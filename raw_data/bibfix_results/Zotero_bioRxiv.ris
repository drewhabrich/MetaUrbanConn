AB  - The complex landscape history of the Neotropics has generated opportunities for population isolation and diversification that place this region among the most species-rich in the world. Detailed phylogeographic studies are required to uncover the biogeographic histories of Neotropical taxa, to identify evolutionary correlates of diversity, and to reveal patterns of genetic connectivity, disjunction, and potential differentiation among lineages from different areas of endemism. The White-crowned Manakin (Pseudopipra pipra) is a small suboscine passerine bird that is broadly distributed through the subtropical rainforests of Central America, the lower montane cloud forests of the Andes from Colombia to central Peru, the lowlands of Amazonia and the Guianas, and the Atlantic forest of southeast Brazil. Pseudopipra is currently recognized as a single, polytypic biological species. We studied the effect of the Neotropical landscape on genetic and phenotypic differentiation within this species using genomic data derived from double digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD), and mitochondrial DNA. Most of the genetic breakpoints we identify among populations coincide with physical barriers to gene flow previously associated with avian areas of endemism. The phylogenetic relationships among these populations imply a novel pattern of Andean origination for this group, with subsequent diversification into the Amazonian lowlands. Our analysis of genomic admixture and gene flow reveals a complex history of introgression between some western Amazonian populations. These reticulate processes confound our application of standard concatenated and coalescent phylogenetic methods and raise the question of whether a lineage in the western Napo area of endemism should be considered a hybrid species. Lastly, analysis of variation in vocal and plumage phenotypes in the context of our phylogeny supports the hypothesis that Pseudopipra is a species-complex composed of at least 8, and perhaps up to 17 distinct species which have arisen in the last ∼2.5 Ma.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Global biodiversity is projected to further decline under a wide range of future socio-economic development pathways, even in sustainability oriented scenarios. This raises the question how biodiversity can be put on a path to recovery, the core challenge for the CBD post-2020 global biodiversity framework. We designed two contrasting, ambitious global conservation strategies, ‘Half Earth’ (HE) and ‘Sharing the Planet’ (SP), and evaluated their ability to restore terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity and to provide ecosystem services while also mitigating climate change and ensuring food security. We applied the integrated assessment framework IMAGE with the GLOBIO biodiversity model, using the ‘Middle of the Road’ Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP2) with its projected human population growth as baseline.We found that both conservation strategies result in a reduction in the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services globally, but without additional measures to achieve effective climate mitigation they will be insufficient to restore biodiversity. The HE strategy performs better for terrestrial biodiversity protection (biodiversity intactness (MSA), Red List Index, geometric mean abundance) in currently still natural regions, reflecting global conservation priorities. The SP strategy yields more improvements for biodiversity in human-used areas, aquatic biodiversity and for regulating ecosystem services (pest control, pollination, erosion control), reflecting regional priorities. However, ‘conservation only’ scenarios show a considerable increase in food security risks (especially in Sub-Saharan Africa) compared to the baseline and limited reduction of global temperature increase. Only when conservation strategies are combined with climate change mitigation efforts and additional actions especially in the agricultural and energy system into a portfolio of ‘integrated sustainability measures’, both conservation strategies result in restoring biodiversity to current values or even some improvement, while keeping global warming below two degrees and keeping food security risks below baseline. Minimizing food wastes and reducing consumption of animal products will be crucial.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AU  - Joshi, Jahnavi

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - A long-standing problem in evolutionary biology and systematics is defining patterns of diversification and speciation, which is compounded by allopatric distributions of polytypic taxa in biogeographically fragmented landscapes. In this paper we revisit this enduring systematic challenge using Mormon swallowtail butterflies (Papilio subgenus Menelaides)—an evolutionary and genetic model system. Menelaides is speciose and intensively sampled, with nearly 260 years of systematic study complicated by polytypy resulting from discontinuous morphological variation. This variation is structured by the mainland-island matrix of the geologically complex Indo-Australian Region, where drawing species boundaries has been difficult. We sampled variation across the biogeographic range of Menelaides, covering 97% of currently recognized species and nearly half of all subspecies. We generated a well-supported mito-nuclear phylogeny, on which we delineated species based on two species delimitation methods (GMYC and mPTP) and strongly supported reciprocal monophyly. These analyses showed that the true species diversity in this group may be up to 25% greater than traditional taxonomy suggests, and prompts extensive taxonomic restructuring. Biogeographic analyses showed that Menelaides have diversified largely in allopatry in Indo-Australian subregions by repeated dispersals across key biogeographic barriers. These results provide critical insights into the diversification process in this morphologically diverse and taxonomically complicated model group. These results will also be informative in future studies on systematics, biogeography, speciation and morphological diversification in the Indo-Australian Region—arguably the most complex geological land/seascape in the world.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Remote sensing is an invaluable tool to objectively illustrate the rapid decline in habitat extents worldwide. The many operational Earth Observation platforms provide options for the generation of land cover maps, each with unique characteristics, as well as considerable semantic differences in the definition of classes. As a result, differences in baseline estimates are inevitable. Here we compare forest cover and surface water estimates over four time periods spanning three decades (1989–2018) for ∼1.3 million km2 encompassing the Xingu river basin, Brazil, from published, freely accessible remotely sensed classifications. While all datasets showed a decrease in forest extent over time, we found a large range in the total area reported by each product for all time periods. The greatest differences ranged from 9% (year 2000) to 17% of the total area (2014-2018 period). We also show the high sensitivity of forest fragmentation metrics (entropy and foreground area density) to data quality and spatial resolution, with cloud cover and sensor artefacts resulting in errors. We further show the importance of choosing surface water datasets carefully because they differ greatly in location and amount of surface water mapped between sources. In several of the datasets illustrating the land cover following operationalization of the Belo Monte dam, the large reservoirs are notably absent. Freshwater ecosystem health is influenced by the land cover surrounding water bodies (e.g. Riparian zones). Understanding differences between the many remotely sensed baselines is fundamentally important to avoid information misuse, and to objectively choose the most appropriate dataset for conservation, taxonomy or policy-making. The differences in forest cover between the datasets examined here are not a failure of the technology, but due to different interpretations of ‘forest’ and characteristics of the input data (e.g. spatial resolution). Our findings demonstrate the importance of transparency in the generation of remotely sensed datasets and the need for users to familiarize themselves with the characteristics and limitations of each chosen data set.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - One of the most famous examples of adaptive radiation is that of the Galápagos finches, where skull morphology, particularly the beak, varies with feeding ecology. Yet increasingly studies are questioning the strength of this correlation between feeding ecology and morphology in relation to the entire neornithine radiation, suggesting that other factors also significantly affect skull evolution. Here, we broaden this debate to assess the influence of a range of ecological and life history factors, specifically habitat density, migration, and developmental mode, in shaping avian skull evolution. Using 3D geometric morphometric data to robustly quantify skull shape for 354 extant species spanning avian diversity, we fitted flexible phylogenetic regressions and estimated evolutionary rates for each of these factors across the full dataset. The results support a highly significant relationship between skull shape and both habitat density and migration, but not developmental mode. We further found heterogenous rates of evolution between different character states within habitat density, migration, and developmental mode, with rapid skull evolution in species which occupy dense habitats, are migratory, or are precocial. These patterns demonstrate that diverse factors impact the tempo and mode of avian phenotypic evolution, and that skull evolution in birds is not simply a reflection of feeding ecology.Impact summary Almost 200 years ago, Darwin found that the beaks of Galápagos finches were different shapes in birds with different diets. Nowadays, it is well established that phylogeny, allometry, and ecology can also be key factors in shaping skulls. Yet, the influence of specific aspects of ecology, as well as life history, on morphological evolution remain poorly constrained. Here, we examined whether three novel factors also influence the shape of bird skulls and rates of evolution: habitat density, migration, or developmental mode. To do so, we combine high resolution 3D quantification of skull shape with dense taxonomic sampling across living birds. Our analyses revealed that skull shape varies in birds based on the density of vegetation in their habitats and on the extent to which they migrate. However, how independent birds are when they are born does not appear to influence overall skull shape. Despite these differences in how much they influence the shape of the skull, habitat density, migration and life history all influence the rate at which bird skulls evolve. Birds evolved fastest if they live in densely vegetated habitats, migrate long distances, or are precocial. These results add to the growing body of evidence that skull evolution in birds is impacted by a diverse range of factors, and suggests that habitat density, migration and life history should be considered in future analyses on drivers of phenotypic evolution.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The Johor Strait separates the island of Singapore from Peninsular Malaysia. A 1-kilometer causeway built in the early 1920s in the middle of the Strait effectively blocks water flowing to/from either side, resulting in low water turnover rates and build-up of nutrients in the inner Strait. We have previously shown that short-term rather than seasonal environmental changes influence microbial community composition in the Johor Strait. Here, we present a temporally-intensive study that uncovers the drivers keeping the microbial populations in check. We sampled the surface water at four sites in the inner Eastern Johor Strait every other day for two months, measured various water quality parameters, and analysed 16S amplicon sequences and flow-cytometry counts. We discovered that microbial community succession revolves around a common stable state resulting from frequent pulse disturbances. Among these, sporadic riverine freshwater input and regular tidal currents influence bottom-up controls including the availability of the limiting nutrient nitrogen and its biological release in readily available forms. From the top-down, marine viruses and predator bacteria (e.g. Saprospiraceae family) limit the proliferation of microbes in the water. Harmful algal blooms, which have been observed historically in these waters, may occur when there are gaps in the top-down and bottom-up controls. This study uncovers the complex interaction between these factors contributing to a low-resistance but high-resilience microbial community and speculate about the rare events that could lead to the occurrence of an algal bloom.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Norwegian landscapes are changing at an increasingly rapid rate, and systematically structured information about observable landscape variation is required for knowledge-based management of landscape diversity. Here we present the first version of a complete, area-covering, evidence-based landscape-type map of Norway, simultaneously addressing geo-ecological, bio-ecological and land-use related variation at the landscape level. We do so by applying map algebra operations on publicly available geographical data sets with full areal coverage for Norway. The type system used in the mapping is supported by systematically structured empirical evidence. We present the results of the mapping procedure, including the geographical distribution and descriptive statistics (abundance and areal coverage) for each of the identified landscape types. We identify nine major landscape types based on coarse-scale landform variation and, within the six inland and coastal major types, 284 minor landscape types are defined based on the composition of geo-ecological, bio-ecological, and land use-related landscape properties. The results provide new insights into the geography of Norwegian marine, coastal and inland landscapes. We discuss potential errors, uncertainties and limitations of the landscape-type maps, and address the potential value of this new tool for research, management and planning purposes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Global change creates an urgent need to predict spatial responses of biota to support the conservation of sufficient habitat to maintain biodiversity. We present species distribution model theory and a synthesis of avian literature on approaches to collecting occurrence data, selecting explanatory variables and analytical processes currently in use to predict future distributions. We find that interpreting the validity of current predictive distributions is hindered by variation in spatio-temporal resolution of data sets that force hypothesis testing under the Grinnellian niche concept. Broadly, the capacity of species to shift their geographic ranges under land use and climate change is expected to be limited by both large scale (i.e., the physiological or fundamental niche) and small scale (i.e., the realized or tolerance niche) factors. We highlight the strengths and weaknesses of widely used explanatory variables and analytical approaches tailored to macrohabitat characteristics and the Grinnellian niche concept. This synthesis addresses if and how current approaches align with theory and makes recommendations for future directions to improve the accuracy of predictive distribution modelling.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Roads impact bat populations through habitat loss and collisions. High quality habitats particularly increase bat mortalities on roads, yet many questions remain concerning how local landscape features may influence bat behaviour and lead to high collision risks (e.g. influence of distance to trees, or of vegetation density). When comparing the potential danger of different road sections, the most popular method today is the use of simple bat detectors to assess the local densities of current populations at road sites. Yet, it is not known to which extent bat behaviour influences collisions (i.e. bats flying at vehicle height or on the side or above, co-occurrence of bats and vehicles). Behaviour is very rarely taken into account in practice, and this might lead to hazardous site selections for mitigation. Our goals were thus (i) to estimate how local landscape characteristics affect each of the conditional events leading to collisions (i.e. bat presence, flight in the zone at collision risk and bat-vehicle co-occurrence), and (ii) to determine which of the conditional events most contributed to collisions risks.In this study, we recorded bat activity and characterised flight behaviour with three variables: position at collision risk, bat-vehicle co-occurrence, and flight path orientation, using acoustic flight path tracking at 66 study sites in the Mediterranean region for two to five full nights. We modelled the effect of the local landscape, i.e. in a radius of 30 m around the road (vegetation height, distance, density and orientation), road features (road width, traffic volume) and the time of year on eleven species or species groups. We built models for each conditional probability of the road collision risk (i.e. species density, presence in the zone at risk, bat-vehicle co-occurrence) and multiplied their estimates to calculate the overall collision risk.Our results show that the local landscape had different effects on bat density and presence in the zone at collision risk. Increasing distance to trees and decreasing tree height were associated with a decrease in bat density at roads. Forests were the local landscapes where bats flew more often in the zone at collision risk. The overall collision risk was higher either in forests or at tree rows perpendicular to the road depending on species. Contrary to common preconceptions, mid-range echolocators seemed to be generally more at risk of collision than short-range or long-range echolocators. In addition, collision risk was greatest in summer or autumn for most species. Finally, bats mainly followed the road axis regardless of the type of landscape.Our results contribute to a better understanding of bat movements in different local environments at the scale where they directly sense their surroundings with echolocation calls. Disentangling bat density from flight behaviour allowed us to better understand the temporal and spatial contributors of roadkills, and to provide guidance for road impact assessment studies.Competing Interest StatementBiotope is an environmental consultancy involved in road impact assessment studies.

AB  - We present the first major systematic study of land snail diversity on green roofs. We surveyed 27 green roofs and the adjacent ground habitat in six major cities in the southeastern United States. We found a total of 18 species of land snails, with three considered to be non-native, invasive species. The majority of land snails encountered in surveys are widespread, generalist species, typically adapted to open habitats. Twelve of the land snails encountered are “greenhouse” species that are very commonly transported via the horticultural trade. Therefore, we infer that at least some land snail species are introduced to green roofs via initial green roof installation and associated landscaping. Additionally, some similarity between roof and ground populations indicates dispersal from nearby ground habitats. The major determinants of snail species diversity and community composition are largely derived from local environmental conditions that are significantly correlated to the quality of green roof maintenance regime and plant diversity. Roof area, height, and age are seemingly not significant characteristics that dictate land snail species richness.

AB  - In agricultural landscapes, management practices and other environmental and social factors shape complex agroecological matrices. In turn, the structure of such matrices impacts both agricultural activities and biodiversity conservation, for instance, by mediating wildlife migration between agricultural and habitat patches. One way to characterize a matrix, its potential role in biodiversity conservation, and how its descriptors change across different spatial scales, is characterizing heterogeneity metrics and systematically examining how such metrics change with grain size and landscape extent. However, these methods have rarely been applied to tropical, peasant-managed landscapes, even though this type of landscape occupies most of the agricultural surface in or near biodiversity hotspots. We focus on a peasant-managed agricultural landscape in Oaxaca, Mexico, for which we mapped and quantified the land-use classes and evaluated heterogeneity metrics. We also examined the response of heterogeneity metrics to changes in grain and extent scales. This allowed us to further understand the structure and conservation potential of the agroecological matrix in this type of landscape, to broadly compare this landscape with other agricultural landscapes in North America, and to recommend specific landscape metrics for different types of studies involving agricultural matrices. We conclude that this type of agricultural matrix is ideal to pursue joint agricultural and conservation strategies in an integrated landscape.

AB  - Butterflies are a diverse and charismatic insect group that are thought to have diversified via coevolution with plants and in response to dispersals following key geological events. These hypotheses have been poorly tested at the macroevolutionary scale because a comprehensive phylogenetic framework and datasets on global distributions and larval hosts of butterflies are lacking. We sequenced 391 genes from nearly 2,000 butterfly species to construct a new, phylogenomic tree of butterflies representing 92% of all genera and aggregated global distribution records and larval host datasets. We found that butterflies likely originated in what is now the Americas, ∼100 Ma, shortly before the Cretaceous Thermal Maximum, then crossed Beringia and diversified in the Paleotropics. The ancestor of modern butterflies likely fed on Fabaceae, and most extant families were present before the K/Pg extinction. The majority of butterfly dispersals occurred from the tropics (especially the Neotropics) to temperate zones, largely supporting a “cradle” pattern of diversification. Surprisingly, host breadth changes and shifts to novel host plants had only modest impacts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

As a result, the history of pig dispersal in the Philippines remains controversial and must have some anthropogenic origin associated with some human migration events. In this study, the context of origin, dispersal, and the level of genetic introgression in Philippine native pigs were deduced using mitochondrial DNA D-loop analysis altogether with domestic pigs and wild boars corresponding to their geographic origin. Results revealed a considerable genetic diversity (0.900±0.016), and a widespread Asian pig-ancestry (94.60%) were revealed in the phylogenetic analysis with admixed European pig-origin (5.10%) harboring various fractions of ancestry from Berkshire and Landrace. The close genetic connection between the continental wild boars and domestic pigs present in the Philippine pigs corroborates our hypothesis of a genetic signal that could potentially be associated with the recently reported multiple waves of human migrations to the Philippines during the last 50,000 years. The high frequency of haplotypes (54.08%) that collapsed in the D7 haplogroup represent an interesting challenge as its distribution does not coincide with the hypothesized migratory route of the Neolithic Austronesian-speaking populations. We detected the first Pacific Clade signature and ubiquitously distributed D2 haplotypes which postulate the legitimate dispersal of pigs associated with the multiple waves of human migrations involving the Philippines. The multimodal mismatch and neutrality test statistics both Fu’s Fs and Tajima’s D correlates the long stationary period of effective population size revealed in the Bayesian skyline plot. While the sudden decrease in population was consistent with the pronounced population bottleneck of Asian and European pigs during the interglacial periods of the Pleistocene.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Ongoing climate change has caused rapidly increasing temperatures, and an unprecedented decline in seawater pH, known as ocean acidification. Increasing temperatures are redistributing species towards higher and cooler latitudes which are most affected by ocean acidification. Whilst the persistence of intertidal species in cold environments is related to their capacity to resist sub-zero air temperatures, studies have never considered the interacting impacts of ocean acidification and freeze stress on species survival and distribution. A full-factorial experiment was used to study whether ocean acidification increases mortality in Mytilus spp. following sub-zero air temperature exposure. We examined physiological processes behind variation in freeze tolerance using 1H NMR metabolomics, analyses of fatty acids, and amino acid composition. We show that low pH conditions (pH = 7.5) significantly decrease freeze tolerance in both intertidal and subtidal populations of Mytilus spp. Under current day pH conditions (pH = 7.9), intertidal M. trossulus were more freeze tolerant than subtidal M. trossulus and M. galloprovincialis. Opposite, under low pH conditions, subtidal M. trossulus was more freeze tolerant than the other groups. We observed a marked shift from negative to positive metabolite-metabolite correlations across species under low pH conditions, but there was no evidence that the concentration of individual metabolites or amino acids affected freeze tolerance. Finally, pH-induced changes in the composition of cell membrane phospholipid fatty acids had no effect on survival. These results suggest that ocean acidification can offset the poleward expanding facilitated by warming, and that reduced freeze tolerance could result in a niche squeeze if temperatures become lethal at the equatorward edge.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Patterns of land-use can affect the transmission of many infectious diseases with human health implications; yet, applied ecosystem service models have rarely accounted for disease transmission risk. A mechanistic understanding of how land-use changes alter infectious disease transmission would help to target public health interventions and to minimize human risk of disease with either ecosystem degradation or restoration. Here, we present a spatially explicit model of disease transmission on heterogeneous landscapes that is designed to serve as a road map for modeling the multifaceted impacts of land-use on disease transmission. We model the transmission of three vector-borne diseases with distinct transmission dynamics (parameterized using published literature to represent dengue, yellow fever, and malaria) on simulated landscapes of varying spatial heterogeneity in tree cover and urban area. Overall, we find that these three diseases depend on the biophysical landscape in different nonlinear ways, leading to tradeoffs in disease risk across the landscape; rarely do we predict disease risk to be high for all three diseases in a local setting. We predict that dengue risk peaks in areas of high urban intensity and human population density, yellow fever risk peaks in areas with low to moderate human population density and high tree cover, and malaria risk peaks where patchy tree cover abuts urban area. To examine how this approach can inform land use planning, we applied the model to a small landscape to the northwest of Bogotá, Colombia under multiple restoration scenarios. We predict that in an area inhabited by both Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus, any increase in overall tree cover would increase dengue and yellow fever risk, but that risk can be minimized by pursuing a large contiguous reforestation project as opposed to many small, patchy projects. A large contiguous reforestation project is also able to both reduce overall malaria risk and the number of malaria hotspots. As sustainable development goals make ecosystem restoration and biodiversity conservation top priorities, it is imperative that land use planning account for potential impacts on both disease transmission and other ecosystem services.Open Research statement All data and code used in this study are available in the online supplemental material.

AB  - The divergence of sister orders, Trichoptera (caddisflies) and Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies), from a silk-spinning ancestor occurred around 290 million years ago. Trichoptera larvae are mainly aquatic and Lepidoptera larvae are almost entirely terrestrial, distinct habitats that required molecular adaptation of their silk for deployment in water versus air. The major protein components of their silks are Heavy chain and Light chain fibroins. In an effort to identify molecular changes in L-fibroins that may have contributed to the divergent use of silk in water versus air, we used the ColabFold implementation of AlphaFold2 to predict three-dimensional structures of L-fibroins from both orders. Comparison of the structures revealed that despite the ancient divergence, profoundly different habitats, and low sequence conservation, a 10-helix core structure was strongly conserved in L-fibroins from both orders. Previously known intra- and intermolecular disulfide linkages were accurately predicted. Structure variations observed outside of the core may represent molecular changes that contributed to the evolution of silks adapted to water or air. The distributions of electrostatic potential, for example, are not conserved and present distinct order-specific surfaces for potential interactions with or modulation by external factors. Also, the interactions of L-fibroins with the H-fibroin C-termini are different between the orders; lepidopteran L-fibroins have N-terminal insertions, not present in trichopteran L-fibroins, which form an unstructured ribbon in isolation but become part of an intermolecular β-sheet when folded with their corresponding H-fibroin C-termini. The results may serve as another example of protein structure prediction from deep sequence data of understudied proteins made possible by AlphaFold2.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The skills and knowledge needed to recognize and classify taxa are becoming increasingly scarce in the scientific community. At the same time, it is clear that these skills are strongly needed in biodiversity monitoring for management and conservation, especially when carried out by citizen scientists. Formalizing the required knowledge in the form of digital identification keys is one way of making such knowledge more available for professional and amateur observers of biodiversity. In this paper we describe Clavis, an open and versatile data format for capturing the knowledge required for taxon identification through digital keys, allowing for a level of detail beyond that of any current key format. We present the format independently from any particular implementation, as our aim is for Clavis to serve as a basis for interoperable tools and interfaces serving different needs and actors.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Many human emergent and re-emergent diseases have a sylvatic cycle. Yet, little effort has been put into discovering and modeling the wild mammal reservoirs of dengue (DENV), particularly in the Americas. Here, we show a species-level susceptibility prediction to dengue of wild mammals in the Americas as a function of the three most important biodiversity dimensions (ecological, geographical, and phylogenetic spaces), using machine learning protocols. Model predictions showed that different species of bats would be highly susceptible to DENV infections, where susceptibility mostly depended on phylogenetic relationships among hosts and their environmental requirement. Mammal species predicted as highly susceptible coincide with sets of species that have been reported infected in field studies, but it also suggests other species that have not been previously considered or that have been captured in low numbers. Also, the environment (i.e., the distance between the species’ optima in bioclimatic dimensions) in combination with geographic and phylogenetic distance is highly relevant in predicting susceptibility to DENV in wild mammals. Our results agree with previous modeling efforts indicating that temperature is an important factor determining DENV transmission, and provide novel insights regarding other relevant factors and the importance of considering wild reservoirs. This modeling framework will aid in the identification of potential DENV reservoirs for future surveillance efforts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Many marine species have a pelagic larval phase that undergo dispersal among habitats. Studies on marine larval dispersal have revealed a large variation in the spatial scale of dispersal, and accumulated evidence has shown that seascape patchiness is the major determinant for variation in self-recruitment. However, few studies have investigated the influence of geographic settings on marine larval dispersal. Bays or lagoons generally enhance the retention of larvae, while larvae are more likely to be flushed by strong currents in open coasts. To examine associations between larval dispersal, geographic setting, and hydrodynamics, we compared fin-scale dispersal patterns, self-recruitment, and local retention of two anemonefishes (Amphiprion frenatus and A. perideraion) between a semi-enclosed bay and an open coast in the Philippines combining genetic parentage analysis and biophysical dispersal modelling. Contrary to our expectations, parentage analysis revealed lower estimates of self-recruitment in the semi-closed bay (0–2%) than in the open coast (14–15%). The result was consistent with dispersal simulations predicting lower local retention and self-recruitment in the former (0.4% and 19%) than in the latter (2.9% and 38%). Dispersal modelling also showed that cross-shore currents toward offshore were much stronger around the semi-closed bay and were negatively correlated with local retention and self-recruitment. These results suggest that stronger cross-shore currents around the semi-closed bay transport anemonefish larvae to the offshore and mainly contributed to the lower self-recruitment. Our results highlight difficulty in predicting self-recruitment from geographic setting alone and importance of hydrodynamics on it.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Ecological communities are jointly structured by dispersal, density-independent responses to environmental conditions and density-dependent biotic interactions. Metacommunity ecology provides a framework for understanding how these processes combine to determine community composition among local sites that are regionally connected through dispersal. In 17 temperate seagrass meadows along the British Columbia coast, we tested the hypothesis that eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) epifaunal invertebrate assemblages are influenced by local environmental conditions, but that high dispersal rates at larger spatial scales dampen effects of environmental differences. We used hierarchical joint species distribution modelling to understand the contribution of environmental conditions, spatial distance between meadows, and species co-occurrences to epifaunal invertebrate abundance and distribution across the region. We found that patterns of taxonomic compositional similarity among meadows were inconsistent with dispersal limitation and meadows in the same region were often no more similar to each other than meadows over 1000 km away. Abiotic environmental conditions (temperature, dissolved oxygen) explained a small fraction of variation in taxonomic abundances patterns across the region. We found novel co-occurrence patterns among taxa that could not be explained by shared responses to environmental gradients, suggesting the possibility that interspecific interactions influence seagrass invertebrate abundance and distribution. Our results add to mounting evidence that suggests that the biodiversity and ecosystem functions provided by seagrass meadows reflect ecological processes occurring both within meadows and across seascapes, and suggest that management of eelgrass habitat for biodiversity may be most effective when both local and regional processes are considered.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Recent centuries have experienced drastic changes in land cover around the world where Himalayan countries like Nepal have undergone changes in the past several decades because of increasing anthropogenic pressure, natural risks and climatic factors. Accordingly, forest fragmentation has also been increasing alarmingly, which is a matter of concern for natural resource management agencies and biodiversity conservation communities. In this study, we assessed land cover change and forest fragmentation trends in Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve of Nepal by implementing landscape fragmentation and recovery process models, and calculating landscape indices based on five-date land cover maps derived from Landsat satellite images from 1993 to 2018. Six land cover types including forest, grass land, barren land, agriculture &amp; built-up, water bodies and snow &amp; glaciers were determined after an intensive field survey. Diverse derived image features were fed to the Support Vector Machines classifier to create land cover maps, followed by a validation procedure using field samples and reference data. Land cover maps showed an increase in forest area from 37.32% (1993) to 39.26% (2018) and snow &amp; glaciers from 1.72% (1993) to 2.15% (2018) while a decrease in grassland area from 38.78% (1993) to 36.41% (2018) and agriculture &amp; built-up area from 2.39% (1993) to 1.80% (2018). Barren land and water body showed negligible changes. The spatial explicit process of forest fragmentation indicated that shrinkage was the most responsible factor of forest loss while expansion was dominant to increment for forest restoration. High dependency of people persists on the reserve for subsistence resources being a cause of forest fragmentation and posing threats to biodiversity. Focus should be made on strategies to decrease the anthropogenic pressure on the reserve. This requires approaches that provide sustainable alternative resources to the local people and innovations that will help them become less reliant on natural resources.

AB  - The global aquarium trade can introduce alien freshwater invaders, potentially impacting local aquatic ecosystems and their biodiversity. The role of the aquarium trade in spreading freshwater red macroalgae that hitchhike on ornamental aquatic plants and animals is unassessed. We investigated this human-mediated phenomenon via a broad biodiversity survey and genetic analysis of freshwater red algae in the field and aquarium shops in East Asia. Using rbcL-based DNA barcoding, we surveyed 125 samples from 46 field sites and 88 samples from 53 aquarium shops (213 samples in total) mostly across Taiwan – a key hub in the global aquarium trade – as well as in Hong Kong, Okinawa (Japan), the Philippines, and Thailand. We augmented our rbcL sequences with GenBank rbcL sequences that represent 40 additional countries globally. We found 26 molecular operational taxonomic units (mOTUs) in Taiwan, some of which are cryptic. Phylogeographical analysis revealed three potential introduced mOTUs in Taiwan, which exhibit no local genetic variation in Taiwan and are distributed across continents. Also, we posit that some presumably endangered freshwater red algae may be preserved in aquaria, an unintentional ex situ conservation site for these organisms that are vulnerable to water pollution from anthropogenic disturbances. Collectively, these data suggest that freshwater red algae have been hitchhiking and dispersed via the aquarium trade, an important and overlooked mechanism of introduction of these organisms across the globe.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The gut microbiota of social bees is relatively simple and dominated by a core set of taxa that have been reported consistently in individual workers from around the world. Yet, variation remains, and this has been shown to affect host health.We characterised the individual- and regional-scale variation in the honeybee (Apis mellifera) gut microbiota in the North West of England, and asked whether the microbiota was influenced by host genotype or landscape composition.We collected multiple honeybees from 64 colonies, and sequenced the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene to characterise the mid- and hindgut bacterial communities. We characterised the genotype of each individual honeybee, and also the land cover surrounding each colony.The literature-defined core taxa consistently dominated across the region, despite the varied environments. However, there was variation in the relative abundance of core taxa, and colony membership explained a large proportion of this variation. Individuals from more genetically diverse colonies had more diverse microbiotas, but individual genetic diversity did not influence gut microbial diversity. There was a trend for colonies in more similar landscapes to have more similar microbiota, whilst bees from more urban landscapes had a slightly less diverse microbiota than those from less urban landscapes.Our study provides, to our knowledge, the first demonstration for any species that the gut bacterial communities of individuals can be influenced by the genotypes of other conspecifics in the population. This is particularly important for social organisms, such as honeybees, as colony rather than individual genetic diversity appears to drive gut microbial diversity, a factor related to colony health.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Anthropogenic environmental alterations such as urbanization can threaten native populations as well as create novel environments that allow human pests and pathogens to thrive. As the number and size of urban environments increase globally, it is more important than ever to understand the dispersal dynamics of hosts, vectors and pathogens of zoonotic disease systems. For example, a protozoan parasite and the causative agent of Chagas disease in humans, Trypanosoma cruzi, recently colonized and spread through the city of Arequipa, Peru. We used population genomic and phylogenomic tools to analyze whole genomes of 123 T. cruzi isolates collected throughout Arequipa to determine patterns of T. cruzi dispersal. The data show significant population genetic structure within city blocks-parasites in the same block tend to be very closely related - but no population structure among blocks within districts - parasites in neighboring blocks are no more closely related to one another than to parasites in distant districts. These data suggest that T. cruzi dispersal within a block occurs regularly and that occasional long-range dispersal events allow the establishment of new T. cruzi populations in distant blocks. Movement of domestic animals may be the primary mechanism of inter-block and inter-district T. cruzi dispersal.Author Summary Urbanization creates environments that are ideal for some human pests and pathogens. As the number and size of urban environments increases globally, it is becoming vital to understand how human disease-causing pathogens, their vectors, and their non-human hosts disperse through urban landscapes. Here we study a population of Trypanosoma cruzi – the protozoan parasite and causative agent of Chagas disease in humans – that recently colonized the city of Arequipa, Peru. We use population genomic and phylogenomic tools to understand how this parasite population dispersed through the city to achieve its current distribution and abundance. We show that T. cruzi collected from the same city block tend to be very closely related, while those from neighboring blocks are often as distantly related as those from blocks in distant districts. The data suggest that vectors facilitate frequent within-block dispersal of the parasite, while domestic animal movement may facilitate the relatively infrequent inter-block and interdistrict dispersal.

AB  - Establishment of new populations is contingent on overcoming abiotic and biotic barriers. While this applies to all species, these hurdles are at the forefront of invasion biology where prediction, prevention, eradication, and control strategies depend on an understanding and exploitation of barriers to establishment and spread. Arundina graminifolia and Dendrobium crumenatum are two invasive orchids spreading throughout Puerto Rico. Current records on their distributions across the island are sparse, and their interactions with the surrounding ecosystem are unknown. Through a direct population survey of all known localities, we identified a new, acquired enemy of both orchids: the orchid-specialist weevil, Stethobaris polita. In this study, we used niche modelling to identify suitable habitats for each orchid on the island and map their current distributions and interactions with S. polita, along with their distributions in the most extreme climate scenario in 2050, in order to contextualize projected patterns of establishment on the island. Our findings show that D. crumenatum flourishes in urban environments which also provide refugia from S. polita. In contrast, there is currently no refugia for A. graminifolia from S. polita attack, as it is more sensitive to the same climatic variables as S. polita. Furthermore, projections into the most extreme climate scenario suggests Puerto Rico will be unsuitable for A. graminifolia and S. polita’s survival, and become less suitable for D. crumenatum, by 2050.

AB  - Global changes in response to human encroachment into natural habitats and carbon emissions are driving the biodiversity extinction crisis and increasing disease emergence risk. Host distributions are one critical component to identify areas at risk of spillover, and bats act as reservoirs of diverse viruses. We developed a reproducible ecological niche modelling pipeline for bat hosts of SARS-like viruses (subgenus Sarbecovirus), given that since SARS-CoV-2 emergence several closely-related viruses have been discovered and sarbecovirus-host interactions have gained attention. We assess sampling biases and model bats’ current distributions based on climate and landscape relationships and project future scenarios. The most important predictors of species distribution were temperature seasonality and cave availability. We identified concentrated host hotspots in Myanmar and projected range contractions for most species by 2100. Our projections indicate hotspots will shift east in Southeast Asia in &gt;2 °C hotter locations in a fossil-fueled development future. Hotspot shifts have implications for conservation and public health, as loss of population connectivity can lead to local extinctions, and remaining hotspots may concentrate near human populations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Historical herbaria are valuable sources of data in invasion biology. Here we study the invasion history of the lime leaf-miner, Phyllonorycter issikii, by surveying over 15 thousand herbarium specimens of limes (Tilia spp.) collected in the Palearctic during last 253 years (1764–2016). The majority of herbarium specimens with the pest’s mines (89%) originated from East Asia (1859–2015), whereas remaining 11% of specimens with the mines came from Europe, European Russia and Western Siberia (1987–2015). These results support the hypothesis of a recent Ph. issikii invasion from Eastern to Western Palearctic.Single molecule real-time sequencing of the COI barcode region of 93 archival larvae and pupae (7–162 years old) dissected from the mines on historical herbaria allowed to distinguish between Ph. issikii and Ph. messaniella, a polyphagous species rarely feeding on Tilia, which mines were found in herbarium from Europe dated by 1915–1942. We discovered 25 haplotypes of Ph. issikii, of which 16 haplotypes were present solely in East Asia, and revealed wide distribution of the species in China. Six haplotypes shared between Eastern and Western Palearctic suggest the contribution of Ph. issikii populations from the Russian Far East, China and Japan to the westward invasion.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Stage-based demographic methods, such as matrix population models (MPMs), are powerful tools used to address a broad range of fundamental questions in ecology, evolutionary biology, and conservation science. Accordingly, MPMs now exist for over 3,000 species worldwide. These data are being digitised as an ongoing process and periodically released into two large open-access online repositories: the COMPADRE Plant Matrix Database and the COMADRE Animal Matrix Database. During the last decade, data archiving and curation of COMPADRE and COMADRE, and subsequent comparative research, have revealed pronounced variation in how MPMs are parameterized and reported.Here, we summarise current issues related to the parameterisation and reporting of MPMs that arise most frequently and outline how they affect MPM construction, analysis, and interpretation. To quantify variation in how MPMs are reported, we present results from a survey identifying key aspects of MPMs that are frequently unreported in manuscripts. We then screen COMPADRE and COMADRE to quantify how often key pieces of information are omitted from manuscripts using MPMs.Over 80% of surveyed researchers (n=60) state a clear benefit to adopting more standardised methodologies for reporting MPMs. Furthermore, over 85% of the 300 MPMs assessed from COMPADRE and COMADRE omitted one or more elements that are key to their accurate interpretation. Based on these insights, we identify fundamental issues that can arise from MPM construction and communication and provide suggestions to improve clarity, reproducibility, and future research utilising MPMs and their required metadata. To fortify reproducibility and empower researchers to take full advantage of their demographic data, we introduce a standardized protocol to present MPMs in publications. This standard is linked to www.compadre-db.org, so that authors wishing to archive their MPMs can do so prior to submission of publications, following examples from other open-access repositories such as DRYAD, Figshare, and Zenodo.Combining and standardising MPMs parameterized from populations around the globe and across the tree of life opens up powerful research opportunities in evolutionary biology, ecology, and conservation research. However, this potential can only be fully realised by adopting standardised methods to ensure reproducibility.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) comprising the coasts of Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and Ecuador, represents an area of high marine biodiversity that supports productive fisheries and acts as an important migratory corridor for many marine species. Despite its biological importance, the ETP is understudied and lacks sufficient data for science-based fisheries management and conservation decision-making. This study aims to consolidate understanding of the current and historical distribution of sharks and mobulid rays in the ETP. We used interviews of coastal community stakeholders to document traditional knowledge of shark and mobulid ray species and distributions. We also analysed small-scale fisheries landings data, where available, to quantify local exploitation patterns and the importance of sharks and rays in small-scale fisheries catches. All shark species landed in the dominant nearshore gillnet fishery show very low mean individuals weights (&lt;5 kg), indicating that the fisheries are dominated by juveniles, captured. Aside from smooth-hounds (Mustelus spp.), the scalloped hammerhead shark, Sphyrna lewini, is the most frequently landed shark species in the region by weight and number, with peaks in abundance between April - July. From 132 interviews in 51 communities across the three countries, and landings data from two small-scale fisheries sites, we identified 41 sites in 12 broad geographical zones as important shark nursery habitats. Of these sites, 68% were associated closely with large mangrove systems of the ETP, highlighting the importance of this habitat for shark life history. No patterns were seen in the occurrence or distribution of mobulid rays in coastal areas. Marine protected areas and responsible fishing zones cover 37% of identified nursery habitats in the ETP, 30% in Costa Rica, 48% in Panama and 30% in Colombia. These findings provide an important benchmark of the conservation status of sharks in the ETP and allow for the prioritisation of research and policy-making.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Underwater sediments are a natural archive of biological information. Reconstruction of past fauna has been conducted for various taxonomic groups using morphological remains and DNA derived from these remains. However, information on past occurrences of fish species, the top predator of lake ecosystems, could have been reproduced only in exceptional environments, and past quantitative information on fish, particularly in lake ecosystems, has been a knowledge gap in reconstructing past fauna. Tracking the quantitative fluctuations of fish is essential for reconstructing multiple trophic levels of organisms in lake ecosystems.To acquire past quantitative fish information from lake sediments, we collected approximately 30 cm-length of underwater sediments in Lake Biwa. We extracted sedimentary environmental DNA (eDNA) and measured temporal fluctuations in the eDNA concentration of the native and fishery target species Plecoglossus altivelis and Gymnogobius isaza. For P. altivelis, we examined the possibility of tracking quantitative fluctuations by comparing sedimentary eDNA with recorded catch per unit effort (CPUE).The chronology of the sediments allowed us to obtain information on sediments collected in Lake Biwa over the past 100 years. The deepest depths at which sedimentary eDNA was detected were 30 and 13 cm for P. altivelis and G. isaza from the surface, corresponding to approximately 100 and 30 years ago, respectively. In the comparison of sedimentary eDNA concentrations and biomass, we found a significant correlation between the CPUE of P. altivelis and its sedimentary eDNA concentration adjusted to compensate for DNA degradation. Sedimentary eDNA fluctuations were observed in P. altivelis, possibly reflecting the abundance fluctuation due to variations in the main food resources of zooplankton.Our findings provide essential pieces for the reconstruction of past fauna of lake ecosystems. The addition of quantitative information on fish species will reach a new phase, for instance, by investigating population shifts or biological interactions in the reconstruction of past fauna in lake ecosystems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Urban expansion is correlated to negative biodiversity trends. The amount of impervious surfaces in urban areas is a determinant of pollinator species assemblages. While the increase in urbanization and impervious surfaces negatively impacts pollinators, cities also encompass urban green spaces, which have a significant capacity to support biodiversity. Among them, domestic gardens that represent a non-negligible fraction of green spaces have been shown to benefit pollinators. Domestic gardens may form habitat clusters in residential areas, although their value at a landscape scale is still unknown. Here, we investigate the combined effects of impervious surfaces and domestic garden areas on pollinator richness. Due to the difficulty of accessing privately owned domestic gardens, we chose to use citizen science data from a well-established French citizen science program known as SPIPOLL. Using regression tree analysis on buffers located from 50m to 1000m around the data points, we show the importance of pollinators being in close proximity to domestic gardens as locally favorable habitats that are embedded within a landscape, in which impervious surfaces represent unfavorable areas. We highlight the inter-connection between local and landscape scales, the potential for patches of domestic gardens in residential areas, and the need to consider the potential of gardeners’ coordinated management decisions within a landscape context.HighlightsCitizen science provided access to domestic gardens, understudied urban green spacesImpervious surfaces limit pollinators presence at landscape levelSufficient critical amount of gardens increased pollinator diversity at local scaleCritical amount of gardens’ knowledge may favor coordinated decisions by gardenersPollinators may benefit from patches of domestic gardens in an urban matrix

AB  - Aim The exceptional species-richness associated with mountains worldwide is linked to the fragmented topography of these areas, responsible for constantly isolating populations during periods of climatic fluctuations. Consequently, endemism and spatial turnover in mountains are very high and few species are widespread among entire mountain ranges, precluding population-level studies that help understanding how macroevolutionary patterns were shaped. Here, we used the bromeliad Vriesea oligantha, a species endemic to, but widespread in, one of the most species-rich ancient montane areas in the globe, the Espinhaco Range, to test how environmental changes over time may have acted on the evolutionary history of this taxon, contributing to understanding how montane macroevolutionary patterns were shaped. Through analyses of plastidial and nuclear DNA of V. oligantha, we dated its origin and intraspecific diversification, and estimated the genetic diversity, structure and migration rates among populations. Using climatic and geographic variables, we modeled suitable areas for the present and the past, estimating corridors between isolated populations. We also used demographic analyses to estimate ancient population dynamics of V. oligantha. Finally, we tested whether climatic variables or geographical distance explain the observed population structure. The origin and intraspecific diversification of V. oligantha are related to early climatic oscillations during the Plio-Pleistocene. This species has a high population structure due to its low pollen and seed dispersibility. The analysis of species distribution modeling estimated corridors between populations in the past, whereas the structure of V. oligantha results from both models of isolation by distance and isolation by environment. The phylogeographic patterns of Vriesea oligantha reflect previously recognized spatial and temporal macroevolutionary patterns in the Espinhaco Range, providing insights into how microevolutionary processes may have given rise to this astonishing mountain biodiversity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Supplementary feeding of wildlife is widespread, being undertaken by more than half of households in many countries. However, the impact that these supplemental resources have is unclear, with impacts assumed to be restricted to urban ecosystems. We reveal the pervasiveness of supplementary foodstuffs in the diet of a wild bird using metabarcoding of blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) faeces collected in early spring from a 220km transect in Scotland with a large urbanisation gradient. Supplementary foodstuffs were present in the majority of samples, with peanut (Arachis hypogaea) the single commonest (either natural or supplementary) dietary item. Consumption rates exhibited a distance decay from human habitation but remained high at several hundred metres from the nearest household and continued to our study limit of 1.4km distant. Supplementary food consumption was associated with a near quadrupling of blue tit breeding density and a five-day advancement of breeding phenology. We show that woodland bird species using supplementary food have increasing UK population trends, while species that don’t, and/or are outcompeted by blue tits, are likely to be declining. We suggest that the impacts of supplementary feeding are larger and more spatially extensive than currently appreciated and could be disrupting population and ecosystem dynamics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AU  - Grobler, B. Adriaan

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Road verges can provide important habitats for plants, especially in transformed landscapes. However, roads and their associated traffic have several adverse impacts on ecosystems that can disrupt vital ecological processes, including pollination. In transformed landscapes, road effects on pollination might be complemented by impacts of large-scale habitat modification. In these landscapes, road verge populations of plants that rely on pollinators for pollen transfer could thus be at risk of pollination failure. This study investigates the pollination of a reseeding, bird-pollinated shrub, Erica glandulosa, in road verges of a fragmented and transformed rural landscape in the southeastern Cape Floristic Region. We test for road impacts on pollination by comparing number of ruptured anther rings—a proxy for pollination—in fynbos vegetation fragments at different distances from the road (0–10, 20–30 and 40–50 m). We also test whether different land-cover types (intact fynbos, alien thickets and rangelands/pastures) next to road verges influence the number of ruptured anther rings. After controlling for robbing rate and plant density, fewer flowers were pollinated near the road than farther away, and fewer flowers were pollinated where road verges occurred next to alien thickets or pastures/rangelands compared to intact fynbos. However, bird pollination was not excluded in road verges: on average, ca. 20–30% of flowers were still visited by birds near the road. These findings potentially call into question the suitability of road verges as refugia for seed-dependent, bird-pollinated plant species in transformed landscapes.

AB  - The rich forests of Indonesian New Guinea are threatened. We used satellite data to examine annual forest loss, road development and plantation expansion from 2001 to 2019, then developed a model to predict future deforestation in this understudied region. In 2019, 34.29 million hectares (Mha), or 83% of Indonesian New Guinea, supported old-growth forest. Over nineteen years, two percent (0.75 Mha) were cleared: 45% (0.34 Mha) converted to industrial plantations, roads, mine tailings, or other uses near cities; 55% (0.41 Mha) cleared by transient processes including selective natural timber extraction, inland water bodies-related processes, fires, and shifting agriculture. Industrial plantations expanded by 0.23 Mha, with the majority (0.21 Mha; 28% of forest loss) replacing forests and reaching 0.28 Mha in 2019 (97% oil palm; 3% pulpwood). The Trans-Papua Highway, a ~4,000 km national investment project, increased by 1,554 km. Positive correlations between highway and plantations expansion indicate these are linked processes. Plantations and roads grew rapidly after 2011, peaked in 2015/16, and declined thereafter. Indonesian government allocated 2.62 Mha of land for the development of industrial plantations (90% oil palm 10% pulpwood) of which 74% (1.95 Mha) remained forest in 2019. A spatial model predicts that an additional 4.5 Mha of forest could be cleared by 2036 if Indonesian New Guinea follows similar relationships to Indonesian Borneo. We highlight the opportunities for policy reform and the importance of working with indigenous communities, local leaders, and provincial government to protect the biological and cultural richness still embodied in this remarkable region.Competing Interest StatementDavid Gaveau is a member of the IUCN Oil Palm Task Force, a group tasked by the IUCN to investigate the sustainability of palm oil and he has done oil palm related work for this task force, and for Greenpeace.

TI  - Urbanization drives the acoustic diversity of mangrove anurans and avifauna in Puerto Rico
AU  - Branoff, Benjamin
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - The mangroves of Puerto Rico occupy a broad gradient of urbanization that offers a chance to test hypotheses on urban faunal communities from both terrestrial and mangrove systems. These hypotheses state that urban avifaunal communities are less diverse, with greater representation by generalists, but that certain mangrove specialists can utilize urban landscapes. Much of this is said to be driven by food resources, with frugivores and nectarivores benefiting from abundant residential flowers and fruits, while insectivores are driven away by low food resources. This study used passive acoustic monitoring to identify the audible anuran and avifaunal species in mangroves across the urban gradient of Puerto Rico. Three anurans and twenty-four avian species were detected across all sites, with eighteen species found at the most diverse site, and six at the least diverse site. The most urban communities were more similar to each other and characterized by low diversity, especially of invertivores, mangrove specialists, and endemics. The least urban communities, however, were less like each other and more diverse than their more urban counterparts. Greater surrounding vegetation cover was the strongest overall predictor of increased faunal diversity, although urban coverage and population density were also strongly correlated with some guilds and species. Soundscape analyses showed that acoustic space use was a strong predictor of site diversity and is thus a sufficiently accurate faster alternative to detecting individual species. This will be an important tool in the continued monitoring of these forests, which may experience changes associated with ongoing urbanization and sea-level rise.

AB  - To help avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change, society needs to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century. Wind energy provides a clean, renewable source of electricity; however, improperly sited wind facilities pose known threats to wildlife populations and contribute to degradation of natural habitats. To support a rapid transition to low-carbon energy while protecting imperiled species, we identified potential low-impact areas for wind development in a 17-state region of the central U.S. By combining maps of sensitive habitats and species with wind speed and land use information, we demonstrate that there is significant potential to develop wind energy in the Great Plains while avoiding significant negative impacts to wildlife. These low-impact areas have the potential to yield approximately 1,099-1,832 GW of wind capacity. This is equivalent to 10-18 times current U.S. installed wind capacity. Our analysis demonstrates that ambitious low-carbon energy goals are achievable on sites with minimal risk of wildlife conflict.

AB  - Urbanization and associated environmental changes are causing global declines in vertebrate populations. In general, population declines of the magnitudes now detected should lead to reduced effective population sizes for animals living in proximity to humans and disturbed lands. This is cause for concern because effective population sizes set the rate of genetic diversity loss due to genetic drift, the rate of increase in inbreeding, and the efficiency with which selection can act on beneficial alleles. We predicted that the effects of urbanization should decrease effective population size and genetic diversity, and increase population-level genetic differentiation. To test for such patterns, we repurposed and reanalyzed publicly archived genetic data sets for North American birds and mammals. After filtering, we had usable raw genotype data from 85 studies and 41,023 individuals, sampled from 1,008 locations spanning 41 mammal and 25 bird species. We used census-based urban-rural designations, human population density, and the Human Footprint Index as measures of urbanization and habitat disturbance. As predicted, mammals sampled in more disturbed environments had lower effective population sizes and genetic diversity, and were more genetically differentiated from those in more natural environments. There were no consistent relationships detectable for birds. This suggests that, in general, mammal populations living near humans may have less capacity to respond adaptively to further environmental changes, and be more likely to suffer from effects of inbreeding.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - As environments change, often drastically, due to human activities, dispersal-behavioral plasticity can become a key mediator of metapopulation connectivity and the interactions between an individual and its altered environment. Our goal was to investigate the traits and ecological processes that affect plastic dispersal responses within an insect-host system undergoing human-induced rapid evolutionary change (HIREC). Since the 1960s, populations of the red-shouldered soapberry bug from Florida, USA, originally feeding on the seeds of Cardiospermum corindum on the islands, quickly adapted to feeding on an invasive, ornamental tree, Koelreuteria elegans, on the mainland, which led to host-specific wing polyphenism. Here, we measured the morphology of &gt;3,500 soapberry bugs field collected from 2013 to 2020 and the flight performance of 378 total soapberry bugs tested in a flight mill during Fall 2019 and Winter 2020. Flight tests showed females and mainland natives exhibited variable flight responses mediated by mass, while males were consistent, wing-dependent flyers. However, historical specimens showed annual rises in flightless morphs for males and dwindling wing-to-body sizes for island natives since 2013. Despite uncertain future fitness consequences, plasticity could help predict mobility character and agent dispersal behavior and ultimately help identify whether recent trends signal adjustment or maladaptation to HIREC.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Ecological specialization reflects both evolutionary and ecological processes. For parasitic taxa, ecological specialization can be assessed as the degree to which a parasite species will associate with certain host species, a property known as host specificity.Ectoparasitic bat flies have been previously reported as highly host specific, presumably due to a history of coevolution with their bat hosts. However, there is conflicting evidence of coevolution between bats and bat flies. Resource-driven competition between parasite individuals and between species may also be important in explaining patterns of bat fly specificity.To test the importance of evolutionary and ecological factors on bat fly specificity, we collected and identified 21 bat fly species from 16 host bat species from the State of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. We generated a bat fly species phylogeny from molecular data, estimated d’ specialization values (a metric of specificity), and used linear and cophylogenetic models to compare the importance of various drivers of parasite ecological specialization.We found that bat fly co-occurrence frequency (a proxy for interspecific competition) and mean infection intensity (a proxy for intraspecific competition) best predicted patterns of bat fly specialization. Co-occurrence frequency had a significantly negative association with specialization, while mean infection intensity has a significantly positive association with specialization. Coevolutionary congruence had a small effect size and did not significantly predict parasite specialization.We found multiple shifts toward more generalized host niches across the bat fly phylogeny. Our results suggest that ecological processes such as resource-driven competition may be more important than evolutionary processes in shaping bat fly host specialization networks.Bat flies showed variable degrees of host specialization, parasitized phylogenetically distant host species, and showed low phylogenetic congruence to their hosts. This suggests that as a group, bat flies may show flexibility in their host preference phenotypes and may change their host associations in the face of environmental disturbance.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Mesophotic coral communities are increasingly gaining attention for the unique biological species they host, exemplified by the numerous mesophotic fish species that continue to be discovered. In contrast, many of the photosynthetic scleractinian corals observed at mesophotic depths are assumed to be depth-generalists, with very few species characterised as mesophotic-specialists. This presumed lack of a specialised community remains largely untested, as phylogenetic studies rarely include mesophotic samples and have long suffered from resolution issues associated with traditional sequence markers. Here, we used reduced-representation genome sequencing to provide a phylogenomic assessment of the two dominant mesophotic genera of plating corals in the Indo-Pacific and Western Atlantic, respectively, Leptoseris and Agaricia. While these genome-wide phylogenies broadly corroborated the morphological taxonomy, they also exposed substantial undescribed diversity (at least 24 molecular clades across the 8 species), including deep divergences within genera and current taxonomic species. Five of the eight focal species consisted of at least two sympatrically-occurring, genetically distinct clades, which were consistently detected across different methods. The repeated observation of genetically divergent clades associated with mesophotic depths highlights that there are many more mesophotic-specialist coral species than currently acknowledged, and that an urgent assessment of this largely unstudied biological diversity is warranted.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The genus Lonicera L. is widely distributed and is well-known for its high species richness and morphological diversity. Previous studies have suggested that many sections of Lonicera are not monophyletic and phylogenetic relationships within the genus are still poorly known. In this study, we sampled 37 accessions of Lonicera, covering four sections of subgenus Chamaecerasus plus six outgroup taxa to recover the main clades of Lonicera based on sequences of nuclear loci generated by target enrichment and cpDNA from genome skimming. We found extensive cytonuclear discordance across the subgenus. Both nuclear and plastid phylogenetic analyses supported subgenus Chamaecerasus sister to subgenus Lonicera. Within subgenus Chamaecerasus, sections Isika and Niatoon were polyphyletic. Based on the nuclear and chloroplast phylogenies we propose to merge Lonicera korolkowii into section Coeloxylosteum and Lonicera caerulea into section Nintooa. In addition, Lonicera is estimated to have originated in the late Miocene (19.84 Ma). The stem age of section Nintooa was estimated to be 17.97 Ma (95% HPD: 13.31- 22.89). The stem age of subgenus Lonicera was estimated to be 16.35 Ma (95% HPD: 9.33- 45.15). Ancestral area reconstruction analyses indicate that Lonicera originated in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau (QTP) and Asia, with subsequent dispersal into other areas. The aridification of the Asian interior possibly promoted the rapid radiation of Lonicera within this region, and the uplift of the QTP appears to have triggered the dispersal and recent rapid diversification of the genus in the QTP and adjacent regions. Overall, this study provides new insights into the taxonomically complex lineages of Lonicera at the section level and the process of speciation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The contrast between the tiger’s (Panthera tigris) 2-3 My age and extant tigers’ coalescence approximately 110,000 years ago suggests an ancient demographic bottleneck. Here we collected over 60 extinct specimens across mainland Asia and generated whole genome sequences from a 10,600-year-old Russian Far East (RFE) specimen (RUSA21, 8ξ coverage), 14 South China tigers (0.1-12ξ), three Caspian tigers (4-8ξ), plus 17 new mitogenomes. RUSA21 clustered within modern Northeast Asian phylogroups and partially derived from an extinct Late Pleistocene lineage. While some 8,000-10,000-year-old RFE mitogenomes are basal to all tigers, one 2,000-year-old specimen resembles present Amur tigers. The Caspian tiger likely dispersed from an ancestral Northeast Asian population and experienced gene flow from southern Bengal tigers. Lastly, genome-wide monophyly supported the South China tiger as a distinct subspecies, albeit with mitochondrial paraphyly, hence resolving its longstanding taxonomic controversy. The distribution of mitochondrial haplogroups corroborated by biogeographical modeling suggested Southwest China was a Late Pleistocene refugium for a relic basal lineage. As suitable habitat returned, Eastern China became a genetic melting pot to foster divergent lineages to merge into South China tigers and other subsequent northern subspecies to develop. Genomic information retrieved from ancient tigers hence sheds light on the species’ full evolutionary history leading to nine modern subspecies and resolves the natural history of surviving tigers.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Understanding the historical emergence and growth of long-range fisheries can provide fundamental insights into the timing of ecological impacts and the development of coastal communities during the last millennium. Whole genome sequencing approaches can improve such understanding by determining the origin of archaeological fish specimens that may have been obtained from historic trade or distant water. Here, we used genome-wide data to individually infer the biological source of 37 ancient Atlantic cod specimens (ca. 1050 to 1950 CE) from England and Spain. Our findings provide novel genetic evidence that eleventh- to twelfth-century specimens from London were predominantly obtained from nearby populations, while thirteenth- to fourteenth-century specimens derived from distant sources. Our results further suggest that Icelandic cod was exported to London earlier than previously reported. Our observations confirm the chronology and geography of the trans-Atlantic cod trade from Newfoundland to Spain starting by the early sixteenth century. Our findings demonstrate the utility of whole genome sequencing and ancient DNA approaches to describe the globalisation of marine fisheries and increase our understanding regarding the extent of the North-Atlantic fish trade and long-range fisheries in medieval and early modern times.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Urban ecosystems are increasingly viewed as an important component within strategies for wildlife conservation but are shaped as much by natural systems as they are by social and political processes. At the garden scale, attitudes and preferences govern design and maintenance choices including the decision to encourage or discourage specific faunal presence. At the global scale, charismatic taxa that are well-liked attract more conservation funding and volunteer stewardship. Amphibians are a class of animals that are both loved and loathed making them a suitable subject for comparing and unpacking the drivers of preference and attitudes towards animals. We conducted a mixed methods survey of 192 participants in three adjacent neighbourhoods in Cape Town, South Africa. The survey included both quantitative and qualitative questions which were analysed thematically and used to explain the quantitative results. The results revealed that attitudes formed during childhood tended to be retained into adulthood, were shaped by cultural norms, childhood experiences and the attitudes of primary care-givers. The findings are significant for environmental education programmes aimed at building connectedness to nature and biophilic values.

AB  - Understanding global patterns of genetic diversity (GD) is essential for describing, monitoring, and preserving life on Earth. To date, efforts to map macrogenetic patterns have been restricted to vertebrates that comprise only a small fraction of Earth’s biodiversity. Here, we construct the first global map of predicted insect GD, derived from open data. We calculate the GD mean (GDM) and evenness (GDE) of insect assemblages across the globe, identify environmental correlates of insect GD, and make predictions. Based on the largest single-locus genetic dataset assembled yet, we find that GDE follows a quadratic latitudinal gradient peaking in the subtropics. Both GDM and GDE correlate with seasonally hot temperatures, as well as climate stability since the LGM. Our models explain 27.9% and 24.0% of the observed variation in GDM and GDE in insects, respectively, making an important step towards understanding global biodiversity patterns in the most diverse animal taxon.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The “paradox of the great speciators” has puzzled evolutionary biologists for over half a century. A great speciator requires excellent dispersal ability to explain its occurrence on multiple islands, but reduced dispersal ability to explain its high number of subspecies. A rapid reduction in dispersal ability is often invoked to solve this apparent paradox, but a proximate mechanism has not been identified. Here, we explore the role of six genes linked to migration and animal personality differences (CREB1, CLOCK, ADCYAP1, NPAS2, DRD4, and SERT) in 20 South Pacific populations of silvereye (Zosterops lateralis) that range from highly sedentary to partially migratory, to determine if genetic variation is associated with dispersal propensity. We detected genetic associations in three of the six genes: i) in a partial migrant population, migrant individuals had longer microsatellite alleles at the CLOCK gene compared to resident individuals from the same population; ii) CREB1 displayed longer average microsatellite allele lengths in recently colonised island populations (&lt; 200 years), compared to evolutionarily older populations. Bayesian broken stick regression models supported a reduction in CREB1 length with time since colonisation and decreasing dispersal propensity; and iii) like CREB1, DRD4 showed differences in polymorphisms between recent and old colonisations but a further sample size is needed to confirm. ADCYAP1, SERT, and NPAS2 were variable but that variation was not associated with dispersal propensity. The association of genetic variants at three genes with migration and dispersal ability in silvereyes provides the impetus for further exploration of genetic mechanisms underlying dispersal shifts, and the prospect of resolving a long-running evolutionary paradox through a genetic lens.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Jaguars (Panthera onca) exert critical top-down control over large vertebrates across the Neotropics and have been declining due to multiple threats. Based on geospatial layers, we extracted socio-environmental variables for 447 protected areas across the Brazilian Amazon to identify protected areas that merit short-term high-priority efforts to maximize jaguar persistence. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, structural equations and regression modeling. Our results reveal that areas containing the largest jaguar densities and estimated population sizes are precisely those confronting most anthropogenic threats. We reveal that jaguars in the world’s largest tropical forest biome are threatened by deforestation associated with anthropogenic fires, and subsequent establishment of pastures. We provide a shortlist of protected areas that should be prioritized for short-term jaguar conservation. The future predicament of jaguar populations can only be ensured if protected areas can be proofed against downgrading and downsizing geopolitical pressures and external anthropogenic threats.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Based on plant occurrence data covering all parts of Germany, we investigated changes in the distribution of 2146 plant species between 1960 and 2017. We analyzed 29 million occurrence records over an area of ∼350.000 km2 on a 5 × 5 km grid using temporal and spatio-temporal models and accounting for sampling bias. Since the 1960s, more than 70% of investigated plant species showed significant declines in nation-wide occurrence. Archaeophytes (species introduced before 1492) most strongly declined but also native plant species experienced severe declines. In contrast, neophytes (species introduced after 1492) increased in their nation-wide occurrence but not homogeneously throughout the country. Our analysis suggests that the strongest declines in native species already happened in the 1960s-80s, a time frame in which usually few data exist. Increases in neophytic species were strongest in the 1990s and 2010s. Overall, the increase in neophytes did not compensate for the loss of other species, resulting in a decrease in mean grid-cell species-richness of -1.9% per decade. The decline in plant biodiversity is a widespread phenomenon occurring in different habitats and geographic regions. It is likely that this decline has major repercussions on ecosystem functioning and overall biodiversity, potentially with cascading effects across trophic levels. The approach used in this study is transferable to large-scale trend analyses using heterogeneous occurrence data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Island species and habitats are particularly vulnerable to human disturbances, and anthropogenic changes are increasingly overwriting natural island biogeographic patterns. However, quantitative comparisons of how native and alien assemblages respond to human disturbances are scarce. Using data from 6,242 species of vertebrates, invertebrates and plants, from 7,718 sites on 81 islands, we model how land-use change, human population density and distance to the nearest road affect local assemblages of alien and native species on islands. We found that land-use change reduces both richness and abundance of native species, whereas the number and abundance of alien species are high in plantation forests and agricultural or urban sites. In contrast to the long-established pattern for native species (i.e., decline in species number with island isolation), more isolated islands have more alien species across most land uses than do less isolated islands. We show that alien species play a major role in the turnover of island assemblages: our models show that aliens outnumber natives among the species present at disturbed sites but absent from minimally-disturbed primary vegetation. Finally, we found a homogenization pattern for both native and alien assemblages across sites within most land uses. The declines of native species on islands in the face of human pressures, and the particular proneness to invasions of the more remote islands, highlight the need to reduce the intensity of human pressures on islands and to prevent the introduction and establishment of alien species.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Population genetic approaches may be used to investigate dispersal patterns of species living in highly urbanized environment in order to improve management strategies for biodiversity conservation or pest control. However, in such environment, population genetic structure may reflect both current features of the cityscape and urbanization history. This can be especially relevant when focusing on exotic commensal rodents that have been introduced in numerous primary colonial European settlements. Accounting for spatial and temporal cityscape heterogeneity to determine how past and recent demographic events may interplay to shape current population genetic structure of synanthropic rodents may provide useful insights to manage their populations. In this study, we addressed these issues by focusing on the house mouse, Mus musculus domesticus, in Dakar, Senegal, where the species may have been introduced as soon as Europeans settled in the middle of the nineteenth century. We examined genetic variation at one mitochondrial locus and 15 nuclear microsatellite markers from individuals sampled in 14 sampling sites representing different stages of urbanization history and different socio-economic environments in Dakar. We used various approaches, including model-based genetic clustering and model-free smoothing of pairwise genetic estimates. We further linked observed spatial genetic patterns to historical and current features of Dakar cityscape using random forest and Bayesian conditional autoregressive models. Results are consistent with an introduction of the house mouse at colonial time and the current genetic structure exhibits a gradient-like pattern reflecting the historical process of spatially continuous expansion of the city from the first European settlement. The genetic patterns further suggest that population dynamics of the house mouse is also driven by the spatial heterogeneity of the current cityscape, including socio-economics features, that translate in habitat quality. Our results highlight the potential importance of accounting for past demographic events to understand spatial genetic patterns of nonnative invasive commensal rodents in highly urbanized environment.

AB  - Hostplant’ location and conspecific aggregation on the hostplant are the key behaviors of several herbivore insect species. The cues used by insects for host identification and aggregation initiation have been researched mainly using a single hostplant species. The chemical repertoire of plants, including volatile and non-volatile secondary metabolites, is critical in mediating these processes. In natural ecosystems, often several closely related plant species co-occur. Despite these related plant species’ similar chemical repertoires, insects proficiently locate their hosts. How they resolve such complex chemical cues is understudied. To study the basis of such resolution, we used five commonly co-occurring Ipomoea spp. as hostplants and four Chiridopsis spp. (beetles) as their herbivores. In this wild sympatric system from the Western Ghats of India, monophagous, biphagous, and oligophagous Chiridopsis spp. are specialist herbivores of different Ipomoea species. We studied the chemistry of these beetles’ stringent host-specificity by determining the roles of chemical cues in hostplant location and aggregation.We analyzed beetles’ hostplant preferences vis-a-vis hostplant volatile blends. We found plant volatiles as the primary hostplant identification cues. Using GC-MS/-FID and SPME headspace analyses, we characterized odor blends of the five Ipomoea spp. and identified putative attractants and repellents for each Chiridopsis sp. using multivariate statistics. We determined their attractant or deterrent natures using behavioral assays and ascertained their perception by the antennal olfactory receptors using electroantennography. Beetles responded to these compounds only when they were delivered via their hostplant odor blends. Beetles did not respond when these compounds were given singularly or via non-host odor blends. We infer that these semiochemicals’ attractant, repellent, or neutral characters are associated with the hostplant’s volatile blend-the matrix. We integrated the multi-source data to visualize this in-flight odor perception by representing odor as color variations or ‘odor images.’ Odor imaging revealed beetles’ differential olfactory perception of different hostplants and indicated how a beetle distinguishes between two closely-related plant species. Additionally, it showed a different olfactory perception of the same hostplant by different closely-related beetle species, suggesting they have evolved to recognize the same odor using different components. Our work demonstrates that the hostplant’s odor blend matrix is crucial; beetles do not respond to attractants/ repellents without it. Together, the closely-related plant species form an ideal system to understand how insects perceive subtle differences between hosts and non-host cues in nature. This investigation also underlines the relevance of studying entire odor blends over individual compounds.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Fishing spiders (Dolomedes spp.) make an interesting model to predict the impact of global changes because they are generalist, opportunistic predators, whose distribution is driven mostly by abiotic factors. Yet, the two European species are expected to react differently to forthcoming environmental changes, because of habitat specialization and initial range. We used an original combination of habitat and dispersal data to revisit these predictions under various climatic scenarios. We used the future range of suitable habitat, predicted with habitat variables only, as a base layer to further predict the range or reachable habitat by accounting for both dispersal ability and landscape connectivity. Our results confirm the northward shift in range and indicate that the area of co-occurrences should also increase. However, reachable habitat should expand less than suitable habitat, especially when accounting for landscape connectivity. In addition, the potential range expansion was further limited for the red-listed D. plantarius, which is more habitat-specialist and has a lower ability to disperse. This study highlights the importance of looking beyond habitat variables to produce more accurate predictions for the future of arthropods populations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - African Swine Fever (ASF) has emerged as a disease of great concern to swine producers and government disease control agencies because of its severe consequences to animal health and the pig industry. Early detection of an ASF introduction is considered essential for reducing the harm caused by the disease. Risk-based surveillance approaches have been used as enhancements to early disease epidemic detection systems in livestock populations. Such approaches may consider the role wildlife plays in hosting and transmitting a disease. In this study, a novel method is presented to estimate and map the risk of introducing ASF into the domestic pig population through wild boar intermediate hosts. It makes use of data about hunted wild boar, rest areas along motorways connecting ASF affected countries to Switzerland, outdoor piggeries, and forest cover. These data were used to compute relative wild boar abundance as well as to estimate the risk of both disease introduction into the wild boar population and disease transmission to domestic pigs. The way relative wild boar abundance was calculated adds to the current state of the art by considering the effect of beech mast on hunting success and the probability of wild boar occurrence when distributing relative abundance values among individual grid cells. The risk of ASF introduction into the domestic pig population by wild boar was highest near the borders of France, Germany, and Italy. On the north side of the Alps, areas of high risk were located on the unshielded side of the main motorway crossing the Central Plateau, which acts as a barrier for wild boar. The results of this study can be used to focus surveillance efforts for early disease detection on high risk areas. The developed method may also inform policies to control other diseases that are transmitted by direct contact from wild boar to domestic pigs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The domestic cat (Felis catus) is the most popular companion animal and the most abundant carnivore globally. It is also a pet with an immense ecological footprint, because even non-feral and food-subsidized cats are prolific predators. Whereas knowledge about the spatial behavior of individual domestic cats is growing, we still know little about how a local population of free-ranging pet cats occupies the landscape. Using a citizen science approach, we GPS-tagged 92 pet cats with outdoor access living in a residential area in southern Norway. The resulting position data allowed us to construct both individual home range kernels and a population-level utilization distribution. Our results reveal a dense predatory blanket that outdoor cats drape over and beyond the urban landscape. It is this population-level intensity surface - the “catscape” - that potential prey have to navigate. There were almost no gaps in the catscape within our residential study area and therefore few terrestrial refuges from potential cat predation. However, cats spent on average 79% of their outdoor time within 50 meters to their owner’s home, which suggests that the primary impact is local and most acute for wildlife in the vicinity to homes with cats. We discuss the catscape as a conceptual and quantitative tool for better understanding and mitigating the environmental impact of domestic cats.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Temperature is thought to be a key variable explaining global patterns of species richness. However, to investigate this relationship carefully, it is necessary to study clades with broad geographic ranges that are comprised of species inhabiting diverse biomes with well- characterized species ranges. In the present study, we investigate the link between temperature and diversification in the butterfly family Pieridae (sulfurs and whites) by combining Next Generation sequences and published molecular data with fine-grained distribution information. After building the most comprehensive phylogeny of the group, with almost 600 species and all higher taxa (subfamilies, tribes and subtribes), we found strong support for the following relationships within the family: Dismorphiinae + (Coliadinae + (Pseudopontiinae + Pierinae)). With a curated distribution dataset of over 800,000 occurrences, we conducted multiple comparative phylogenetic analyses that provided strong evidence that species in environments with more stable daily temperatures or with cooler maximum temperatures in the warm seasons have higher diversification rates. We also found a positive correlation between speciation and extinction with paleotemperature: as global temperature decreased through geological time, so did diversification rates. Although many studies demonstrate higher diversity in the tropics, we have been able to identify specific climate variables associated with changes in diversification, while also inferring the most robust and well sampled phylogenomic framework for Pieridae to date.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - In biological invasion processes animal behavior moderates the success of invasive species, and the native fauna’s ability to adapt. The importance of behavioral syndromes and flexibility of invading species for invasion success remains debated. We investigated behavior of rodents, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) currently invading Ireland, and the native wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) that declines with vole invasion, at replicated sites at pre-invasion, edge, and source of the invasion. We found that individual rodents varied consistently in risk-taking behaviors, and mice had not adapted to the presence of invasive voles. Voles at the invasion edge were more careful but also more flexible compared to voles the invasion source. The ability to develop timid and flexible phenotypes may contribute to the invasion success of rodents worldwide.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - By altering the abundance, diversity, and distribution of species — and their pathogens — globalization may inadvertently select for more virulent pathogens. In Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, a hotspot of amphibian biodiversity, the pet trade has facilitated the co-occurrence of previously isolated enzootic and panzootic lineages of the pathogenic amphibian-chytrid (‘Bd’) and generated new virulent recombinant genotypes (‘hybrid’). Epidemiological data indicate that amphibian declines are most severe in hybrid zones, suggesting that coinfections are causing more severe infections or selecting for higher virulence. We investigated how coinfections involving these genotypes shaped virulence and transmission. Overall, coinfection favored the more virulent and competitively superior panzootic genotype, despite dampening its virulence and transmission. However, for the least virulent and least competitive genotype, coinfection increased both pathogen virulence and transmission. Thus, by integrating experimental and epidemiological data, our results provide mechanistic insight into how globalization can select for, and propel, the emergence of introduced hypervirulent lineages, such as the globally distributed panzootic lineage of Bd.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

Here we combine fresh collections and museum vouchers to revise the order Axinellida for California. Seven new species are described: Endectyon (Endectyon) hispitumulus, Eurypon curvoclavus, Aulospongus viridans, Aulospongus lajollaensis, Halicnemia litorea, Halicnemia montereyensis, and Halicnemia weltoni. One new combination is also described, and two existing species are reduced to junior synonyms, resulting in a total of 13 species; a dichotomous key to differentiate them is provided.

AB  - Wild edible plants as culturally-appropriate sources of nutrition and for food security are now well-recognised. In Europe, the use of wild edible plants is shifting from a subsistence activity to an emerging trend in high-end gastronomy. The environmental impacts of this shift are poorly known. Foraging is increasingly popular for personal consumption and commercially, not least in the Nordic countries where popularity is fuelled by the New Nordic Food movement. Here, we evaluate if this trend entails biodiversity conservation risks in Norway. In collaboration with the Norwegian Association for Mycology and Foraging, we conducted 18 face-to-face interviews with key stakeholders and we published an online questionnaire filled by 219 recreational and professional foragers. We enquired on what species are harvested, by whom and how, where do foragers learn and what are their perspectives on the sustainability of foraging. We combined these data with an assessment of foraging impact based on foraging pressure, ecological traits and conservation assessments. Our results show that 272 different wild edible plants are foraged and that this is mostly sustainable.However, some risks arise from the harvest of threatened plants, the potential spread of invasive species, and the overharvesting of extremely popular or ‘fashionable’ species. Foraging fosters a strong connection with the natural environment and the majority of foragers report to forage as part of a sustainable lifestyle. We suggest that careful encouragement to forage and the participatory development of local guidelines for sustainable foraging in Norway can enhance people-nature relationships while safeguarding foraged plant populations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Developing actionable early detection and warning systems for agricultural stakeholders is crucial to reduce the annual $200B USD losses and environmental impacts associated with crop diseases. Agricultural stakeholders primarily rely on labor-intensive, expensive scouting and molecular testing to detect disease. Spectroscopic imagery (SI) can improve plant disease management by offering decision-makers accurate risk maps derived from Machine Learning (ML) models. However, training and deploying ML requires significant computation and storage capabilities. This challenge will become even greater as global scale data from the forthcoming Surface Biology &amp; Geology (SBG) satellite becomes available. This work presents a cloud-hosted architecture to streamline plant disease detection with SI from NASA’s AVIRIS-NG platform, using grapevine leafroll associated virus complex 3 (GLRaV-3) as a model system. Here, we showcase a pipeline for processing SI to produce plant disease detection models and demonstrate that the underlying principles of a cloud-based disease detection system easily accommodate model improvements and shifting data modalities. Our goal is to make the insights derived from SI available to agricultural stakeholders via a platform designed with their needs and values in mind. The key outcome of this work is an innovative, responsive system foundation that can empower agricultural stakeholders to make data-driven plant disease management decisions, while serving as a framework for others pursuing use-inspired application development for agriculture to follow that ensures social impact and reproducibility while preserving stakeholder privacy.Key PointsCloud-based plant disease detection system, easily accommodates newly developed and/or improved models, as well as diverse data modalities.Empower agricultural stakeholders to use hyperspectral data for decision support while preserving stakeholder data privacy.Outline framework for researchers interested in designing geospatial/remote sensing applications for agricultural stakeholders to follow.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Climate Change is already seen as one of the biggest threats to biodiversity in the 21st century. Not much studies direct attention to its effects on whole communities of threatened hotspots. In the present work, we combine ecological niche modelling (ENM) with a future climate scenario of greenhouse gases emissions to study the future changes in alpha and beta diversity of birds of the Brazilian Cerrado biome, a hotspot of biodiversity with high velocity of climate change and agricultural expansion. In general, we found heterogeneous results for changes in species richness, spatial and temporal taxonomic and functional beta diversity, and mean ecological distinctiveness. Contrary to a previous study on Cerrado mammals, species richness is expected to increase in Northern Cerrado, where homogenization of communities (decreasing spatial turnover) is also expected to occur especially through local invasions. We show that biotic homogenization (which is composed of local extinction of natives and local invasion of exotic species) will occur in two biological groups but through different subprocesses: local extinctions for mammals and local invasions for birds. Distinct conservation management actions should be directed depending on the outcomes of analyzes of alpha and spatial and temporal beta diversity, for example controlling species invasions in Northern Cerrado. Conservation studies should continue evaluating Cerrado in Brazil even under covid pandemic, as environmental situation in the country is not good and incentives for scientific studies are almost nonexistent.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Sri Lanka occupies a strategic position in the Indian Ocean, making the surrounding ocean one of the busiest in the region. The lack of fundamental studies has created a void regarding the physical and chemical behaviour of the fouling community. A few studies have been conducted to assess the subtidal biofouling communities and invasive threats in key ports and surrounding coastal waters. This study explores the chemical diversity and environmental resilience of nine marine macrofouling organisms through secondary metabolite-induced impacts on biofilm formation and volatile component analysis. The anti-settlement assay revealed that Schizoporella errata, Botrylloides violaceus, Callyspongia diffusa, and Acanthella cavernosa showed significant resistance against Escherichia coli settlement within the first 12 h (OD600 &lt; 0.1). The identification of known compounds with a higher degree of antimicrobial activity, such as dodecanoic acid, methyl palmitate, β-caryophyllene and β-asarone, further supports the findings of anti-settlement activity of macrofouling organisms and likely plays a role in environmental resilience.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Coastal lagoons are transitional ecosystems that host a unique diversity of species and support many ecosystem services. Owing to their position at the interface between land and sea, they are also subject to increasing human impacts, which alter their ecological functioning. Because coastal lagoons are naturally highly variable in their environmental conditions, disentangling the effects of anthropogenic disturbances like eutrophication from those of natural variability is a challenging, yet necessary issue to address. Here, we analyze a dataset composed of macrobenthic invertebrate abundances and environmental variables (hydro-morphology, water, sediment and macrophytes) gathered across 29 Mediterranean coastal lagoons located in France to characterize the main drivers of community composition and structure. Using correlograms, linear models and variance partitioning, we found that lagoon hydro-morphology (connection to the sea and surface) which affects the level of environmental variability (salinity and temperature), as well as lagoon-scale benthic habitat diversity (using macrophyte morphotypes) seemed to regulate macrofauna distribution, while eutrophication and associated stressors like low dissolved oxygen acted upon the existing communities, mainly by reducing species richness and diversity. Furthermore, M-AMBI, a multivariate index composed of species richness, Shannon diversity and AMBI (AZTI’s Marine Biotic Index) and currently used to evaluate the ecological state of French coastal lagoons, was more sensitive to eutrophication (18%) than to natural variability (9%) with nonetheless 49% of its variability explained jointly by both. Conversely, AMBI was the only tested index that uniquely responded to eutrophication variables, which nonetheless explained less than a third of its variability. To improve the robustness of benthic indicators like M-AMBI and increase the effectiveness of lagoon benthic habitat management, we call for a revision of the ecological groups at the base of the AMBI index and of the current lagoon typology which could be inspired by the lagoon-sea connection levels used in this study.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - There is growing evidence for a link between biodiversity and ecosystem function, and for a correlation between human population and the species diversity of plants and animals in a region. Here, we suggest these relationships might not be independent. Using a comprehensive phylogeny of southern African trees and structural equation modelling, we show that human population density correlates with tree phylogenetic diversity and show that this relationship is stronger than the correlation with species richness alone. Further, we demonstrate that areas high in phylogenetic diversity support a greater diversity of ecosystem goods and services, indicating that the evolutionary processes responsible for generating variation among living organisms are also key to the provisioning of nature’s contributions to people. Our results raise the intriguing possibility that the history of human settlement in southern Africa may have been shaped, in part, by the evolutionary history of its tree flora. However, the correlation between human population and tree diversity generates a conflict between people and nature. Our study suggests that future human population growth may threaten the contributions to people provided by intact and phylogenetically diverse ecosystems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Understanding how community assembly processes drive biodiversity patterns is a central goal of community ecology. While it is generally accepted that ecological communities are assembled by both stochastic and deterministic processes, quantifying their relative importance remains challenging. Even fewer studies have investigated how the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic community assembly processes vary among taxa and along gradients of habitat degradation. Using data on 1,002 invertebrate species across six taxonomic groups in Malaysian Borneo, we quantified the importance of stochastic and deterministic community assembly processes across a gradient of logging intensity. Dispersal limitation was the dominant process at all levels of logging intensity. The relationship between logging and community assembly varied depending on the specific combination of taxa and stochasticity metric used, but, in general, the processes that govern invertebrate community assembly were remarkably robust to changes in land use intensity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The maintenance of biodiversity and the capacity of natural systems to provide goods and services for people is affected on different levels by the intensity of human activities on ecosystems. In this study, we apply a Legacy-adjusted Human Footprint Index (LHFI) to evaluate the spatiotemporal variation of anthropic impact in Colombia in 1970, 1990, 2000 and 2015. We identified hotspots of change in LHFI and we evaluated the intensity of anthropic pressures in natural regions and ecosystems. We found that LHFI in Colombia increased between 1970 and 2015. The Andean and Caribbean regions presented the highest levels of anthropic impact, remaining stable over time. Hotspots of change were mainly located in the following regions: Andean (Antioquia, Cauca and Valle del Cauca states), Amazon (Amazonas, parts of Meta, Guaviare and Putumayo states) and Orinoco (Casanare and parts of Meta and Vichada states). In addition, ecosystems that under the IUCN ecosystem risk categories are Critically Endangered (CR) and Vulnerable (VU) were the most affected by a high level of human impact. Spatiotemporal evaluation of the human footprint in Colombia provides new insights about trends in human pressures on ecosystems and constitutes an analytical tool with high potential for harmonizing land use planning and biodiversity conservation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Food web structure plays an important role in determining ecosystem stability against perturbations. High-latitude marine ecosystems are being affected by environmental stressors and biological invasions. In the West Antarctic Peninsula these transformations are mainly driven by climate change, while in the sub-Antarctic region by anthropogenic activities. Understanding the differences between these areas is necessary to monitor the changes that are expected to occur in the upcoming decades. Here, we compared the structure and stability of Antarctic (Potter Cove) and sub-Antarctic (Beagle Channel) marine food webs. We compiled species trophic interactions (predator-prey) and calculated complexity, structure and stability metrics. Even if both food webs presented the same connectance, we found important differences between them.

AB  - Anthropogenic changes in climate, land use and disturbance regimes, as well as introductions of non-native species can lead to the transformation of many ecosystems. The resulting novel ecosystems are usually characterized by species assemblages that have not occurred previously in a given area. Quantifying the ecological novelty of communities (i.e. biotic novelty) would enhance the understanding of environmental change. However, quantification remains challenging since current novelty metrics, such as the number and/or proportion of non-native species in a community, fall short of considering both functional and evolutionary aspects of biotic novelty. Here, we propose the Biotic Novelty Index (BNI), an intuitive and flexible multidimensional measure that combines (1) functional differences between native and non-native introduced species with (2) temporal dynamics of species introductions. We show that the BNI is an additive partition of Rao’s quadratic entropy, capturing the novel interaction component of the community’s functional diversity. Simulations show that the index varies predictably with the relative amount of functional novelty added by recently arrived species, and they illustrate the need to provide an additional standardized version of the index. We present a detailed R-code and two applications of the BNI by (1) measuring changes of biotic novelty of dry grassland plant communities along an urbanization gradient in a metropolitan region and (2) determining the biotic novelty of plant species assemblages at a national scale. Results illustrate the applicability of the index across scales and its flexibility in the use of data of different quality. Both case studies revealed strong connections between biotic novelty and increasing urbanization, a measure of abiotic novelty. We conclude that the BNI framework may help in building a basis for a better understanding of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of global change.

AB  - This article analyses historical data from observations made to birds in breeding, throughout two routes with urban characteristics and during a consecutive period of 10 years (2009-2018), following a precise methodology designed by the North American Breeding Bird Survey. The analyzed routes are officially registered in the Mexican Commission for Biodiversity’s Knowledge and Use, the United States Geological Survey Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, and the Canadian Wildlife Service Research Centre. The observations were made by citizens without formal professional education; hence the results may be considered within the framework of citizen science. Their contributions provided important data for decision-making regarding environmental issues, since the presence of birds is considered one of the main indicators on health conditions of an ecosystem. Data analysis identified two basic conditions: (i) a reduction of the 23% in the number of species found, as many of them disappeared during counting; and (ii) the significant increase in population of other species, three of pigeons among them. Apart from the study of bird behavior in the routes with urban characteristics, the article acknowledges the lack of connection and use of the information produced from monitoring for decision-making and education regarding environmental issues. Therefore, we consider crucial to create scientific observatories, both available to experts in the field and to the general population, as the ultimate purpose would be the production of citizen science.

AB  - The BlueFlux field campaign is supported by NASA’s Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) and will develop prototype blue carbon products to inform coastal carbon management. Blue carbon is included in carbon-dioxide removal actions proposed to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations to mitigate climate change. Due to their high productivity and carbon storage, combined with historic losses and a wide-range of beneficial ecosystem services, the restoration and conservation of mangrove ecosystems features prominently in blue-carbon planning. The goal of BlueFlux is to carry out multi-scale measurements of CO2 and CH4 fluxes using chambers, flux towers, and aircraft and scale these to gridded products using space-based observations of forest structure and surface reflectance. The measurements cover gradients in disturbance, mainly from the history of hurricanes in the region that drive the dieback of mangroves and the formation of ‘ghost forests’. The fluxes of CH4 emissions will be contrasted with CO2 uptake to provide a more complete budget of radiative forcing and to understand the net climate benefits of blue carbon. BlueFlux demonstrates that quantifying the removals of CO2 and emissions of CH4 using a multi-scale approach can provide increased confidence in regional greenhouse-gas accounting, contribute to process-understanding, and help inform restoration and conservation efforts in the context of climate mitigation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Species is the fundamental unit to quantify biodiversity. In recent years, the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has seen an increased number of studies related to its geographical distribution, population structure, and phenotypic diversity. However, seven additional species from the same genus have been less thoroughly studied, which has limited our understanding of the macroevolutionary leading to the diversification of this genus over the last 20 million years. Here, we report the geographies, hosts, substrates, and phylogenetic relationships for approximately 1,800 Saccharomyces strains, covering the complete genus with unprecedented breadth and depth. We generated and analyzed complete genome sequences of 163 strains and phenotyped 128 phylogenetically diverse strains. This dataset provides insights about genetic and phenotypic diversity within and between species and populations, quantifies reticulation and incomplete lineage sorting, and demonstrates how gene flow and selection have affected traits, such as galactose metabolism. These findings elevate the genus Saccharomyces as a model to understand biodiversity and evolution in microbial eukaryotes.Competing Interest StatementCommercial use of Saccharomyces eubayanus strains requires a license from WARF (conflict declared by DP, QKL, and CTH) or CONICET (conflict declared by DL).

AB  - Mosquito species belonging to the genus Aedes have attracted the interest of scientists and public health officers for their invasive species traits and efficient capacity of transmitting viruses affecting humans. Some of these species were brought outside their native range by human activities such as trade and tourism, and colonised new regions thanks to a unique combination of eco-physiological traits.Considering mosquito physiological and behavioural traits to understand and predict the spatial and temporal population dynamics is thus a crucial step to develop strategies to mitigate the local densities of invasive Aedes populations.Here, we synthesised the life cycle of four invasive Aedes species (Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus, Ae. japonicus and Ae. koreicus) in a single multi-scale stochastic modelling framework which we coded in the R package dynamAedes. We designed a stage-based and time-discrete stochastic model driven by temperature, photo-period and inter-specific larval competition that can be applied to three different spatial scales: punctual, local and regional. These spatial scales consider different degrees of spatial complexity and data availability, by accounting for both active and passive dispersal of mosquito species as well as for the heterogeneity of the input temperature data.Our overarching aim was to provide a flexible, open-source and user-friendly tool rooted in the most updated knowledge on species biology which could be applied to the management of invasive Aedes populations as well as for more theoretical ecological inquiries.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Tidal hydrodynamics drive the groundwater-seawater exchange and shifts in microbiota structure in the coastal zone. However, how microbiota structure responds to periodic tidal fluctuations and anthropogenic disturbance is seldom evaluated in the intertidal groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) continuum, although it affects microbially driven biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem function therein. Here, we resolved the high-resolution spatiotemporal dynamics and assembly mechanisms along a GW-SW continuum in the natural tidal creek. Our results revealed an evident rhythmic pattern of microbiota structure in response to daily and monthly tidal fluctuations in intertidal surface water. The similarity in archaeal community structures among groundwater and ebb-tide surface water demonstrated archaeal transport through groundwater discharge, whereas multi-source transport mechanisms led to the occurrence of unique bacterial biota in ebb-tide water. Mechanistically, homogeneous selection (58.6%-69.3%) dominated microbiota assembly patterns in the intertidal GW-SW continuum, while biotic interactions were weaker in the groundwater microbiota than the surface water microbiota. Compared with the natural tidal creek, we found that microbiota biodiversity and community succession in intertidal groundwater under anthropogenic-induced terrestrial nutrient inputs and weakened tidal fluctuations were primarily controlled by increased dispersal limitation and consequent weakening of homogeneous selection, as well as enhanced biotic interactions. Overall, this study sheds light on the ecological rules guiding water microbiota assembly in the coastal transition zones and highlights periodic hydrodynamic and anthropogenic disturbances as prominent influencing factors of the microbiota structure, as well as the potential for enhancing coastal monitoring initiatives by incorporating only a few rhythmic but critical key microbial observations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Sound emissions from human activities represent a pervasive environmental stressor. Individual responses in terms of behaviour, physiology or anatomy are well documented but whether they propagate through nested ecological interactions to alter complex communities needs to be better understood. This is even more relevant for freshwater ecosystems that harbour a disproportionate fraction of biodiversity but receive less attention than marine and terrestrial systems. We conducted a mesocosm investigation to study the effect of chronic exposure to motorboat noise on the dynamics of a freshwater community including phytoplankton, zooplankton, and roach as a planktivorous fish. As expected under the trophic cascade hypothesis, roach predation induced structural changes in the planktonic communities. Surprisingly, although roach changed their feeding behaviour in response to noise, the dynamics of the roach-dominated planktonic communities did not differ between noisy and noiseless mesocosms. This suggests that the top-down structuring influence of roach on planktonic communities might be resilient to noise and reveals the difficulties on extrapolating impacts form individual responses to complex communities.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Efforts are underway in Canada to set aside terrestrial lands for conservation, thereby protecting them from anthropogenic pressures. Here we produce the first Canadian human footprint map to identify intact and modified lands and ecosystems. Our results showed strong spatial variation in pressures across the country, with just 18% of Canada experiencing measurable human pressure. However, some ecosystems are experiencing very high pressure, such as the Great Lakes Plains and Prairies national ecological areas which have over 75% and 56% of their areas, respectively, with a high human footprint. In contrast, the Arctic and Northern Mountains have less than 0.02% and 0.2% under high human footprint. A validation of the final map resulted in a Cohen Kappa statistic of 0.911, signifying an ‘almost perfect’ agreement between the human footprint and the validation data set. By increasing the number and accuracy of mapped pressures, our map demonstrates much more widespread pressures in Canada than were indicated by previous global mapping efforts, demonstrating the value in specific national data applications. Ecological areas with immense anthropogenic pressure, highlight challenges that may arise when planning for ecologically representative protected areas.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - The Golden-cheeked Warbler, Setophaga chrysoparia, is a migratory songbird listed as endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act that breeds exclusively in central Texas and is heavily impacted by habitat conversion. The species relies on mixed Ashe-juniper and oak woodlands for nest-building and shelter during spring and early summer months. Using land cover data spanning the last 25 years, we conduct a geospatial analysis to quantify changes and\ identify shifts in breeding habitat quantity and quality. Since 1985, 13% of all forests within the warbler’s breeding range were disturbed, with greater incidences near San Antonio (32%) and Austin (24%) metropolitan areas. Additionally, data show a 45% decrease in high-quality habitat (i.e., intact mixed or evergreen core forests) and a decrease in patch size. Habitats within protected areas see a less sharp decline in habitat quality and large increases in warbler sightings, but these only represent 10% of all highest-quality habitat in the breeding range. Drastic declines in habitat quality suggest that generalized metrics of conversion may underestimate true habitat loss as degradation may impact the ecological viability of remaining forests for warbler nesting. Further evidence suggests that the few protected areas within the Texas range continue to play a significant role in warbler breeding. This information will assist researchers and managers prioritizing conservation action and will inform upcoming species status determinations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Economic impacts from plant pests are often felt at the regional scale, yet some impacts expand to the global scale through the alignment of a pest’s invasion potentials. Such globally invasive species (i.e., paninvasives) are like the human pathogens that cause pandemics. Like pandemics, assessing paninvasion risk for an emerging regional pest is key for stakeholders to take early actions that avoid market disruption. Here, we develop the paninvasion severity assessment framework and use it to assess a rapidly spreading regional U.S. grape pest, the spotted lanternfly planthopper (Lycorma delicatula; SLF), to spread and disrupt the global wine market. We found that SLF invasion potentials are aligned globally because important viticultural regions with suitable environments for SLF establishment also heavily trade with invaded U.S. states. If the U.S. acts as an invasive bridgehead, Italy, France, Spain, and other important wine exporters are likely to experience the next SLF introductions. Risk to the global wine market is high unless stakeholders work to reduce SLF invasion potentials in the U.S. and globally.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - We analyzed a set of historical data from rapid vegetation inventories in a tropical montane cloud forest in northern Andean Ecuador. Trees in plots from several types of forest were counted and measured, including: (1) primary forest, including mature and recently closed-canopy sites and naturally formed gaps, (2) abandoned pasture, and (3) intensively-farmed sites. The goal of the study was to understand in a specific period of time the similarities and differences among natural and anthropogenic disturbances and their potential long term effect on the forest plant community. We found that mature and intermediate close canopy sites are similar. Also old forest is quite resilient to gap-forming disturbance. Natural gaps are quickly colonized by old-forest-associated plant species, and return to an old-forest-type community of trees in a short time. In contrast, forests regenerating from anthropogenic disturbance appear to have multiple possible states: some regenerating forest sites where the anthropogenic disturbance were low are coming to closely resemble old-forest-type communities, but some where the anthropogenic disturbance was intense appear to be changing in a very different direction, which does not resemble any other vegetation community type currently in the forest. A major predictor of present ecological state is the type of land use before reforestation: pastures can occasionally transition back to the pre-disturbance state of forest. More intensively used sites, many of which are abandoned sugar cane plantations, do not return to a pre-disturbance ecological state, instead forming a new and different kind of forest, dominated by a different community of trees. We examined tree-seedling communities to understand the trajectory of the forest into the future, and find that new forest types may be forming that do not resemble any existing associationsintensive agricultural sites. We also found that Los Cedros is extremely diverse in tree species. We estimate approximately 500 species of tree in only the small southeastern area of the reserve that has been explored scientifically. Additionally, the forest tree community shows extremely rapid distance decay (beta-diversity), approaching near complete turn-over in the limited spatial extent of the study. This suggests that hundreds of other tree species remain to be observed in the reserve, in addition to the 350+ that are directly observed in the present study, including new observations of species with IUCN threatened-endangered status. We also highlight the conservation value of Reserva Los Cedros, which has managed to reverse deforestation within its boundaries despite a general trend of extensive deforestation in the surrounding region, and to protect large, contiguous areas of highly-endangered Andean primary cloud forest habitat.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) is a European fresh and brackish water piscivorous fish, important as both a key predator and a valuable commercial and recreational fisheries species. There are concerns that some stocks are depleted due to overfishing and environmental changes. We review data collection and population assessments currently used for nine pikeperch stocks across six European countries and apply a unified assessment framework to evaluate population status and trends. For this we first standardised commercial, scientific, and recreational catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and catch time series and then applied Bayesian surplus production models. Our results showed that three stocks (including two in the Baltic Sea) were strongly depleted, with estimated biomasses considerably lower than the biomass at maximum sustainable yield (Bmsy). Other stocks were either close or higher than their estimated Bmsy. Looking at the trends, we find that four stocks (Lake Oulujärvi, Kvädöfjärden, Lake Peipsi and Lipno) showed increasing biomass trends and two (Curonian Lagoon, Galtfjärden) had a strong decline in biomass. In most cases the stocks with clear signs of recovery were also those for which strong management strategies have been implemented. We find that, despite pikeperch being one of the most valuable inland fisheries, formalised stock assessments and regular surveys remain rare. Importantly, although most stocks are strongly targeted by recreational fishing, estimates of recreational catch are highly uncertain. We conclude that data limited stock assessment methods are useful for assessing fish population status and highlight an urgent need to improve pikeperch scientific monitoring and assessment of recreational catches.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Global road networks continue to expand, and the wildlife responses to these landscape-level changes need to be understood to advise long-term management decisions. Roads have high mortality risk to snakes because snakes typically move slowly and can be intentionally targeted by drivers.We investigated how radio-tracked King Cobras (Ophiophagus hannah) traverse a major highway in northeast Thailand, and if reproductive cycles were associated with road hazards.We surveyed a 15.3km stretch of Highway 304 to determine if there were any locations where snakes, and other wildlife, could safely move across the road (e.g., culverts, bridges). We used recurse analysis to detect possible road-crossing events, and used subsets of King Cobra movement data to create dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models (dBBMM) in an attempt to show movement pathways association with possible unintentional crossing structures. We further used Integrated Step Selection Functions (ISSF) to assess seasonal differences in avoidance of major roads for adult King Cobras in relation to reproductive state.We discovered 32 unintentional wildlife crossing locations capable of facilitating King Cobra movement across the highway. Our dBBMMs failed to show if underpasses were being used by telemetered individuals; however, the tracking locations pre- and post-crossing provided strong evidence of underpass use. Our ISSF suggested a lower avoidance of roads during the breeding season, though the results were inconclusive. With the high volume of traffic, large size of King Cobras and a 98.8% success rate of crossing the road in our study, we strongly suspect that individuals are using the unintentional crossing structures to safely traverse the road.Further research is needed to determine the extent of wildlife underpass use at our study site and globally, alongside using previously proven fencing to facilitate their use. We propose that more consistent integration of drainage culverts and bridges could help mitigate the impacts of roads on some terrestrial wildlife, particularly in areas where roads fragment forests and wildlife corridors.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Intraspecific diversity is among the most important biological variables, although still poorly understood for most species. Iguana iguana is a Neotropical lizard known from Central and South America, including from numerous Caribbean islands. Despite the presence of native melanistic I. iguana populations in the Lesser Antilles, these have received surprisingly little research attention. Here we assessed population size, distribution, degree of melanism, and additional morphological and natural history characteristics for the melanistic iguanas of Saba, Caribbean Netherlands based on a one-month fieldwork visit. Using Distance sampling from a 38-transect dataset we estimate the population size at 8233 ±2205 iguanas. Iguanas mainly occurred on the southern and eastern sides of the island, between 180-390 m (max altitude 530 m), with highest densities both in residential and certain natural areas. Historically, iguanas were relatively more common at higher altitudes, probably due to more extensive forest clearing for agricultural reasons. No relationship was found between the degree of melanism and elevation, and few animals were completely melanistic. Furthermore, we found that body-ratio data collection through photographs is biased and requires physical measuring instead. Although the population size appears larger than previously surmised, the limited nesting sites and extremely low presence of juvenile and hatchling iguanas (2.4%), is similarly worrying as the situation for I. delicatissima on neighboring St. Eustatius. The island’s feral cat and large goat population are suspected to impact nest site quality, nest success, and hatchling survival. These aspects require urgent future research to guide necessary conservation management.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

TI  - GreenMaps: a Tool for Addressing the Wallacean Shortfall in the Global Distribution of Plants
AU  - Daru, Barnabas H.
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - The exponential growth of species occurrence data can facilitate dynamic biodiversity analyses. However, raw biodiversity data alone should not be used indiscriminately due to inherent sampling biases, impediments that contribute to Wallacean shortfall (i.e. the paucity of species’ geographic information). It has been suggested that Wallacean shortfall is a common phenomenon across taxa, however, there is no global assessment geared toward overcoming this impediment for plants, despite the fundamental role of plants in ecosystem stability, food security and biodiversity conservation. Here, I present GreenMaps, a new tool that will permit a rapid initial assessment of the Wallacean shortfall for plants by building base maps of species’ predicted distributions upon which citizen science participation could contribute to spatial validation of the actual range occupied by species. The initial stages of GreenMaps have now been accomplished, providing a massive dataset of modeled range maps for over 194,000 vascular plant species. This will make it the largest and only global assessment of geographic distributions for plant species at scales relevant to research and conservation. Ultimately, GreenMaps will interface with a mobile application to enable volunteers from any region of the world to validate predicted species distributions to be used for the generation of new and improved global map of plant distributions.

AB  - The current note hypothesised that human/tourism beach activities in Rommel Bay, Marsa Matrouh, Egypt (31°21’39.9”N 27°15’12.3”E) affected the marine invertebrates in this area. The note resulted some new findings of arthropod, molluscan, and seagrasses species diversity and distribution. The hypothesised study concluded that human/tourism beach activities did not eliminate the invertebrate communities, but these animals have shifted and moved themselves to escape away from noise and pollution. Further investigations should be taken into consideration about aquatic insects, mites, crustaceans, seagrasses, and molluscans diversity and distribution, to figure out the actual structures and interactions between these animals within the Rommel Bay ecosystem, besides what are the stresses they have, and what are the consequences.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - We conducted research to understand online trade in jaguar parts and develop tools of utility for jaguars and other species. Our research took place to identify potential trade across 31 online platforms in Spanish, Portuguese, English, Dutch, French, Chinese, and Vietnamese. We identified 230 posts from between 2009 and 2019. We screened the images of animal parts shown in search results to verify if from jaguar; 71 posts on 12 different platforms in four languages were accompanied by images identified as definitely jaguar, including a total of 125 jaguar parts (50.7% posts in Spanish, 25.4% Portuguese, 22.5% Chinese and 1.4% French). Search effort varied among languages due to staff availability. Standardizing for effort across languages by dividing number of posts advertising jaguars by search time and number individual searches completed via term/platform combinations, the adjusted rankings of posts were: Portuguese #1, Chinese 2 (time) &amp; 3 (searches), Spanish 3 &amp; 4; French 5 &amp; 4; English 5 &amp; 2, and Dutch 6. Teeth were most common; 156 posts offered at least 367 apparent teeth. From these, 95 teeth were assessed as definitely jaguar; 71 jaguar teeth could be linked to a location, with the majority of the 71 offered for sale from Mexico, China, Bolivia, and Brazil (26.8, 25.4, 16.9, and 12.7% respectively). Ranking of number of teeth was Mexico (19), China (18), Bolivia (12), Brazil (9), Peru/Ecuador (most accurate probable location) (8), Venezuela (3), Guadeloupe (1), and Uruguay (1). The second most traded item, skins and derivative items were only identified from Latin America: Brazil (7), was followed by Peru (6), Bolivia (3), Mexico (2 and 1 skin piece), and Nicaragua and Venezuela (1 each). Whether by number of posts or pieces, the ranking of parts was teeth, skins/pieces of skins, heads, and bodies. Our research presents a snapshot of online jaguar trade and methods that may have utility for many species now traded online. Our research took place within a longer-term project to assist law enforcement in host countries to better identify potential illegal trade online, with research findings informing hubs in Latin America for building such capacity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Yellow-legged gull, Larus michahellis, has undergone widespread colonization of the urban environment in recent past. Starting in 2000 this affected the historical centre of Venice, 24 roof-nesting pairs being recorded in 2005, with this number increasing significantly in the last decade. In 2016, the waste management company of Venice established a new door to door garbage collection system to prevent the accumulation of rubbish in the streets and limit the trophic resources available for the species. The study provides an up-to-date estimate of the urban population of yellow-legged gulls, using Distance Sampling method. We also studied the effect of the new system on the species by comparing the population estimate before and after the change and by analysing the trend of individuals collected in the old town by the service of wildlife recovery during 2010-2018. Results estimate 440 breeding pairs (95s% confidence interval: 326-593) in June 2018 and show a 34% decrease of breeding pairs in 2018 with respect to 2017, as well as a decrease in number of 1-year birds and pulli collected by wildlife recovery service starting from 2016, year of the policy implementation. Our data did not show a significant decrease in the overall number of individuals, suggesting the new policy has a stronger effect on the breeding success of the species than on adult survival. This study emphasizes the importance of preventing rubbish accumulation in the streets as factor for reducing the abundance of urban yellow-legged gulls.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Understanding the phylogeographic history of a group and identifying the factors contributing to speciation is an important challenge in evolutionary biology. Vicariance has clearly played a major role in diversification across diverse groups of organisms, but how this interacts with intrinsic biological features such as changes in reproductive system or sexual selection is less well understood. The Goodeinae are a Mexican endemic group of live-bearing fish. Here, we develop genomic resources for species within the Goodeinae and use phylogenomic approaches to characterise their evolutionary history. We sequenced, assembled and annotated the genomes of four new Goodeinae genomes, including A. toweri, the only matrotrophic live-bearing fish without a trophotaenia in the group. We produced a phylogeny of the Goodeinae and estimate timings of species divergence. We determined the extent and timing of introgression between the species to assess if this may have occurred during an early radiation, or in more recent episodes of secondary contact. We also analyse patterns in the changes of effective population size for the species and examine the time course of expansion and decline. We used branch-site models to detect genome-wide positive selection across Goodeinae, and we specifically ask if this differs in A. toweri, where reversal of placental viviparity has recently occurred. We find that Goodeinae diverged rapidly, with reductions in effective population size after each split. Contrary to expectations, we find evidence of gene flow between geographically isolated species, suggesting vicariant speciation was supplemented by limited post-speciation gene flow, potentially as a result of river piracy. Genes under positive selection in the group are likely to be associated with the switch to live-bearing. Overall, our studies suggest that both volcanism driven vicariance and changes in reproductive mode influenced radiation in the Goodeinae.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Large carnivores strongly shape ecological interactions within their respective ecosystems, but experience significant conflicts with human across their range due to their specific ecological resource requirements. The tiger (Panthera tigris) typifies the challenges faced by the large carnivore communities globally. India retains majority of the global tiger population with significant numbers outside protected areas (PAs) that are involved in conflicts from livestock predation and human/tiger death. To understand the prey selection patterns and spatio-temporal patterns of livestock predation-related conflict issues we investigated tiger food habits across the Indian part of the Terai-Arc Landscape (TAL), a globally-important tiger conservation landscape in India. We used 510 genetically-confirmed tiger faeces collected across the landscape and ascertained 10 wild and livestock as major prey species. Large-bodied species (sambar, swamp deer, nilgai, chital, wild pig and livestock) comprised ~94% of tiger diet, with sambar, chital and livestock were the major prey species. Habitat-specific (Shivalik-Bhabar and Terai) analyses show significantly different pattern of prey selections determined by abundance and prey body weight. Results also suggest that PA and non-PAs of Terai habitat are more prone to livestock depredation-related conflicts, and careful management interventions and community involvements are required to reduce such threats. We suggest long-term plans including population estimation of tigers and prey outside PAs, reducing grazing pressures and cattle enumeration, detailed investigation of tiger deaths etc. to ensure future tiger sustainability across this habitat.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Madagascar’s biota has suffered recent extinctions and many of its unique species are threatened. However, the severity of recent and potential extinctions in a global evolutionary context is unquantified. We compiled a phylogenetic dataset for the complete non-marine mammalian biota of Madagascar and estimated natural rates of extinction, colonization, and speciation. We measured how long it would take to restore Madagascar’s mammalian biodiversity under these rates, the “evolutionary return time” (ERT). We show the loss of currently threatened Malagasy mammal species would have a much deeper long-term impact than all the extinctions since human arrival to the island. A return from current to pre-human diversity would take 1.6 million years (Myr) for bats, and 2.9 Myr for non-volant mammals. However, if species currently classified as threatened go extinct, the ERT rises to 2.9 Myr for bats and 23 Myr for non-volant mammals. The evolutionary history currently under threat on Madagascar is much greater than on other islands, suggesting an extinction wave with deep evolutionary impact is imminent unless immediate conservation actions are taken.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - In this study, we examined the richness and diversity of diurnal raptors along with their foraging guilds across different land uses in a sub-tropical landscape during December 2016 to November 2018. A total of 80 vantage points, 19 line transects and 36 road transects were sampled in 33 sites in six different habitat types in the study area where we recorded 3409 individuals of 29 diurnal raptors in 2 orders and 3 families. Significant variation in bird abundance was observed among different habitat types, farmlands being more specious followed by pure forests, water bodies and forest-farmland interfaces. Among the seasons, summers recorded higher abundance followed by winter, monsoon and post-monsoon. A low diversity value (H′=2.22) however was observed for the whole study area with mean monthly highest recorded during February (H′=2.44) and least during June (H′=1.85). Most of the raptors observed for their food types and foraging were predators (n=22) and rest were carrion feeders (n=22). Fourteen among all observed diurnal raptors were winter visitors and 13 residents with 9 reported globally threatened. A moderately high richness of diurnal raptors substantiate high conservation value of these habitats especially the forest patches and farmlands and thus calls for effective management strategies for the conservation and proliferation of raptors in sub-tropical areas of Jammu region.

TI  - Inconsistent effects of urbanization on amphibian genetic diversity
AU  - Schmidt, Chloé

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are leading causes of vertebrate population declines. These declines are thought to be partly due to decreased connectivity and habitat loss reducing population sizes in human transformed habitats. With time this can lead to reduced effective population size and genetic diversity which restricts the ability of wildlife to cope with environmental change through genetic adaptation. However, it is not well understood whether these effects are generally applicable across taxa. Here, we repurposed and synthesized raw microsatellite data from online repositories from 19 amphibian species sampled at 554 sites in North America. For each site, we estimated gene diversity, allelic richness, effective population size, and population differentiation. Using binary urban-rural census designations, and continuous measures of human population density and the Human Footprint Index, we tested for generalizable effects of human land use on amphibian genetic diversity. We found no consistent relationships for any of our genetic metrics. While we did not detect directional effects for most species, a few generalist species responded positively to urbanization. These results contrast with consistent negative effects of urbanization in mammals and species specific positive and negative effects in birds. In the context of widespread amphibian declines, our results suggest that habitat loss in human transformed habitats is a more immediate concern than declining genetic diversity in populations that persist.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - The Broad-winged Hawk (BWHA, Buteo platypterus) is a small, secretive hawk with distinguishing broad black tail bands that breeds in northeastern North America. The hawk nests in deciduous or mixed forest, often near water, and close to clearings or forest edges. Land conversion and fragmentation alters the landscape and reduces the area of contiguous forest used by BWHA. This study seeks to determine the landscape characteristics influencing the apparent breeding range declines of the BWHA at the landscape scale. Landscape characteristics and BWHA presence data from 18,684 Breeding Bird Atlas blocks (each about 25km2) from Ohio, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New York for two atlas period (1st Atlas: 1980s, 2nd Atlas: 2000s) were analyzed. Bayesian latent Gaussian models were fitted using INLA to determine best fit model for predicting the landscape characteristics associated with BWHA presence. The best models included landscape changes in land cover, including forest, water, urban, barren, farmland, and wetland and fragmentation of the landscape. Trends in loss were especially prevalent around the region’s largest cities: New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington DC. Loss of BWHA at the block-level was associated with areas with less forest in the 2000s, a decline in size of largest forest patches, lower elevations and lower latitudes. We suggest that both habitat loss and climate change may be contributing to the range contraction of the Broad-winged Hawk in the northeast United States.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Urbanisation is currently increasing worldwide, and there is now ample evidence of phenotypic changes in wild organisms in response to this novel environment, but the extent to which this adaptation is due to genetic changes is poorly understood. Current evidence for evolution is based on localised studies, and thus lacking replicability. Here, we genotyped great tits (Parus major) from nine cities across Europe, each paired with a rural site, and provide evidence of repeated polygenic responses to urban habitats. In addition, we show that selective sweeps occurred in response to urbanisation within the same genes across multiple cities. These genetic responses were mostly associated with genes related to neural function and development, demonstrating that genetic adaptation to urbanisation occurred around the same pathways in wildlife populations across a large geographical scale.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Climate change inevitably leaves behind a genetic footprint within phylogeographic legacies of affected species, as individuals are driven to either disperse to track suitable conditions or adapt in situ. One potential consequence is the possibility of hybridization among species, as both geographic ranges and adaptive landscapes shift. The admixture resulting from these newly formed ‘contact zones’ has various outcomes, to include the creation of new lineages. Interpreting these within the context of historic climate change provides clues necessary to predict biotic responses (and thus evolutionary trajectories) as a function of contemporary shifts. Herein, we dissect historic contact zones for Massasaugas (Viperidae; Sistrurus spp.) within two distinct North American regions (southwestern United States and Central Great Plains) using ddRAD sequencing. We identified fine-scale but previously unrecognized population structure within the southwestern contact zone, where we detected contemporary intergradation between Prairie and Desert massasaugas (S. tergeminus tergeminus, and S. t. edwardsii, respectively), with primary divergence indicated by demographic model selection. Within the Central Great Plains, we found evidence for historic secondary contact via Quaternary climatic cycles, subsequently followed by range expansion at the suture zone separating S. tergeminus and S. catenatus. Extant Missouri populations represent ancestral/relictual vestiges of this earlier hybridization, isolated between the eastern terminus of S. t. tergeminus and the western edge of S. catenatus. Our results illustrate how abrupt climate change has driven ancestral hybridization, cryptic diversity, and range dynamism within Sistrurus.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Currents are unique drivers of oceanic phylogeography and so determine the distribution of marine coastal species, along with past glaciations and sea level changes. Here, we reconstruct the worldwide colonization history of eelgrass (Zostera marina L.), the most widely distributed marine flowering plant or seagrass from its origin in the Northwest Pacific, based on nuclear and chloroplast genomes. We identified two divergent Pacific clades with evidence for admixture along the East Pacific coast. Multiple west to east (trans-Pacific) colonization events support the key role of the North Pacific Current. Time-calibrated nuclear and chloroplast phylogenies yielded concordant estimates of the arrival of Z. marina in the Atlantic through the Canadian Arctic, suggesting that eelgrass-based ecosystems, hotspots of biodiversity and carbon sequestration, have only been present since ∼208 Kya (thousand years ago). Mediterranean populations were founded ∼53 Kya while extant distributions along western and eastern Atlantic shores coincide with the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (∼20 Kya).

AB  - Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is the most widely distributed tick-borne viral disease in humans. The virus is widely expanded across western China, South Asia, and the Middle East to southeastern Europe and Africa. Its causative agent, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), is among the deadliest human pathogens in Africa and Eurasia. The historical known distribution of the CCHFV vector Hyalomma marginatum in Europe included most of the Mediterranean and the Balkan countries, Ukraine, and southern Russia. Further expansion of its potential distribution is possibly occurred in and out of the Mediterranean region. This study updated the map of the principal vector of CCHFV, H. marginatum, in the Old World. The model estimated the environmental suitability of H. marginatum in the Old World, including Europe. On the continental European scale, the model anticipated a widespread potential distribution, covering southern, western, central, and eastern Europe, as far north as southern parts of Scandinavian countries. The distribution of H. marginatum also covered the countries across the central part of Europe where the species is not autochthonous. All models were statistically robust and performed better than random (p &lt; 0.001). Based on the results of the model, climatic conditions could hamper the successful overwintering of H. marginatum and their survival as adults in many areas of the region. Regular updates of the models, using updated occurrence, current, and future climatic data are recommended to regularly assess the areas at risk.Summary Hyalomma marginatum is a vector of numerous highly important human and animal pathogens. It is the main vector of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) in Europe. This study updated the potential distribution of H. marginatum on a global scale, including Europe, with a particular focus on Central Europe. The model predicted a widespread potential distribution of H. marginatum on the continental European scale, anticipating occurrences of H. marginatum in southern, western, central, and eastern Europe, as far north as southern parts of Scandinavian countries. In Central Europe, H. marginatum populations have not been established in any of the countries yet, but the presence of the species has been reported from all countries in the region. Their potential spread northwards and establishment of permanent populations of H. marginatum in the north are therefore of great importance, in particular since the immature stages of H. marginatum are frequently found on migratory birds flying northwards to temperate Europe. Our ecological niche model of H. marginatum in Central Europe anticipated its distribution in all countries of the region. Our prediction for current global potential distribution of this tick species can help in understanding disease risk areas associated with this vector.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Data from wildlife rehabilitation centres can provide on-the-ground records of causes of raptor morbidity and mortality, allowing threat patterns to be explored throughout time and space. We provide an overview of native raptor admissions to four wildlife rehabilitation centres (WRCs) in England and Wales, quantifying the main causes of morbidity and mortality, trends over time and whether certain causes were more common in more urbanised areas between 2001-2019. Throughout the study period 14 raptor species were admitted totalling 3305 admission records. The Common Buzzard (Buteo buteo; 31%) and Tawny Owl (Strix aluco; 29%) were most numerous. Relative to the proportion of breeding individuals in Britain &amp; Ireland, Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus), Little Owls (Athene noctua) and Western Barn Owls (Tyto alba) were over-represented in the admissions data by 103%, 73% and 69%, respectively. Contrastingly Northern Long-eared Owls (Asio otus), Western Marsh Harriers (Circus aeruginosus) and Merlin (Falco columbarius) were under-represented by 187%, 163% and 126%, respectively. Across all species, vehicle collisions were the most frequent anthropogenic admission cause (22%) and orphaned young birds (10%) were most frequent natural admission cause. Mortality rate was highest for infection/parasite admissions (90%), whereas orphaned birds experienced lowest mortality rates (16%). For one WRC, there was a notable decline in admissions over the study period. Red Kite (Milvus milvus) admissions increased over time, whereas Common Buzzard and Common Kestrel admissions declined. There were significant declines in the relative proportion of persecution and metabolic admissions, and an increase in orphaned young birds. Urban areas were positively associated with persecution, building collisions and unknown trauma admissions, whereas vehicle collisions were associated with more rural areas. Many threats persist for raptors in England and Wales, however, have not changed substantially over the past two decades. Threats associated with urban areas, such as building collisions, may increase over time in line with human population growth and subsequent urban expansion.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Effective conservation planning often requires difficult decisions when at-risk species inhabit economically valuable landscapes or if the needs of multiple threatened species do not align. In the agriculture-dominated landscape of eastern Ontario and southwestern Quebec, Canada, conflicting habitat requirements exist between threatened grassland birds benefiting from certain agriculture practices and those of a diverse woodland bird community dependent on forest recovery. Using multi-scale species distribution models with Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data, we assessed habitat suitability for 8 threatened grassland and forest specialists within this region. We also identified landscapes that jointly maximize occurrence of the 8 focal species and diversity of the overall grassland and forest communities. Influential habitat associations differed among species at the territory (200m radius) and landscape level (1km), highlighting the importance of considering multiple spatial scales. Species diversity was maximized when forest or grassland/pasture cover approached 40–50%, indicating a positive response to land cover heterogeneity. We identified species diversity hotspots near Lake Huron, as well as along the shore and southeast of the St. Lawrence River. These areas represent mosaic landscapes, balancing forest patches, wetland, grassland/pasture, and row crops such as corn, soybean, and cereals. Despite drastic landscape changes associated with agroecosystems, we demonstrate that targeted habitat protection and enhancement that prioritizes land cover diversity can maximize protection of bird communities with directly contrasting needs. We highlight multiple pathways to achieve this balance, including forest retention or separating row crops with hedgerows and wooded fence-lines, improving flexibility in conservation approaches.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Background Water flow is one of several factors that determine the habitats of aquatic insects. The conversions of stagnant (lentic) and running (lotic) water are physiologically and ecologically constrained. In general, aquatic insect species only occur in one of these environments. Though Eubrianax ramicornis (Coleoptera: Psephenidae) usually resides in rivers, however, it is also known to occur near the shores of Lake Biwa in Japan. Here, we investigated the genetic differences between the two Eubrianax species of Lake Biwa and its inflowing rivers, and other regions of Japan for the first time. Lake Biwa is an ancient lake and about four million years old. Though over 60 endemic species were described from Lake Biwa, they are mostly fish and molluscs, with only two species of aquatic insects. There are few reports of endemic aquatic insects in other ancient lakes, too. Discussion of the endemism of Eubrianax and its promoting factors is expected to provide insights into the evolution of aquatic insects in ancient lakes.Methods We surveyed and morphologically identified psephenid larvae in Lake Biwa and its inflowing rivers during the summers of 2017 and 2018 (Hayashi, 2009: Hayashi &amp; Sota, 2009). We conducted phylogenetic analyses of two regions of COI and estimated the ages of population divergence based on fossil records of Eubrianax beetles in Lake Biwa as well as those of previously reported populations in other regions. We also analyzed two COI regions of the E. ramicornis haplotypes in Lake Biwa.Results Four psephenid species were identified among the samples collected in Lake Biwa and its inflowing rivers. Of these, E. ramicornis was collected only at the Lake Biwa shore whereas its congeneric E. granicollis was collected only from the rivers inflowing the lake. The phylogenetic analyses showed that E. ramicornis of Lake Biwa were clearly differentiated from those in previously reported regions and this divergence was estimated to have occurred 1.40 MYA. At that time, there was no lake at the location of present-day Lake Biwa. It is thought that rivers and their dammed flood plains to the east, with gravel and sand supplied by the rising Suzuka Mountains further to the east. Such an environments is preferable for E. ramicornis and they were thought to have become isolated from the surrounding rivers during the formation of Lake Biwa. On the contrary, there was no genetic differentiation between the E. granicollis population at the Lake Biwa inflow rivers and those elsewhere. Hence, E. granicollis might have migrated to the Lake Biwa watershed later than E. ramicornis and maintained gene flow over a wide area. The genetic differentiation of E. ramicornis reported here for the first time suggests that a species with a wide distribution may rather be evolving endemic to Lake Biwa. Reports on the endemism of aquatic insects in ancient lakes are scarce. This study is expected to bring new perspectives to the study of insect evolution in ancient lakes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Biodiversity is in decline due to human land use, exploitation, and climate change. To be able to counteract this alarming trend it is paramount to closely monitor biodiversity at global scales. Because this is practically impossible with traditional methods, the last decade has seen a strong push for solutions. In aquatic ecosystems the monitoring of species from environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as one of the most powerful tools at our disposal but in terrestrial ecosystems the power of eDNA for monitoring has so far been hampered by the local scale of the samples. In this study we report the first attempt to detect insects from airborne eDNA. We compare our results to two traditional insect monitoring projects (1) using light trapping for moth monitoring and (2) transect counts for the monitoring of butterflies and wild bees. While we failed to detect many of the same species monitored with the traditional methods, airborne eDNA metabarcoding revealed DNA from from six classes of Arthropods, and twelve order of Insects - including representatives from all of the four largest orders: Diptera (flies), Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Coleoptera (beetles) and Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and ants). We also recovered DNA from nine species of vertebrates, including frogs, birds and mammals as well as from 12 other phyla. We suggest that airborne eDNA has the potential to become a powerful tool for terrestrial biodiversity monitoring, with many impactful applications including the monitoring of pests, invasive or endangered species or disease vectors.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Over a million species face extinction, carrying with them untold options for food, medicine, fibre, shelter, ecological resilience, aesthetic and cultural values. There is therefore an urgent need to design conservation policies that maximise the protection of biodiversity and its contributions to people, within the constraints of limited budgets. Here we present a novel framework for spatial conservation prioritisation that combines simulation models, reinforcement learning and ground validation to identify optimal policies. Our methodology, CAPTAIN (Conservation Area Prioritisation Through Artificial Intelligence Networks), quantifies the trade-off between the costs and benefits of area and biodiversity protection, allowing the exploration of multiple biodiversity metrics. Under a fixed budget, our model protects substantially more species from extinction than the random or naively targeted protection of areas. CAPTAIN also outperforms the most widely used software for spatial conservation prioritisation (Marxan) in 97% of cases and reduces species loss by an average of 40% under simulations, besides yielding prioritisation maps at substantially higher spatial resolution using empirical data. We find that regular biodiversity monitoring, even if simple and with a degree of inaccuracy – characteristic of citizen science surveys – substantially improves biodiversity outcomes. Given the complexity of people–nature interactions and wealth of associated data, artificial intelligence holds great promise for improving the conservation of biological and ecosystem values in a rapidly changing and resource-limited world.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The contribution of urban greenspaces to support biodiversity and provide benefits for people is increasingly recognised. However, ongoing management practices still favour (1) vegetation oversimplification, often limiting greenspaces to lawns and tree canopy rather than multi-layered vegetation that includes under and midstorey; and (2) the use of nonnative plant species. These practices likely hinder the potential of greenspaces to sustain indigenous biodiversity, particularly for taxa like insects, that rely on plants for food and habitat. Yet, little is known about which plant species may maximise positive outcomes for taxonomically and functionally diverse insect communities in urban greenspaces. Additionally, while urban environments are expected to experience high rates of introductions, quantitative assessments of the relative occupancy of indigenous vs. introduced insect species in greenspace are rare – hindering understanding of how greenspace management may promote indigenous biodiversity while limiting the establishment of introduced insects. Using a hierarchically replicated study design across 15 public parks, we recorded occurrence data from 552 insect species on 133 plant species – differing in planting design element (lawn, midstorey and tree canopy), midstorey growth form (forbs, lilioids, graminoids and shrubs) and origin (nonnative, native and indigenous) – to assess: (1) the relative contributions of indigenous and introduced insect species and (2) which plant species sustained the highest number of indigenous insects. Our data indicates that the insect community was predominately composed of indigenous rather than introduced species. Our findings further highlight the core role of multi-layered vegetation in sustaining high insect biodiversity in urban areas, with indigenous midstorey and canopy representing key elements to maintain rich and functionally diverse indigenous insect communities. Intriguingly, graminoids supported the highest indigenous insect richness across all studied growth forms by plant origin groups. Taken together, our study emphasise the opportunity posed by indigenous understory and midstorey plants, particularly indigenous graminoids in our study area, to promote indigenous insect biodiversity in urban greenspaces. Our work provides a blueprint and stimulus for built-environment professionals to incorporate into their practice plant species palettes that foster a larger presence of indigenous over regionally native or nonnative plant species, whilst incorporating a broader mixture of midstorey growth forms.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - A significant gap in understanding the response of biodiversity to urban areas is the lack of long-term studies. Most of the information on urban birds comes from studies carried out in the northern hemisphere, and they include data that don’t exceed three years. Although short-term studies contribute to knowledge about bird community diversity and their spatial distribution in urban areas, they could be biased towards more conspicuous and abundant species. One of the few multi-temporal datasets available for birds in urban areas is the Christmas Bird Count (CBC). Using annual CBC data available between 2001 and 2018 from 21 urban and peri-urban sample sites assessed from the main cities of Colombia, we identified and analyzed long-term trends on the cumulative diversity of bird communities as well as on their spatial distribution. We estimated comparative trends in richness, abundance, similarity, and complementarity of avifauna for each city and sample site based on their responses to urbanization and dietary guilds. We identified almost a quarter of the species registered in Colombia (464 of 1954). The representativeness of the community obtained during 18 years exceeds 84%, showing richness that ranges between 214 and 278 species in the three cities. Bird species and individuals registered showed wide variation of the sample sites. We found more dwellers, insectivorous and granivorous species in urban areas, with frugivores relegated to peri-urban sites, usually coinciding with avoider species. Natural peri-urban areas and intra-urban wetlands and urban parks were the most important refuges for birds and maintained the highest avoider and utilizer species richness. Long-term inventories are fundamental for determining consolidated bird diversity and distributional patterns. This information established a baseline for decision-making and applying recommendations that allow reconciling the growing demand for urban areas with the need to preserve the native avifauna in megadiverse Neotropical countries such as Colombia.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The growth of complex populations, such as microbial communities, forests, and cities, occurs over vastly different spatial and temporal scales. Although research in different fields has developed detailed, system-specific models to understand each individual system, a unified analysis of different complex populations is lacking; such an analysis could deepen our understanding of each system and facilitate cross-pollination of tools and insights across fields. Here, we analyze time-series data of the human gut microbiome, tropical forest, and urban employment using a shared framework. We demonstrate that a single, three-parameter model of stochastic population dynamics can reproduce the empirical distributions of population abundances and fluctuations in all three data sets. The three parameters characterizing a species measure its mean abundance, deterministic stability, and stochasticity. Our analysis reveals that, despite the vast differences in scale, all three systems occupy a similar region of parameter space when time is measured in generations. In other words, although the fluctuations observed in these systems may appear different, this difference is primarily due to the different observation periods for each system. Further, we show that the distribution of temporal abundance fluctuations is described by just two parameters and derive a two-parameter functional form for abundance fluctuations to improve risk estimation and forecasting.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The homogenous nature of the urban environment rapidly alters community dynamics of extant flora and fauna due to short-term spatial and temporal factors. However, such impacts of urbanization are mostly investigated in terms of taxonomic diversity, while its impact on functional diversity remains poorly understood. Whereas taxonomic information is limited to the identity of species, functional traits determine the relationship between species identity and ecosystem functioning. Studies investigating the role of urbanization in altering these ecological parameters have mostly focused on avian communities or plant species, while arthropods such as spiders which are integral components of urban households have largely been overlooked. This study aims to understand the impact of urbanization on both taxonomic diversity and functional diversity of spider assemblages across an urban–semi-urban–forest gradient in Guwahati, a rapidly growing city in northeast India. We surveyed spiders at 13 sites representing four habitat types (urban, urban parks, semi-urban, and forests) using belt transects, and also recorded functional traits relating to key life history processes. Spider species composition differed significantly between various habitats. The taxonomic diversity of spiders was highest in forests and lowest in urban parks. The turnover component was the major contributor to changing the β-diversity of spiders. Reduced diversity in urban regions was likely due to the dominance of a few synanthropic species. Generalised linear mixed-effects model analysis indicated that the habitat types significantly impacted spider abundance. Functional richness was maximum in forests (Fric = 23.43) and minimum in urban habitats (Fric = 12.98), while functional divergence was maximum in urban sites (Fdiv = 0.79). Our study demonstrates that urban land-use change can alter the structure and functioning of the spider community.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The challenges to which plants are exposed in urban environments represent, in miniature, the challenges plants face as a result of global environmental change. Hence, urban habitats provide a unique opportunity to assess whether processes of local adaptation are taking place despite the short temporal and geographical scales that characterize the anthropoceneWe quantified the ecological diversity of spontaneously occurring urban habitat patches of A. thaliana. Using plant community indicators, we show that these patches differ in their levels of soil nutrient content and disturbance. Accordingly, plants in each patch displayed significantly different flowering time, size, and fitness.Using a deep sampling approach coupled with reduced genome-sequencing, we demonstrate that most individuals can be assigned to a limited set of clonal lineages; the genetic diversity of these lineages represents the diversity observed in western European populations of the species, indicating that established urban populations originate from a broad regional pool of lineages.We assessed the genetic and phenotypic diversity of these lineages in a set of common garden experiments. We report marked genetic differences in life-history traits, including time of primary and secondary dormancy as well as of flowering. These genetic differences in life-history traits are not randomly distributed but sorted out by ecological differences among sites of origin.Synthesis: Our study shows that the genetically diverse phenology of a regional A. thaliana gene pool is not randomly distributed but filtered by urban environmental heterogeneity. This report is the first to show a pattern of local genetic adaptation within urban environments. We conclude that environmental filtering helps maintain functional diversity within species.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Eight percent of all land surface has been designated as “Key Biodiversity Areas” (KBAs). Since these areas were established based on only two percent of all terrestrial species estimated to exist, we ask what would happen if we used all species on Earth to identify additional KBAs. We explore this question at a global scale by using data from 64,110 species of animals and plants to identify how many areas could qualify as KBAs under current criteria. We find that between 26% and 68% of the world’s terrestrial areas can be classified as KBAs, depending on the spatial resolution. The total area from potential KBAs increases drastically as more species are assessed, suggesting that if all species were included, virtually all land surface could eventually meet the biological requirements for becoming a KBA. In addition, KBAs lack a data-driven ranking system, thus assuming that all KBAs are equally worthy protection. KBAs are intended to be areas which are both of biological importance and manageable but the current approach largely sidesteps the biological component. We make an urgent call for stricter criteria in the KBA methodology or alternative methodologies that allow for biologically robust area prioritization, help secure evidence-based investments, and support progress towards the targets under the new Global Biodiversity Framework.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation and human well-being are tightly interlinked; yet mismatches in the scale at which both priorities are planned and implemented have exacerbated biodiversity loss, erosion of ecosystem services, and declining human quality of life. India houses the second largest human population on the planet, while &lt;5% of the country’s land area is effectively protected for conservation. This warrants landscape-level conservation planning through a judicious mix of land-sharing and land-sparing approaches, and co-production of ecosystem services. Through a multi-faceted assessment, we prioritize spatial extents of land parcels that, in the face of anthropogenic threats, can safeguard conservation landscapes across India’s biogeographic zones. We find that only a fraction (~15%) of such priority areas identified here are encompassed under India’s extant PA network, and several landscapes of high importance were omitted in all previous global-scale assessments. We then examined the spatial congruence of priority areas with administrative units earmarked for economic development by the Indian government, and propose management-zoning through state-driven and participatory approaches. Our spatially explicit insights can help meet the twin goals of biodiversity conservation and sustainable development in India and other countries across the Global South.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - As human density increases, biodiversity must increasingly co-exist with urbanization or face local extinction. Tolerance of urban areas has been linked to numerous functional traits, yet few globally-consistent patterns have emerged to explain variation in urban tolerance, which stymies attempts at a generalizable predictive framework. Here, we calculate an Urban Association Index (UAI) for 3768 bird species in 137 cities across all permanently inhabited continents. We then assess how UAI varies as a function of ten species-specific traits and further test whether the strength of trait relationships vary as a function of three city-specific variables. Of the ten species traits, nine were significantly associated with urban tolerance. Urban-associated species tend to be smaller, less territorial, have greater dispersal ability, broader dietary and habitat niches, larger clutch sizes, greater longevity, and have lower elevational limits. Only bill shape showed no global association with urban tolerance. Additionally, the strength of several trait relationships varied across cities as a function of latitude and/or human population density. For example, the effects of body mass and diet breadth are more pronounced at higher latitudes, while the effects of territoriality and longevity were reduced in cities with higher population density. Thus, the importance of trait filters in birds varies predictably across cities, indicating biogeographic variation in selection for urban tolerance that could explain prior challenges in the search for global patterns. A globally-informed framework that predicts urban tolerance will be integral to conservation as increasing proportions of the world’s biodiversity are impacted by urbanization.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Anthropogenic habitat destruction and climate change are altering the geographic distributions of plant communities. Although mapping vegetation changes is now possible at high resolution using remote sensing data and deep convolutional neural networks, these approaches have not been applied to model the distributions of thousands of plant species to understand spatial changes in biodiversity. To address the current lack of scalable and automatic tools to map plant species distributions at a fine-grained scale, we created a dataset of over half a million citizen science observations of 2,221 plant species across California paired with satellite images at 1 meter resolution from solely free and public sources. With this we trained a deep convolutional neural network, deepbiosphere, that predicts presences of plant species within 256 × 256 meter satellite images and outperforms common low-resolution species distribution models. We showcase the novelty and potential applications of this framework by visualizing high-resolution predictions of keystone species such as coastal redwoods, identifying spatio-temporal ecosystem changes from wildfires and restoration management, and detecting urban biodiversity hotspots. Deep neural networks continuously trained on public remote sensing imagery and citizen science observations could enable cheap, automatic, and scalable monitoring of biodiversity and detect rapid anthropogenic impacts on ecosystems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Urbanisation is a growing phenomenon causing the decline of wild bees globally. Yet, bees manage to persist in the urban matrix thanks to islands of vegetation in public parks and private gardens. While we begin to comprehend the impact of urbanisation on bees’ diversity and abundance, our understanding of its impact on the functional diversity of wild bees is limited. Here, we use an integrative approach to investigate the response of wild bees to urbanisation at the community, species, and individual levels. To do so, we sampled wild bees in 24 public parks along an urbanisation gradient in the Mediterranean city of Marseille. We found that species richness and abundance decreased in more urbanised areas, but increased in larger city parks. Moreover, larger individuals within species, but not larger species, were found in larger city parks, suggesting that park size is crucial for the persistence of bees in cities. Interestingly, we show that brighter species were found in parks surrounded by a large amount of impervious surface, highlighting the importance of colour traits in the response to environmental changes. Finally, our results revealed that larger species, but not larger individuals, were also more colourful. In summary, our study not only confirmed that urbanisation negatively impacts community-level traits, but that it also affects species’ coloration and individuals’ body size, thus improving our understanding of the functional response of wild bees to urbanisation. We suggest that increasing park size may compensate for the negative effects of urbanisation on wild bees.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Urban ecosystems are associated with socio-ecological conditions that can filter and promote taxa. However, the strength of the effect of ecological filtering on biodiversity could vary among biotic and abiotic factors. Here, we investigate the effects of habitat amount, temperature, and host-enemy biotic interactions in shaping communities of cavity-nesting bees and wasps (CNBW) and their natural enemies.We installed trap-nests in 80 sites distributed along urban intensity gradients in 5 European cities (Antwerp, Paris, Poznan, Tartu and Zurich). We quantified the species richness and abundance of CNBW hosts and their natural enemies, as well as two performance traits (survival and parasitism) and two life-history traits (sex ratio and number of offspring per nest for the hosts). We analysed the importance of the abiotic and biotic variables using generalized linear models and multi-model inference.We found that habitat amount and temperature were the main drivers of CNBW host responses, with larger habitat amounts resulting in higher species richness and abundance, and a larger total number of brood cells per nest for both bees and wasps, as well as a larger probability of survival for bees. Conversely, higher local temperatures decreased species richness, abundance, survival rate, number of brood cells per nest, and proportion of females in CNBW hosts.Biotic interactions with natural enemies shaped wasp species richness, with higher levels of parasitism resulting in more wasp species. Similarly, our results showed direct density-dependence between CNBW hosts and their natural enemies.Overall, our study highlights the importance of habitat amount and temperature in shaping urban food webs, through direct effects on hosts responses and the subsequent consequences for their natural enemies. As cities prepare to tackle the future consequences of global change, strategies that make it possible to maintain available habitat and mitigate urban overheating emerge as a key urban adaptation for biodiversity conservation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Sustainable cities depend on urban forests. City trees improve our health, clean the air, store CO2, and cool local temperatures. Comparatively less is known about urban forests as ecosystems, particularly their spatial composition, nativity statuses, biodiversity, and tree health. Here, we assembled and standardized a new dataset of N=5,132,890 trees from 63 of the largest US cities with detailed information on location, health, nativity status, and species. We further designed new tools to analyze the ecosystem structure of urban forests, including spatial clustering and abundance of native trees, and validate these tools in comparison to past methods. We show that city trees are significantly clustered by species in 93% of cities, potentially increasing pest vulnerability (even in cities with biodiverse urban forests). Further, non-native species significantly homogenize urban forests across cities, while native trees comprise 0.44%-85.6% (median=45.6%) of city tree populations. Native trees are less frequent in drier cities, and indeed climate significantly shapes both nativity and biodiversity in urban forests. Parks are more biodiverse than urban settings. Compared to past work which focused primarily on canopy cover and species richness, we show the importance of analyzing spatial composition and nativity statuses in urban forests (and we created new datasets and tools to do so). This dataset could be analyzed in combination with citizen-science datasets on bird, insect, or plant biodiversity; social and demographic data; or data on the physical environment. Urban forests offer a rare opportunity to intentionally design biodiverse, heterogenous, rich ecosystems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Green infrastructure (GI) classifications are widely applied to predict and assess its suitability for urban biodiversity and ecosystem service (ES) provisioning. However, there is no consolidated classification, which hampers elucidating synthesis and consolidated relationships across ES and biodiversity.In this research, we aim to bridge the gap between urban GI research on ES and biodiversity by providing a standardized common classification that enables consistent spatial analysis.We analyzed GI classifications used across five ES and four taxa in scientific literature. GI classes were analyzed based on name, definition and characteristics. Results were used to create a novel classification scheme accounting for both ES and biodiversity.We show that many GI classes are unique to a ES or taxon, indicating a lack of multifunctionality of the classification applied. Among the universally used classes, diversity in their definitions is large, reducing our mechanistic understanding of multifunctionality in GI. Finally, we show that most GI classes are solely based on land-use or land-cover, lacking in-depth detail on vegetation. Through standardization and incorporation of key characteristics, we created a consolidated classification. This classification is fully available through openly-accessible databases.Our consolidated standardized classification accommodates interdisciplinary research on ES and biodiversity and allows elucidating urban biodiversity and ES relationships into greater detail, facilitating cross-comparisons and integrated assessments. This will provide a foundation for future research efforts into GI multi-functionality and urban greening policies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Much effort has been made to understand why foliar microbes live where they do. However, whether foliar microbiome composition can be predicted is unknown. Here, we determine the limits of prediction using metabarcoding data of both fungal and bacterial assemblages that occur within (endophytes) and without (epiphytes) leaves from 59 plant taxa. We built random forest models for prevalent taxa and quantified the combined predictive power of 24 plant traits, 12 abiotic conditions and 7 additional features. As response variables, we considered microbial relative and absolute abundances, and occurrences. Most microbial taxa were too rare to effectively model, but model performance was generally poor even for the most prevalent and abundant taxa (model R2 was typically &lt;0.1). Fungi were more tractable for modeling than bacteria. Models of Shannon’s diversity were moderately successful but those for richness were not. Taxa responded idiosyncratically and non-linearly to variation in the foliar habitat. When prevalent microbes were included as features in models, performance improved. Our results suggest that easily measurable aspects of the phyllosphere habitat are poor predictors of microbiome composition. These results pose a challenge for the study of microbial biogeography and we discuss possible ways forward.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Climate change has disrupted natural phenological patterns, including migration. Despite extensive studies of phenological shifts in migration by climate change and driving factors of migration, a few issues remain unresolved. In particular, little is known about the complex effects of driving factors on migration with interactions and nonlinearity, and partitioning of the effects of factors into spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal effects. The Pacific spiny dogfish Squalus suckleyi (hereafter “spiny dogfish”) is a coastal elasmobranchii that migrates southward for parturition and northward for feeding in the western North Pacific. Here, to elucidate the migration patterns as well as the driving factors under climate change, we first examined long-term changes in the timing and geographic location of migration by applying a spatio-temporal model to ca. 5-decade time series data for the presence/absence of spiny dogfish in the western North Pacific. We then evaluated the spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal effects of driving factors (sea surface temperature [SST], depth, productivity, and magnetic fields) on seasonal occurrence patterns using a machine learning model. We found that the migration area did not change over ca. 5 decades, whereas the migration timing advanced by a month after 2000. The spatial effects of magnetic fields and depth were consistently large and the spatial and spatio-temporal effects of SST increased in the migration season, even though temporal effect of SST was always weak. These results suggest that the migration area of spiny dogfish was stable over time because their spatial distribution was determined by geographic features, whereas the migration timing advanced by tracking a suitable SST location which increased steeply after 2000. Therefore, temperature as well as other factors influence migration simultaneously under climate change and underline the importance of paying attention biotic/abiotic factors including temperature and process-based understanding to predict future impacts of climate change on phenological shifts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - In the short-beaked echidna, Tachyglossus aculeatus, after an initial period of in utero development, the egg is laid in the pouch and incubated for 10 days. During this time, the fetuses develop an egg tooth and caruncle to help them hatch. However, there are only a few historical references that describe the development of the monotreme egg tooth. Using unprecedented access to echidna pre- and post-hatching tissues, the egg tooth and caruncle were assessed by micro-CT, histology and immunofluorescence, to map the changes at the morphological and molecular level. Unlike mammalian tooth germs that develop by invagination of a placode, the echidna egg tooth developed by evagination, similar to that of the first teeth in some reptiles. The egg tooth ankylosed to the premaxilla, rather than forming a mammalian thecodont attachment, with loss of the egg tooth post-hatching associated with high levels of odontoclasts, and apoptosis. The caruncle formed as a separate mineralisation from the adjacent nasal capsule, and as observed in birds and turtles, the nasal region epithelium expressed markers of cornification. Together, this highlights that the monotreme egg tooth shares many similarities with reptilian teeth, suggesting that this tooth is conserved from a common ancestor of mammals and reptiles.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Background and Aims Abelia (Caprifoliaceae) is a small genus with five species, including one man-made hybrid and several natural hybrids. The genus has a discontinuous distribution in mainland China, Taiwan Island, and the Ryukyu islands, providing a model system to explore mechanisms of species dispersal in the East Asian flora. However, the current phylogenetic relationships within Abelia remain uncertain.Methods In this study, we reconstructed phylogenetic relationships within Abelia using nuclear loci generated by target enrichment and plastomes from genome skimming. Divergence time estimation, ancestral area reconstruction, and ecological niche modelling (ENM) were used to examine the diversification history of Abelia.Key Results We found extensive cytonuclear discordance across the genus. By integrating lines of evidence from molecular phylogenies, divergence times, and morphology, we propose to merge A. macrotera var. zabelioides into A. uniflora. Network analyses suggested that there have been widespread and multiple hybridization events among Abelia species. These hybridization events may have contributed to the speciation mechanism and resulted in a high observed morphological diversity. The diversification of Abelia began in the early Eocene, followed by A. chinensis var. ionandra colonizing the island of Taiwan in the Middle Miocene. The ENM results suggested an expansion of climatically suitable areas during the Last Glacial Maximum and range contraction during the Last Interglacial. Disjunction between the Himalayan-Hengduan Mountain region (HHM) and the island of Taiwan is most likely the consequence of topographic isolation and postglacial contraction.Conclusions We used genomic data to reconstruct the phylogeny of Abelia and found a clear pattern of reticulate evolution in the group. In addition, our results support shrinkage of postglacial range and the heterogeneity of the terrain have led to the disjunction of the mainland China-Taiwan island. This study provides important new insights into the speciation process and taxonomy of Abelia.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Local adaptation is an important consideration when predicting arthropod-borne disease risk because it can impact on vector population fitness and persistence. However, the extent that vector populations are adapted to local environmental conditions and whether this can impact on species distributions generally remains unknown. Here we find that the geographic distribution of Ae. aegypti across Panama is rapidly changing as a consequence of the recent invasion by its ecological competitor, Aedes albopictus. Although Ae. albopictus has displaced Ae. aegypti in some areas, species coexist across many areas, raising the question: What biological and environmental factors permit population persistence?. Despite low population structure and high gene flow in Ae. aegypti across Panama, excepting the province of Bocas del Toro, we identify 128 candidate SNPs, clustered within 17 genes, which show a strong genetic signal of local adaptation. This putatively adaptive variation occurs across relatively fine geographic scales with the composition and frequency of candidate adaptive loci differing between populations in wet tropical environments along the Caribbean coast and the dry tropical conditions typical of the Pacific coast of Panama. Temperature and vegetation were important predictors of adaptive genomic variation in Ae. aegypti with potential areas of local adaptation occurring within the Caribbean region of Bocas del Toro, the Pacific coastal areas of Herrera and Panama City and the eastern Azuero Peninsula. Interestingly, several of these locations coincide with areas where Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus co-exist, suggesting that Ae. aegypti could have an adaptive edge under local environmental conditions that impacts on inter-specific competition with Ae. albopictus. Our results guide future experimental work by suggesting that locally adapted Ae. aegypti are able to persist on invasion by Ae. albopictus and, as a consequence, may fundamentally alter future arborviral disease risk and efforts to control mosquito populations.Author Summary Local environmental adaptation of mosquito vectors can alter the landscape of arthropod-borne disease by impacting on life history traits that increase their relative fitness thus promoting population persistence. We have identified a number of genomic loci in Ae. aegypti from Panama that exhibit a signal of natural selection associated with variation in the environment. Loci with a signal of local adaptation are predominately partitioned between wet and dry tropical environments with variation largely impacted by temperature and vegetation indices. Local adaptation in tandem with changes in the geographic distribution of Ae. aegypti due to the recent invasion of its ecological competitor, Ae. albopictus, has the potential to alter the landscape of arborviral disease.

AB  - Low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), widely known as drones, have become ubiquitous and improved considerably in their technical capabilities and data quality. This opens new opportunities for their utilisation in scientific research that can help to reduce equipment and data collection costs. Remote sensing methods in ecological fieldwork can be a suitable approach to complementing, augmenting or even replacing certain aspects of fieldwork. In this study we tested the suitability of UAV for the detection of salmonid spawning grounds in two lakes in Iceland, Thingvallavatn and Ellidavatn. Salmonids are very susceptible to environmental changes, especially during embryonic development when highly oxygenated water flow and low temperatures are required. Monitoring the changes of the redd density over time will help understand the population dynamics of salmonid species and create strategies for species conservation. As part of this pilot study, we conducted aerial surveys during the spawning seasons in both locations in 2018 recording standard photographs in the visible spectrum (red, green, blue) to fully cover the respective areas of interest. Different flight altitudes were recorded to test the effects of image resolution on the final analyses. The images were then processed by applying standard remote sensing analyses in the software ENVI. The maximum likelihood classification combined with post-classification improvement methods resulted in satisfactory accuracies that are valuable for further monitoring efforts. From these findings we established a workflow that allows the implementation of UAV in ecological fieldwork for regular long-term observations. We discuss our experiences with regards to their utility, their limitations and identify future directions of research for implementing the potential that low-cost approaches have in supporting ecological studies of freshwater ecosystems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The resolution offered by genomic data sets coupled with recently developed spatially informed analyses are allowing researchers to quantify population structure at increasingly fine temporal and spatial scales. However, uncertainties regarding data set size and quality thresholds and the time scale at which barriers to gene flow become detectable have limited both empirical research and conservation measures. Here, we used restriction site associated DNA sequencing to generate a large SNP data set for the copperhead snake (Agkistrodon contortrix) and address the population genomic impacts of recent and widespread landscape modification across an approximately 1000 km2 region of eastern Kentucky. Nonspatial population-based assignment and clustering methods supported little to no population structure. However, using individual-based spatial autocorrelation approaches we found evidence for genetic structuring which closely follows the path of a historic highway which experienced high traffic volumes from ca. 1920 to 1970. We found no similar spatial genomic signatures associated with more recently constructed highways or surface mining activity, though a time lag effect may be responsible for the lack of any emergent spatial genetic patterns. Subsampling of our SNP data set suggested that similar results could be obtained with as few as 250 SNPs, and thresholds for missing data exhibited limited impacts on the spatial patterns we detected outside of very strict or permissive extremes. Our findings highlight the importance of temporal factors in landscape genetics approaches, and suggest the potential advantages of large genomic data sets and fine-scale, spatially-informed approaches for quantifying subtle genetic patterns in temporally complex landscapes.

AB  - Human activities have caused massive losses of natural populations across the globe. Like many groups, amphibians have experienced substantial declines worldwide, driven by environmental changes such as habitat conversion, pollution, and disease emergence. Each of these drivers is often found in close association with the presence of roads. Here we report a novel consequence of roads affecting an amphibian native to much of North America, the wood frog (Rana sylvatica). Across 38 populations distributed from southern to central New England, we found that adult wood frogs living adjacent to roads had higher incidence and severity of edema (bloating caused by fluid accumulation) during the breeding season than frogs living away from the influence of roads. This effect was best explained by increased conductivity of breeding ponds, caused by runoff pollution from road salt used for de-icing. Edema severity was negatively correlated with locomotor performance in more northerly populations. Interestingly, northern populations experience more intense winters, which tends to result in more de-icing salt runoff and increased energetic demands associated with overwintering cryoprotection needs. Thus, this emerging consequence of roads appears to impose potential fitness costs associated with locomotion, and these effects might be most impactful on populations living in regions where de-icing is most intense.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The present note intends to challenge, based on field observations, the definition of treeline and argues for considering the upper occurrences of tree-species as an integrative result of historical and contemporary processes acting on high-altitude socio-ecosystems. A field survey of Pinus cembra growing above 2800 m asl was conducted, in an ecoregion of southwestern Alps, straddling France and Italy (Queyras-Mt Viso area). Pines were described (height, density) and their habitats were contextualized (altitude, slope degree and exposure, bedrock). Individuals of Pinus cembra are commonly growing between 2800 and 3200 m asl, generally on east-facing, steep and rocky slopes, with a pine density decreasing with altitude. Pines are generally dwarf-shaped, sometimes erected or prostrated. Their needles are half the size compared to those of pines growing in subalpine forests. Pine morphology indicates harsh growing conditions, notably strong wind, aridity and frost. These habitats constitute visually emerging objects attractive for the nutcracker caching behaviour. This setting acts as a positive passive driver for pine at high altitudes, which is further favoured by intense atmospheric moisture supplied by the east from the Po valley. Steep and rocky slopes exclude livestock, likely explaining why these pines are located in grass-less habitats. These tree clusters constitute remarkable “sky-island” populations. Larix decidua and Pinus uncinata were also recorded at exceptional altitudes but P. cembra is the most frequent species in high alpine conditions. These observations altogether highlight a complex pattern of tree-species line in the western Alps, and probably beyond.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Phenotypic variation is the basis for trait adaptation via evolutionary selection.1, 2, 3 However, the driving forces behind the quantitative trait variations remain unclear owing to their complexity at the molecular level.4, 5, 6 This study focused on the natural variation of the free-running period (FRP) of the circadian clock because FRP is a determining factor of the internal clock phase (chronotype), which is responsible for physiological timing during a day.7 Although natural variations in FRP have been widely reported,8, 10, 11 few studies have shown the association between FRP and adaptive temporal traits. As a clock-dependent physiological process, photoperiodism is a typical target of local adaptation.12, 13 Lemna aequinoctialis in Japan is a paddy-field duckweed exhibiting a latitudinal cline of critical day-lengths (CDLs) for short-day flowering.14 To investigate the relationship between FRP and CDL, we collected 72 strains of L. aequinoctialis within a latitudinal range between 31.5°N to 43.8°N. We found a significant correlation (P = 7.5E-8) between FRPs and locally adaptive CDLs, confirming that the variation in FRP-dependent chronotypes underlies geographically differentiated photoperiodism. Diel transcriptome analysis revealed that the induction timing of a florigen gene is key for connecting chronotypes to photoperiodism at the molecular level. Based on these results, we propose a fundamental rule concerning the “chronotype effect” in evolution: the variation of FRP functions as a resource for the variation of temporal traits. This study highlights the adaptive significance of FRP variation and provides a reason for the maintenance of FRP variation in natural populations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The grand ambition of theorists studying ecology and evolution is to discover the logical and mathematical rules driving the world’s biodiversity at every level from genetic diversity within species to differences between populations, communities, and ecosystems. This ambition has been difficult to realize in great part because of the complexity of biodiversity. Theoretical work has led to a complex web of theories, each having non-obvious consequences for other theories. Case in point, the recent realization that genetic diversity involves a great deal of temporal and spatial stochasticity forces theoretical population genetics to consider abiotic and biotic factors generally reserved to ecosystem ecology. This interconnectedness may require theoretical scientists to adopt new techniques adapted to reason about large sets of theories. Mathematicians have solved this problem by using formal languages based on logic to manage theorems. However, theories in ecology and evolution are not mathematical theorems, they involve uncertainty. Recent work in Artificial Intelligence in bridging logic and probability theory offers the opportunity to build rich knowledge bases that combine logic’s ability to represent complex mathematical ideas with probability theory’s ability to model uncertainty. We describe these hybrid languages and explore how they could be used to build a unified knowledge base of theories for ecology and evolution.case study you explore using the Salix tritrophic system.

AB  - The Brazilian buffy-tufted-ear marmoset (Callithrix aurita), one of the world’s most endangered primates, is threatened by anthropogenic hybridization with exotic, invasive marmoset species. As there are few genetic data available for C. aurita, we developed a PCR-free protocol with minimal technical requirements to rapidly generate genomic data with genomic skimming and portable nanopore sequencing. With this direct DNA sequencing approach, we successfully determined the complete mitogenome of a marmoset that we initially identified as C. aurita. The obtained nanopore-assembled sequence was highly concordant with a Sanger sequenced version of the same mitogenome. Phylogenetic analyses unexpectedly revealed that our specimen was a cryptic hybrid, with a C. aurita phenotype and C. penicillata mitogenome lineage. We also used publicly available mitogenome data to determine diversity estimates for C. aurita and three other marmoset species. Mitogenomics holds great potential to address deficiencies in genomic data for endangered, non-model species such as C. aurita. However, we discuss why mitogenomic approaches should be used in conjunction with other data for marmoset species identification. Finally, we discuss the utility and implications of our results and genomic skimming/nanopore approach for conservation and evolutionary studies of C. aurita and other marmosets.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The North American tiger salamander species complex, including its best-known species, the Mexican axolotl, has long been a source of biological fascination. The complex exhibits a wide range of variation in developmental life history strategies, including populations and individuals that undergo metamorphosis, those able to forego metamorphosis and retain a larval, aquatic lifestyle (i.e., paedomorphosis), and those that do both. This life history variation has been assumed to lead to reproductive isolation and speciation, but the degree to which it has shaped population- and species-level divergence is poorly understood. Using a large multi-locus dataset from hundreds of samples across North America, we identified genetic clusters across the geographic range of the tiger salamander complex. These clusters often contain a mixture of paedomorphic and metamorphic taxa, indicating that geographic isolation has played a larger role in lineage divergence than paedomorphosis in this system. This conclusion is bolstered by geography-informed analyses indicating no effect of life history strategy on population genetic differentiation and by model-based analyses demonstrating gene flow between adjacent metamorphic and paedomorphic populations. This fine-scale genetic perspective on life-history variation establishes a framework for understanding how plasticity, local adaptation, and gene flow contribute to lineage divergence. Many members of the tiger salamander complex are endangered, and the Mexican axolotl is an important model system in regenerative and biomedical research. Our results chart a course for more informed use of these taxa in experimental, ecological, and conservation research.Significance Statement Population structure and speciation are shaped by a combination of biotic and abiotic factors. The tiger salamander complex has been considered to be a key group where life history variation has led to a rapid rate of speciation, driven in large part by the evolution of obligate paedomorphosis–a condition where adults maintain an aquatic, larval phenotype. Using a large multi-locus dataset, we present evidence of gene flow between taxa with different life history strategies, suggesting that obligate paedomorphosis is not a strong driver of speciation in the tiger salamander complex. Many of these nominal taxa are listed as critically endangered, and our genetic results provide information and guidance that will be useful for their conservation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - To develop effective management actions of riverine fisheries, it is important to monitor how fish resources (i.e., eggs) are recruited in the upper reaches of natural rivers, particularly where dams have been constructed, which potentially hinder life-history strategies. Here, we aimed to determine the State of drifting fish eggs resources, and the underlying environmental factors regulating the presence of fish eggs in the upper reaches of a river (Laibin section of Xijiang River, China). Based on surveys conducted over one spawning period (2016), we set out to: (1) describe the composition and abundance of drifting fish eggs in the 150 km Lainbin section under a dam control, and (2) analyze how the composition and distribution of fish eggs was correlated with environmental factors. A total of 15157 eggs belonging to two orders, four families, and 18 species were collected. Comparison of these data with historical records in the same area showed that the community structure of drifting eggs has changed considerably. Previously, the community was dominated by larger-bodied species, rather than the smaller species documented in 2016. Eggs were primarily detected between May and August. In the natural channel, the greatest abundance of eggs occurred during May and June. In comparison, the greatest abundance of eggs downstream of the dam was detected in July. The results of this study provide important information for water conservancy institutions towards managing regions containing dams to maintain the ecology of rivers and protect important fish resources.

AB  - Biotic-dispersed tree seedling species are fundamental for the maintenance of the structure and function of forest patches in fragmented rainforest landscapes. Nonetheless, the effects of landscape structure and the spatial scale at which operates on seedling α- and β-diversity is unknown. Using a multi-scale approach, we assessed the relative effect of landscape composition (i.e., percentage of old-growth/secondary forest cover), configuration (i.e., aggregation/density of forest patches) and connectivity (i.e., structural and functional) on α- and β-diversity of biotic-dispersed seedlings in 16 forest patches in the Lacandona rainforest, Mexico. We assessed these effects at 13 spatial scales (from 300 to 1500 m radius, at 100 m intervals) for three α- and β-diversity orders (rare, common and dominant species). We found that patch aggregation increased species richness and reduced β-diversity of common and dominant species at similar spatial scales (500 to 600 m). Additionally, functional connectivity had a positive effect on the β-diversity of rare species in the 800 m spatial extent. These effects suggest that landscape configuration and functional connectivity sustain seedling diversity by preserving seed rain richness and the presence of large terrestrial herbivorous mammals. In contrast, the percentage of secondary forest matrix was detrimental for all α-diversity orders and the β-diversity of common and dominant species. Forthcoming conservation strategies should prevent deforestation, increase habitat amount and promote functional connectivity of forest-dependent fauna through matrix management actions.

AB  - Increasing human population size and the concomitant expansion of urbanisation significantly impact natural ecosystems and native fauna globally. Successful conservation management relies on precise information on the factors associated with wildlife population decline, which are challenging to acquire from natural populations. Wildlife Rehabilitation Centres (WRC) provide a rich source of this information. However, few researchers have conducted large-scale longitudinal studies, with most focussing on narrow taxonomic ranges, suggesting that WRC-associated data remains an underutilised resource, and may provide a fuller understanding of the anthropogenic threats facing native fauna.We analysed admissions and outcomes data from a WRC in Queensland, Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital, to determine the major factors driving admissions and morbidity of native animals in a region experiencing rapid and prolonged urban expansion.We studied 31,626 admissions of 83 different species of native birds, reptiles, amphibians, marsupials and eutherian mammals from 2006 to 2017. While marsupial admissions were highest (41.3%), admissions increased over time for all species and exhibited seasonal variation (highest in Spring to Summer), consistent with known breeding seasons.Causes for admission typically associated with human influenced activities were dominant and exhibited the highest mortality rates. Car strikes were the most common reason for admission (34.7%), with dog attacks (9.2%), entanglements (7.2%), and cat attacks (5.3% also high. Admissions of orphaned young and overt signs of disease were significant at 24.6% and 9.7%, respectively. Mortality rates were highest following dog attacks (72.7%) and car strikes (69.1%) and lowest in orphaned animals (22.1%).Our results show that WRC databases offer rich opportunities for wildlife monitoring and provide quantification of the negative impacts of human activities on ecosystem stability and wildlife health. The imminent need for urgent, proactive conservation management to ameliorate the negative impacts of human activities on wildlife is clearly evident from our results.

AB  - Significance Foraged leafy greens are consumed around the globe, including in urban areas, and may play a larger role when food is scarce or expensive. It is thus important to assess the safety and nutritional value of wild greens foraged in urban environments.Methods Field observations, soil tests, and nutritional and toxicology tests on plant tissue were conducted for three sites, each roughly 9 square blocks, in disadvantaged neighborhoods in the East San Francisco Bay Area in 2014–2015. The sites included mixed-use areas and areas with high vehicle traffic.Results Edible wild greens were abundant, even during record droughts. Soil at some survey sites had elevated concentrations of lead and cadmium, but tissue tests suggest that rinsed greens of the tested species are safe to eat. Daily consumption of standard servings comprise less than the EPA reference doses of lead, cadmium, and other heavy metals. Pesticides, glyphosate, and PCBs were below detection limits.The nutrient density of 6 abundant species compared favorably to that of the most nutritious domesticated leafy greens.Conclusions Wild edible greens harvested in industrial, mixed-use, and high-traffic urban areas in the San Francisco East Bay area are abundant and highly nutritious. Even grown in soils with elevated levels of heavy metals, tested species were safe to eat after rinsing in tap water. This does not mean that all edible greens growing in contaminated soil are safe to eat—tests on more species, in more locations, and over a broader range of soil chemistry are needed to determine what is generally safe and what is not. But it does suggest that wild greens could contribute to nutrition, food security, and sustainability in urban ecosystems. Current laws, regulations, and public-health guidance that forbid or discourage foraging on public lands, including urban areas, should be revisited.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - The biased loss of large and medium frugivores alters seed dispersal and plant regeneration. Species reintroductions have been proposed as a strategy to reverse the consequences of species loss. However, the effects of reintroductions on ecological processes are seldom accessed, which hinders the comprehension of reintroductions’ potential to reestablish functioning ecosystems. In this study, we investigate the effect of howler monkey (Alouatta guariba) reintroduction on the plant regeneration of Tijuca National Park (TNP), a defaunated Atlantic Forest fragment. Howlers are folivore-frugivore primates, whose large clumped defecations attract dung beetles, which provide secondary dispersal by burying seeds present in the howlers’ feces. Thus, we expect that the fate of seeds dispersed by howlers will differ from those dispersed by other frugivores present in the Park. We followed the fate of seeds between 3 and 14mm in diameter in three steps of the seed dispersal loop, each one consisting of a different experiment. First, we estimated secondary seed dispersal and burial depth probabilities according to the frugivores’ defecation pattern; then, predation probability in different burial depths and defecation patterns; and, finally, recruitment probability in different burial depths. Considering the final result of the three experiments, the howlers’ reintroduction affected positively the regeneration of large seeds. The fate of 3mm seeds was little affected because they were seldom preyed upon at shallower depths anyway and could not recruit when deeply buried. On the other hand, seeds larger than 3mm reached the seedling stage more frequently when dispersed by howlers than when dispersed by other animals present in the Park. Thus, howler monkey reintroduction in defaunated areas, in addition to smaller frugivores, whose defecation patterns are less attractive for dung beetles, improves the regeneration of large seeds. We hope that this study will stimulate new howler reintroductions in defaunated areas.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The metacommunity concept provides a theoretical framework that aims at explaining organism distributions by a combination of environmental filtering, dispersal and drift. With the development of statistical tools to quantify and partially isolate the role of each of these processes, empirical metacommunity studies have multiplied worldwide. However, few works attempt a multi-taxon approach and even fewer compare two distant biogeographical regions using the same methodology. Under this framework, we tested the expectation that temperate (mediterranean-climate) pond metacommunities would be more influenced by environmental and spatial processes than tropical ones, because of stronger environmental gradients and greater isolation of waterbodies.We surveyed 30 tropical and 32 mediterranean temporary ponds from Costa Rica and Spain, respectively, and obtained data on 49 environmental variables (including limnological, hydrogeomorphological, biotic, climatic, and landscape variables). We characterized the biological communities of Bacteria and Archaea (from both the water column and the sediments), phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, amphibians and birds, and estimated the relative role of space and environment on metacommunity organization for each group and region, by means of variation partitioning using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs).Environmental selection was important in both tropical and mediterranean ponds, but markedly stronger in the latter, probably due to their larger limnological heterogeneity. Spatialized environment and pure spatial effects were greater in the tropics, related to higher climatic heterogeneity and dispersal processes (e.g. restriction, surplus) acting at different scales. The variability between taxonomic groups in spatial and environmental contributions was very wide. Effects on passive and active dispersers were similar within regions but different across regions, with higher environmental effects in mediterranean active dispersers. The residual (unexplained) variation was larger in tropical pond metacommunities, suggesting a higher role for stochastic processes and/or effects of biotic interactions in the tropics. Overall, these results provide support, for a wide variety of organisms related to aquatic habitats, for the classical view of stronger abiotic niche constraints in temperate areas compared to the tropics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Introduction Urbanization is one of the main causes for environmental problems due to the introduction of pollutants into water bodies. Lahi is crossing fintoselam. This river has long been used for a variety of purposes including source of public water supply, small scale irrigation, bathing, washing, animal watering, sand and stone dredging and recreation.Objective To assess the influence of Finoteselam town on ecological status of Lahi riverMethods The assessment were assessed using physicochemical parameters, physical habitat assessment, biotic indices /metrics, human activity by observation as well as macroinvertabretes samples from eleven sampling sites coded S1 to S11 along the river using the standard procedures. The assessments were involved in-situ measurements and collection of water samples in April 2019 then, analyzed the water samples in laboratory.Results The biological analysis reveals a notable reduction of the diversity macroinvertabrates in the downstream direction where the minimum was at midstream sites. Upstream has significantly better macroinvertabrates assemblage than midstream (p-value&lt;0.05). Physical habitat evaluation scores varied from 43 at S8 to 173 at S1 and relatively lower score were recorded at midstream sites. Low % of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera with high family biotic index and high % of Diptera with low biological monitoring working party also indicated water ecology deteriorated mainly at midstream sites. Multivariate analysis of classical analysis, canonical correspondence analysis and none metric multidimensional scaling also indicated ecological deterioration at midstream sites mainly at S5, S6, S7 and S8.Conclusion Midstream was relatively more polluted than upstream due to influence of pollutant from Finoteselam town. The ecological status of upstream segments of the river is very good with slight organic pollutions, and at midstream is poor and significant degree of organic pollutions; whereas the status of the downstream is fair with fairly substantial water pollution showing moderate ecological disturbance. In general, midstream the sampling stations show the deterioration in water ecology and thus necessitated a need for mitigation measure to save the Lahi.

AB  - The Anthropocene marks great changes to environments and the animals that inhabit them. Changes, such as disturbance, can affect the manner in which animals interact with their environments, such as moving and selecting habitats. To test how animals might respond to changing disturbance regimes, we employ an experimental approach to movement ecology. We used integrated step selection analysis (iSSA) to test the behavioural responses of individually-marked grove snails (Cepaea nemoralis) exposed to a gradient of physical disturbance in their habitat. We used a before-after control-impact (BACI) experimental design within semi-controlled mesocosms to manipulate edge and disturbance variables by altering the area of the mesocosm covered by bricks. We showed that grove snails perceive edges of enclosures and edges of bricks as risks, and responded to such risks by altering their movement. Grove snails displayed a bimodal response to risk by taking shelter in place or moving faster to be farther from the disturbance. Furthermore, individuals tended to modulate their behavioural response to the degree of risk. Our study highlights the usefulness of experimental mesocosms in movement ecology and in determining the effects of habitat alteration and human-imposed risk on movement behaviour.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Saline wetlands are keystone ecosystems in arid and semi-arid landscapes that are currently under severe threat. This study conducted spatio-temporal modelling of the largest saline Ramsar site of India, in Sambhar wetland from 1963-2059. One CORONA aerial photograph of 1963 and Landsat images of 1972, 1981, 1992, 2009, and 2019 were acquired and classified under 8 classes as Aravalli, barren land, saline soil, salt crust, saltpans, waterbody, settlement, and vegetation for spatial modelling integrated with bird census, soil-water parameters, GPS locations, and photographs. Past decadal area statistics state reduction of waterbody from 30.7 to 3.4% at constant rate (4.23%) to saline soil. Saline soil increased from 12.4 to 21.7% and saline soil converted to barren land from 45.4 to 49.6%; saltpans from 7.4 to 14% and settlement from increased 0.1 to 1.3% till 2019. Future predictions hint at a net increase of 20% by wetland, vegetation by 30%, settlement by 40%, saltpan by 10%, barren land by 5%, and net loss of 20%, each by Aravalli and salt crust. The biggest loss of 120% was seen by saline soil converted to barren land. Notably, 40% of the current wetland will be lost by 2059. Additionally, soil-water parameters result state a loss of saline character of wetland ecosystem; subsequently bird statistics indicate a shift in migratory birds disturbing the wetland food web. India has been losing a critical habitat of migratory birds, halophytes, and halophiles, along with livelihood. This study looks to bridge the missing link from local to global wetland ecological disconnect, providing thereby lake management and restoration strategies.

TI  - 100+ years of bird survey data reveal changes in functional fingerprints indexing ecosystem health of a tropical montane forest through time
AU  - Gómez, Camila

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Ecologically relevant traits of organisms inhabiting an ecosystem determine its functional fingerprint. Quantifying changes in the shape, volume and shifts in the position of functional fingerprints can provide information about the effects of diversity loss or gain through time, and is a promising means to monitor ecological integrity. This, however, is seldom possible owing to limitations in historical surveys and lack of data on organismal traits, particularly in diverse tropical regions. Using detailed bird surveys from four time periods across more than one century and morphological traits of 233 species, we quantified changes in the avian functional fingerprint of a tropical montane forest site in the Andes of Colombia. We found that 79% of the variation in functional space, regardless of time period, was described by three major axes summarizing body size, dispersal ability, and habitat breadth. Changes in species composition caused significant alterations of the functional fingerprint of the assemblage, with 35 – 60% reductions in functional richness and dispersion. Owing to species extirpations and to novel additions to the assemblage, functional space is currently smaller and at least 11% different to what it was a century ago, with fewer large-sized species, more good dispersers, and fewer habitat specialists. Extirpated species had high values of functional uniqueness and distinctiveness, resulting in large reductions of functional richness and dispersion after their loss, implying potentially important consequences for ecosystem functioning. Conservation efforts aimed at maintaining ecosystem function must move beyond maintaining species numbers to designing strategies for the maintenance of ecological function by identifying and conserving species with traits conferring high vulnerability.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - There are few studies of day-roosting ecology of bats inhabiting the southernmost forests of South America, where cool summer temperatures and land management practices pose several challenges. The goal of the present study was to describe day-roosting habitats and patterns of thermoregulation in two bat species occurring on Tierra del Fuego, Myotis chiloensis (Chilean myotis) and Histiotus magellanicus (southern big-eared brown bat), during late spring. To do so, we tagged 17 bats with temperature-sensitive radio-transmitters, located 17 day-roosts, and collected 81 days of skin temperature data. We concurrently recorded ambient air temperature to determine its effect on torpor use. Both species were found roosting in large diameter (77.8 ± 6 cm), typically live, Nothofagus pumilio trees (lenga) located on the edges of forest gaps or within stands primarily composed of smaller, younger trees. Bats of both species frequently used torpor, with skin temperatures dropping below a torpor threshold on 89% of days (n = 72) and daily minimum skin temperatures averaging 16.5 °C over the course of our study. Average daily air temperature was a significant predictor of torpor use, with lower skin temperatures and more time spent in torpor observed on colder days. Minimum skin temperature and time spent torpid did not vary between bat species, nor did the characteristics of day-roosts. These data show that spring temperatures in Tierra del Fuego pose an energetic challenge that bats meet through frequent use of torpor, and likely, habitat selection. We recommend local conservation efforts keep these thermal challenges in mind by retaining large trees, which may provide warmer microclimates or room for social groups.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Genetic diversity a major determinant for the capacity of species to persist and adapt to their environments. Unraveling the factors affecting genetic differentiation is crucial to understand how genetic diversity is shaped and species may react to changing environments. We employed genotyping by sequencing to test the influence of climate, space, latitude, altitude and land cover on genetic differentiation in a collection of 81 wild pea samples (Pisum sativum ssp. elatius) from across its distribution range from western Europe to central Asia. We also attempted to elucidate the species recent evolutionary history and its effect on the current distribution of genetic diversity. Association of single SNPs with climate variables were analyses to test for signatures of local adaptation. Genetic variation was geographically structured into six distinct genetic cluster. Two of which were associated with a taxonomic group (Pisum sativum ssp. humile) that according to some researchers does not qualify for a sub-species rank due to its alleged lack of genetic distinctness from other conspecific groups. The effect of the tested factors influencing genetic differentiation were rather variable among genetic clusters. The climate predictors were most important in all clusters. Land use was more important in clusters from areas strongly influenced by human land use, especially by agriculture. We found a statistically significant association of 3,623 SNPs (2.4 % of all SNPs) with one of the environmental predictors. Most of them were correlated with latitude followed by temperature, precipitation and altitude. Estimation of SNP effects of the candidates resulted in a missense to silent ratio of 0.45, suggesting many of the observed candidates SNPs may alter the encoded amino acid sequence. Wild peas went through a genetic bottleneck during the last glacial period followed by population recovery. Probably associated with this population recovery, we detected a range expansion, which may have led to an eastward range expansion of the European cluster to Turkey and thereof southwards and eastwards. Overall, the interplay of several environmental factors and the recent evolutionary history affected the distribution of genetic diversity in wild peas where each subpopulations were differently affected by those factors and processes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Several major migrations and population turnover events during the later Stone Age (after c. 11,000 cal. BP) are believed to have shaped the contemporary population genetic diversity in Eurasia. While the genetic impacts of these migrations have been investigated on regional scales, a detailed understanding of their spatiotemporal dynamics both within and between major geographic regions across Northern Eurasia remains largely elusive. Here, we present the largest shotgun-sequenced genomic dataset from the Stone Age to date, representing 317 primarily Mesolithic and Neolithic individuals from across Eurasia, with associated radiocarbon dates, stable isotope data, and pollen records. Using recent advances, we imputed &gt;1,600 ancient genomes to obtain accurate diploid genotypes, enabling previously unachievable fine-grained population structure inferences. We show that 1) Eurasian Mesolitic hunter-gatherers were more genetically diverse than previously known, and deeply divergent between the west and the east; 2) Hitherto genetically undescribed hunter-gatherers from the Middle Don region contributed significant ancestry to the later Yamnaya steppe pastoralists; 3) The genetic impact of the transition from Mesolithic hunter-gatherers to Neolithic farmers was highly distinct, east and west of a “Great Divide” boundary zone extending from the Black Sea to the Baltic, with large-scale shifts in genetic ancestry to the west. This include an almost complete replacement of hunter-gatherers in Denmark, but no substantial shifts during the same period further to the east; 4) Within-group relatedness changes substantially during the Neolithic transition in the west, where clusters of Neolithic farmer-associated individuals show overall reduced relatedness, while genetic relatedness remains high until ~4,000 BP in the east, consistent with a much longer persistence of smaller localised hunter-gatherer groups; 5) A fast-paced second major genetic transformation beginning around 5,000 BP, with Steppe-related ancestry reaching most parts of Europe within a 1,000 years span. Local Neolithic farmers admixed with incoming pastoralists in most parts of Europe, whereas Scandinavia experienced another near-complete population replacement, with similar dramatic turnover-patterns also evident in western Siberia; 6) Extensive regional differences in the ancestry components related to these early events remain visible to this day, even within countries (research conducted using the UK Biobank resource). Neolithic farmer ancestry is highest in southern and eastern England while Steppe-related ancestry is highest in the Celtic populations of Scotland, Wales, and Cornwall. Overall, our findings show that although the Stone-Age migrations have been important in shaping contemporary genetic diversity in Eurasia, their dynamics and impact were geographically highly heterogeneous.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Pathogens originating from wildlife (zoonoses) pose a significant public health burden, comprising the majority of emerging infectious diseases. Efforts to control and prevent zoonotic disease have traditionally focused on animal-to-human transmission, or “spillover”. However, in the modern era, increasing international mobility and commerce facilitate the spread of infected humans, non-human animals (hereafter animals), and their products worldwide, thereby increasing the risk that zoonoses will be introduced to new geographic areas. Imported zoonoses can potentially ‘spill back’ to infect local wildlife—a danger magnified by urbanization and other anthropogenic pressures that increase contacts between human and wildlife populations. In this way, humans can function as vectors, dispersing zoonoses from their ancestral enzootic systems to establish reservoirs elsewhere in novel animal host populations. Once established, these enzootic cycles are largely unassailable by standard control measures and have the potential to feed human epidemics. Understanding when and why translocated zoonoses establish novel enzootic cycles requires disentangling ecologically complex and stochastic interactions between the zoonosis, the human population, and the natural ecosystem. We address this challenge by delineating potential ecological mechanisms affecting each stage of enzootic establishment—wildlife exposure, enzootic infection, and persistence—applying existing ecological concepts from epidemiology, invasion biology, and population ecology. We ground our study in the neotropics, where four arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) of zoonotic origin—yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses—have separately been introduced into the human population. This paper is a step towards developing a framework for predicting and preventing novel enzootic cycles in the face of zoonotic translocations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Can we cluster bacterial sediment communities based on lake size, depth, and trophic status? Or, are bacterial microbial communities an emergent property of their geography, integrating regional physical and climatic conditions? Lakes in Minnesota are uniquely situated to address these questions because of their wide geographic range and variability in size and basin land-use. In this study, we selected twenty lakes with varying morphological and chemical properties across four ecological regions of Minnesota. Our objectives were to (i)) evaluate the diversity and spatial variation of the bacterial community at the sediment-water interface and (ii) determine how lake location and watershed land-use impact aqueous chemistry and influence community structure. Our data indicate that sediment communities from similar depth intervals are more likely to cluster by ecological region rather than any individual lake properties (e.g., trophic status, TP concentration, lake depth). However, composition is tied to a given lake, wherein samples from the same core were more alike than samples at similar depths across lakes. Our results illustrate the diversity within lake sediment microbial communities and provide insight into relationships between taxonomy, physicochemical, and geographic properties of north temperate lakes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - All parasites are heterogeneous in space, yet little is known about the prevalence and scale of this spatial variation, particularly in wild animal systems. To address this question, we sought to identify and examine spatial dependence of wildlife disease across a wide range of systems.Conducting a broad literature search, we collated 31 such datasets featuring 89 replicates and 71 unique host-parasite combinations, only 51% of which had previously been used to test spatial hypotheses. We analysed these datasets for spatial dependence within a standardised modelling framework using Bayesian linear models, and we then meta-analysed the results to identify generalised determinants of the scale and magnitude of spatial autocorrelation.We detected spatial autocorrelation in 48/89 model replicates (54%) across 21/31 datasets (68%), spread across parasites of all groups. Even some very small study areas (under 0.01km2) exhibited substantial spatial variation.Despite the common manifestation of spatial variation, our meta-analysis was unable to identify host-, parasite-, or sampling-level determinants of this heterogeneity across systems. Parasites of all transmission modes had easily detectable spatial patterns, implying that structured contact networks and susceptibility effects are potentially as important in spatially structuring disease as are environmental drivers of transmission efficiency.Our findings demonstrate that fine-scale spatial patterns of infection manifest frequently and across a range of wild animal systems, and many studies are able to investigate them whether or not the original aim of the study was to examine spatially varying processes. Given the widespread nature of these findings, studies should more frequently record and analyse spatial data, facilitating development and testing of spatial hypotheses in disease ecology. Ultimately, this may pave the way for an a priori predictive framework for spatial variation in novel host-parasite systems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The Mediterranean Basin has experienced extensive change in geology and climate over the past six million years. Yet, the relative importance of key geological events for the distribution and genetic structure of the Mediterranean fauna remains poorly understood. Here, we use population genomic and phylogenomic analyses to establish the evolutionary history and genetic structure of common wall lizards (Podarcis muralis). This species is particularly informative because, in contrast to other Mediterranean lizards, it is widespread across the Iberian, Italian, and Balkan peninsulas, and in extra-Mediterranean regions. We found strong support for six major lineages within P. muralis, which were largely discordant with the phylogenetic relationship of mitochondrial DNA. The most recent common ancestor of extant P. muralis was likely distributed in the Italian Peninsula, and experienced an “Out-of-Italy” expansion following the Messinian salinity crisis (~5 Mya), resulting in the differentiation into the extant lineages on the Iberian, Italian and Balkan peninsulas. Introgression analysis revealed that both inter- and intraspecific gene flow have been pervasive throughout the evolutionary history of P. muralis. For example, the Southern Italy lineage has a hybrid origin, formed through admixture between the Central Italy lineage and an ancient lineage that was the sister to all other P. muralis. More recent genetic differentiation is associated with the onset of the Quaternary glaciations, which influenced population dynamics and genetic diversity of contemporary lineages. These results demonstrate the pervasive role of Mediterranean geology and climate for the evolutionary history and population genetic structure of extant species.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Rice paddy irrigation ponds can sustain surprisingly high taxonomic richness and make significant contributions to regional biodiversity. We evaluated the impacts of pesticides and other environmental stressors on the taxonomic richness of freshwater animals in 21 irrigation ponds in Japan. We sampled a wide range of freshwater animals (reptiles, amphibians, fishes, mollusks, crustaceans, insects, annelids, bryozoans, and sponges) and surveyed environmental variables related to pesticide contamination, eutrophication, decreased macrophyte coverage, physical habitat destruction, and invasive alien species. Statistical analyses comprised contraction of highly correlated environmental variables, best-subset model selection, stepwise model selection, and permutation tests. Results showed that: (i) probenazole (fungicide) was the unique significant stressor on fish (i.e., contamination with this compound had a significantly negative correlation with fish taxonomic richness), (ii) the interaction of BPMC (insecticide; also known as fenobucarb) and bluegill (invasive alien fish) was a significant stressor on a “large insect” category (Coleoptera, Ephemeroptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, Odonata, and Trichoptera), (iii) the interaction of BPMC and concrete bank was a significant stressor on an “invertebrate” category, (iv) the combined impacts of BPMC and the other stressors on the invertebrate and large insect categories resulted in an estimated mean loss of taxonomic richness by 15% and 77%, respectively, in comparison with a hypothetical pond with preferable conditions.

AB  - The biodiverse Neotropical ecoregion remains insufficiently assessed, poorly managed, and threatened by unregulated human activities. Novel, rapid and cost-effective DNA-based approaches are valuable to improve understanding of the biological communities and for biomonitoring in remote areas. Here, we evaluate the potential of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding for assessing the structure and distribution of fish communities by analysing sediments and water from 11 locations along the Jequitinhonha River catchment (Brazil). Each site was sampled twice, before and after a major rain event in a five-week period and fish diversity was estimated using high-through-put sequencing of 12S rRNA amplicons. In total, 252 Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) and 34 fish species were recovered, including endemic, introduced, and previously unrecorded species for this basin. Spatio-temporal variation of fish assemblages was detected, richness during the first campaign was nearly twice as high as in the second sampling round; though peaks of diversity were primarily associated with only four locations. No correlation between β-diversity and longitudinal distance or presence of dams was detected, but low species richness observed at sites located near dams indicates that these anthropogenic barriers might have an impact on local fish diversity. Unexpectedly high α-diversity levels recorded at the river mouth suggest that these sections should be further evaluated as putative “eDNA reservoirs” for rapid monitoring. By uncovering spatio-temporal changes, unrecorded biodiversity components, and putative anthropogenic impacts on fish assemblages, we further strengthen the potential of eDNA metabarcoding as a biomonitoring tool, especially in regions often neglected or difficult to access.

AB  - Converting habitat for agricultural production threatens biodiversity loss worldwide and has significant implications for human well-being. Debates on how to conserve biodiversity as the demand for agriculture products rises is being informed by studies using habitat specificity as a proxy for sensitivity to land modification, assuming all species respond to habitat loss and fragmentation relative to their affinity towards the habitat type being converted. Here, we test this assumption among rodent assemblages on the Canadian Prairies, hypothesizing negative responses among grassland obligates and neutral or positive responses among habitat generalists to landscape change along a gradient of increasing agricultural intensity. We found complex, sometimes contradictory responses among rodent species, which depended on the magnitude of habitat loss that had occurred and did not always reflect each species’ relative affinity for grassland habitat. Our results suggest future studies should avoid assuming a single habitat type appropriately characterizes resource limitation among all species, and instead carefully consider which dimension of the ecological niche defines specificity for each species. Our results indicate habitat specificity is not always a reliable proxy for sensitivity to land modification, with significant implications for biodiversity conservation when used to inform agriculture and land use policies.

AB  - C2 photosynthesis is characterized by recapturing photorespiratory CO2 by RuBisCO in Kranz-like cells and is therefore physiologically intermediate between C3 and C4 photosynthesis. C2 can be interpreted as an evolutionary precursor of C4 and/or as the result of hybridization between a C3 and C4 lineage.We compared the expression of photosynthetic traits among populations of the Salsola divaricata agg. (C2) from humid subtropical to arid habitats on the coasts of the Canary Islands and Morocco and subjected them to salt and drought treatments. We screened for enhanced C4-like expression of traits related to habitat or treatment. We estimated species trees with a transcriptome dataset of Salsoleae and explored patterns of gene tree discordance. With phylogenetic networks and hybridization analyses we tested for hybrid origin of the Salsola divaricata agg.We observed distinct independent variation of photosynthetic traits within and among populations and no clear evidence for selection towards C4-like trait expression in more stressful habitats or treatments. We found reticulation and gene tree incongruence in Salsoleae supporting a putative hybrid origin of the Salsola divaricata agg.C2 photosynthesis in the Salsola divaricata agg. combines traits inherited from its C3 and C4 parental lineages and seems evolutionarily stable, possibly well adapted to a wide climatic amplitude.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

TI  - Acoustic community structure and seasonal turnover in tropical South Asian birds
AU  - Krishnan, Anand
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Birds produce diverse acoustic signals, with coexisting species occupying distinct ‘acoustic niches’ to minimize masking, resulting in overdispersion within acoustic space. In tropical regions of the world, an influx of migrants from temperate regions occurs during winter. The effects of these migrants on acoustic community structure and dynamics remain unstudied. Here, I show that in a tropical urban bird community, the influx of winter migrants is accompanied by a turnover of the acoustic community. However, in spite of this turnover, the acoustic community remains overdispersed in acoustic niche space. The winter acoustic community additionally exhibits lower frequency-band diversity, consistent with species singing less continuously, as well as lower phylogenetic diversity. My data thus suggests that acoustic niches and community structure are stable across seasons in spite of species turnover. Migrants occupy similar regions of acoustic space as residents, and are relatively closely related to some of these species. Their arrival therefore leads to greater phylogenetic clustering in the winter, and thus lower phylogenetic diversity, although the acoustic community remains overdispersed. Studying seasonal dynamics of acoustic communities thus provides valuable insight into assembly processes, as well as a potential framework for long-term monitoring of urban ecosystems.

TI  - Functional diversity metrics using kernel density <em>n</em>-dimensional hypervolumes
AU  - Mammola, Stefano
AU  - Cardoso, Pedro
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - The use of n-dimensional hypervolumes in trait-based ecology is rapidly increasing. By representing the functional space of a species or community as a Hutchinsonian niche, the abstract Euclidean space defined by a set of independent axes corresponding to individuals or species traits, these multidimensional techniques show great potential for the advance of functional ecology theory.In the panorama of existing methods for delineating multidimensional spaces, the R package hypervolume [Glob. Ecol. Biogeogr. (2014) 23:595–609] is currently the most used. However, functions for calculating the standard set of functional diversity (FD) indices—richness, divergence, and regularity—have not been developed within the hypervolume framework yet. This gap is delaying its full exploitation in functional ecology, meanwhile preventing the possibility to compare its performance with that of other methods.We develop a set of functions to calculate FD indices based on n-dimensional hypervolumes, including alpha (richness), beta (and respective components), dispersion, evenness, contribution, and originality. Altogether, these indices provide a coherent framework to explore the primary mathematical components of FD within a multidimensional setting. These new functions can work either with hypervolume objects or raw data (species presence or abundance and their traits) as input data, and are versatile in terms of input parameters and options.These functions are implemented within BAT (Biodiversity Assessment Tools), an R package for biodiversity assessments. As a coherent corpus of functional indices based on a common algorithm, it opens the possibility to fully explore the strengths of the Hutchinsonian niche concept in community ecology research.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - We introduce the AusTraits database - a compilation of measurements of plant traits for taxa in the Australian flora (hereafter AusTraits). AusTraits synthesises data on 375 traits across 29230 taxa from field campaigns, published literature, taxonomic monographs, and individual taxa descriptions. Traits vary in scope from physiological measures of performance (e.g. photosynthetic gas exchange, water-use efficiency) to morphological parameters (e.g. leaf area, seed mass, plant height) which link to aspects of ecological variation. AusTraits contains curated and harmonised individual-, species- and genus-level observations coupled to, where available, contextual information on site properties. This data descriptor provides information on version 2.1.0 of AusTraits which contains data for 937243 trait-by-taxa combinations. We envision AusTraits as an ongoing collaborative initiative for easily archiving and sharing trait data to increase our collective understanding of the Australian flora.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Sawfishes are considered one of the most endangered families of fishes in the world. Their diadromous ecology and vulnerability to fishing nets have brought most populations to the brink of collapse. Conservation of the surviving populations is hindered by the paucity of historic and contemporary catch and observational records, and assessments of suitable coastal and riverine habitats. Colombia and Panama are two of 14 countries considered as a high priority for the development of species-specific national legal protection of the critically endangered largetooth sawfish (Pristis pristis). To construct a baseline for the temporal and spatial distribution of the largetooth sawfish in Colombia and Panama, we collected historical records from museum databases and from literature over the past century, analysed available small-scale fisheries landings databases, and conducted interviews with fish workers in 38 locations across both countries. We found 257 records of sawfish occurrences across both countries between 1896 and 2015, with 69% of the records before the year 2000. The declining trend in the frequency of observations was corroborated by fishers, who reported fewer sawfish catches over the last 20 years. Using kernel density estimation of recent encounter locations, we identify potential hotspots that may represent extant populations of sawfish. These locations are broadly characterized by their remoteness and high mangrove forest cover. Given the length and cultural diversity of the Pacific coastlines of Colombia and Panama, and the inaccessibility of many of the communities, our findings provide important guidance to target rapid conservation and fisheries interventions to priority areas. We suggest that the relative success of community-managed fishing areas in the region makes this a valuable platform on which to build local stewardship of marine resources, while raising awareness of the need to safeguard critically endangered largetooth sawfish.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Microbes play a critical role in regulating the size, composition, and turnover of dissolved organic matter (DOM), which is one of the largest pools of carbon in aquatic ecosystems. Global change may alter DOM-microbe associations with implications for biogeochemical cycles, although disentangling these complex interactions remains a major challenge. Here we develop a framework called Energy-Diversity-Trait integrative Analysis (EDTiA) to examine the associations between DOM and bacteria along temperature and nutrient gradients in a manipulative field experiment on mountainsides in contrasting subarctic and subtropical climates. In both study regions, the chemical composition of DOM correlated with bacterial communities, and was primarily controlled by nutrients and to a lesser degree by temperature. At a molecular-level, DOM-bacteria associations depended strongly on the molecular traits of DOM, with negative associations indicative of decomposition as molecules are more biolabile. Using bipartite networks, we further demonstrated that negative associations were more specialized than positive associations indicative of DOM production. Nutrient enrichment promoted specialization of positive associations, but decreased specialization of negative associations particularly at warmer temperatures in subtropical climate. These global change drivers influenced specialization of negative associations most strongly via molecular traits, while both molecular traits and bacterial diversity similarly affected positive associations. Together, our framework provides a quantitative approach to understand DOM-microbe associations and wider carbon cycling across scales under global change.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AU  - Harris, Stephen E.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Urbanization significantly alters natural ecosystems and has accelerated globally. Urban wildlife populations are often highly fragmented by human infrastructure, and isolated populations may adapt in response to local urban pressures. However, relatively few studies have identified genomic signatures of adaptation in urban animals. We used a landscape genomics approach to examine signatures of selection in urban populations of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) in New York City. We analyzed 154,770 SNPs identified from transcriptome data from 48 P. leucopus individuals from three urban and three rural populations, and used outlier tests to identify evidence of urban adaptation. We accounted for demography by simulating a neutral SNP dataset under an inferred demographic history as a null model for outlier analysis. We also tested whether candidate genes were associated with environmental variables related to urbanization. In total, we detected 381 outlier loci and after stringent filtering, identified and annotated 19 candidate loci. Many of the candidate genes were involved in metabolic processes, and have well-established roles in metabolizing lipids and carbohydrates. Our results indicate that white-footed mice in NYC are adapting at the biomolecular level to local selective pressures in urban habitats. Annotation of outlier loci suggest selection is acting on metabolic pathways in urban populations, likely related to novel diets in cities that differ from diets in less disturbed areas.

AB  - Background Reef-building corals are critical species for sustaining coral reefs and are highly threatened by global climate change. However, relevant transcriptomic data largely rely on short-read sequencing, which severely limits the understanding of coral molecular mechanisms and leaves many important biological questions unresolved.Results We sequenced the full-length transcriptomes of four common and frequently dominant reef-building corals, including two Robusta clade species, Pocillopora damicornis and Pocillopora verrucosa, and two Complexa clade species, Acropora muricata and Montipora foliosa, using the PacBio Sequel II platform. We obtained information on gene functions, structures and expression profiles. Among them, a comparative analysis of biomineralization-related genes provided insights into the molecular basis of coral skeletal density. The gene expression profiles of the symbiote Symbiodiniaceae were also isolated and annotated from the holobiont sequence data; these profiles showed more highly convergent traits related to gene structure and expression level than those of coral hosts. Interestingly, we observed that intracellular algal cells share some evolutionary convergence between intracellular symbiosis in corals and intracellular digestion in amphioxus. Finally, a phylogenetic analysis of key circadian clock genes among 27 evolutionarily representative species indicated that there are four key members in early metazoans, including cry genes; Clock or Npas2; cyc or Arntl; and tim, while per, as the fifth member, occurs in Bilateria.Conclusions Our work overcomes the incompleteness of short-read sequencing and illuminates the molecular basis of calcification, symbiosis, and circadian genes, thus providing a foundation for further work on the manipulation of skeleton production or symbiosis to promote the survival of these important organisms.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AU  - Lindstrom, Jessica

AU  - Hamilton, Jill
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Restoration often advocates for the use of local seed in restoration, however increasingly new strategies have been proposed to incorporate diverse sources to maintain evolutionary potential within seed mixes. Increasing seed sources per species within a seed mix should increase genetic variation, however, few empirical studies have evaluated how seed source diversity impacts plant community composition following restoration. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the use of single or multi-source seed mix treatments to plant community diversity following restoration. Using 14 species commonly applied in grassland restoration, we examined plant community diversity following restoration comparing seed mixes with either one or five sources per species across two restoration sites in Minnesota and South Dakota, United States. Following seeding, species establishment and abundance were recorded to calculate plant diversity for each seed mix treatment. There were no major effects of seed mix treatment on community emergence and diversity observed, with the majority of plant establishment reflecting non-seeded species. However, site-specific differences were observed. Heterogeneous land-use history associated with the Minnesota site likely contributed to differences across the restoration treatments. In contrast, community diversity at the South Dakota site was homogeneous across seed mix treatments with changes in plant community influenced solely by early season species establishment. This suggests land-use history irrespective of seed mix treatment influences establishment and persistence, particularly in the first year following restoration. Future monitoring across seasons will be needed to evaluate if community diversity changes in response to seed mix treatment.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - In 1972, Robert May showed that diversity is detrimental to an ecosystem since, as the number of species increases, the ecosystem is less stable. This is the so-called diversity-stability paradox, which has been derived by considering a mathematical model with linear interactions between the species. Despite being in contradiction with empirical evidence, the diversity-stability paradox has survived the test of time for over 40+ years. In this paper we first show that this paradox is a conclusion driven solely by the linearity of the model employed in its derivation which allows for the neglection of the fixed point solution in the stability analysis. The linear model leads to an ill-posed solution and along with it, its paradoxical stability predictions. We then consider a model ecosystem with nonlinear interactions between species, which leads to a stable ecosystem when the number of species is increased. The saturating non linear term in the species interaction is analogous to a Hill function appearing in systems like gene regulation, neurons, diffusion of information and ecosystems The exact fixed point solution of this model is based on k-core percolation and shows that the paradox disappears. This theoretical result, which is exact and non-perturbative, shows that diversity is beneficial to the ecosystem in agreement with analyzed experimental evidence

AB  - In an increasingly anthropogenic world, native species face multiple interacting threats. Habitat fragmentation and domestic dogs are two such perturbations threatening terrestrial mammals globally. Here, we implemented a camera trap survey in the fragmented central valley/Andean foothills transition of the Los Lagos Region in Southern Chile to evaluate space use of native carnivores in a landscape comprised of patches of native forest amidst a matrix of pastureland. Using an occupancy modeling framework to account for imperfect detection, we examined the impacts of dogs and landscape metrics of fragmentation on three mesocarnivores – the foxes culpeo (Lycalopex culpaeus) and chilla (Lycalopex griseus) and the wild cat güiña (Leopardus guigna). Factors driving occupancy differed for each of the native species, while detection rates for both canid species increased with dog occupancy. We found that a small (12%) simulated increase in dog occupancy negatively impacted the spatial use of the culpeo. Habitat loss and fragmentation were positive drivers for the chilla and the dog, and indirectly impacted the culpeo through the domestic dog. The güiña did not respond to fragmentation and other habitat covariates or dog occupancy. Instead, all native carnivore species temporally partitioned diel activity with dogs. We highlight that the effects of dogs or fragmentation are not ubiquitous across the carnivore guild with varied tolerance. However, future conditions of increased fragmentation and habitat loss will likely increase the potential contact between domestic dogs and native carnivores.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The identities of most arthropod associates of cynipid-induced oak galls in the western Palearctic are generally known. However, a comprehensive accounting of associates has been performed for only a small number of the galls induced by the estimated 700 species of cynipid gall wasp in the Nearctic. This gap in knowledge stymies many potential studies of diversity, coevolution, and community ecology, for which oak gall systems are otherwise ideal models. We report rearing records of insects and other arthropods from more than 527,306 individual galls representing 201 different oak gall types collected from 32 oak tree species in North America. Of the 201 gall types collected, 155 produced one or more animals. A total of 151,075 animals were found in association with these 155 gall types, and of these 61,044 (40.4%) were gall wasps while 90,031 (59.6%) were other arthropods. We identified all animals to superfamily, family, or, where possible, to genus. We provide raw numbers and summaries of collections, alongside notes on natural history, ecology, and previously published associations for each taxon. For eight common gall-associated genera (Synergus, Ceroptres, Euceroptres, Ormyrus, Torymus, Eurytoma, Sycophila, and Euderus), we also connect rearing records to gall wasp phylogeny, geography, and ecology - including host tree and gall location (host organ), and their co-occurrence with other insect genera. Though the diversity of gall wasps and the large size of these communities is such that many Nearctic oak gall-associated insects still remain undescribed, this large collection and identification effort should facilitate the testing of new and varied ecological and evolutionary hypotheses in Nearctic oak galls.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Advances in artificial intelligence for computer vision hold great promise for increasing the scales at which ecological systems can be studied. The distribution and behavior of individuals is central to ecology, and computer vision using deep neural networks can learn to detect individual objects in imagery. However, developing supervised models for ecological monitoring is challenging because it needs large amounts of human-labeled training data, requires advanced technical expertise and computational infrastructure, and is prone to overfitting. This limits application across space and time. One solution is developing generalized models that can be applied across species and ecosystems. Using over 250,000 annotations from 13 projects from around the world, we develop a general bird detection model that achieves over 65% recall and 50% precision on novel aerial data without any local training despite differences in species, habitat, and imaging methodology. Fine-tuning this model with only 1000 local annotations increase these values to an average of 84% recall and 69% precision by building on the general features learned from other data sources. Retraining from the general model improves local predictions even when moderately large annotation sets are available and makes model training faster and more stable. Our results demonstrate that general models for detecting broad classes of organisms using airborne imagery are achievable. These models can reduce the effort, expertise, and computational resources necessary for automating the detection of individual organisms across large scales, helping to transform the scale of data collection in ecology and the questions that can be addressed.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AU  - Whitney, Kaitlin Stack

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - After the US federal government created a national pollinator protection plan in 2015, many states followed with their own. Since their goal is to promote pollinating insect conservation, we wanted to know whether the state plans are using best practices for evidence-based science policy. In early 2019 we found and downloaded every existing, publicly available US state pollinator protection plan. We then used content analysis to assess the goals, scope, and implementation of state-level pollinator protection plans across the US. This analysis was conducted using three distinct frameworks for evidence-based policymaking: US Department of Interior Adaptive Resources Management (ARM), US Environmental Protection Agency management pollinator protection plan (MP3) guidance, and Pew Trusts Pew-MacAthur Results First Project elements of evidence-based state policymaking (PEW) framework. Then we scored them using the framework criteria, to assess whether the plans were using known best practices for evidence based policymaking. Of the 31 states with a state pollinator plan, Connecticut was the state with the lowest total score across the three evaluation frameworks. The state with the highest overall scores, across the three frameworks, was Missouri. Most states did not score highly on the majority of the frameworks. Overall, many state plans were lacking policy elements that address monitoring, evaluation, and adjustment. These missing elements impact states’ ability to achieve their conservation goals. Our results indicate that states can improve their pollinator conservation policies to better match evidence-based science policy guidance, regardless of which framework is used.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AU  - Aron, Serge
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Group diversity is usually associated with a reduced risk of disease outbreak and a slower rate of pathogen transmission. In social insects, multiple mating by queens (polyandry) evolved several times although reducing worker’s inclusive fitness. One major hypothesis suggests that polyandry has been selected for to mitigate the risk of outbreak thanks to increased genetic diversity within colonies. We investigated this hypothesis in the ant Cataglyphis mauritanica, in which nestmate workers are produced by several clonal, single-mated queens. Using natural colonies, we correlated genetic diversity with worker survival to a fungal entomopathogen. We further tested whether workers from different paternal lineages (but a common maternal genome) show differential resistance in experimentally singleor multiple-patriline groups, and whether an increased number of patrilines in a group improved disease incidence.We show that workers from distinct patrilines vary in their resistance to pathogen in single-patriline colonies, but the difference among patrilines disappears when they are mixed in multiple-patriline colonies. Furthermore, pathogen resistance was affected by the number of patrilines in a group, with twoand three-patriline groups being more resistant than single-patriline groups. However, resistance did not differ between groups made of two and three patrilines; similarly, it was not associated with genetic diversity in natural colonies. Overall, our results suggest that collective disease defenses might homogenize workers’ resistance from different patrilines and, thereby, stabilize colony resistance.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Agriculture-dominated landscapes harbor significantly diminished biodiversity, but are also areas in which significant gains in biodiversity can be achieved. Planting or retaining woody vegetation along field margins can provide farmers with valuable ecosystem services while simultaneously benefitting biodiversity. However, when crops are damaged by the biodiversity harbored in such vegetation, farmers are reluctant to incorporate field margin habitat onto their land and may even actively remove such habitats, at cost to both farmers and non-target wildlife. We investigated how damage by both insect pests (sunflower moth, Homoeosoma electellum) and avian pests to sunflower (Helianthus annuus) seed crops varied as a function of bird abundance and diversity, as well as by landscape-scale habitat. Surveys for insect damage, avian abundance, and bird damage were carried out over two years in 30 different fields on farms in California’s Sacramento Valley. The mean percentage of moth-damaged sunflowers sampled was nearly four times higher in fields that had bare or weedy margins (23.5%) compared to fields with woody vegetation (5.9%) and decreased in both field types as landscape-scale habitat complexity declined. Birds damaged significantly fewer sunflower seeds (2.7%) than insects, and bird damage was not affected by field margin habitat type, landscape-scale habitat variables, or avian abundance, but was significantly higher along field edges compared to ≥ 50m from the field edge. Avian species richness nearly doubled in fields with woody margin habitat compared to fields with bare/weedy margins in both the breeding season and in fall. These results indicate that the benefits of planting or retaining woody vegetation along sunflower field margins could outweigh the ecosystem disservices related to bird damage, while simultaneously increasing the biodiversity value of intensively farmed agricultural landscapes.

AB  - Environmental niche models predict the presence of the invasive Argentine ant in north-western Europe, especially along all the French Atlantic coast. Yet, the species has never been observed North from the 45th parallel in Europe, suggesting either that current models are wrong or that Argentine ants are already spreading north inconspicuously. Here, we report a three-hectare wide colony of Argentine ants, detected in 2016 in Nantes, France, which is 300 km north of the former northern-most outdoor population of this species in Europe. COI sequencing revealed that the haplotype of this new colony is the same as the one found in the so-called Catalonian supercolony, which is distinct from the haplotype found over most of the species range in Europe. Our discovery confirms models’ predictions that Argentine ants can colonize north-western Europe and suggests that they might have already reached several other locations along the French Atlantic coast. Detection surveys should be conducted in order to assess Argentine ants’ invasion patterns in Western France, particularly in high introduction risk areas such as major cities and maritime ports.

AB  - Human consumption and management of land, i.e., how people transmit to a landscape as a source of livelihood, shelter, recreation, or industry, are powerful forces shaping patterns and dynamics in human-occupied landscapes. Understanding and managing landscape change, therefore, requires a thorough knowledge of the developmental processes the area is undergoing, causing the change in the land use pattern over time. In this study land use/cover dynamics of the Central Highland of Deccan Peninsula and Semi-Arid zone of Gujarat Rajputana bio-geographic regions of India was assessed using a combination of hybrid classification, markov analysis approach within the time frame of 2000-2013. In this time frame, major changes have been identified in dense forest, open forest, cropland, fallow land and in the barren landforms. The landscape has witnessed a substantial increase in built-up areas from 31317 sq. km. in 2000 to 52338 sq. km in 2013. The scrubland has largely declined from 35713.06 sq. km in 2000 to 23003.88 sq.km in 2013; it might have resulted from the transition of scrubland to the fallow land which was predicted as more than 70% in the first phase and more than 30% in the later phase. The area under dense forest constantly decreased in the studied time (84027 sq. km to 71225.37 sq. km). The Markov analysis estimated a probability of changing of open forest types to fallow land (36% in 2000-2006 and 20% in 2006-2013). As the environmental damage is irreversible due to industrialization, therefore a sound strategy needs to be implemented for sustainable use of natural resources that can go hand in hand.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - The range of the invasive alien hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax, has been continuously expanding since its invasion of Korea in 2003. Here, we compared the aggressive behaviors and body size of V. velutina nigrithorax with five native hornet species to identify the interspecific hierarchies that contributes to the spread of this species. Aggressive behaviors were classified into 11 categories and each interaction was scored as a win, loss, or tie. As a result, V. velutina was superior to V. simillima in 153 fights where V. velutina won 71% and showed a high incidence of threatening behavior. V. mandarinia outperformed V. velutina in 104 fights where V. mandarinia won 91% and grappling behavior was common. V. analis was superior to V. velutina in 67 fights where V. analis won 76% and showed a high amount of threatening behavior. V. crabro was superior to V. velutina in 93 fights where V. crabro won 73% and showed a high rate of threatening behavior. V. dybowskii was superior to V. velutina in 132 fights where V. dybowskii won 91%, and showed a high rate of threatening and grappling behaviors. The body size of V. velutina was larger than V. simillima (although not statistically significant) and smaller than all other Vespa species. Therefore, according to the results of this study, the low interspecific hierarchies of V. velutina seems to be a major cause of slower spreading rates than it has shown in Europe. However, over time, its density has gradually increased within the forest, in which it seems to be overcoming its disadvantages and expanding its range, possibly as large colonies and good flying abilities make it easier to secure food.

AB  - The introduction of non-native species into new habitats is one of the foremost risks to global biodiversity. Here, we evaluate a recent invasion of wild tomato (Solanum pimpinellifolium) onto the Galápagos islands from a population genomic perspective, using a large panel of novel collections from the archipelago as well as historical accessions from mainland Ecuador and Peru. We infer a recent invasion of S. pimpinellifolium on the islands, largely the result of a single event from central Ecuador which, despite its recency, has rapidly spread onto several islands in the Galápagos. By reconstructing patterns of local ancestry throughout the genomes of invasive plants, we uncover evidence for recent hybridization and introgression between S. pimpinellifolium and the closely related endemic species Solanum cheesmaniae. Two large introgressed regions overlap with known fruit color loci involved in carotenoid biosynthesis. Instead of red fruits, admixed individuals with endemic haplotypes at these loci have orange fruit colors that are typically characteristic of the endemic species. We therefore infer that introgression explains the observed trait convergence. Moreover, we infer roles for two independent loci in driving this pattern, and a likely history of selection favoring the repeated phenotypic transition from red to orange fruits. Together, our data reconstruct a complex history of invasion, expansion, and gene flow among wild tomatoes on the Galápagos islands. These findings provide critical data on the evolutionary importance of hybridization during colonization and its role in influencing conservation outcomes.Significance Statement The isolation and unique diversity of the Galápagos Islands provide numerous natural experiments that have enriched our understanding of evolutionary biology. Here we use population genomic sequencing to reconstruct the timing, path, and consequences of a biological invasion by wild tomato onto the Galápagos. We infer that invasive populations originated from a recent human-mediated migration event from central Ecuador. Our data also indicate that invasive populations are hybridizing with endemic populations, and that this has led to some invasive individuals adopting both fruit color genes and the fruit color characteristic of the endemic island species. Our results demonstrate how hybridization can shape patterns of trait evolution over very short time scales, and characterize genetic factors underlying invasive success.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Aim We present a Constraint-based Model of Dynamic Island Biogeography (C-DIB) that predicts how species functional traits interact with dynamic environments to determine the candidate species available for local community assembly on real and habitat islands through time.Location Real and habitat islands globally.Methods We develop the C-DIB model concept, synthesize the relevant literature, and present a toolkit for evaluating model predictions for a wide variety of “island” systems and taxa.Results The C-DIB model reveals that as islands cycle between phases of increasing or decreasing size and connectivity to a source pool, the dominant process driving species’ presence or absence switches between colonization and extinction. Both processes are mediated by interactions between organismal traits and environmental constraints. Colonization probability is predicted by a species’ ability to cross the intervening matrix between a population source and the island; population persistence (or extinction) is predicted by the minimum spatial requirements to sustain an isolated population. The non-random distributions of mammals on islands of the Sunda Shelf and Great Basin “sky islands” provide example study systems for evaluating the C-DIB model.Main conclusions Because different suites of traits impose constraints on the processes of colonization and extinction, similar environmental conditions can host different candidate species despite the same predicted richness. Thus, the model exemplifies the specific yet underappreciated role of hysteresis –the dependency of outcomes not only on the current system state –but also the historical contingency of environmental change in affecting populations and communities in insular systems.

AB  - Somatostatin and its related peptides (SSRPs) form an important family of hormones with diverse physiological roles. The ubiquitous presence of SSRPs in vertebrates and several invertebrate deuterostomes suggests an ancient origin of the SSRP signaling system. However, the existence of SSRP genes outside of deuterostomes has not been established and the evolutionary history of this signaling system remains poorly understood. Our recent discovery of SSRP-like toxins (consomatins) in venomous marine cone snails (Conus) suggested the presence of a homologous signaling system in mollusks and potentially other protostomes. Here we identify the molluscan SSRP-like signaling gene that gave rise to the consomatin family. Following recruitment into venom, consomatin genes experience strong positive selection and repeated gene duplications resulting in the formation of a hyper-diverse family of venom peptides. Intriguingly, the largest number of consomatins was found in worm-hunting species (&gt; 400 sequences), indicating a homologous system in annelids, another large protostome phylum. Comprehensive sequence mining enabled the identification of orthologous SSRP-like sequences (and their corresponding orphan receptor) in annelids and several other protostome phyla. These results establish the existence of SSRP-like sequences in many major branches of bilaterians, including xenacoelomorphs, a phylum believed to have emerged before the divergence of protostomes and deuterostomes, ~ 600 My ago. Finally, having a large set of predator-prey SSRP sequences available, we show that while the cone snail’s signaling SSRP-like genes are under purifying selection, in striking contrast, the consomatin genes experience rapid directional selection to target receptors in a changing mix of prey.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

Still, holistic approaches to national assessments of large old trees are scarse in the scientific literature. Here we propose and apply a holistic framework to understand the distribution of large old trees, the formal regulations targeting the conservation of large old trees and the ways large old trees are present in the popular news in Romania. There were 4032 large old tree records in Romania most of the records being concentrated in the Central and North-Western part of Romania. The number of tree records decreases with the decreasing terrain accessibility. Almost 50% of the large old tree records are in areas not covered by nature conservation regulations and 2/3 of the terrestrial protected areas have no open access large old tree records, so far. We identified five formal regulations which could be relevant for large old tree conservation in Romania, however, only two of these explicitly targets large old trees. The lack of knowledge and interest, the lack of expertize, institutional capacity, vested interests (corruption) and inconsistencies within the regulations are the major barriers in the formal protection of large old trees. We also identified several opportunities for the local initiatives to protect large old trees, based on the current legislative frameworks. We identified 259 internet news targeting large old trees in Romania which reveals a wide range of values and concerns associated to large old trees at the level of the local communities. While discussing our results we highlight the benefits of a wider adoption of our approach for science, decision making and local initiatives to save large old trees.

AB  - In the face of human-caused biodiversity crisis, understanding the theoretical basis of conservation efforts of endangered species and populations has become increasingly important. According to population genetics theory, population subdivision helps organisms retain genetic diversity, crucial for adaptation in a changing environment. Habitat shape is thought to be important for generating and maintaining population subdivision, but empirical cases are needed to test this assumption. We studied Saimaa ringed seals, landlocked in a labyrinthine lake and recovering from a drastic bottleneck, by whole-genome sequencing 105 individuals and additional individuals from three other ringed seal subspecies. We analyzed the distribution of variation and genetic relatedness among the individuals in relation to the habitat shape. Despite a severe history of a genetic bottleneck with prevalent homozygosity in Saimaa ringed seals, we found evidence for population structure mirroring the subregions of the lake. Highlighting the significance of habitat connectivity in conservation biology and the power of genomic tools in understanding its impact, genome-wide analyses showed that the subpopulations had retained unique variation and largely complementary patterns of homozygosity. Integration of genetic analyses in conservation decisions gives hope to Saimaa ringed seals and other endangered species in fragmented habitats.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Viral discovery studies in wild animals often rely on cross-sectional surveys at a single time point. As a result, our understanding of the temporal stability of wild animal viromes remains poorly resolved. While studies of single host-virus systems indicate that host and environmental factors influence seasonal virus transmission dynamics, comparable insights for whole viral communities in multiple hosts are lacking. Leveraging non-invasive faecal samples from a long-term wild rodent study, we characterised viral communities of three common European rodent species (Apodemus sylvaticus, A. flavicollis, and M. glareolus) living in temperate woodland over a single year. Our findings indicate that a substantial fraction of the rodent virome is seasonally transient and associated with vertebrate or bacteria hosts. Further analyses of one of the most abundant virus families, Picornaviruses, show pronounced temporal changes in viral richness and diversity, which were associated with concurrent and up to ∼3-month lags in host density, ambient temperature, rainfall and humidity, suggesting complex feedbacks from the host and environmental factors on virus transmission and shedding in seasonal habitats. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of understanding the seasonal dynamics of wild animal viromes in order to better predict and mitigate zoonotic risks.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Throughout the world, wetlands have experienced degradation and declines in areal coverage. Fortunately, recognition of the value of wetlands has generated interest in preserving and restoring them. Post-restoration monitoring is necessary to analyze success or failure, thereby informing subsequent management decisions. Restoration of oxbow wetlands has become the focus of targeted restoration efforts to promote recovery of biodiversity and sensitive species, and to enhance ecosystem services. The fish communities of oxbows have been the subject of many monitoring studies. However, an optimal method for monitoring the fish communities of oxbows has not been described, thereby limiting our capacity to effectively manage these ecosystems. We compared four sampling methodologies (backpack electrofishing, fyke netting, minnow trapping, and seining) for fish community data collection with a primary objective of determining an optimal method for sampling fish communities in small oxbow wetlands. Seining and fyke netting were determined to be optimal methods for sampling oxbow fish communities. Backpack electrofishing and minnow trapping produced lower total catch and taxonomic richness values than seining and fyke netting. Although seining and fyke netting produced similar taxonomic diversity and abundance values, qualitative analysis revealed that seining caused greater habitat disturbance and potential stress to fish. Therefore, consideration must be given to how species present (especially sensitive species) within the wetland could be impacted by sampling disturbance when choosing between seining and fyke netting.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Emergent neutrality (EN) suggests that species must be sufficiently similar or sufficiently different in their niches to avoid interspecific competition. Such a scenario results in a transient pattern with clumps and gaps of species abundance along the niche axis (e.g., represented by body size). From this perspective, clumps are groups of coexisting species with negligible fitness differences and stochastic abundance fluctuations. Plankton is an excellent model system for developing and testing ecological theories, especially those related to size structure and species coexistence. We tested EN predictions using the phytoplankton community along the course of a tropical river considering (i) body size structure, (ii) functional clustering of species in terms of morphology-based functional groups (MBFG), and (iii) the functional similarity among species concerning their functional traits. Two main clumps in the body size axis (clump I and II) were conspicuous through time and were detected in different stretches of the river. Clump I comprised medium-sized species from the MBFGs IV, V, and VI while clump II included large-bodied species from the MBFGs V and VI. Pairwise differences in species biovolume correlated with species functional similarity when the whole species pool was considered, but not among species within the same clump. Although clumps comprised multiple MBFGs, the dominant species within the clump belonged always to the same MBFG. Also, within-clump species biovolume increased with functional distinctiveness considering both seasons and stretches, except the lower course. These results suggest that species within clumps behave in a quasi-neutral state, but even minor shifts in trait composition may affect species biovolume. Our findings point that EN belongs to the plausible mechanisms explaining community assembly in river ecosystems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AU  - Morand, Serge

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - The greatly accelerated economic growth during the Anthropocene has resulted in astonishing improvements in many aspects of human well-being, but has also caused the acceleration of risks, such as the interlinked biodiversity and climate crisis. Here, we report on another risk: the accelerated infectious disease risk associated with the number and geographic spread of human infectious disease outbreaks. Using the most complete, reliable, and up-to-date database on human infectious disease outbreaks (GIDEON), we show that the number of disease outbreaks, the number of diseases involved in these outbreaks, and the number of countries affected have increased during the entire Anthropocene. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of these outbreaks is becoming more globalized in the sense that the overall modularity of the disease networks across the globe has decreased, meaning disease outbreaks have become increasingly pandemic in their nature. This decrease in modularity is correlated with the increase in air traffic. We finally show that those countries and regions which are most central within these disease networks tend to be countries with higher GDPs. Therefore, one cost of increased global mobility and greater economic growth is the increased risk of disease outbreaks and their faster and wider spread. We briefly discuss three different scenarios which decision-makers might follow in light of our results.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The future of land use and cover change in Brazil, in particular due to deforestation and forest restoration processes, is critical for the future of global climate and biodiversity, given the richness of its five biomes. These changes in Brazil depend on the interlink between global factors, due to its role as one of the main exporters of commodities in the world, and the national to local institutional, socioeconomic and biophysical contexts. Aiming to develop scenarios that consider the balance between global and local factors, a new set of land use change scenarios for Brazil were developed, aligned with the global structure Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCPs) developed by the global change research community. The narratives of the new scenarios align with SSP1/RCP 1.9, SSP2/RCP 4.5, and SSP3/RCP 7.0. The scenarios were developed combining the LuccME spatially explicit land change allocation modeling framework and the INLAND surface model to incorporate the climatic variables in water deficit. Based on detailed biophysical, socio-economic and institutional factors for each biome in Brazil, we have created spatially-explicit scenarios until 2050, considering the following classes: forest vegetation, grassland vegetation, planted pasture, agriculture, mosaic of small land uses, and forestry. The results aim at regionally detailing global models and could be used both regionally to support decision-making, but also to enrich global analysis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Invasive freshwater crayfish are spreading rapidly across the world. Here, we report the first record of Australian redclaw crayfish, Cherax quadricarinatus (von Martens 1868) in Hong Kong, China. Identification of the captured crayfish was confirmed using external morphological features and molecular analyses. A total of 49 crayfish were captured from a stream pool and a reservoir in Pok Fu Lam Country Park using dip nets and funnel traps. The captured C. quadricarinatus ranged from 17.20 mm to 56.40 mm (mean = 30.70) in carapace length and the sex ratio was 1:1. Since this species is globally recognized as an invasive species, a comprehensive survey on its status and invasion front, an investigation into its potential ecological impacts, as well as the formulation of a monitoring and removal strategy, are warranted.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - As the environment becomes increasingly altered by human development, the importance of understanding the ways in which wildlife interact with modified landscapes is becoming clear. Areas such as industrial sites are sometimes presumed to have little conservation value, but many of these sites have areas of less disturbed habitats around their core infrastructure, which could provide ideal conditions to support some species, such as mesocarnivores. We conducted the first assessments of the density of serval (Leptailurus serval) at the Secunda Synfuels Operations plant, South Africa. We ran three camera trap surveys to estimate serval density using a spatially explicit capture recapture framework. Servals occurred at densities of 76.20-101.21 animals per 100 km2, which are the highest recorded densities for this species, presumably due to high abundance of prey and the absence of persecution and/or competitor species. Our findings highlight the significant conservation potential of industrialised sites, and we suggest that such sites could help contribute towards meeting conservation goals.

AB  - Aim Biogeographic regionalization has fascinated biogeographers and ecologists for centuries and is endued with new vitality by evolutionary perspectives. However, progress is scant for most insect groups due to shortfalls in distribution and phylogenetic information, namely Wallacean and Darwinian shortfalls respectively. Here, we used the western Palearctic ants as the case to tackle these shortfalls and test their biogeographic structure through novel distribution data and phylogenetic approaches.Location Western Palearctic realm.Taxon Ants (Formicidae).Methods Firstly, we developed a refined database integrating the occurrences of 747 ant species across 207 regions of the western Palearctic realm, based on newly expert-validated records derived from the existing global ant biodiversity informatics. Using range estimates for these species derived from polygons and species distribution modelling, we produced species assemblages in 50 × 50 km grid cells. We calculated taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover of ant assemblages, performing hierarchical clustering analysis using the Simpson dissimilarity index to delineate biogeographic structure.Results At both the regional list- and grid assemblage-levels, the Mediterranean has higher turnover and more biogeographic regions than northern Europe, both taxonomically and phylogenetically. Delineations based on grid assemblages detected more detailed biogeographic transitions, while those based on regional lists showed stronger insularity in biogeographic structure. The phylogenetic regionalization suggested closer but varied affinities between assemblages in comparison to the taxonomic approach.Main conclusions Here, we integrated expert-validated regional lists, species distribution modelling, and a recent phylogeny to tackle Wallacean and Darwinian shortfalls for an important insect group by developing a next-generation map of biogeographic regionalization for the western Palearctic ants. The results of this study suggest strong constraints from geographic barriers and potential effects of climatic history on ant distributions and evolutionary history, and also provide baseline spatial information for future investigations of regional insect distributions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Aim Leaves display a remarkable variety of shapes, each with potential ecological advantages in certain climates. Studies correlating leaf shape with either climate or height constraints have focused on intraspecific variation, while the macroecological drivers of shape remain poorly known. Here, we determine associations between climate and plant height with the evolution of leaf shape in a lineage with high species and morphological diversity.Location Global.Time period Cretaceous to contemporary.Major taxa studied Palms (Arecaceae).Methods We apply a Bayesian phylogenetic mixed model to test for associations between climate and leaf shape (entire, pinnate, palmate, and costapalmate). We further reconstruct the ancestral leaf shape using multistate speciation and extinction models and compare the frequency of shapes with global temperatures through time.Results We find that plant height associates with dissected shapes, and that annual precipitation correlates with pinnate shapes. The ancestral leaf shape is likely entire or polymorphic. Pinnate lineages originated multiple times after transitions from entire-leaved to either polymorphic (species with entire-leaved or pinnate individuals) or pinnate shapes.Main conclusions Palms that are tall and live in humid regions are more likely to have pinnate leaves. Through geological time scales, temperature did not play a role in determining leaf shapes. This study contributes to our understanding of how the diversity of leaf shapes is linked to biological and climatic factors.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Knowledge of species ages and their distribution enhance our understanding of processes that create and maintain species diversity at both local and regional levels. The largest family of freshwater mussels (Unionidae), reach their highest species diversity in drainages of the southeastern united states. By sequencing multiple loci from mussel species distributed throughout the drainages in this region, we attempt to uncover historical patterns of divergence and determine the role of vicariance events on the species formation in mussels and extend our hypothesis to freshwater animals in general. We analyzed 346 sequences from five genera encompassing 37 species. Species were sampled across 12 distinct drainages ending either in the Atlantic Ocean or the Gulf of Mexico. Overall the topologies of the different genera returned phylogenetic trees that were congruent with geographically contiguous drainages. The most common pattern was the grouping between the Atlantic slope and gulf coast drainages, however the Tennessee drainage was often the exception to this pattern grouping with the Atlantic slope. Most mussel species find a most recent common ancestor within a drainage before finding an ancestor between drainages. This supports the hypothesis of allopatric divergence followed by later burst of speciation within a drainage. Our estimated divergence times for the Atlantic-Gulf split agree with other studies estimating vicariance in fish species of the Atlantic and gulf coast.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Two species of larval parasitoids of the globally invasive fruit pest, Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae), Leptopilina japonica and Ganaspis brasiliensis (both Hymenoptera: Figitidae), were detected in British Columbia, Canada in 2019. Both are presumed to have been unintentionally introduced from Asia, however; the extent of their establishment across different habitats with diverse host plants used by D. suzukii was unclear. In addition, there was no knowledge of the temporal dynamics of parasitism of D. suzukii by these two parasitoids. We repeatedly sampled the fruits of known host plants of D. suzukii over the entire 2020 growing season in British Columbia. We documented the presence of L. japonica and G. brasiliensis and estimated the apparent percentage of D. suzukii parasitized. Across a large region of southwestern British Columbia, both L. japonica and G. brasiliensis were found to be very common across a variety of mostly unmanaged habitats over the entire course of the season (May-October) in the fruits of most host plants known to host D. suzukii larvae. The two parasitoids were responsible for more than 98% of D. suzukii larval parasitism and usually co-existed. Parasitism of D. suzukii was variable among hosts plants and sites (0-66% percent parasitism) and appeared to be time-structured. Our study demonstrates that the close association between the two larval parasitoids and D. suzukii that exists in Asia has evidently been reconstructed in North America, resulting in the highest parasitism levels of D. suzukii yet recorded outside of its area of origin.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - El Niño Southern Oscillation global coral bleaching events are increasing in frequency; however, the severity of bleaching is not geographically uniform. There were two major objectives of the present project: 1) assess the state of reefs and coral health at several sites and 2) explore water quality and climate change impacts on Timorese reefs. The impacts of climate change (principally by following coral mortality) were surveyed on coral reefs before and after the 2016–2017 underwater heatwave, using temperature loggers deployed between surveys which were compared to Coral Reef Watch (CRW) experimental virtual station sea surface temperature (SST). CRW is an important and widely used tool; however, we found the SST was significantly warmer (&gt; 1°C) than in situ temperature during the austral summer accruing 5.79 degree heating weeks. In situ temperature showed no accumulation. Change in coral cover between surveys was attributed to reef heterogeneity. There were significant differences in coral cover, coral diversity, and nutrient concentrations between site and depth and a low prevalence of disease recorded in both years. The comparison of temperature and SST indicate that bleaching stress in Timor-Leste is potentially mitigated by seasonal and oceanographic dynamics. This is corroborated by Timor-Leste’s location within the Indonesian ThroughFlow. Timor-Leste is a climate refugium and the immediate conservation work lies in the management of localized anthropogenic impacts on coral reefs such as sedimentation and fishing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Mutualistic interactions provide essential ecosystem functions, such as promoting and maintaining diversity. Understanding if functionally important mutualisms are resilient (able to resist and recover) to anthropogenic disturbance is important to understand the capacity for diversity to recover. Animal-mediated seed dispersal supports plant population growth and community structure, and disturbance of this function can threaten plant diversity and contribute to low resiliency. Ant-mediated seed dispersal mutualisms are particularly sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance, as they rely on one to a few high-quality dispersal partners. In North American eastern deciduous forests (NAEDF), ants in the genus Aphaenogaster are “keystone dispersers” of 30-40% of understory forbs adapted to dispersal by ants (myrmecochores). The majority of present day NAEDF have regenerated from previous disturbance in the form of historical land use change (HLUC), due to clearing for agriculture. Previous studies have revealed that myrmecochore diversity is not resilient to HLUC. Here, we ask if seed dispersal mutualisms are resilient to HLUC and if decreases in mutualistic interactions with partners, Aphaenogaster sp., or increases in antagonistic interactions cause degradation of function. In a large-scale natural experiment (20 sites), we measured seed removal, the abundance of mutualistic partners and other invertebrates interacting with seeds, myrmecochore cover and diversity, along with ant habitat and forest structure. We found lower and more variable seed removal in secondary forests compared to remnant forests. A path analysis of all forests revealed that abundance of mutualists was the primary determinant of variation in seed removal, and that seed damage by antagonists (invasive slugs) negatively affected dispersal and was higher in secondary forests. In a path analysis of remnant forests, the link between mutualist abundance and seed removal was absent, but present in the secondary forest path, suggesting that seed dispersal is more variable and dependent on mutualist abundance in secondary forests and is stable and high in remnant forests. Here we show that functional resilience to HLUC is variable and may impede recovery of understory plant communities. This work provides key insights on the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on mutualistic interactions and how the resilience of critical ecosystem functions impacts diversity resiliency.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Franciscana dolphins in Babitonga Bay represent the only population of that critically endangered species which is confined to an estuary. Surrounded by large cities and harbors, that environment presents intense human activities and potential impacts that may threaten the dolphins. Understanding their habitat use and distribution can inform mitigation of such impacts. Here we used acoustic data from sixty fixed passive acoustic monitoring stations, implemented between June and December 2018. The relationship between the occurrence of franciscanas and environmental variables was investigated with generalized additive mixed models. The selected model presented 51% of explained deviance and included “time of day”, “intensity of presence of Guiana dolphins”, “maximum slope”, and “bottom sediment”, among other less statistically significant variables. A daily distribution pattern was identified, with franciscanas remaining in the areas of greatest occurrence especially in the morning and seemed to prefer sandy bottom and flatter areas. Areas intensively used by Guyana dolphins were avoided. Additionally, we mapped their distribution using “Empirical Bayesian Kriging” to identify the main areas of occurrence and for foraging. Franciscanas are consistently predominant in the innermost region of the estuary, without expressive use of the entrance channel, but with a wider range in winter than in the spring. The area around the islands, between the north and south banks, represents an important foraging area, a behavior more frequent during dawn and night. This study provides important insights into critical habitat and behavioral patterns of franciscanas, especially this critically endangered population.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

TI  - Unclusterable, underdispersed arrangement of insect-pollinated plants in pollinator niche space
AU  - Herrera, Carlos M.
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Pollinators can mediate facilitative or competitive relationships between plant species, but the comparative importance of these two conflicting phenomena in shaping community-wide pollinator resource use remains unexplored. This paper examines the idea that the arrangement in pollinator niche space of plant species samples comprising complete or nearly complete regional or local plant communities can help to evaluate the relative importance of facilitation and competition as drivers of community-wide pollinator resource use. Pollinator composition data for insect-pollinated plants from the Sierra de Cazorla mountains (southeastern Spain), comprising 85% of families and ~95% of widely distributed insect-pollinated species, were used to address the following questions at regional (45 sites, 221 plant species) and local (one site, 73 plant species) spatial scales: (1) Do objectively identifiable plant species clusters occur in pollinator niche space ? Four different pollinator niche spaces were considered whose axes were defined by insect orders, families, genera and species; and (2) If all plant species form a single, indivisible cluster in pollinator niche space, Are they overdispersed or underdispersed relative to a random arrangement ? “Clusterability” tests failed to reject the null hypothesis that there was only one pollinator-defined plant species cluster in pollinator niche space, irrespective of spatial scale, pollinator niche space or pollinator importance measurement (proportions of pollinator individuals or flowers visited by each pollinator type). Observed means of pairwise interspecific dissimilarity in pollinator composition were smaller than randomly simulated values in the order-, family- and genus-defined pollinator niche spaces at both spatial scales, thus revealing significantly non-random, underdispersed arrangement of plant species within the single cluster existing in each of these pollinator niche spaces. In the undisturbed montane habitats studied, arrangement of insect-pollinated plant species in pollinator niche space did not support a major role for interspecific competition as a force shaping community-wide pollinator resource use by plants, but rather suggested a situation closer to the facilitation-dominated extreme in a hypothetical competition-facilitation gradient. Results also highlight the importance of investigations on complete or nearly complete insect-pollinated plant communities for addressing novel hypotheses on the ecology and evolution of plant-pollinator systems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Peptide hormones and neuropeptides form a diverse class of signaling molecules that control essential processes in animals. Despite several breakthroughs in peptide discovery, many signaling peptides remain undiscovered. Recently, we demonstrated the use of somatostatin-like toxins from cone snail venom to identify homologous signaling peptides in prey. Here, we demonstrate that this toxin-based approach can be systematically applied to the discovery of other unknown bilaterian signaling peptides. Using large sequencing datasets, we searched for homologies between cone snail toxins and putative peptides from several important model organisms representing the snails’ prey. We identified five toxin families that share strong similarities with previously unknown signaling peptides from mollusks and annelids. One of the peptides was also identified in rotifers, brachiopods, platyhelminths, and arthropods, and another was found to be structurally related to crustacean hyperglycemic hormone, a peptide not previously known to exist in Spiralia. Based on several lines of evidence we propose that these signaling peptides not only exist but serve important physiological functions. Finally, we propose that the discovery pipeline developed here can be more broadly applied to other systems in which one organism has evolved molecules to manipulate the physiology of another.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Protected areas are the cornerstones of global biodiversity conservation efforts1,2, but to fulfil this role they must be effective at conserving the ecosystems and species that occur within their boundaries. This is particularly imperative in tropical forest hotspots, regions that concentrate a major fraction of the world’s biodiversity while also being under intense human pressure3–5. But these areas strongly lack adequate monitoring datasets enabling to contrast biodiversity in protected areas with comparable unprotected sites6,7. Here we take advantage of the world’s largest citizen science biodiversity dataset – eBird8 – to quantify the extent to which protected areas in eight tropical forest biodiversity hotspots are effective at retaining bird diversity, and to understand the underlying mechanisms. We found generally positive effects of protection on the diversity of bird species that are forest-dependent, endemic to the hotspots, or threatened or Near Threatened, but not on overall bird species richness. Furthermore, we show that in most of the hotspots examined this is driven by protected areas preventing both forest loss and degradation. Our results support calls for increasing the extent and strengthening the management efforts within protected areas to reduce global biodiversity loss9–11.

TI  - Golden section hypothesis of macroevolution: unification of metabolic scaling and <em>Fibonacci</em> sequence
AU  - Yang, Xin G.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Golden section is a subtle technology from nature to split space, which is both extensive and mysterious. In recent years, some studies1-4 have begun to focus on metabolic scaling (B∝Mb) at the macroevolutionary scale, and some important trends have been revealed. To further answer the question of "where does b come from and where does it go in evolution", a golden section model of macroevolution was constructed by integrating metabolic scaling and Fibonacci sequence. The results showed that, (1) macroevolution at the boundary level was a highly ordered process from one-dimensional (prokaryotes) to five-dimensional evolution (fungi). Four-dimensional life5 was only the choice of animals. (2) b just was the syndrome of dimension application and metabolism realization of life following Fibonacci sequence; however, it indicated major evolution events in the macroevolution and the directions in secondary macroevolution. The logic and panorama of macroevolution therefore were re-outlined based on the idea of dimensional evolution and metabolic evolution. It was argued that the golden section model of macroevolution established a full-new logic system of dimensional and metabolic evolution, and provided a possible path for the unification of macroevolution and microevolution.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Historically, behavior studies have focused mainly on animals of two phyla in particular: Craniata and Arthropoda, however, behavioral research on alternative phyla like mollusks has been increasing because of the potential for research that these models present. When we talk about mollusk behavior, cephalopods are the first group that stands out, however, research on Mexico’s endemic species like Octopus maya, is still lacking. This octopus could help to reach a standardized model in neuroscience, because adapts well to laboratory conditions and has been successfully cultured through several generations. These characteristics provide a great advantage as a research model since they could reduce the number of variables that affect behavioral studies, something hard to control with a captured-wild octopus. Hence, in order to work properly with species like this, in research environments, it’s fundamental to know first the behaviors that this species can perform there. Therefore, the objective of this study was to elaborate an ethogram that describes the behavioral repertoire that O. maya displays in laboratory conditions. Thirteen individuals of O. maya (6-20g) were used and maintained in tanks with a closed circulation seawater system and illuminated with a red light of 30 lx in a 12:12 LD cycle. Nine of these individuals were used for an ad libitum sampling of behaviors to name, define, categorize and operationally describe them. The last four individuals were used to establish day/night activity patterns, (length and frequency of behaviors throughout the day). The obtained results showed that O. maya has a wide behavioral repertoire with at least twenty-three behaviors, which were included in six different behavioral categories. The obtained results showed that O. maya has a wide behavioral repertoire with at least twenty-three behaviors, which were organized in six different behavioral categories. Also, this species showed differentiated activity patterns between day and night, with peaks of activity, distribution, and frequencies of activity behaviors mainly during the light hours. These results showed that O. maya has behaviors comparable with other octopus species and support the proposal for its use as a viable research model. Knowing the behavioral repertoire of O. maya allows for better control in future behavioral studies using this model, provides the main tools to evaluate the organism’s health and status, and supports its use for research in neuroscience and cognition.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - While the theory of micro-evolution by natural selection assigns a crucial role to competition, its role in macroevolution is less clear. Phylogenetic evidence for a decelerating accumulation of lineages suggests a feedback of lineage diversity on diversification, i.e., ecological limits to diversification. However, does this feedback only occur between close relatives, or do distant relatives also influence their diversification? In other words: are there phylogenetic limits to these ecological limits? Islands form ideal systems to answer these questions, because their boundedness facilitates an overview of all potential competitors. The DAISIE (Dynamic Assembly of Island biota through Speciation Immigration and Extinction) framework allows for testing the presence of diversity-dependence on islands given phylogenetic data on colonization and branching times. The current inference models in DAISIE assume that this diversity-dependence only applies within a colonizing clade, which we term clade-specific (CS) diversity-dependence. Here we introduce a new DAISIE model that assumes that diversity-dependence applies to all species regardless of their ancestry, i.e. diversity-dependence applies both to species within the same clade and between different clades. We call this island-wide (IW) diversity-dependence. Here we present a method to compute a likelihood for this model and develop a statistical procedure based on likelihood ratio bootstrapping to compare it to the likelihood of the CS model in order to overcome biases known for standard model selection. We apply it to the diversification of Eleutherodactylus frogs on Hispaniola. Across the Greater Antilles archipelago, this radiation shows repeated patterns of diversification in ecotypes which are similar across clades. This could be suggestive of overlapping niche space and hence between-clade interactions, i.e. IW diversity-dependence. But it could also be suggestive of only within-clade interactions, because between-clade interactions would have blocked the same ecotype re-appearing. We find that the CS model fits the data much better than the IW model, indicating that different colonizations, while resulting in similar ecotypes, are sufficiently distinct to avoid interacting strongly. We argue that non-overlapping distributions between clades (both spatially and in terms of ecotypes) cannot be used as evidence of CS diversity-dependence, because this pattern may be a consequence of IW diversity-dependence. By contrast, by using phylogenetic data rather than distributional data our method does allow for inferring the phylogenetic limits to ecological limits to diversification. We discuss how our new IW model advances our understanding also in other ways, ranging from identifying priority effects to modelling the spread of an epidemic in island-like systems, such as schools or hospitals.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The negative effect of fragmentation is one of the main concerns in the study of biodiversity loss in landscape ecology. The use of the matrix has been considered an important factor because it can change the relationship of a population with the configuration of the landscape. A systematic way to assess the effect of matrix quality in fragmented landscapes could lead to a better understanding of how matrices can be used to suppress the negative effect of fragmentation. We built a computational individual-based model capable of simulating bi-dimensional landscapes with three types of land cover (habitat, suitable matrix and hostile matrix) and individuals that inhabit those landscapes. We explored in which situations changes in the proportion of the suitable matrix in the landscape and the degree of usability of this suitable matrix can mitigate the negative effect of fragmentation per se. We observed that (i) an increase in the matrix quality (increases in the suitable matrix proportion and/or usability) can suppress the fragmentation effect in 47% of the simulated scenarios; (ii) the less usable the matrix is the more of it is needed to suppress the fragmentation effect; (iii) there is a level of usability below which increasing the suitable matrix proportion does cause the fragmentation effect to cease. These results point toward a landscape management that considers the similarity of the matrix to the native habitat under management. We suggest that an index to measure the usability of elements of the matrix could be an important tool to further the use of computational models in landscape management.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Background Previous phylogeographic studies of the lion (Panthera leo) have improved our insight into the distribution of genetic variation, as well as a revised taxonomy which now recognizes a northern (Panthera leo leo) and a southern (Panthera leo melanochaita) subspecies. However, existing whole range phylogeographic studies on lions either consist of very limited numbers of samples, or are focused on mitochondrial DNA and/or a limited set of microsatellites. The geographic extent of genetic lineages and their phylogenetic relationships remain uncertain, clouded by massive sampling gaps, sex-biased dispersal and incomplete lineage sorting.Results In this study we present results of low depth whole genome sequencing and subsequent variant calling in ten lions sampled throughout the geographic range, resulting in the discovery of &gt;150,000 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). Phylogenetic analyses revealed the same basal split between northern and southern populations as well as four population clusters on a more local scale. Further, we designed a SNP panel, including 125 autosomal and 14 mitochondrial SNPs, which was tested on &gt;200 lions from across their range. Results allow us to assign individuals to one of these four major clades (West &amp; Central Africa, India, East Africa, or Southern Africa) and delineate these clades in more detail.Conclusions The results presented here, particularly the validated SNP panel, have important applications, not only for studying populations on a local geographic scale, but also for tracing samples of unknown origin for forensic purposes, and for guiding conservation management of ex situ populations. Thus, these genomic resources not only contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary history of the lion, but may also play a crucial role in conservation efforts aimed at protecting the species in its full diversity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.CITESConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and FloraDRCDemoratic Republic of the CongoEAZAEuropean Association of Zoos and AquariaFIVPleFeline Immunodeficiency VirusIUCNInternational Union for Conservation of NatureMLMaximum LikelihoodmtDNAmitochondrial DNANGSNext Generation SequencingNPNational ParknuDNAnuclear DNAPCAPrincipal Component AnalysisRSARepublic of South AfricaSNPSingle Nucleotide Polymorphism

AB  - A growing focus in microbial ecology is understanding of how beneficial microbiome function is created and maintained through both stochastic and deterministic assembly mechanisms. This study explores the role of both the environment and disease in regulating the composition of microbial species pools in the soil and local communities of an amphibian host. To address this, we compared the microbiomes of over 200 Plethodon cinereus salamanders along a 65km land-use gradient in the greater New York metropolitan area and paired these with associated soil cores. Additionally, we characterized the diversity of bacterial and fungal symbionts that putatively inhibit the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. We predicted that if soil functions as the main regional species pool to amphibian skin, variation in skin microbial community composition would correlate with changes seen in soil. We found that salamanders share many microbial taxa with their soil environment but that these two microbiomes exhibit key differences, especially in the relative abundances of the bacteria phyla Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria and the fungal phyla Ascomycota and genus Basidiobolus. Microbial community composition varied with changes in land-use associated factors such as canopy cover, impervious surface, and concentrations of the soil elements Al, Ni, and Hg, creating site-specific compositions. In addition, high dissimilarity among individual amphibian microbiomes across and within sites suggest that both stochastic and deterministic mechanisms guide assembly of microbes onto amphibian skin, with likely consequences in disease preventative function.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Animal movement and resource use are tightly linked. Investigating these links to understand how animals utilize space and select habitats is especially relevant in areas that have been affected by habitat fragmentation and agricultural conversion. We set out to explore the space use and habitat selection of Burmese pythons (Python bivittatus) in a patchy land use matrix dominated by agricultural crops and human settlements. We used radio telemetry to record daily locations of seven Burmese pythons over the course of our study period of approximately 22 months. We created dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models (dBBMMs) for all individuals, using occurrence distributions to estimate extent of movements and motion variance to reveal temporal patterns. Then we used integrated step selection functions to determine whether individual movements were associated with particular landscape features (aquatic agriculture, forest, roads, settlements, terrestrial agriculture, water), and whether there were consistent associations at the population level. Our dBBMM estimates suggested that Burmese pythons made use of small areas (98.97 ± 35.42 ha), with low mean individual motion variance characterized by infrequent moves and long periods at a single location. At both the individual and population level, Burmese pythons in the agricultural matrix were associated with aquatic environments. Only one individual showed a strong avoidance for human settlements which is troublesome from a human-wildlife conflict angle, especially as Burmese pythons have been observed entering human settlements and consuming livestock in our study site. Our study is one of the first to contribute to the knowledge of Burmese python ecology in their native range as the majority of studies have focused on invasive populations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Droughts increasingly threaten the world’s forests and their potential to mitigate climate change. In 2018–2019, Central European forests were hit by two consecutive hotter drought years, an unprecedented phenomenon that is likely to occur more frequently with climate change. Here, we examine tree growth and physiological stress responses (increase in carbon isotope composition; Δδ13C) to this consecutive drought based on tree-rings of dominant tree species in a Central European floodplain forest. Tree growth was not reduced for most species in 2018, indicating that water supply in floodplain forests can partly buffer meteorological water deficits. Drought stress responses in 2018 were comparable to former single drought years but the hotter drought in 2018 induced drought legacies in tree growth while former droughts did not. We observed strong decreases in tree growth and increases in Δδ13C across all tree species in 2019, which are likely driven by the cumulative stress both consecutive hotter droughts exerted. Our results show that consecutive hotter droughts pose a novel threat to forests under climate change, even in forest ecosystems with comparably high levels of water supply.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Growing urban expansion results in the alteration of ecological processes (i.e. predation) within trophic networks. Predation on herbivores is known to vary with the size of the area covered in vegetation, successional stage, altitude, and the structure of the predator community, but there are gaps in information regarding how this occurs in urban and suburban environments. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the predation pressure on artificial models of lepidopteran larvae varied with degree of urbanization, type of substrate, and group of predators (birds or arthropods) in Cali, Colombia. Five hundred and eighteen artificial larvae were placed in two areas of the city (urban vs. suburban) and in two types of substrate (leaf vs. stem) for 30 continuous days and with two replications over time. Total predation was measured as the number of models with evidence of attack by predators. The overall incidence of predation was 24.13%, and was significantly higher in the urban area (63.20%) when compared to the suburban area (36.80%). The leaf substrate was attacked significantly more than the stem (60% vs. 40%). The proportion of attacks carried out by birds was significantly higher (74.40%) than that carried out by arthropods (24.80%). Together, these results suggest that the incidence of predation varies with the disturbance caused by urbanization and by the type of substrate in which prey organisms are found. In addition, the study confirms that birds are the main controllers of herbivorous insects in urban environments.

However, genetic differentiation exists within this taxonomic level, putting genetically distinct populations at risk of local extinction. In seabirds, reproductive isolation is one of the principal drivers of genetic structure. In the Diablotin Black-capped Petrel Pterodroma hasitata, an endangered gadfly petrel endemic to the Caribbean, two phenotypes have been described: a smaller dark form and a heavier light form, which are genetically distinct. We hypothesized that color forms have a similar non-breeding distribution at sea but distinct nesting distributions.Location Western North Atlantic and northern Caribbean islands.Methods In May 2019, we captured 5 adult Black-capped Petrels of each phenotype at sea and equipped them with satellite transmitters. We used generalized linear mixed models to test the importance of phenotype on geographic distribution. Using kernel density estimations, we located use areas, quantified spatial overlap between forms, and assessed form-specific exposure to marine threats. Finally, we used tracking data to estimate the distribution and timing of nesting.Results Petrels were tracked for 11 – 255 d (mean = 102.1 d±74.2). During the non-breeding period, all individuals ranged from 28.4 – 43.0 degrees latitude. Phenotypes had significantly distinct non-breeding distributions. In the western North Atlantic, the dark form was exposed to more marine threats than the light form. We recorded two trips (1 individual of each form) to known breeding areas, with the light form initiating breeding 1.5 months before the dark form.Main conclusions Phenotypic differences in the Black-capped Petrel were linked to differences in nesting phenology, non-breeding marine distribution, and at-sea threat exposure. To sustain the species’ representation, redundancy, and resiliency in the light of environmental changes, it is likely that the evolutionary processes that resulted in genetic differentiation will also need to be conserved.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Herbarium collections shape our understanding of the world’s flora and are crucial for addressing global change and biodiversity conservation. The formation of such natural history collections, however, are not free from sociopolitical issues of immediate relevance. Despite increasing efforts addressing issues of representation and colonialism in natural history collections, herbaria have received comparatively less attention. While it has been noted that the majority of plant specimens are housed in the global North, the extent of this disparity has not been rigorously quantified to date. Here, by analyzing over 85 million specimen records and surveying herbaria across the globe, we assess the colonial legacy of botanical collections and how we may move towards a more inclusive future. We demonstrate that colonial exploitation has contributed to an inverse relationship between where plant biodiversity exists in nature and where it is housed in herbaria. Such disparities persist in herbaria across physical and digital realms despite overt colonialism having ended over half a century ago, suggesting ongoing digitization and decolonization efforts have yet to alleviate colonial-era discrepancies. We emphasize the need for acknowledging the inconvenient history of herbarium collections and the implementation of a more equitable, global paradigm for their collection, curation, and use.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Conservation interventions in developing countries are frequently thwarted by socio-economic agendas, severely limiting the scope and rigor of biodiversity and habitat conservation. Very few ecological assessments incorporate human interests in conservation prioritization, creating asynchrony between planning and implementation. For conservation actions to be logistically feasible, multiple criteria including ecological, social, economic and administrative aspects must be considered. Understanding how these different dimensions interact spatially is also important for gauging the potential for conservation success. Here, we use a guild of select mammalian carnivores (wild canids and hyenas) in India to (i) generate distribution maps at the spatial scale of administrative sub-districts, that is relevant to management, (ii) examine ecological, social and biogeographic factors associated with their distribution, quantify key threats, and identify areas important for their conservation, (iii) use prioritization tools for balancing habitat conservation, human needs and economic growth, and (iv) evaluate the spatial congruence between areas with high conservation potential, and areas currently in focus for protection efforts, conservation investments, and infrastructure development. We find that the current Protected Area system does not adequately cover or represent diverse habitats, that there is immense potential for States to increase financial investments towards alternative conservation strategies, and, most infrastructure projects may be jeopardizing important carnivore habitats. Our framework allowed for identifying locations where conservation investments would lead to the highest dividends for flagship carnivores and associated species across habitats. We make a case for re-evaluating how large-scale prioritization assessments are made, and for broadening the purview of conservation policies in India and other developing countries.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - After New Zealand’s 7.8 Mw Kaikōura earthquake in late 2016 an unexpected anthropogenic effect involved increased motorised vehicle access to beaches. We show how these effects were generated by landscape reconfiguration associated with coastal uplift and widening of high-tide beaches, and present analyses of the distribution of natural environment values in relation to vehicle movements and impacts. Access changes led to extensive vehicle tracking in remote areas that had previously been protected by natural barriers. New dunes formed seaward of old dunes and have statutory protection as threatened ecosystems, yet are affected by vehicle traffic. Nesting grounds of nationally vulnerable banded dotterel (Charadrius bicinctus bicinctus) co-occur with vehicle tracking. An artificial nest experiment showed that vehicle strikes pose risks to nesting success, with 91% and 83% of nests destroyed in high and moderate-traffic areas, respectively, despite an increase in suitable habitat. Despite gains for recreational vehicle users there are serious trade-offs with environmental values subject to legal protection and associated responsibilities for management authorities. In theory, a combination of low-impact vehicle access and environmental protection could generate win-win outcomes from the landscape changes, but is difficult to achieve in practice. Detailed information on sensitive areas would be required to inform designated vehicle routes as a potential solution, and such sensitivities are widespread. Alternatively, vehicle access areas that accommodate longstanding activities such as boat launching could be formally established using identified boundaries to control impacts further afield. Difficulties for the enforcement of regulatory measures in remote areas also suggest a need for motivational strategies that incentivise low-impact behaviours. We discuss options for user groups to voluntarily reduce their impacts, the importance of interactions at the recreation-conservation nexus, and need for timely impact assessments across the social-ecological spectrum after physical environment changes -- all highly transferable principles for other natural hazard and disaster recovery settings worldwide.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Fundamental questions remain about the regulation of acute pathogens in the absence of acquired immunity. This is especially true for canine rabies, a universally fatal zoonosis. From tracing rabies transmission in a population of 50,000 dogs in Tanzania between 2002-2016 we unravel the processes through which rabies is regulated and persists, fitting individual-based models to spatially-resolved data to investigate the mechanisms modulating transmission and the scale over which they operate. We find that while prevalence never exceeds 0.15%, we detect significant susceptible depletion at local scales commensurate with rabid dog movement, reducing transmission through clustering of rabies deaths and individuals incubating infection. Individual variation in rabid dog behaviour facilitates virus dispersal and co-circulation of lineages, enabling metapopulation persistence. These mechanisms likely operate in many pathogens circulating in spatially structured populations, with important implications for prediction and control, yet are unobservable unless the scale of host interactions is identified.One-Sentence Summary Identifying the spatial scale of contact reveals the mechanisms that limit the size of rabies outbreaks and that are critical for predicting transmission dynamics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Climate change and other anthropogenic drivers of biodiversity change are unequally distributed across the world. Overlap in the distributions of different drivers have important implications for biodiversity change attribution and the potential for interactive effects. However, the spatial relationships among different drivers, and whether they differ between the terrestrial and marine realm has yet to be examined.We compiled global gridded datasets on climate change, land-use, resource exploitation, pollution, alien species potential, and human population density. We used multivariate statistics to examine the spatial relationships amongst the drivers and to characterize the typical combinations of drivers experienced by different regions of the world.We found stronger positive correlations among drivers in the terrestrial than in the marine realm, leading to areas with high intensities of multiple drivers on land. Climate change tended to be negatively correlated with other drivers in the terrestrial realm (e.g., in the tundra and boreal forest with high climate change but low human use and pollution), whereas the opposite was true in the marine realm (e.g., in the Indo-Pacific with high climate change and high fishing).We show that different regions of the world can be defined by anthropogenic threat complexes (ATCs), distinguished by different sets of drivers with varying intensities. The ATCs can be used to test hypotheses about patterns of biodiversity change, especially in response to the joint effects of multiple drivers. More generally, our global analysis highlights the broad conservation priorities needed to mitigate the impacts of anthropogenic change, with different priorities emerging on land and in the ocean, and in different parts of the world.

AB  - Tree expansion among historic grassland and shrubland systems is a global phenomenon, which results in dramatic influences on ecosystem processes and wildlife populations. In the western US, pinyon-juniper woodlands have expanded by as much as six-fold among sagebrush steppe landscapes since the late nineteenth century, with demonstrated negative impacts to the behavior, demography, and population dynamics of species that rely on intact sagebrush rangelands. Notably, greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) are unable to tolerate even low conifer cover, which can result in population declines and local extirpation. Removing expanding conifer cover has been demonstrated to increase sage grouse population growth rates and sagebrush-obligate songbird abundance. However, advances in restoring sagebrush habitats have been met with concern about unintended impacts to species that rely on conifer woodlands, notably the pinyon jay (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) whose population declines are distinctive among birds breeding in pinyon-juniper woodlands. We modeled indices to abundance in relation to multi-scale habitat features for nine songbirds reliant on both sagebrush and pinyon-juniper woodlands for breeding. Findings demonstrate that targeted sage grouse habitat restoration under the Sage Grouse Initiative is not at odds with protection of pinyon jay populations. Rather, conifer management has largely occurred in the northern sagebrush ecosystem where models suggest that past cuts likely benefit Brewer’s sparrow and sage thrasher while avoiding pinyon jay habitat. Extending our spatial modeling further south beyond the sagebrush biome could better equip conservationists with more comprehensive decision-support, particularly where pinyon jays face additional pressures of drought-induced tree mortality.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Aedes aegypti, the main vector of multiple arboviruses, is highly associated with human dwellings. Females exhibit an opportunistic oviposition behavior, seldomly laying eggs on natural containers, but rather distributing them among human-generated breeding sites. Bacterial communities associated with such sites, as well as the compositional shifts they undergo through the development of larval stages, have been described. Some bacteria can play a direct role in supporting the success of mosquito development. Additionally, exposure to different bacteria during larval phases can have an impact on life-history traits. Whether the larvae acquire symbionts from aquatic niches, or just require bacteria as food, is still debated. Based on these facts, we hypothesized that female Ae. aegypti shape the bacterial communities of breeding sites during oviposition as a form of niche construction to favor offspring fitness. Our study presents a series of experiments to address whether gravid females modify bacterial consortia present in larval habitats. For this, we first verified if females can mechanically transfer bacteria into culture media. As evidence of mechanical transmission was obtained, we then elaborated an experimental scheme to dissect effects from factors related to the act of oviposition and mosquito-egg-water interactions. The DNA samples obtained from breeding site water belonging to five treatments were subjected to amplicon-oriented sequencing to infer their bacterial community structure. Microbial ecology analyses revealed significant differences between treatments in terms of diversity. Particularly, between-treatment shifts in abundance profiles were detected, also showing that females induce a significant decrease in alpha diversity through oviposition. In addition, indicator species analysis pinpointed bacterial taxa with significant predicting values and fidelity coefficients for the samples in which single females laid eggs. Furthermore, we provide evidence regarding how one of these indicator taxa, Elizabethkingia, exerts a positive effect upon the development and fitness of mosquito larvae, thus suggesting that the developmental niche construction hypothesis may hold in this model.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Plants are widely recognized as chemical factories, with each species producing dozens to hundreds of unique secondary metabolites. These compounds shape the interactions between plants and their natural enemies. Here we explore how plants generate chemical diversity, and what evolutionary processes have led to novel compounds and unique chemical profiles.We comprehensively characterized the chemical profile of one-third of the species of tropical rainforest trees in the genus Inga (∼ 100, Fabaceae) and applied phylogenetic comparative methods to understand the mode of chemical defense evolution.We show that: 1) Each Inga species produces exceptionally high levels of phytochemical diversity, despite costs, tradeoffs and biosynthetic constraints. 2) Closely related species have highly divergent defense profiles, with individual compounds, major compound classes and complete profiles showing little to no phylogenetic signal. 3) We show that the evolution of a species’ chemical profile shows a signature of divergent adaptation, implying that it is advantageous for a species to have distinct chemistry from close relatives to avoid shared natural enemies. 4) Finally, we hypothesize a model where deep homology of biosynthetic pathways and rapid changes in regulatory mechanisms may better explain the observed large shifts in defense chemicals between closely related taxa.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The impacts of ecotourism on biodiversity are poorly understood and the outcome of research is often contradictory. On the one hand ecotourism could impact the occurrence, survival or behavior of species, on the other hand ecotourism is often mentioned as providing a “human shield” by deterring negative practices like gold mining, logging and hunting.Brownsberg Nature Park is easily the most visited protected area of Suriname, with a high number of ecotourists visiting from abroad. A four-year study on the impact of ecotourism on medium-large terrestrial mammals was carried out between 2013 and 2016 using 16 camera trapping stations. The area has a clear gradient of tourism pressure, with the pressure decreasing further away from the lodging facilities. Evidently, the impacts of human presence on the mammal communities were more significant in the busiest areas. Most species avoided areas with many hikers or switched to a more nocturnal activity pattern. In these areas the impact was not reflected in species numbers, however it was causing a significant lowering of the diversity of mammals. On the other hand, vehicles had little impact on species avoidance or diversity, but did increase nocturnality even more than hikers. A few species seemed to be “attracted” by hikers and/or traffic. Giant armadillos and spotted pacas used the pools in the road created by traffic. Ocelots, margays and red-rumped agoutis seemed to favor human disturbance probably because of predator release. Some of the most impacted species were the jaguar, puma and lowland tapir, all three species with significant contribution to ecosystem balance. Their avoidance or even disappearance from highly human frequented areas could easily result in ecosystem changes in these areas. Management measures should focus on lowering the number of hikers in popular places and limiting the number of vehicles in recreational or tourist areas.

AB  - Background Dengue is an endemic vector-borne disease influenced by environmental factors such as landscape and climate. Previous studies separately assessed the effects of landscape and climate factors on mosquito occurrence and dengue incidence. However, both factors interact in time and space to affect mosquito development and dengue disease transmission. For example, eggs laid in a suitable environment can hatch after being submerged in rain or flood water.Objectives This study aimed to investigate the combined influences of landscape and climate factors on mosquito occurrence and dengue incidence.Methods Entomological, epidemiological, and landscape data from the rainy season (July-December) were obtained from respective government agencies in Metro Manila, Philippines, from 2012 to 2014. Temperature, precipitation, and vegetation data were obtained through remote sensing. A random forest algorithm was used to select the landscape and climate variables. Afterwards, using the identified key variables, a model-based (MOB) recursive partitioning was implemented to test the combinatory influences of landscape and climate factors on the ovitrap index and dengue incidence.Results The MOB recursive partitioning for the ovitrap index indicated that mosquito occurrence was higher in high residential density areas, where industrial areas also exist and are well connected with roads. Precipitation was another key covariate modulating the effects of landscape factors, possibly by expanding breeding sites and activating mosquito reproduction. Moreover, the MOB recursive partitioning indicated that precipitation was the main predictor of dengue incidence, with a stronger effect in high residential density and commercial areas.Discussion Precipitation with floods has epidemiologically important implications by damaging shelters and causing population displacement, thus increasing exposure to dengue vectors. Our findings suggest that the intensification of vector control during the rainy season can be prioritized in residential and commercial areas to better control dengue disease dynamics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Morphology often relates to ecology in a well-defined manner, enabling prediction of ecological roles for taxa that lack direct observations, such a fossils. Diet is a particularly important component of a species’ ecology. However, in order to predict diet it must first be codified, and establishing metrics that effectively summarize dietary variability without excessive information loss remains challenging. We employed a dietary item relative importance coding scheme to derive multivariate dietary classifications for a sample of extant carnivoran mammals, and then used Bayesian multilevel modeling to assess whether these scores could be predicted from a set of dental metrics, with body size as a covariate. There is no “one size fits all” model for predicting dietary item importance; different topographical features best predict different foods at different body sizes, and model-averaged estimates perform especially well. We show how models derived from living taxa can be used to provide novel insights into the dietary diversity of extinct carnivoran species. Our approach need not be limited to diet as an ecological trait of interest, to these phenotypic traits, or to carnivorans. Rather, this framework serves as a general approach to predicting multivariate ecology from phenotypic traits.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Satisfying the demand for agricultural products while also protecting the environment from negative impacts of agriculture is a major challenge for crop management. We used an ecophysiological model of plant-pest interaction and multi-criteria decision analysis to optimize crop management when considering two contrasting objectives: (1) maximizing crop production and (2) minimizing environmental impact related to fertilization, irrigation and pesticide deployment. The model provides an indicator of crop production for 27 management scenarios, obtained combining three levels of fertilization, irrigation and pesticide use, respectively. We computed the environmental impact relevant to each management scenario by means of a weighted sum of costs assigned to fertilization, irrigation and pesticide use. We identified the optimal scenarios with respect to the considered objectives analysing the Pareto front. These scenarios were mostly characterized by high fertilization and no pesticide use. We evaluated the multi-functionality of the optimal scenarios by mean of the Gini coefficient: the scenario better assuring the equality between the two objectives was characterized by high fertilization, intermediate irrigation and no pesticide. Although our results remain qualitative and not immediately transferable to agronomic practices, our analytical framework provides a useful tool to evidence trade-offs among two contrasting objectives and provide solutions to act in an efficient way by leaving a certain degree of freedom to the political decision maker.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Biodiversity is known to be influenced by agricultural practices in many ways. However, it is necessary to understand how this relation takes place in particular agroecosystems, sociocultural contexts and for specific biological groups. Also, in order to systematically study and track how biodiversity responds or changes with agricultural practices, it is necessary to find groups that can be used as practical indicators. We conduct a study of beetle (Coleoptera) diversity in maize-based agricultural plots with heterogeneous management practices in the Central Valleys of Oaxaca, Mexico. First, we use a mixture of local knowledge and multivariate statistics to group the plots into two broad and contrasting management categories (traditional vs. industrialized). Then, we present an analysis of Coleopteran diversity for each category, showing higher levels across different diversity indexes for the traditional plots. Also, our results let us postulate the Curculionidae family as an indicator of both management type and overall Coleopteran diversity in the agricultural lands of the study site. We discuss our results in terms of the agricultural matrix quality and its role in joint productive and biodiversity conservation strategies.

AB  - Urbanization results in pervasive habitat fragmentation and reduces standing genetic variation through bottlenecks and drift. Loss of genome-wide variation may ultimately reduce the evolutionary potential of animal populations experiencing rapidly changing conditions. In this study, we examined genome-wide variation among 23 white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) populations sampled along an urbanization gradient in the New York City metropolitan area. Genome-wide variation was estimated as a proxy for evolutionary potential using more than 10,000 SNP markers generated by ddRAD-Seq. We found that genome-wide variation is inversely related to urbanization as measured by percent impervious surface cover, and to a lesser extent, human population density. We also report that urbanization results in enhanced genome-wide differentiation between populations in cities. There was no pattern of isolation by distance among these populations, but an isolation by resistance model based on impervious surface significantly explained patterns of genetic differentiation. Isolation by environment modeling also indicated that urban populations deviate much more strongly from global allele frequencies than suburban or rural populations. This study is the first to examine loss of genome-wide SNP variation along an urban-to-rural gradient and quantify urbanization as a driver of population genomic patterns.

AB  - New techniques for the species-level sorting of millions of specimens are needed in order to accelerate species discovery, determine how many species live on earth, and develop efficient biomonitoring techniques. These sorting methods should be reliable, scalable and cost-effective, as well as being largely insensitive to low-quality genomic DNA, given that this is usually all that can be obtained from museum specimens. Mini-barcodes seem to satisfy these criteria, but it is unclear how well they perform for species-level sorting when compared to full-length barcodes. This is here tested based on 20 empirical datasets covering ca. 30,000 specimens and 5,500 species, as well as six clade-specific datasets from GenBank covering ca. 98,000 specimens for over 20,000 species. All specimens in these datasets had full-length barcodes and had been sorted to species-level based on morphology. Mini-barcodes of different lengths and positions were obtained in silico from full-length barcodes using a sliding window approach (3 windows: 100-bp, 200-bp, 300-bp) and by excising nine mini-barcodes with established primers (length: 94 – 407-bp). We then tested whether barcode length and/or position reduces species-level congruence between morphospecies and molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (mOTUs) that were obtained using three different species delimitation techniques (PTP, ABGD, objective clustering). Surprisingly, we find no significant differences in performance for both species- or specimen-level identification between full-length and mini-barcodes as long as they are of moderate length (&gt;200-bp). Only very short mini-barcodes (&lt;200-bp) perform poorly, especially when they are located near the 5’ end of the Folmer region. The mean congruence between morphospecies and mOTUs is ca. 75% for barcodes &gt;200-bp and the congruent mOTUs contain ca. 75% of all specimens. Most conflict is caused by ca. 10% of the specimens that can be identified and should be targeted for re-examination in order to efficiently resolve conflict. Our study suggests that large-scale species discovery, identification, and metabarcoding can utilize mini-barcodes without any demonstrable loss of information compared to full-length barcodes.

AB  - There is growing concern, locally and globally, about the health of pollinating insects and their decreasing abundance and diversity. While roads may also be contributing to insect pollinator declines (roads can contribute to habitat fragmentation and habitat destruction), roadsides may provide opportunities for pollinating insect conservation. Yet to use these areas to support local pollinating insects, we need to understand which plants will support wild pollinators, especially of conservation concern. To that end, we researched the potential plant-pollinator networks of three existing seed mixes in western New York (USA) – a roadside seed mix, a pollinator-friendly planting mix, and a lawn seed mix. We used publicly available information and built bipartite graphs to show the resulting networks. The pollinator-friendly seed mix supported the most pollinating insects overall and taxa of conservation concern. Yet the roadside mix, with the same species richness as the lawn seed mix, supported a different network based on the plants in the mix. Our results inform which particular plant species in existing seed mixes in western New York can support wild pollinating insect species of concern in the region. Additionally, our results show potentially how roadside and lawn plantings may be altered to support a broader network of pollinating insects.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Within urban landscape planning, debate continues around the relative merits of land-sparing (compaction) and land-sharing (sprawl) scenarios. Using part of Greater Manchester (UK) as a case-study, we present a landscape approach to mapping green infrastructure and variation in social-ecological-environmental conditions as a function of land sparing and sharing. We do so for the landscape as a whole as well as for areas of high and low urbanity. Results imply potential trade-offs between land-sparing-sharing scenarios relevant to characteristics critical to urban resilience such as landscape connectivity and diversity, air quality, surface temperature, and access to green space. These trade-offs may be particularly complex due to the parallel influence of patch attributes such as land-cover and size and imply that both ecological restoration and spatial planning have a role to play in reconciling tensions between land-sparing and sharing strategies.

AB  - The distributions of the potential adaptive ranges of iconic plant species are not yet fully known especially in regions such as Ethiopia where high climatic variability and vegetation types are found. This study was undertaken to predict the distributions of the potential suitable habitats of Pouteria adolfi-friederici and Prunus africana tree species under the current and two future climate scenarios (i.e., RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 in 2050 and 2070) using MaxEnt software (version: 3.4.4.). Eleven less correlated environmental variables (r&lt;0.7) were identified and used to make the prediction models. Elevational shifts of the highly suitable habitats, effects of elevation, solar radiation and topographic position in relation to the current and future climatic scenarios on the habitats were statistically analyzed using independent t-test and linear model. Under all climate scenarios, we found a decrease in the proportion of areas of highly suitable habitats for both study species. High potentials of suitable habitats for Pouteria adolfi-friederici are predicted to be confined to southwest, west central and south parts of Ethiopia in fragmented moist afromontane forest patches, while it is in the southwest and west central parts of Ethiopia for Prunus africana. On basis of vegetation types of the country, potential suitable habitats for Pouteria adolfi-friederici are predicted to occur in moist evergreen forest, dry evergreen forest and grassland complex and Combretum-Terminalia woodland vegetation types. Whereas, moist evergreen forest, dry evergreen forest and grassland complex and riverine vegetation types are predicted to comprise potential suitable habitats for Prunus africana, showing considerable spatial dynamics. Overall, our results suggest that the strategies deem to design biodiversity conservation should take into account the dynamics of the suitable niches of different species under different future climate scenarios.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Wildlife–vehicle collisions are of increasing concern with regards to the continuous and accelerating anthropogenic development. Preventing and mitigating collisions with wildlife will require a better understanding of the environmental and biological drivers of collision risks. Because species of large mammals differ in terms of food requirements, habitat selection and movement behaviours we tested at the management unit level if the density of collisions with red deer, roe deer and wild boar differed in terms of spatial distribution and explanatory factors. From 20,275 documented collisions in France between years 1990 and 2006, we found marked differences in the most influential environmental factors accounting for the density of collisions among the three species. The effect of road density was higher for the red deer than for the two other species and did not level off at our spatial-scale of observation. As expected, the annual hunting harvest – interpreted as a proxy of population abundance – was positively associated with the density of collisions for all species, being the strongest for red deer. While the collision density decreased with the proportion of forest in a management unit for wild boar, it increased with the fragmentation of forests for red deer that commute among forest patches between day and night. To reduce the number of wildlife– vehicle collisions, our results suggest to generalise road fencing and/or a control of abundance of large herbivore populations. Mitigation measures should target units where the collision risk is the highest for the most problematic species.

AB  - In the light of unprecedented change in global biodiversity, real-time and accurate ecosystem and biodiversity assessments are becoming increasingly essential. Nevertheless, estimation of biodiversity using ecological field data can be difficult for several reasons. For instance, for very large areas, it is challenging to collect data that provide reliable information. Some of these restrictions in Earth observation can be avoided through the use of remote sensing approaches. Various studies have estimated biodiversity on the basis of the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH). According to this hypothesis, spectral heterogeneity over the different pixel units of a spatial grid reflects a higher niche heterogeneity, allowing more organisms to coexist. Recently, the spectral species concept has been derived, following the consideration that spectral heterogeneity at a landscape scale corresponds to a combination of subspaces sharing a similar spectral signature. With the use of high resolution remote sensing data, on a local scale, these subspaces can be identified as separate spectral entities, the so called “spectral species”. Our approach extends this concept over wide spatial extents and to a higher level of biological organization. We applied this method to MODIS imagery data across Europe. Obviously, in this case, a spectral species identified by MODIS is not associated to a single plant species in the field but rather to a species assemblage, habitat, or ecosystem. Based on such spectral information, we propose a straightforward method to derive α- (local relative abundance and richness of spectral species) and β-diversity (turnover of spectral species) maps over wide geographical areas.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The study was aimed to conduct the population dynamics and diversity indices for three major pest species in order to design an IPM protocol in two experimental sites (Om Saber, Beheira Governorate 30°29’50.6”N, 30°46’18.8”E), and (Kom Oshim, Fayoum Governorate 29°34’40.9”N, 30°55’38.3”E). The resulted data showed statistically significant fluctuation, population dynamics, abundance, distribution, and diversity indices of the two-spotted spider mite (TSSM) Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), the silver leaf whitefly Bemisia tabaci Genn. (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), and the onion thrips Thrips tabaci Lindman (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) which recorded on four plant species belonging to Brassicaceae (Siberian (Russian) kale Brassica napus var. pabularia L. and Italian (Tuscan) kale Brassica oleracea var. palmifolia), and Lamiaceae (Spearmint Mentha spicata L. and Saudi Mint Mentha longifolia L.). The proposed IPM program consisted of predatory mites; Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot, Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot, and Cydnoseius negevi (Swirski &amp; Amitai) (Acari: Phytoseiidae), a green pesticide, and an entomopathogenic compound. It was concluded that abiotic and biotic factors together help in explaining why various pest species build their communities rapidly and increase their parameters that become above the EIL. Such factors are hypothesized to affect the plant-arthropod, predator-herbivore, predator-predator, and tri-trophic interactions. And it recommends the application of such protocol should consider the timing of tacking an action and merging tactics together to get the maximum efficiency.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The capacity of highly diverse systems to prevail has proven difficult to explain. In addition to methodological issues, the inherent complexity of ecosystems and issues like multicausality, non-linearity and context-specificity make it hard to establish general and unidirectional explanations. Nevertheless, in recent years, high order interactions have been increasingly discussed as a mechanism that benefits the functioning of highly diverse ecosystems and may add to the mechanisms that explain their persistence. Until now, this idea has been explored by means of hypothetical simulated networks. Here, we test this idea using an updated and empirically documented network for a coffee agroecosystem. We identify potentially key nodes and measure network robustness in the face of node removal with and without incorporation of high order interactions. We find that the system’s robustness is either increased or unaffected by the addition of high order interactions, in contrast with randomized counterparts with similar structural characteristics. We also propose a method for representing networks with high order interactions as ordinary graphs and a method for measuring their robustness.HighlightsThe robustness of a coffee-associated ecological network is either increased or unaffected by the incorporation of high order interactions.A method is proposed for representing high order interactions in ordinary networks.A method is proposed to measure the robustness of networks with high order interactions.High order interactions may promote the persistence of diverse ecosystems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Applying quantifiable metrics to validate the success of restoration efforts is crucial for ongoing management programs in anthropogenically fragmented habitats. Estimates of dispersal can provide such baseline data because they measure not only the extent to which restored patches are colonized and interconnected, but also their metapopulation source/sink dynamics. In this context, we estimated dispersal and population connectivity among prairie (Microtus ochrogaster; N=231) and meadow vole (M. pennsylvanicus; N=83), sampled from eight restored plots at five tallgrass prairie sites embedded within the agricultural matrix of midwestern North America. Our expectation was that extensive distances separating these restored habitats (i.e., 48–246 km) would spatially isolate vole metapopulations, resulting in significant genetic differentiation. We first used molecular taxonomy to validate the field-identifications of all sampled individuals, then used pairwise FST derived from 15 microsatellite DNA loci to estimate genetic connectivity among the species-delimited study populations. Metapopulation stability was gauged by assessing migration rates and deriving effective population sizes (Ne). We also calculated relatedness values (r) as a potential surrogate for contact in prairie vole, a primary vector for Lyme disease. Molecular species-assignments contravened field-identifications in 25% of samples (11 prairie/67 meadow) and identified two instances of species-hybridization (0.6%). Local effects (i.e., population crash/drought) were manifested at two sites, as documented by significant temporal declines in Ne and r. Overall, high migration rates and non-significant (10/15) pairwise FST values underscored elevated metapopulation connectivity. A single site that recorded five significant FST values also displayed significant r-values indicating the inadvertent sampling of closely related individuals. This highlights the close social groupings among cooperatively-breeding prairie vole that can exacerbate Lyme disease transmission. Thus, while elevated population connectivity aligns with prairie restoration goals, it also reinforces a need in adaptive management to evaluate environmental matrices for their permeability to vector-borne diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Standard models of plant speciation assume strictly dichotomous genealogies in which a species, the ancestor, is replaced by two offspring species. The reality in wind-pollinated trees with long evolutionary histories is more complex: species evolve from other species through isolation when genetic drift exceeds gene flow; lineage mixing can give rise to new species (hybrid taxa such as nothospecies and allopolyploids). The multi-copy, potentially multi-locus 5S rDNA is one of few gene regions conserving signal from dichotomous and reticulate evolutionary processes down to the level of intra-genomic recombination. Therefore, it can provide unique insights into the dynamic speciation processes of lineages that diversified tens of millions of years ago. Here, we provide the first high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of the 5S intergenic spacers (5S-IGS) for a lineage of wind-pollinated subtropical to temperate trees, the Fagus crenata – F. sylvatica s.l. lineage, and its distant relative F. japonica. The observed 4,963 unique 5S-IGS variants reflect a complex history of hybrid origins, lineage sorting, mixing via secondary gene flow, and intra-genomic competition between two or more paralogous-homoeologous 5S rDNA lineages. We show that modern species are genetic mosaics and represent a striking case of ongoing reticulate evolution during the past 55 million years.Significance statement The evolution of extra-tropical wind-pollinated tree genera involves dynamic speciation processes. High-throughput sequencing of the multi-copy, potentially multi-locus 5S rDNA reveals a complex history of hybrid origins, lineage sorting and mixing, and intra-genomic competition between paralogous-homeologous loci in the core group of Eurasian beech trees (genus Fagus) and their distant relative, F. japonica.

AB  - It is not feasible to continuously observe ecological succession in lakes because of the long time-scales generally involved. Thus, the process has been inductively deduced by comparing many lakes with different succession states, or indirectly simulated by tracking studies of smaller water bodies, experiments using microcosms or mesocosms, and reconstruction of lake history by sediment analysis. However, the reality of succession processes in large lakes with slow succession is not well understood, and new approaches are needed. Theoretically, in a group of large and small lakes of similar ages and with similar initial and watershed environments, the rate of nutrient accumulation in each lake depends on the ratio of watershed area to lake size, and the lakes are predicted to evolve to different trophic levels over time. Here, we tested this hypothesis on the 10 lakes of varying sizes in Akan Caldera, Japan, which were formed thousands of years ago by fragmentation due to volcanic eruptions within the caldera. Topographic and water quality studies showed that the ratio of accumulated watershed area to lake size (area and volume), expressed logarithmically, had a positive linear regression with the total phosphorus concentration, an indicator of trophic level. The trophic levels of the lakes were diverse, including oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic types in the traditional “lake type” classification based on total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a concentrations. Furthermore, 21 species of aquatic macrophytes were observed by a diving survey, and the plant species composition was classified into five groups corresponding to the trophic status of the lakes, indicating a conventional “hydrarch succession”. The diversity of water quality and aquatic vegetation in a group of lakes with similar origins paves the way for new comparative studies of lakes, including large lakes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Urban sprawl is one of the greatest global changes with major negative impacts on biodiversity and human well-being. Recent policies have acknowledged the value of urban green areas in counterbalancing such impacts. These policies aim to increase the ecological value of green areas, making cities more permeable to natural populations. However, they are largely focused on the role and management of public green areas, ignoring the role and potential of private green areas for urban ecological value.This study aims to evaluate the benefits of considering private green areas for conservation efforts in cities. Using data on bat activity and information on vegetation and building height, we quantify the respective role of public and private green areas in habitat availability and connectivity for the common pipistrelle in the city of Paris, France. Our results show that despite the low proportion of private green areas in Paris (36% of the total green areas), they still contributed up to 47.9% of bat habitat availability and decrease the resistance of the city matrix by 88%. The distribution in the city matrix and vegetation composition of those areas appeared especially beneficial for bat habitat availability and connectivity. The study demonstrates the importance of private green areas in the ecological value of cities in complementing the role of public green areas. Our results confirm the need to develop more inclusive urban conservation strategies that include both public and private stakeholders.HighlightsThe urban ecological value of private gardens outweighs that of public gardensThis is true for both habitat availability and connectivityBiodiversity policies in cities should also focus on private green areasInclusive conservation strategies are also needed in cities

AB  - Understanding biological diversity and the mechanisms of the Sino-Japanese disjunctions are major challenges in eastern Asia biogeography. The Sino-Japanese flora has been broadly studied as an ideal model for plant phylogeography. Diabelia (Caprifoliaceae) is an East Asian genus, with a disjunctive distribution across the Sino-Japanese region. However, relationships within Diabelia remain elusive. In this study, we reconstructed the phylogeny of Diabelia and inferred historical biogeography and evolutionary patterns based on nuclear and plastid sequences from target enrichment and genome skimming approaches, respectively. We found that the main clades within Diabelia were discordant between nuclear and plastid trees. Both nuclear and plastid phylogenetic analyses supported five main clades: D. serrata, D. tetrasepala, D. sanguinea, D. spathulata var. stenophylla and D. spathulata var. spathulata. Species network analyses revealed that Diabelia tetrasepala is likely the result of a hybridization event. Divergence time estimation and ancestral area reconstructions showed that Diabelia originated in Japan during the early Miocene, with subsequent vicariance and dispersal events between Japan and Korea, and between Japan and China. Overall, our results support the division of Diabelia into five main clades and the recognition of five species in the genus. This research provides new insights in the species delimitation and speciation processes of taxonomically complex lineages such as Diabelia.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Approximately 100 years ago, unregulated harvest nearly eliminated white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from eastern North America, which subsequently served to catalyze wildlife management as a national priority. An extensive stock-replenishment effort soon followed, with deer broadly translocated among states as a means of re-establishment. However, an unintended consequence was that natural patterns of gene flow became obscured and pre-translocation signatures of population structure were replaced. We applied cutting-edge molecular and biogeographic tools to disentangle genetic signatures of historical management from those reflecting spatially heterogeneous dispersal by evaluating 35,099 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived via reduced-representation genomic sequencing from 1,143 deer sampled state-wide in Arkansas. We then employed Simpson’s diversity index to summarize ancestry assignments and visualize spatial genetic transitions. Using sub-sampled transects across these transitions, we tested clinal patterns across loci against theoretical expectations of their response under scenarios of recolonization and restricted dispersal. Two salient results emerged: (A) Genetic signatures from historic translocations are demonstrably apparent; and (B) Geographic filters (major rivers; urban centers; highways) now act as inflection points for the distribution of this contemporary ancestry. These results yielded a state-wide assessment of contemporary population structure in deer as driven by historic translocations as well as ongoing processes. In addition, the analytical framework employed herein to effectively decipher extant/historic drivers of deer distribution in Arkansas are also applicable for other biodiversity elements with similarly complex demographic histories.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDM) have been increasingly developed in recent years but their validity is questioned. Their assessment can be improved by the use of independent data but this can be difficult to obtain and prohibitive to collect. Standardized data from citizen science may be used to establish external evaluation datasets and to improve SDM validation and applicability. We used opportunistic presence-only data along with presence-absence data from a standardized citizen science program to establish and assess habitat suitability maps for 9 species of amphibian in western France. We assessed Generalized Additive and Random Forest Models’ performance by (1) cross-validation using 30% of the opportunistic dataset used to calibrate the model or (2) external validation using different independent data sets derived from citizen science monitoring. We tested the effects of applying different combinations of filters to the citizen data and of complementing it with additional standardized fieldwork. Cross-validation with an internal evaluation dataset resulted in higher AUC (Area Under the receiver operating Curve) than external evaluation causing overestimation of model accuracy and did not select the same models; models integrating sampling effort performed better with external validation. AUC, specificity and sensitivity of models calculated with different filtered external datasets differed for some species. However, for most species, complementary fieldwork was not necessary to obtain coherent results, as long as the citizen science data was strongly filtered. Since external validation methods using independent data are considered more robust, filtering data from citizen sciences may make a valuable contribution to the assessment of SDM. Limited complementary fieldwork with volunteer’s participation to complete ecological gradients may also possibly enhance citizen involvement and lead to better use of SDM in decision processes for nature conservation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been adopted to help beginners identify insect species from field images. However, the application of these methods on the identification of tiny congeneric species moving across heterogeneous background remains difficult. To enable rapid and automatic identification in the field, we customized a method involving real-time object detection of two Phyllotreta beetles. We first performed data augmentation using transformations, syntheses, and random erasing of the original images. We then proposed a two-stage method for the detection and identification of small insects based on CNN, where YOLOv4 and EfficientNet were used as a region proposal network and a re-identification method, respectively. Evaluation of the model revealed that one-step object detection by YOLOv4 alone was not precise (Precision = 0.55) when classifying two species of flea beetles and background objects. In contrast, the two-step CNNs improved the precision (Precision = 0.89) with moderate accuracy (F-measure = 0.55) and acceptable speed (ca. 5 frames per second for full HD images) of detection and identification of insect species in the field. Although real-time identification of tiny insects remains a challenge in the field, our method aids in improving small object detection on a heterogeneous background.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The extreme environmental conditions that prevail in cities are known to cause selection pressures leading to adaptive changes in wild, city-dwelling, organisms (“urban evolution”). The urban heat island, elevated temperatures in the city centre due to a combination of generation, reflection, and trapping of heat, is one of the best recognised and most widespread urban environmental factors. Here, we used a citizen-science approach to study the effects of urban heat on genetically-determined shell colour in the land snail Cepaea nemoralis in the Netherlands. We used smartphone applications to obtain colour data on almost 8,000 snails throughout the country. Our analysis shows that snails in urban centres are more likely to be yellow than pink, an effect predicted on the basis of thermal selection. Urban yellow snails are also more likely to carry dark bands at the underside of the shell; these bands might affect thermoregulation in yet underexplored ways.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - A major challenge in community ecology is to understand the mechanisms promoting stable local coexistence. A necessary feature of local coexistence is that species show negative frequency dependence, rescuing rare species from exclusion. However, most studies have focused on ecological differences driving negative frequency dependence, ignoring non-ecological mechanisms such as reproductive interactions. Here, we combined field studies with behavioural and mesocosm experiments to investigate how reproductive interactions within and between species promote coexistence. Our results indicate that the intensity of male mating harassment and sexual conflict increases as species become more common, reducing female productivity and leading to negative frequency dependence. Moreover, field surveys reveal that negative frequency dependence operates in natural settings, consistent with our experimental results. These results suggest that sexual conflict can promote local coexistence and highlights the importance of studying reproductive interactions together with ecological differences to better understand the mechanisms promoting species coexistence.Significance statement Research on the mechanisms promoting local species coexistence have focused on canonical ecological differences that increase intraspecific over interspecific competition. However, one intrinsic factor of species that can promote coexistence are the reproductive interactions. We performed a series of behavioural and mesocosm experiments manipulating species frequencies together with field observations and show that sexual conflict can decrease female fitness when species are common and promote local coexistence. Our results suggest that reproductive interactions are an understudied mechanism that can promote species coexistence even when species are ecologically equivalent.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Long-distance movements of sharks within and between islands pose substantial challenges for resource managers working with highly migratory species. When no-take zones do not cover the critical areas that sharks use as part of their lifecycle, exposure to fishing activities can be significant. Shark movements between the Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) of the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) have been studied for several years, however little is known about the strength of connectivity between these islands. We analyzed the extensive MigraMar ultrasonic telemetry dataset to assess how Galapagos sharks (Carcharhinus galapagensis) and silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis) use different islands as stepping-stones during their migrations within the Revillagigedo National Park and other ETP islands. Of the 66 sharks monitored, 63.5% moved within the same island, 25.4% between two islands or more and only 10.1% across different MPAs. A C. falciformis tagged in Roca Partida Island, Revillagigedo, travelled to Clipperton Atoll and another one tagged in Darwin Island travelled to the atoll on two different years. The largest movement of C. galapagensis was accomplished by a shark tagged at Socorro Island, Revillagigedo, later detected at Clipperton and finally recorded in Darwin Island, Galapagos. This last path was in fact, one of the longest movements ever recorded for the species. Although long-distance dispersion was not common, our results highlight the need for co-operation between different countries to ensure adequate protection for sharks in the form of swimways and other conservation tools in the ETP.

AB  - Ecosystems and biodiversity produce benefits to society, but many of them are hard to quantify. For example, it is unclear whether European societies gain benefits from experiencing rivers that host high native biodiversity. Without such knowledge, monetary investments into ecologically oriented river management plans are difficult to justify. The objective of this study was to reveal how the public in four European countries values ecological characteristics of domestic rivers and the outcomes of hypothetical river basin management plans designed to improve river ecosystems, particularly fish biodiversity. We conducted a choice experiment among the populations in Norway, Sweden, Germany and France. We found similar preference structures in all countries with high marginal willingness-to-pay for improvements of abiotic river attributes (increased accessiblity of the river banks, improved bathing water quality, decreased river fragmentation). Citizens also benefited from certain fish species occurring in a river with native salmonid species being more valued than nonnatives, particularly in Norway, and from the degree of a river’s native biodiversity. Welfare measures calculated for selected river basin management plans (policy scenarios) revealed societal benefits that were primarily derived from ecological river management whereas a scenario focusing on hydroelectricity production generated the lowest utility. We conclude that ecological river management may produce high nonmarket economic benefits in all study countries, particularly through the management of abiotic river attributes and the restoration of declining or extinct fish species. Our results help to inform decisions on restoration efforts by showcasing the benefits that these measures have for the public.

AU  - Branoff, Benjamin

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Urban forests are repeatedly characterized as distinct in composition and structure in comparison with their non-urban counterparts. This holds true for mangroves, although previous studies lack quantified representations of urbanness as well as any inclusion of hydrology or water chemistry, which are important influences on mangrove forest structure, composition, and function. This study uses LiDAR and ground-based measurements of mangroves within well quantified urban gradients in Puerto Rico to test for the relative importance of urbanization alongside flooding metrics and surface water chemistry in explaining observed patterns of forest structure and composition. In simple regression, urban metrics were the most powerful predictors of forest composition but not structure. Results show higher tree diversity but lower mangrove diversity in the most urban forests. Structural measurements, however, were best explained by flooding, surface water chemistry, and non-urban land cover metrics. Nitrogen concentrations best explained stem density and tree size, while flooding metrics best explained stand biomass and basal area, and surrounding vegetation cover best explained canopy cover and height metrics. In multiple regression, land cover and surface water chemistry were more important than flooding, with population density again being the most important variable in explaining mangrove forest diversity. Results show that urbanization is an important influence on mangrove composition and basal area, leading to higher tree diversity and lower basal area, consistent with patterns in terrestrial forests. But urban mangrove forests are also lower in mangrove diversity and tend to have representation only by Laguncularia racemosa. Nitrogen concentrations and surrounding vegetation cover, both of which are indirectly influenced by urbanization, were positively related to tree size and canopy cover and height, respectively. These tests suggest urbanization is an important influence on mangrove forest structure and composition, but that flooding and water chemistry must also be considered when managing these forests.

AB  - A current frontier of character displacement research is to determine if displacement occurs via multiple phenotypic pathways and varies across communities with different species compositions. Here, we conducted the first test for context-dependent character displacement in multimodal floral signals by analyzing variation in floral scent in a system that exhibits character displacement in flower size, and that has multiple types of sympatric communities. In a greenhouse common garden experiment, we measured quantitative variation in volatile emission rates of the progeny of two species of Clarkia from replicated communities that contain one, two, or four Clarkia species. The first two axes of a constrained correspondence analysis, which explained 24 percent of the total variation in floral scent, separated the species and community types, respectively. Of the 23 compounds that were significantly correlated with these axes, nine showed patterns consistent with character displacement. Two compounds produced primarily by C. unguiculata and two compounds produced primarily by C. cylindrica were emitted in higher amounts in sympatry. Character displacement in some volatiles varied across sympatric communities and occurred in parallel with displacement in flower size, demonstrating that this evolutionary process can be context-dependent and may occur through multiple pathways.

AB  - Cities support unique and valuable ecological communities, but understanding urban wildlife is limited due to the difficulties of assessing biodiversity. Ecoacoustic surveying is a useful way of assessing habitats, where biotic sound measured from audio recordings is used as a proxy for biodiversity. However, existing algorithms for measuring biotic sound have been shown to be biased by non-biotic sounds in recordings, typical of urban environments.We develop CityNet, a deep learning system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to measure audible biotic (CityBioNet) and anthropogenic (CityAnthroNet) acoustic activity in cities. The CNNs were trained on a large dataset of annotated audio recordings collected across Greater London, UK. Using a held-out test dataset, we compare the precision and recall of CityBioNet and CityAnthroNet separately to the best available alternative algorithms: four acoustic indices (AIs): Acoustic Complexity Index, Acoustic Diversity Index, Bioacoustic Index, and Normalised Difference Soundscape Index, and a state-of-the-art bird call detection CNN (bulbul). We also compare the effect of non-biotic sounds on the predictions of CityBioNet and bulbul. Finally we apply CityNet to describe acoustic patterns of the urban soundscape in two sites along an urbanisation gradient.CityBioNet was the best performing algorithm for measuring biotic activity in terms of precision and recall, followed by bulbul, while the AIs performed worst. CityAnthroNet outperformed the Normalised Difference Soundscape Index, but by a smaller margin than CityBioNet achieved against the competing algorithms. The CityBioNet predictions were impacted by mechanical sounds, whereas air traffic and wind sounds influenced the bulbul predictions. Across an urbanisation gradient, we show that CityNet produced realistic daily patterns of biotic and anthropogenic acoustic activity from real-world urban audio data.Using CityNet, it is possible to automatically measure biotic and anthropogenic acoustic activity in cities from audio recordings. If embedded within an autonomous sensing system, CityNet could produce environmental data for cites at large-scales and facilitate investigation of the impacts of anthropogenic activities on wildlife. The algorithms, code and pre-trained models are made freely available in combination with two expert-annotated urban audio datasets to facilitate automated environmental surveillance in cities.

AB  - In the Neotropics, vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) are the main reservoir host for rabies, a highly fatal encephalitis caused by viruses in the genus Lyssavirus. Although patterns of rabies virus exposure and infection have been well-studied for vampire bats in South America and Mexico, exploring the ecology of vampire bat rabies in other regions is crucial for predicting risks to livestock and humans. In Belize, rabies outbreaks in livestock have increased in recent years, underscoring the need for systematic data on viral dynamics in vampire bats. In this study, we examine the first three years of a longitudinal study on the ecology of vampire bat rabies in northern Belize. Rabies seroprevalence in bats was high across years (29–80%), suggesting active and endemic virus circulation. Across two locations, the seroprevalence time series per site were inversely related and out of phase by at least a year. Microsatellite data demonstrated historic panmixia of vampire bats, and mark–recapture detected rare but contemporary inter-site dispersal. This degree of movement could facilitate spatial spread of rabies virus but is likely insufficient to synchronize infection dynamics, which offers one explanation for the observed phase lag in seroprevalence. More broadly, our analyses suggest frequent transmission of rabies virus within and among vampire bat roosts in northern Belize and highlight the need for future spatiotemporal, phylogenetic, and ecological studies of vampire bat rabies in Central America.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The probability that a propagule reaches a certain location where it can establish and persist is affected by the distance from the source. Fragmented landscapes often promote the isolation of habitats that hinder or impede the movement of species that affect their range distribution, even when environmental conditions are adequate. Studies that assess the connectivity of the landscape are essential to ensure that ecological conservation planning covers all vital processes that occur on a landscape scale. Based on the classification of land cover in the Rio Doce Basin - RDB, we used a habitat / non-habitat approach to assess RDB connectivity for tree species. Based on circuit theory, we built 6 surface models of resistance based on habitat and non-habitat areas. We performed the analysis using the GIS plug-in and Linkage Mapper to generate lest cost path maps. The RDB is very fragmented, but still has functionally connected regions. The west to nothwestern and southeastern portions of the basin are well-connected and demand conservation practices, while the center-north of the basin and the far southwest are regions with greater resistance to connectivity as a result of strong anthropic pressures that reduce forests, requiring intervention through restoration projects avoiding loss due to lack of connectivity. In addition, land reclamation projects in degraded areas must also be organized in the Linhares region, as it is inserted in a region of very high biodiversity with a high level of endemism and a high number of threatened species.

AB  - Given trade’s importance to maintaining food security, it is crucial to understand the relationship between human population growth, land use, food supply, and trade. We develop a metapopulation model coupling human population dynamics to agricultural land use and food production in “patches” (regions and countries) connected via trade networks. Patches that import sparingly or fail to adjust their demand sharply in response to changes in food per capita experience food insecurity. They fall into a feedback loop between increasing population growth and decreasing food per capita, particularly if they are peripheral to the network. A displacement effect is also evident; patches that are more central and/or import more heavily preserve their natural land states. Their reliance on imports means other patches must expand their agricultural land. These results emphasize that strategies for improving food security and equality must account for the combined effects of network topology and patch-level characteristics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The structure of the genome shapes the distribution of genetic diversity and sequence divergence. To investigate how the relationship between chromosome size and recombination rate affects sequence divergence between species, we combined empirical analyses and evolutionary simulations. We estimated pairwise sequence divergence among 15 species from three different Mammalian clades - Peromyscus rodents, Mus mice, and great apes - from chromosome-level genome assemblies. We found a strong significant negative correlation between chromosome size and sequence divergence in all species comparisons within the Peromyscus and great apes clades, but not the Mus clade, suggesting that the dramatic chromosomal rearrangements among Mus species may have masked the ancestral genomic landscape of divergence in many comparisons. Our evolutionary simulations showed that the main factor determining differences in divergence among chromosomes of different size is the interplay of recombination rate and selection, with greater variation in larger populations than in smaller ones. In ancestral populations, shorter chromosomes harbor greater nucleotide diversity. As ancestral populations diverge, diversity present at the onset of the split contributes to greater sequence divergence in shorter chromosomes among daughter species. The combination of empirical data and evolutionary simulations revealed that chromosomal rearrangements, demography, and divergence times may also affect the relationship between chromosome size and divergence, and deepen our understanding of the role of genome structure on the evolution of species divergence.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The interactions between pairs of native and alien plants via shared use of pollinators have been widely studied. Studies of invasive species effects at the community level on the other hand are still scarce. Few community level studies, however, have considered how differences in the intensity of invasion, and degree of floral trait similarity between native and invasive species, can mediated effects on native plant-pollinator communities. Here, we evaluated the effect of alien species on overall plant-pollinator network structure, and species-level network parameters, across nine coastal communities distributed along 205 km at Yucatán, México that vary in alien species richness and flower abundance. We further assessed the effect of alien plant species on plant-pollinator network structure and robustness via computational simulation of native and invasive plant extinction scenarios. We did not find significant differences between native and alien species in functional floral phenotypes, the visitation rate and species composition of the pollinator community. Variation in the proportion of alien plant species and flower abundance across sites did not affect plant-pollinator networks structure. Species-level network parameters (i.e., normalized degree and nestedness contribution) did not differ between native and alien species. Furthermore, our simulation analyses revealed that alien species are functionally equivalent to native species and contribute equally to network structure and robustness. Overall, our results suggest that alien species are well integrated into native coastal plant-pollinator networks which may be facilitated by high levels of floral trait similarity and pollinator use overlap. As a result, alien species may play a similar role than that of natives in the structure and stability of native plant and pollinator communities in the studied coastal sand dune ecosystem.

AB  - Aim The impact of global change on biodiversity is commonly assessed in terms of changes in species distributions, community richness and community composition. Whether and how much associations between species, i.e. the degree of correlation in their spatial co-occurrence, are also changing is much less documented and mostly limited to local studies of ecological networks. In this study, we quantify changes in large-scale patterns of species associations in bird communities in relation to changes in species composition.Location France.Time period 2001-2017.Major taxa studied Common breeding birds.Methods We use network approaches to build three community-aggregated indices reflecting complementary aspects of species association networks. We characterise the spatio-temporal dynamics of these indices using a large-scale and high-resolution dataset of bird co-abundances of 109 species monitored for 17 years (2001-2017) from 1,969 sites across France. We finally test whether spatial and temporal changes in species association networks are related to species homogenisation estimated as the spatio-temporal dynamics of β-diversity and the proportion of habitat generalists. The consistency of these relationships is tested across three main habitats, namely woodland, grassland and human settlements.Results We document a directional change in association-based indices in response to modifications in β-diversity and in the proportion of generalists in space and time. Weaker associations and sparser networks were related to lower β-diversity and a higher proportion of generalists, suggesting an overlooked aspect of biotic homogenisation affecting species associations. We report that this overall pattern is not constant across habitats, with opposite relationships between biotic homogenisation and change in species association networks in urban versus forest communities suggesting distinct homogenisation processes.Main Conclusions Although species association contain only partial signatures of species interactions, our study highlights that biotic homogenisation translates to finer changes in community structure by affecting the number, strength and type of species associations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Aim We propose a Bayesian framework for modelling species distributions using presence-only biodiversity occurrences obtained from historical opportunistic surveys.Location Global applicability with two case studies in south-east Mexico.Methods The framework defines a bivariate spatial process separable into ecological and sampling effort processes that jointly generate occurrence observations of biodiversity records. Presence-only data are conceived as incomplete observations where some presences have been filtered out. A choosing principle is used to separate out presences, missing data and absences relative to the species of interest and the sampling observations. The framework provides three modelling alternatives for accounting the spatial autocorrelation structure: independent latent variables (model I); common latent spatial random effect (model II); and correlated latent spatial random effects (model III).The framework was compared against the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm in two case studies: one for the prediction of pines (Class: Pinopsida), using botanical records as sampling observations and another for the prediction of Flycatchers (Family: Tyranidae), using bird sightings as sampling records.ăResults In both case studies, at least one of the proposed models achieved higher predictive accuracy than MaxEnt. The model with correlated spatial effects fit best when the sampling effort was informative, while the one with a shared spatial effect was more suitable in cases with high proportion of non sampled sites.Main Conclusions Our approach provides a flexible framework for presence-only SDMs aided by a sampling effort process informed by the accumulated observations of independent and heterogeneous surveys. For the two case studies, the framework provided a model with a higher predictive accuracy than an optimised version MaxEnt.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Some ecological phenomena are visually engaging and widely celebrated. Consequently, these have the potential to generate large footprints in the online and social media image records which may be valuable for ecological research. Cherry tree blooms are one such event, especially in Japan where they are a cultural symbol (Sakura, 桜). For centuries, the Japanese have celebrated Hanami (flower viewing) and the historical data record of the festival allows for phenological studies over this period, one application of which is climate reconstruction. Here we analyse Flickr social network site data in an analogous way to reveal the cherry blossoms’ seasonal sweep from southern to northern Japan over a twelve-week period.Our method analyses data filtered using geographical constraints, multi-stage text-tag classification, and machine vision, to assess image content for relevance to our research question and use it to estimate historic cherry bloom times. We validated our estimated bloom times against official data, demonstrating the accuracy of the approach. We also investigated an out of season Autumn blooming that has gained worldwide media attention. Despite the complexity of human photographic and social media activity and the relatively small scale of this event, our method can reveal that this bloom has in fact been occurring over a decade.The approach we propose in our case study enables quick and effective monitoring of the photogenic spatiotemporal aspects of our rapidly changing world. It has the potential to be applied broadly to many ecological phenomena of widespread interest.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

TI  - Spatial scale moderates the shape of the biodiversity-disease relationship
AU  - Halliday, Fletcher W.
AU  - Rohr, Jason R.
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Diverse host communities commonly inhibit the spread of parasites in studies at small and intermediate scales, leading some to suggest that conserving biodiversity could help control infectious diseases. However, the generality of this “dilution effect” remains controversial. First, most studies assume a linear, monotonic relationship between biodiversity and disease, though the actual shape is unknown. Second, most studies are conducted at a single spatial scale, though biotic interactions are often-scale-dependent, thus spatial scale might determine the direction of biodiversity-disease relationships. Third, most studies focus only on a small range of possible diversity levels, though the direction of biodiversity-disease relationships may change outside of this range. By analyzing 231 biodiversity-disease relationships on 77 parasite species, we provide broad evidence that biodiversity-disease relationships are generally non-linear and moderated by spatial scale; biodiversity generally inhibits disease at local scales (&lt;100 km2) and amplifies disease at regional scales (&gt;1,000,000 km2). These effects did not depend on any tested host, parasite, or study characteristics, though the spatial scale of a study was often related to study design and parasite type, highlighting the need for additional multiscale research. Few studies were missing substantial data at low diversity, but missing data at low diversity could result in underreporting of amplification. Experiments might be missing data at high diversity, which could result in underreporting of dilution. Despite context-dependence in biodiversity-disease relationships, most conservation is implemented at local scales where biodiversity appears to inhibit disease and thus these results suggest that local conservation actions could reduce disease risk.Significance statement It has been suggested that diverse ecological communities limit disease spread, but the generality of this pattern is contentious. Therefore, the degree to which biodiversity conservation can limit harmful epidemics remains unresolved. We address this fundamental question by analyzing 231 published relationships between biodiversity and disease. We find evidence that most biodiversity-disease relationships are nonlinear and scale-dependent with biodiversity generally associated with reduced disease at small and intermediate scales, but increased disease at large scales. Moreover, these results were generally robust to missing data at low and high biodiversity levels and variation in host, parasite, and study characteristics. This suggests that conservation efforts aimed at reducing the impacts of human and wildlife diseases will be most successful at local scales.

AB  - Soil fungi are vital to forest ecosystem functions, in part through their role mediating tree responses to environmental factors, as well as directly through effects on resource cycling. While the distribution of these key taxa may vary with a suite of abiotic and biotic factors, the relative role of host species identity on soil fungal community composition and function remains unresolved. In this study, we used a combination of amplicon sequencing and enzymatic assays to assess soil fungal composition and associated function under three tree species, Quercus rubra, Betula nigra, and Acer rubrum, planted individually and in all combinations in a greenhouse, with added fungal inoculum collected below mature field trees. Across treatments, fungal communities were dominated by the phylum Ascomycota, followed by Basidiomycota and Mortierellomycota. Nonetheless, fungal communities differed between each of the solo planted treatments, suggesting at least some taxa may associate preferentially with these tree species. Additionally, fungal community composition under mixed sapling treatments broadly differed from solo saplings. The data also suggests that there were larger enzymatic activities in the solo treatments as compared with all mixed treatments. This difference may be due to the greater relative abundance of saprobic taxa found in the solo treatments. This study provides evidence of the importance of tree identity on soil microbial communities and functional changes to forest soils.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Coral reefs are of paramount importance in marine ecosystems, where they provide support for a large part of the biodiversity. Being quite sensitive to global changes, they are therefore the prime targets for biodiversity conservation policies. However, such conservation goals require accurate species identification, which are notoriously difficult to get in these highly morphologically variable organisms, rich in cryptic species. There is an acute need for easy-to-use and resolutive species diagnostic molecular markers. The present study builds on the huge sequencing effort developed during the TARA Pacific expedition to develop a genotyping strategy to assign coral samples to the correct species within two coral genera (Porites and Pocillopora). For this purpose, we developed a technique that we called “Divergent Fragment” based on the sequencing of a less than 2kb long diagnostic genomic fragment determined from the metagenomic data of a subset of the corals collected. This method has proven to be rapid, resolvable and cost-effective. Sequencing of PCR fragments nested along the species diagnostic fragment allowed us to assign 232 individuals of the genus Pocillopora and 247 individuals of the genus Porites to previously identified independent genetic lineages (i.e. species). This genotyping method will allow to fully analyze the coral samples collected across the Pacific during the Tara Pacific expedition and opens technological perspectives in the field of population genomics-guided conservation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

TI  - ANIMAL-AIDED DESIGN – using a species’ life-cycle to improve open space planning and conservation in cities and elsewhere
AU  - Weisser, Wolfgang W.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Biodiversity underlies many of the ecosystem services demanded by humans. For cities, the design of ‘green infrastructures’ or ‘nature-based solutions’ has been proposed to maintain the provisioning of these services and the preservation of biodiversity. It is unclear, however, how such green infrastructure can be implemented, given existing planning practices that generally ignore biodiversity. Urban open spaces are normally designed by landscape architects with a primary focus on plants, aesthetic design and functionality for human users. As a consequence, conservation of species only plays a minor role, in fact, protected animals are often considered detrimental to the design, e.g. when the need to conserve a protected species demands modifications of a building project. Conversely, conservationists are often in favor of protected areas, also in cities, with little access for humans and no human design.We propose ‘Animal-Aided Design’ (AAD) as a methodology for the design of urban open spaces, to integrate conservation into open space planning. The basic idea of AAD is to include the presence of animals in the planning process, such that they are an integral part of the design. For AAD, the desired species are chosen at the beginning of a project. The requirements of the target species then not only set boundary conditions for the design, but also serve as an inspiration for the design itself. The aim of AAD is to establish a stable population at the project site, or contribute to population growth of species with larger habitats. AAD thus allows a combination of good urban design with species conservation. We illustrate our approach with designs for urban spaces in Munich.

AB  - In the Anthropocene era, climate change poses a great challenge in environmental management and decision-making for species and habitat conservation. To support decision-making, many studies exist regarding the expected vegetation changes and the impacts of climate change on European plants, yet none has investigated how climate change will affect the extinction risk of the entire endemic flora of an island biodiversity hotspot, with intense human disturbance. Our aim is to assess, in an integrated manner, the impact of climate change on the biodiversity and biogeographical patterns of Crete and to provide a case-study upon which a cost-effective and climate-smart conservation planning strategy might be set. We employed a variety of macroecological analyses and estimated the current and future biodiversity, conservation and extinction hotspots in Crete, as well as the factors that may have shaped these distribution patterns. We also evaluated the effectiveness of climate refugia and the NATURA 2000 network (PAs) on protecting the most vulnerable species and identified the taxa that should be of conservation priority based on the Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) index, during any environmental management process. The highlands of Cretan mountain massifs have served as both diversity cradles and museums, due to their stable climate and high topographical heterogeneity. They are also identified as biodiversity hotspots, as well as areas of high conservation and evolutionary value, due their high EDGE scores. Due to the ‘escalator to extinction’ phenomenon and the subsequent biotic homogenization, these areas are projected to become diversity ‘death-zones’ in the near future and should thus be prioritized in terms of conservation efforts and by decision makers. In-situ conservation focusing at micro-reserves and ex-situ conservation practices should be considered as an insurance policy against such biodiversity losses, which constitute cost-effective conservation measures. Scientists and authorities should aim the conservation effort at areas with overlaps among PAs and climate refugia, characterized by high diversity and EDGE scores. These areas may constitute Anthropocene refugia. Thus, this climate-smart, cost-effective conservation-prioritization planning will allow the preservation of evolutionary heritage, trait diversity and future services for human well-being and acts as a pilot for similar regions worldwide.

AB  - Although trees are key to ecosystem functioning, many forests and tree species across the globe face strong threats. Preserving areas of high biodiversity is a core priority for conservation; however, different dimensions of biodiversity and varied conservation targets make it difficult to respond effectively to this challenge. Here, we (i) identify priority areas for global tree conservation using comprehensive coverage of tree diversity based on taxonomy, phylogeny, and functional traits; and (ii) compare these findings to existing protected areas and global biodiversity conservation frameworks. We find that ca. 51% of the top-priority areas for tree biodiversity are located in current protected areas. The remaining half top-priority areas are subject to moderate to high human pressures, indicating conservation actions are needed to mitigate these human impacts. Our findings emphasize the effectiveness of using tree conservation priority areas for future global conservation planning.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The Himalayan uplift, a tectonic event of global importance, seemingly disseminated aquatic biodiversity broadly across Asia. But surprisingly, this hypothesis has yet to be tested. We do so herein by sequencing 1,140 base-pair of mtDNA cytochrome-b for 72 tetraploid Nepalese/Bhutanese Snowtrout (Schizothorax spp.), combining those data with 67 GENBANK® sequences (59 ingroup/8 outgroup), then reconstructing phylogenetic relationships using maximum likelihood/ Bayesian analyses. Results indicate Snowtrout originated in Central Asia, dispersed across the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), then into Bhutan via south-flowing tributaries of the east-flowing Yarlung-Tsangpo River (YLTR). The headwaters of five large Asian rivers provided dispersal corridors into southeast Asia. South of the Himalaya, the YLTR transitions into a westward-flowing Brahmaputra River that facilitated successive colonization of Himalayan drainages: First Bhutan, then Nepal, followed by far-western drainages subsequently captured by the Indus River. We found greater species-divergences across rather than within-basins, implicating vicariant evolution as a driver. The Himalaya is a component of the “third-pole” [Earth’s largest (but rapidly shrinking) glacial reservoir outside the Arctic/Antarctic]. Its unique aquatic biodiversity must not only be recognized (as herein) but also conserved through broad, trans-national collaborations. Our results effectively contrast phylogeography with taxonomy as a necessary first step in this process.The Himalaya is the most extensive and recently evolved mountain system on Earth (length=2400km; width=240km; elevation=75-8800m), with a global significance underscored by its large-scale lithospheric, cryospheric, and atmospheric interactions [1]. These have not only driven global climate, but also defined the cultural and biological endemism of the region [2]. Massive, tectonically derived mountain chains such as the Alps and the Himalaya are hypothesized as being fundamental to the formation of global biodiversity gradients via vicariance and local adaptation, with a significantly stronger signal in terrestrial rather than aquatic systems [3]. Here we test how orogeny (the deformation and folding of Earth’s crust by lateral compression) has contributed to the diversification of freshwater fishes broadly across Asia. We do so by evaluating the phylogeography of an endemic high-elevation fish, the Snowtrout (Schizothorax: Cyprinidae).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The use of molecular methods to manage natural resources is increasingly common. However, DNA-based methods are seldom used to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of species’ range shifts. This is important when managing range-shifting species such as non-native species (NNS), which can have negative impacts on biotic communities. Here we investigated the range-shifting NNS Ciona robusta, Clavelina lepadiformis, Microcosmus squamiger and Styela plicata using a combined methodological approach. We first conducted non-molecular biodiversity surveys for these NSS along the South African coastline, and compared the results with historical surveys. We detected no consistent change in range size across species, with some displaying range stability and others showing range shifts. We then sequenced a section of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) from tissue samples and found genetic differences along the coastline but no change over recent times. Finally, we found that environmental DNA metabarcoding data showed broad congruence with both the non-molecular biodiversity and the COI datasets, but failed to capture complete incidence of all NSS. Overall, we demonstrated how a combined methodological approach can effectively detect spatial and temporal variation in genetic composition and range size, which is key for managing biodiversity changes of both threatened and NSS.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

Careful spatial planning can contribute to the successful return and conservation of urban nature by maximizing the contribution of green infrastructure to landscape connectivity. By using ecological connectivity theory as a planning tool, governments can quantify the effect of different interventions on the ease with which wildlife can move across the landscape. Here we outline an approach to a) quantify ecological connectivity for different urban wildlife species and b) use this to test different urban planning scenarios using QGIS. We demonstrate four extensions to the work by Deslaurier et al. (2018) and Spanowicz &amp; Jaeger (2019) which improve the application of this method as a planning tool for local government:A step-by-step method for calculating effective mesh size using the open-source software QGIS.Conversion of the effective mesh size value (meff) to a “probability of connectedness” (Pc, for easier interpretation by local government and comparisons between planning scenarios).Guidance for measuring species-specific connectivity, including how to decide what spatial information should be included and which types of species might be most responsive to connectivity planning.Advice for using the method to measure the outcome of different urban planning scenarios on ecological connectivity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The ascomycete fungus Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola (Oo) is the causative agent of ophidiomycosis (Snake Fungal Disease), which has been detected globally. However, surveillance efforts in the central U.S., specifically Texas, have been minimal. The threatened and rare Brazos water snake (Nerodia harteri harteri) is one of the most range restricted snakes in the U.S. and is sympatric with two wide-ranging congeners, N. erythrogaster transversa and N. rhombifer, in north central Texas; thus, providing an opportunity to test comparative host-pathogen dynamics in this system. To accomplish this, we surveyed a portion of the Brazos river drainage (~400 river km) over 29 months and tested 150 Nerodia spp. for the presence of Oo via quantitative PCR and recorded any potential signs of Oo infection. We found Oo was distributed across the entire range of N. h. harteri, Oo prevalence was 46 % overall, and there was a significant association between Oo occurrence and signs of infection in our sample. Models indicated adults had a higher probability of Oo infection than juveniles and subadults, and adult N. h. harteri had a higher probability of infection than adult N. rhombifer but not higher than adult N. e. transversa. High Oo prevalence estimates (94.4%) in adult N. h. harteri has implications for their conservation and management owing to their patchy distribution, comparatively low genetic diversity, and threats from anthropogenic habitat modification.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Large Amazonian rivers impede dispersal for many species, but lowland river networks frequently rearrange, thereby altering the location and effectiveness of river-barriers through time. These rearrangements may promote biotic diversification by facilitating episodic allopatry and secondary contact among populations. We sequenced genome-wide markers to evaluate histories of divergence and introgression in six Amazonian avian species-complexes. We first tested the assumption that rivers are barriers for these taxa and found that even relatively small rivers facilitate divergence. We then tested whether species diverged with gene flow and recovered reticulate histories for all species, including one potential case of hybrid speciation. Our results support the hypothesis that river dynamics promote speciation and reveal that many rainforest taxa are micro-endemic, unrecognized and thus threatened with imminent extinction. We propose that Amazonian hyper-diversity originates in part from fine-scale barrier displacement processes –including river dynamics– which allow small populations to differentiate and disperse into secondary contact.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Biodiversity is an important parameter for the evaluation of the extant environmental conditions. Here, we used environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to investigate fish biodiversity in five different estuaries in Japan. Water samples for eDNA were collected from river mouths and adjacent coastal areas of two estuaries with high degrees of development (the Tama and Miya Rivers) and three estuaries with relatively low degrees of development (the Aka, Takatsu, and Sendai Rivers). A total of 182 fish species across 67 families were detected. Among them, 11 species occurred in all the rivers studied. Rare fishes including endangered species were successfully detected in rich natural rivers. Biodiversity was the highest in the Sendai River and lowest in the Tama River, reflecting the degree of human development along each river. Even though nutrient concentration was low in both the Aka and Sendai Rivers, the latter exhibited greater diversity, including many tropical or subtropical species, owing to its more southern location. Species composition detected by eDNA varied among rivers, reflecting the distribution and migration of fishes. Our results are in accordance with the ecology of each fish species and environmental conditions of each river, suggesting the potential of eDNA for non-invasive assessment of aquatic biodiversity.

AB  - Addressing global biodiversity loss requires an expanded focus on multiple dimensions of biodiversity. While most studies have focused on the consequences of plant interspecific diversity, our mechanistic understanding of how the diversity within a given plant species (genetic diversity) affects plant productivity remains limited. Here, we use a tree species × genetic diversity experiment to disentangle the effects of species diversity and genetic diversity, and how they are related to tree functional diversity and trophic feedbacks. Tree species as well as genetic diversity increased tree productivity via increased tree functional diversity, reduced soil fungal diversity and marginally reduced herbivory. The effect of tree genetic diversity on productivity was partly different between tree species monocultures and mixtures: the functional diversity effect resulting from tree genetic diversity was only found in tree species monocultures, but the trophic feedbacks via herbivory were similar in species monocultures and mixtures. Given the complexity of interactions between tree species and genetic diversity, tree functional diversity and trophic feedbacks on productivity, we suggest that both tree species and genetic diversity should be considered in reforestation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Anthropogenic stressors, including restoration activities, can have ecosystem wide impacts, reflecting in various biotic components, particularly the basal levels in the trophic webs. Functional traits link taxonomic diversity to ecosystem function, thereby enabling a better ecological assessment of ecosystem health. We studied the effects of restoration activities on the community structure and functional diversity of freshwater cladoceran zooplankton in an urban water reservoir. Samples were taken in the early and late phases of the restoration work. Cladoceran species community and functional composition was significantly different between the two phases. There was a considerable reduction in taxonomic richness, functional richness and redundancy in the late phase. Taxonomic beta diversity between the two phases was explained more by nestedness. Habitat degradation due to haphazard restoration measures such as destruction of littoral zone and arbitrary desilting in addition to the dumping of untreated sewage could have contributed to the decrease in species and functional richness within the reservoir.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The Mediterranean region with its islands is among top biodiversity hotspots. It houses numerous freshwater taxa with a high rate of endemism, but is heavily impacted by anthropogenic pressures and global climate change. To conserve biodiversity, reliable data on species and genetic diversity are needed especially for the scarcely known insular freshwater ecosystems. Environmental DNA metabarcoding provide a straight-forward opportunity to assess aquatic biodiversity. Therefore, we conducted the first eDNA metabarcoding study in one stream catchment on Sicily. Specifically, we aimed to i) investigate spatial diversity patterns of macroinvertebrate communities, ii) assess seasonal changes, and iii) check if dispersal barriers can be identified. Water samples were taken at 27 different sites in two seasons and eDNA metabarcoding performed using the COI gene. In total, we detected 98 macroinvertebrate species, including 28 taxa potentially new to Sicily. Exact sequence variant (ESV) and species composition data showed that diversity differed between seasons with less taxa detected in winter. We also detected a dispersal barrier, which had a stronger effect in autumn. Our findings show that eDNA metabarcoding provides valuable information on Sicilian freshwater biodiversity. We therefore encourage its application for understudied regions to better understand the state and dynamics of freshwater biodiversity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Soils harbor a substantial fraction of the world’s biodiversity, contributing to many crucial ecosystem functions. It is thus essential to identify general macroecological patterns related to the distribution and functioning of soil organisms to support their conservation and governance. Here we identify and characterize the existing gaps in soil biodiversity and ecosystem function data across soil macroecological studies and &gt;11,000 sampling sites. These include significant spatial, environmental, taxonomic, and functional gaps, and an almost complete absence of temporally explicit data. We also identify the limitations of soil macroecological studies to explore general patterns in soil biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, with only 0.6% of all sampling sites having a non-systematic coverage of both biodiversity and function datasets. Based on this information, we provide clear priorities to support and expand soil macroecological research.

AB  - Aim Unsustainable hunting is leading to widespread defaunation across the tropics. To mitigate against this threat with limited conservation resources, stakeholders must make decisions on where to focus anti-poaching activities. Identifying priority areas in a robust way allows decision-makers to target areas of conservation importance, therefore maximizing the impact of conservation interventions.Location Annamite mountains, Vietnam and Laos.Methods We conducted systematic landscape-scale surveys across five study sites (four protected areas, one unprotected area) using camera-trapping and leech-derived environmental DNA. We analyzed detections within a Bayesian multi-species occupancy framework to evaluate species responses to environmental and anthropogenic influences. Species responses were then used to predict occurrence to unsampled regions. We used predicted species richness maps and occurrence of endemic species to identify areas of conservation importance for targeted conservation interventions.Results Analyses showed that habitat-based covariates were uninformative. Our final model therefore incorporated three anthropogenic covariates as well as elevation, which reflects both ecological and anthropogenic factors. Conservation-priority species tended to found in areas that are more remote now or have been less accessible in the past, and at higher elevations. Predicted species richness was low and broadly similar across the sites, but slightly higher in the more remote site. Occupancy of the three endemic species showed a similar trend.Main conclusion Identifying spatial patterns of biodiversity in heavily-defaunated landscapes may require novel methodological and analytical approaches. Our results indicate to build robust prediction maps it is beneficial to sample over large spatial scales, use multiple detection methods to increase detections for rare species, include anthropogenic covariates that capture different aspects of hunting pressure, and analyze data within a Bayesian multi-species framework. Our models further suggest that more remote areas should be prioritized for anti-poaching efforts to prevent the loss of rare and endemic species.

TI  - Quantifying Costs of Urbanisation: Wetland Loss and Impacts in a Rapidly Developing Global City
AU  - Gabites, Harriet

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - As cities grow, natural ecosystems decline through conversion to urban environments. Cities are often viewed as biodiversity wastelands, but they can be hotspots of global biodiversity. Urban biodiversity emphasises two fundamentals. First, people living in cities enjoy wildlife and second, there is virtually no planning for species that co-inhabit our cities. If urban biodiversity was a significant part of planning, then we would be far better at integrating green infrastructure into expanding urban environments.Wetlands are among the most important and productive ecosystems in the world. They are the main suppliers of fresh water for human use and provide habitat to critical fauna and flora. In urban areas they are a vital link to nature and social cohesion. Currently, there is an absence of wetland inventory quantifying loss and changes overtime. Hence the broad impacts of urbanisation on wetland loss are difficult to assess.We explored wetland loss and created a wetland inventory for Western Sydney, Australia, one of the world’s fastest growing urban regions. We used satellite imagery to determine wetland number and type, and calculated changes in wetland surface area from 2010-2017. Broad changes to land use were also quantified. We developed species distribution models of a common urban wetland turtle (Chelodina longicollis) that people interact with regularly or have as pets. Chelodina longicollis utilises both aquatic and terrestrial environments, and we determined if changes in distribution were associated with changes in the wetland inventory and urbanisation.Most local government areas (LGA) experienced a decrease in wetland surface area from 2010-2017, ranging from -1% (Cumberland) to -21% (Blacktown). Majority of LGAs experienced a decrease in wetland density, with wetland densities declining by 25% (Blacktown). All LGAs experienced an increase in urban land use, ranging from 3-12%, which was associated with high rates of wetland loss.Changes in turtle distribution over the decade reflects a southern distribution shift away from where wetland losses were concentrated. We estimated that ∼40,000 individual turtles were displaced or killed due to wetland loss and urbanisation.Urbanisation was the leading cause of wetland loss and degradation in Western Sydney between 2010 and 2017. Wetlands provide critical green infrastructure and significant green space for social cohesion in urban areas. Integration of current wetlands, or the creation of functional wetlands, is key for sustainable development of urban landscapes. Urban wetlands (natural and constructed) may provide “biodiversity arks” for endangered species and facilitate community led conservation programs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - In the Tashan Cave barb Garra tashanensis, inhabiting a small cave in south west Iran, two mental disc forms were observed. To assess their phylogenetic relationships, disc-less and disc-bearing individuals were analyzed using mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) partial DNA sequences. Both mental disc forms nested within one clade with absolute bootstrap support (BS = 100), and the genetic distances between the disc-bearing and disc-less individuals (0.3-0.7%) was considerably lower than inter-species mtDNA sequence distances reported among members of the genus Garra. Hence, the observed mental disc variation was not inferred to be a taxonomic feature or a consequence of character displacement. Instead, it was inferred as a case of character release to diversify among ecological niches in the limited subterranean habitat, which should be clarified in follow-up ecological and population genetic studies in more detail.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Urbanisation is a major anthropogenic perturbation that progressively alters multiple environmental parameters, thereby presenting novel evolutionary challenges to wild populations. Symbiotic microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tracts (gut) of vertebrates have well-established mutual connections with the physiology of their hosts and respond quickly to environmental alterations. However, the impacts of anthropogenic changes and urbanisation on gut microbiota remain poorly understood, especially in early development. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the gut microbiota in juvenile great tits (Parus major) in an urban mosaic. First, we compared the microbiota of nestlings reared in artificial nest boxes or natural cavities. Next, we analysed microbiota variations employing two distinct urbanisation frameworks, (i) the classical urban/rural dichotomy and (ii) gradual changes in the amount of impervious surface area (ISA) in the urban space and identified the environmental variables that predicted the changes in the microbial communities. Alpha diversity was influenced by cavity type and by the amount of impervious surface surrounding the breeding location. Alpha diversity was also positively correlated with the tree cover density. Beta diversity differed between urban and rural sites, and these alterations covaried with sound pollution, the distance to the city centre and the distance to the closest road. Overall, the microbial communities reflect and are possibly influenced by the heterogeneous environmental modifications that are typical of the urban space. Strikingly, the choice of framework used to define the urban space can influence the outcomes of studies investigating animal-microbe symbiosis. Our results open new perspectives from which the potential function of microbial symbionts in the adaptation of their hosts to anthropogenic stress can be investigated.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Background Real-time monitoring of tree growth can provide novel information about trees in urban/suburban areas and the myriad ecosystem services they provide. By monitoring irrigated specimen trees we test the hypothesis that in trees with sufficient water, growth is governed by environmental factors regulating energy gain rather than by factors related to water use.Methods Internet enabled, high-resolution dendrometers were installed on three trees in Southampton, NY. The instruments, along with a weather station, streamed data to a project web page that was updated once an hour. (https://ecosensornetwork.com). Growing periods were determined using a Hidden Markov Model based on Zweifel et al.’s (2016) zero-growth model. Linear models and conditional inference trees correlated environmental variables to growth magnitude and rate of growth.Results Growth was governed by the interacting environmental variables of air temperature, soil moisture, VPD and took place primarily at night. Radial growth of spruce began April 14 after the accumulation of 69.7 °C growing degrees days and ended September 7th. Cedar growth began later (April 26th), after the accumulation of 160.6 °C and ended later (November 3rd). During the observation period, these three modest suburban trees sequestered 108.3 kg of CO2.Conclusions Though irrigated, residential tree growth in our experiment was affected by environmental factors relating to both water use and energy gain through photosynthesis. Linking tree growth to fluctuations in environmental conditions facilitates the development of a predictive understanding useful for ecosystem management and growth forecasting across future altering climates.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Sustainably managing multifunctional landscapes for production of multiple ecosystem services (ES) requires thorough understanding of the interactions between ES and the ecological processes that drive them. We build upon landscape connectivity theory to present a spatial approach for assessing functional connections between multiple ES at the landscape scale. We demonstrate application of the approach using existing ES supply mapping data for plant agriculture, waterflow regulation, and landscape aesthetics. The connections we observed between these three ES revealed high-value multifunctional linkages on the landscape that were not necessarily predictable from supply area mapping, nor from land use or land cover data. By providing spatial information on ES connectivity, our approach enables local and regional environmental planning and management that takes full consideration of the complex, multi-scale interactions between ecological processes, land use and land cover, and ecosystem service supply on a landscape.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Amphibians are animal that requires combinations of hydrosphere (riparian vegetation, water body) and vegetation (trees) microhabitats. In urban settings, those microhabitats are scarce and disappearing. One of areas that still have sufficient microhabitats to support amphibian populations is located in an 88.9 Ha urban forests of Universitas Indonesia Campus in West Java. Here, this paper aims to assess and model the several amphibian species occupancy (Ψ) with vegetation covers, riparian vegetation, and water bodies based on Akaike habitat selection (AIC) indices. The studied amphibian species include Bufo melanosticus, Hylarana nicobariensis, Fejervarya limnocharis, and Polypedates leucomystax. For modeling, 7 microhabitat models were developed and tested for amphibian species occupancy with covariates including vegetation cover, riparian vegetation, and water body microhabitats. The Principle Component Analysis (PCA) shows that the occupancies of amphibian were influenced mostly by the presences of water bodies followed by riparian vegetation, and vegetation covers. According to the values of Ψ and AIC, Polypedates leucomystax and Fejervarya limnocharis were species that have high occupancy in riparian vegetation microhabitats with Ψ values of −14.18 and −12.59. Likewise, Hylarana nicobariensis has an equal occupancy in vegetation, riparian vegetation, and water body microhabitats.

AB  - Rapid urbanization and associated biodiversity loss is rampant globally but especially a cause of concern for developing countries. However, numerous studies investigating the role of urban green spaces have established their key role in conserving larger suites of species in urban area. Yet our knowledge is lopsided due to lag in research in developing countries. We examined how landscape and local scale features of urban green spaces influence bird species richness, density, fine-foraging guild richness and composition during breeding and non-breeding season. This is the first study of this nature in one the Himalayan states of India. We quantified landscape level variables in the 250m buffer around 18 urban green spaces. We sampled vegetation and bird community during breeding and non-breeding season through 52 intensive sampling point spread across 18 urban green spaces. Size of the urban green space at landscape level and tree richness at the local scale emerged as important predictor variables influencing bird species richness, density and richness of imperiled insectivorous guild across seasons. Urban green spaces within education institutions and offices experiencing much less management supported higher bird richness and density whereas city parks were the most species poor. Community composition was affected more strongly by built-up cover and barren area in the matrix and also by tree species richness within urban green spaces. City planners should focus on establishing larger city parks during design stage whereas biodiversity potential of the existing urban green spaces could be enhanced by selecting native tree and shrub species to increase overall habitat complexity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Understanding species distribution is the first requirement to work on their behaviour, conservation, and phylogeography. Over the last decades, the number of species described on the Korean peninsula has significantly increased, but areas around the boundaries of the Korean peninsula still have to be surveyed for the presence of these species, especially where the environment is similar and connected. Here, we conducted surveys in the continuous landscapes of the Republic of Korea, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the People’s Republic of China to determine the range of the Gold-spotted pond frog, Pelophylax chosenicus. The surveys were conducted between 2016 and 2020 through visual and call encounters. We also used molecular tools to confirm the species identity of the northernmost population, in China, sequencing the mitochondrial DNA 16S gene fragment. We then determined the importance of landscape types for the species, and especially rice paddies, and used landscape models to define suitable habitats across the region. We found the species to be widespread in low elevation wetlands along the coast of the Yellow Sea, with two isolated populations on the south-east of the Korean Peninsula, and the northernmost population in the vicinity of Dandong in PR China. As this species is listed as threatened in the Republic of Korea, knowing its exact distribution will be important for conservation practices, and this first record for PR China provides a baseline for further surveys.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Urban lawns provide space for recreation in cities, and they are an important part of urban green infrastructures. However, most lawns are intensively managed. As only few plant species can survive the frequent mowing, urban lawns typically harbor only a limited number of plant species. To improve the biodiversity of urban lawns, it is often suggested to reduce the mowing frequency. Here, we studied the plant diversity of urban grasslands that have recently undergone management changes from mowing every few weeks to mowing only once or twice per season and compared them to intensively managed lawns. Within six years after the management changes, the grasslands with reduced mowing frequency indeed hosted 30% more plant species than intensively managed lawns, and they were more heterogeneous both within and between grasslands. Additionally, the species composition of less frequently mown grasslands shifted from common mowing-tolerant lawn species to typical meadow species. Our study thus shows that the reduction of mowing is a simple and effective tool for increasing the biodiversity in urban grasslands.

AB  - Madagascar exhibits extraordinarily high level of species richness and endemism, while being severely threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation (HL&amp;F). In front of such threat to biodiversity, conservation effort can be directed, for instance, in the documentation of species that are still unknown to science, or in investigating how species respond to HL&amp;F. The tufted-tail rats genus (Eliurus spp.) is the most speciose genus of endemic rodents in Madagascar, with 13 described species, which occupy two major habitat types: dry or humid forests. The large species diversity and association to specific habitat types make the Eliurus genus a suitable model for investigating species adaptation to new environments, as well as response to HL&amp;F (dry vs humid). In the present study, we investigated Eliurus spp. genomic diversity across northern Madagascar, a region covered by both dry and humid fragmented forests. From the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear genomic (RAD-seq) data of 124 Eliurus individuals sampled in poorly studied forests of northern Madagascar, we identified an undescribed Eliurus taxon (Eliurus sp. nova). We tested the hypothesis of a new Eliurus species using several approaches: i) DNA barcoding; ii) phylogenetic inferences; iii) species delimitation tests based on the Multi-Species Coalescent (MSC) model, iv) genealogical discordance index (gdi); v) the ad-hoc test of isolation-by-distance within versus between sister-taxa, vi) comparisons of %GC content patterns and vii) morphological analyses. All analyses support the recognition of the undescribed lineage as a distinct species. In addition, we show that Eliurus myoxinus, a species known from the dry forests of western Madagascar, is, surprisingly, found mostly in humid forests in northern Madagascar. In conclusion, we discuss the implications of such findings in the context of Eliurus species evolution and diversification, and use the distribution of northern Eliurus species as a proxy for reconstructing past changes in forest cover and vegetation type in northern Madagascar.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The global shipping network (GSN) has been suggested as a pathway for the establishment and reintroduction of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus primarily via the tire trade. We used historical maritime movement data in combination with an agent-based model to understand invasion risk in the United States Gulf Coast and how the risk of these invasions could be reduced. We found a strong correlation between the total number of cargo ship arrivals at each port and likelihood of arrival by both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. Additionally, in 2012, 99.2% of the arrivals into target ports had most recently visited ports occupied by both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, increasing risk of Aedes invasion. Model results indicated that detection and removal of mosquitoes from containers when they are unloaded at a port may be more effective in reducing the establishment of mosquito populations compared to eradication efforts that occur while onboard the vessel, suggesting detection efforts should be focused on unloaded containers. To reduce the risk of invasion and reintroduction of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, surveillance and control efforts should be employed when containers leave high risk locations and when they arrive in ports at high risk of establishment.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AU  - Ascensão, Fernando

AU  - Pereira, Henrique M.
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Assessing the road effects on biodiversity is challenging because impacts may depend on both wildlife responses to roads and on the spatial arrangement of roads. We questioned whether an increase in road encroachment i.e., the advancement of roads into non-urban areas, leads to significant changes (positive and negative) in species occurrence, and if so, whether those changes are linked to specific traits related to perturbation sensitiveness, therefore acting as filters that increase the community compositional dissimilarity. Using a large citizen-science dataset of point-counts performed throughout Iberian Peninsula (4,459 unique survey sites), we modelled the effect of road density on the occurrence of common songbirds (n=58), while accounting for potential confounding effects of environment and survey effort. We then tested if species’ occurrence patterns would be linked to specific traits related to the ability to cope with human presence. Finally, we assessed how road density affect the community compositional dissimilarity. We estimated 24 (41%) and 12 (21%) species to be negatively and positively affected by roads, respectively. Increased road encroachment was positively related with a higher prevalence of urban dwellers and negatively related with the occurrence of species nesting and foraging on the ground. Furthermore, increasing road density translated into an increasing community compositional dissimilarity, mostly due to species turnover. Our study support previous research showing that roads have different effects on the occurrence of different species, but we revealed that at least three species' traits have a clear relation with such road responses. Such trait filtering is probably causing a high species turnover between songbird communities occurring in roaded and nearby roadless areas. Overall, we found that different species-specific responses to roads translates into changes at the community level. Landscape and road-network management should be conceived acknowledging that roads are contributing to biodiversity changes. As so, building upon the concepts of Land Sharing / Land Sparing, conservation actions should be tailored according to the different species responses e.g., road verge management targeting species having a positive relation with road density; and compensation actions targeting species showing a negative response toward roads.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Weather and land use can significantly impact mosquito abundance and presence, and by consequence, mosquito-borne disease (MBD) dynamics. Knowledge of vector ecology and mosquito species response to these drivers will help us better predict risk from MBD. In this study, we evaluated and compared the independent and combined effects of weather and land use on mosquito species occurrence and abundance in Eastern Ontario, Canada. Data on occurrence and abundance (245,591 individuals) of 30 mosquito species were obtained from mosquito capture at 85 field sites in 2017 and 2018. Environmental variables were extracted from weather and land use datasets in a 1-km buffer around trapping sites. The relative importance of weather and land use on mosquito abundance (for common species) or occurrence (for all species) was evaluated using multivariate hierarchical statistical models. Models incorporating both weather and land use performed better than models that include weather only for approximately half of species (59% for occurrence model and 50% for abundance model). Mosquito occurrence was mainly associated with temperature whereas abundance was associated with precipitation and temperature combined. Land use was more often associated with abundance than occurrence. For most species, occurrence and abundance were positively associated with forest cover but for some there was a negative association. Occurrence and abundance of some species (47% for occurrence model and 88% for abundance model) were positively associated with wetlands, but negatively associated with urban (Culiseta melanura and Anopheles walkeri) and agriculture (An. quadrimaculatus, Cs. minnesotae and An. walkeri) environments. This study provides predictive relationships between weather, land use and mosquito occurrence and abundance for a wide range of species including those that are currently uncommon, yet known as arboviruses vectors. Elucidation of these relationships has the potential to contribute to better prediction of MBD risk, and thus more efficiently targeted prevention and control measures.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Protected areas are central to meeting biodiversity conservation goals, but measuring their effectiveness is challenging. We address this challenge by using DNA from leech-ingested bloodmeals to estimate vertebrate occupancies across the 677 km2 Ailaoshan reserve in Yunnan, China. 163 park rangers collected 30,468 leeches from 172 patrol areas. We identified 86 vertebrate species, including amphibians, mammals, birds, and squamates. Multi-species occupancy modelling showed that species richness increased with elevation and distance to reserve edge, including the distributions of most of the large mammals (e.g. sambar, black bear, serow, tufted deer). The exceptions were the three domestic mammal species (cows, sheep, goats) and muntjak deer, which were more common at lower elevations. eDNA-estimated vertebrate occupancies are Granular, Repeatable, Auditable, Direct, Efficient, and Simple-to-understand measures that can be used to assess conservation effectiveness and thus to improve the contributions that protected areas make to achieving global biodiversity goals.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Urbanization is decreasing wildlife habitat and connectivity worldwide, including for apex predators, such as the puma (Puma concolor). Puma populations along California’s central and southern coastal habitats have experienced rapid fragmentation from development, leading to calls for demographic and genetic management. To address urgent conservation genomic concerns, we used double-digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing to analyze 16,285 genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 401 broadly sampled pumas. Our analyses indicated support for 4–10 geographically nested, broad- to fine-scale genetic clusters. At the broadest scale, the 4 genetic clusters had high genetic diversity and exhibited low linkage disequilibrium, indicating pumas have retained statewide genomic diversity. However, multiple lines of evidence indicated substructure, including 10 fine-scale genetic clusters, some of which exhibited allelic fixation and linkage disequilibrium. Fragmented populations along the Southern Coast and Central Coast had particularly low genetic diversity and strong linkage disequilibrium, indicating genetic drift and close inbreeding. Our results demonstrate that genetically at-risk populations are typically nested within a broader-scale group of interconnected populations that collectively retains high genetic diversity and heterogeneous fixations. Thus, extant variation at the broader scale has potential to restore diversity to local populations if management actions can enhance vital gene flow and recombine locally sequestered genetic diversity. These state- and genome-wide results are critically important for science-based conservation and management practices. Our broad- and fine-scale population genomic analysis highlights the information that can be gained from population genomic studies aiming to provide guidance for fragmented population conservation management.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - In this study, we tested whether urban landscape structure influences avian species diversity using data for Harare, Zimbabwe. Initially, we quantified landscape structure using fragmentation indices derived from a 5m resolution SPOT 5 imagery. We collected bird species data through field-based observations of birds at 35 locations occurring in five land use/land cover types. We quantified avian species diversity using Barger-Parker, Menhinick and Simpson’s Indices. Regression analysis was used to determine the nature and strength of the relationships between avian species diversity and fragmentation indices. Results indicated that woodland specialist avian species are negatively associated with landscape fragmentation, while grassland specialist and generalist avian species positively responded to patch edge density, habitat patch size and shape complexity. Overall, our results suggest that changes in landscape structure due to expansion of built-up areas in tropical urban areas may influence avian species diversity.

AB  - Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding for biodiversity monitoring is a critical technical advance. Both aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity information can be detected in riverine water eDNA. However, it remains unverified whether riverine water eDNA can be used to simultaneously monitor aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity. Our specific objective was to assess the effectiveness of monitoring aquatic and riparian biodiversity using riverine water eDNA. We proposed that the monitoring effectiveness (the proportion of aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity information detected by riverine water eDNA samples) could be approximated by the transportation effectiveness of land-to-river and upstream-to-downstream biodiversity information flow. We conducted a case study in a watershed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and estimated the effectiveness of using riverine water eDNA to monitor aquatic and riparian biodiversity based on comparing the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and species assemblages of three taxonomic communities detected in riverine water eDNA samples and riparian soil eDNA samples in spring, summer, and autumn. The aquatic and riparian biodiversity of a watershed on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau could be simultaneously effectively monitored using riverine water eDNA on summer or autumn rainy days. Monitoring bacterial communities was more efficient than monitoring eukaryotic communities. On summer rainy days, 43%-76% of riparian species could be detected in water eDNA samples, 92%-99% of upstream species could be detected in a 1-km downstream eDNA sample, and more than 50% of dead bioinformation (i.e., the bioinformation labeling the biological material without life activity and fertility) could be monitored 4-6 km downstream for eukaryotes and 13-19 km for bacteria. We encourage more studies on the monitoring effectiveness for each taxonomic community in other watersheds with different environmental conditions. We believe that in future ecological research, conservation and management, we could efficiently monitor and assess the aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity by simply using riverine water eDNA samples.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Urbanization is rapidly transforming much of Southeast Asia, altering the structure and function of the landscape, as well as the frequency and intensity of the interactions between people, animals, and the environment. In this study, we began to explore the impact of urbanization on zoonotic disease risk by simultaneously characterizing changes in the abundance and diversity of reservoir hosts (rodents), ectoparasite vectors (ticks), and microbial pathogens across a gradient of urbanization in Malaysian Borneo. We found that although rodent species diversity decreased with increasing urbanization, two species appeared to thrive in anthropogenic environments: the invasive urban exploiter, Rattus rattus and the native urban adapter, Sundamys muelleri. R. rattus was strongly associated with the presence of built infrastructure across the gradient and dominated the urban rodent community where it was associated with high microbial diversity and multi-host zoonoses capable of environmental transmission, including Leptospira spp., and Toxoplasma gondii. In contrast, S. muelleri was restricted to sites with a significant vegetative component where it was found at high densities in the urban location. This species was strongly associated with the presence of ticks, including the medically important genera Ambylomma, Haemaphysalis, and Ixodes. Overall, our results demonstrate that the response to urbanization varies by species at all levels: host, ectoparasite, and microbe. This may lead to increased zoonotic disease risk in a subset of environments across urban and urbanizing landscapes that can be reduced through improved pest management and public health messaging.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - The selective landscape that gave rise to Earth’s species has shifted in the Anthropocene. Humans have accelerated extinction pressures, making efforts to detect general non-random patterns of extinction increasingly important. Much research has focused on detecting which traits make some species more likely to go extinct, such as large body size and slow reproductive rate in animals, limited dispersal in vascular plants, and narrow habitat requirements in cacti. However, general models for such non-random extinction are lacking. Here, we adapt the three general models of natural selection to classify non-random extinction as directional, disruptive, or stabilizing extinction. We develop a quantitative method for testing which general extinction model best describes observed data and apply it to the Caribbean lizard genus Leiocephalus as a case study. We surveyed the literature for recorded last occurrence for extinct and threat status for extant species. Eight species have gone extinct and ten are predicted to go extinct soon. Past extinctions in Leiocephalus showed directional extinction of large bodied species, while future-predicted extinctions exhibited a more complex extinction model similar to both random and stabilizing extinction with respect to body size. Similarly, future-predicted extinctions exhibited stabilizing extinction with respect to limb and tail lengths. Lizards with either very long or very short appendages are most likely to go extinct in the future. This shift from directional to stabilizing extinction for Leiocephalus is consistent with hunting, introduced predators, and habitat loss that first increased extinction pressure on the largest species and then extinction pressure on species that deviate from an adaptive peak centered on a generalist ground-lizard body plan. As adaptive optima shift in the Anthropocene, general models of non-random extinction are essential to developing a mature strategy for future successful conservation efforts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Pollinating invertebrates are vital to terrestrial ecosystems but are impacted by anthropogenic habitat loss/fragmentation and climate change. Conserving and improving landscape connectivity is important to offset those threats, yet its assessment for invertebrates is lacking. In this study, we evaluated the functional connectivity between protected areas in Australia for 59 butterfly species, under present conditions and different future scenarios (for 2050 and 2090) of land-use, land-cover, and climate change. Using circuit-theory analysis, we found that functional connectivity under present conditions varies widely between species, even when their estimated geographical ranges are similar. Under future scenarios, functional connectivity is predicted to decrease overall, with negative changes worsening from 2050 to 2090, although a few species are positive exceptions. We have made our results available as spatial datasets to allow comparisons with taxa from other studies and can be used to identify priority areas for conservation in terms of establishing ecological corridors or stepping-stone habitat patches. Our study highlights the importance of considering pollinating invertebrates when seeking holistic conservation and restoration of a landscape’s functional connectivity, underscoring the need to expand and promote protected areas to facilitate functional connectivity under future scenarios of global change.Research Data The habitat suitability maps and functional connectivity maps are made available as GeoTiff images via Figshare (10.6084/m9.figshare.19130078).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - As species ranges shift in response to anthropogenic change, they lose coevolved or coadapted interactions and gain novel ones in recipient communities. Range-expanding species may lose or experience weak antagonistic interactions with competitors and enemies, and traits of interacting species will determine the strength of interactions. We leveraged a poleward range expansion of an oak gall wasp that co-occurs on its host plant with other gall wasp species and interacts with shared natural enemies (largely parasitoid wasps). We created quantitative host-parasitoid interaction networks by sampling galls on 400 trees. We compared network structure and function and traits of hosts and parasitoids in the native and expanded range. Interaction networks were less diverse in the expanded range, with low complementarity of parasitoid assemblages among hosts. While whole networks were more generalized in the expanded range, interactions with the range-expanding species were more specialized. This was not due to a loss of specialist enemies but weak apparent competition by shared generalist enemies. Phenological divergence of enemy assemblages attacking the novel and co-occurring hosts was greater in the expanded range that may contribute to weak apparent competition. Given the rate and extent of anthropogenic-driven range expansions, it is pressing to uncover how complex biotic interactions are reassembled.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Urban forests (i.e. all vegetation present in urban areas), provide environmental and socioeconomic benefits1 to more than half of the global population2. Projected climate change threatens these benefits to society3–5. Here, we assess vulnerability to climate change of 16,006 plant species present in the urban forests of 1,010 cities within 93 countries, using three vulnerability metrics: exposure, safety margin and risk. Exposure expresses the magnitude of projected changes in climate in a given area, safety margin measures species’ sensitivity to climate change, and risk is the difference between exposure and safety margin6. We identified 9,676 (60.5%) and 8,344 (52.1%) species exceeding their current climatic tolerance (i.e. safety margin) for mean annual temperature (MAT) and annual precipitation (AP), respectively. By 2050, 13,479 (84.2%) and 9,960 (62.2%) species are predicted to be at risk from projected changes in MAT and AP, respectively, with risk increasing in cities at lower latitudes. Our results can aid evaluation of the impacts of climate change on urban forests and identify the species most at risk. Considering future climates when selecting species for urban plantings will enhance the long-term societal benefits provided by urban forests, including their contribution to mitigating the magnitude and impacts of climate change.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Taxonomists consider species as discrete units of biological organization, which are subject to a continuous process of evolutionary change and are connected through their shared ancestry. However, the continuous nature of evolutionary change is difficult to reconcile with the discrete outcome of speciation, especially where species boundaries are permeable. A good example of this inconsistency is the lichen genus Pyrenodesmia, which shows a high morphologic and genetic diversity that that defies systematization by taxonomic or phylogenetic methods. Here we show that hybridization explains the presence of discordant morphs and that European species are interconnected through cross-mating in a single reproductive network, a syngameon, despite which species remain largely distinct and distinguishable. Whole genome data reflect the important role played by genome defense mechanisms in the genomic stabilization of fungal hybrids. The recurrence of Repeat Induced Point mutations (RIP) shapes genomes with islands of suppressed recombination and loss of gene content, which in turn generates a feedback loop reinforcing the lack of reproductive isolation through the loss of heterokaryon incompatibility and a tendency towards morphological reduction.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Chile’s isolation and varied climates have driven the evolution of a unique biodiversity with a high degree of endemism. The Mediterranean-type biome of Central Chile is one of 35 global biodiversity hotspots and has been highlighted as one of Chile’s most endangered areas. It is threatened by anthropogenic land use change impacting the integrity of local biomes and associated species. This area holds the most extensive collections of the country with high endemicity regarding native bee species. Characterising habitat requirements of bees is a pressing priority to safeguard them and the ecosystem services they provide.We investigated broad-scale patterns of bee diversity using newly accessible expert-validated datasets comprising digitized specimen records from both Chilean and US collections and novel, expert-validated type specimen data for the bees of Chile. We used a generalised dissimilarity modelling (GDM) approach to explore both compositional and phylogenetic β-diversity patterns across latitudinal, altitudinal, climate and habitat gradients in well-sampled bee assemblages in Central Chile. Using the GDM measures of increasing compositional and environmental dissimilarity we categorised and compared the most important drivers of these patterns and used them to classify ‘wild bee ecoregions’ (WBE) representing unique assemblages.Turnover of bee assemblages was explained primarily by latitudinal variation (proxy for climate) along Chile. However, temperature variations, precipitation and the presence of bare soil also significantly explained the observed patterns. In comparison, we observed less turnover in phylogenetic biodiversity corresponding to spatial gradients. We were able to develop six de novo ecoregions (WBE) all with distinct taxa, endemic lineages, and representative species. The WBE represent distinct spatial classifications but have similarities to existing biogeographical classifications, ecosystems and bioclimatic zones.This approach establishes the baseline needed to prioritise bee species conservation efforts across this global biodiversity hotspot. We discuss the novelty of this classification considering previous biogeographical characterisations and its relevance for assessing conservation priorities for bee conservation. We argue that Chile’s WBE show areas requiring funding for bee species exploration and description, distribution mapping and strengthening of conservation policies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Land use intensification in urban areas can have profound effects on biological communities that provide valuable ecosystem services to urban residents. We used a functional response and effect trait approach to determine how bird species’ responses to local and landscape-scale habitat of urban green spaces affects the supply of cultural and regulating ecosystem services. We sampled bird communities and habitat variables in urban green spaces that varied in local and landscape-scale habitat composition and compiled a dataset of species’ response and effect traits related to nesting, foraging, diet, and visual and acoustic aesthetic appeal. Overall, the landscape-scale context of a green space had a stronger influence on species’ abundances than local-scale habitat. Landscape-scale impervious surface surrounding our study sites interacted with response traits related to nesting in human-built structures, clutch size, and consumption of invertebrates to drive bird species’ abundances. Because correlations between response and effect traits can influence the effect traits available to provide ecosystem services at a site, we explored the correlation of these three response traits to a suite of effect traits and found the response traits were correlated with several effect traits related to diet and regulating services but correlated with few of the plumage and acoustic traits that produce cultural services. Finally, we found that effect traits associated with cultural and regulating ecosystem services varied strongly along the landscape-scale gradient of urbanization. Sites with high impervious surface cover are expected to have low levels of invertebrate pest control and visual appeal but high levels of acoustic appeal, diet evenness (generalism), and granivory. Overall, our study highlights the key role of landscape-scale habitat in driving bird-mediated ecosystem services and underscores the importance of regional urban planning to create healthy and livable cities.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The geographic nature of biological dispersal shapes patterns of genetic variation over landscapes, so that it is possible to infer properties of dispersal from genetic variation data. Here we present an inference tool that uses geographically-referenced genotype data in combination with a convolutional neural network to estimate a critical population parameter: the mean per-generation dispersal distance. Using extensive simulation, we show that our deep learning approach is competitive with or outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly at small sample sizes (e.g., n = 10). In addition, we evaluate varying nuisance parameters during training—including population density, population size changes, habitat size, and the size of the sampling window relative to the full habitat—and show that this strategy is effective for estimating dispersal distance when other model parameters are unknown. Whereas competing methods depend on information about local population density or accurate identification of identity-by-descent tracts as input, our method uses only single-nucleotide-polymorphism data and the spatial scale of sampling as input. These features make our method, which we call disperseNN, a potentially valuable new tool for estimating dispersal distance in non-model systems with whole genome data or reduced representation data. We apply disperseNN to 12 different species with publicly available data, yielding reasonable estimates for most species. Importantly, our method estimated consistently larger dispersal distances than mark-recapture calculations in the same species, which may be due to the limited geographic sampling area covered by some mark-recapture studies. Thus genetic tools like ours complement direct methods for improving our understanding of dispersal.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - More ambitious conservation efforts are needed to stop the global biodiversity crisis. Here, we estimate the minimum land area to secure important sites for terrestrial fauna, ecologically intact areas, and the optimal locations for representation of species ranges and ecoregions. We discover that at least 64 million km2 (44% of terrestrial area) requires conservation attention. Over 1.8 billion people live on these lands so responses that promote agency, self-determination, equity, and sustainable management for safeguarding biodiversity are essential. Spatially explicit land-use scenarios suggest that 1.3 million km2 of land requiring conservation could be lost to intensive human land-uses by 2030, which requires immediate attention. However, there is a seven-fold difference between the amount of habitat converted under optimistic and pessimistic scenarios, highlighting an opportunity to avert this crisis. Appropriate targets in the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework to ensure conservation of the identified land would contribute substantially to safeguarding biodiversity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - One of the defining features of the Anthropocene is eroding ecosystem services as a function of decreases in biodiversity and overall reductions in the abundance of once-common organisms, including many insects that play innumerable roles in natural communities and agricultural systems that support human society. It is now clear that the preservation of insects cannot rely solely on the legal protection of natural areas far removed from the densest areas of human habitation. Instead, a critical challenge moving forward is to intelligently manage areas that include intensively farmed landscapes, such as the Central Valley of California. Here we attempt to meet this challenge with a tool for modeling landscape connectivity for insects (with pollinators in particular in mind) that builds on available information including lethality of pesticides and expert opinion on insect movement. Despite the massive fragmentation of the Central Valley, we find that connectivity is possible, especially utilizing the restoration or improvement of agricultural margins which (in their summed area) exceed natural areas. Finally, we highlight steps moving forward and the great many knowledge gaps that could be addressed in the field to improve future iterations of our modeling approach.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Urbanization gradients influence both landscape and climate and provide opportunity for understanding how species, especially plants and pollinators, respond to artificially driven environmental transitions.Here, we investigated several aspects of pollination along an urbanization gradient in landscape and climate. We quantified wild hoverfly and bee abundances with trapping, standing crop of nectar with spectrophotometer, and the pollen transported by flower-visitors with DNA-metabarcoding, in 40 independent sites from seminatural to built-up areas in Northern Italy.Linear and nonlinear relationships were detected along the urbanization gradient. Pollinator abundances increased until 22% of impervious surface, dropping by 34% after that, and it also decreased with green patch distance and urban park size. Thus, suburban landscapes host more pollinators than highly cemented or seminatural areas. Moreover, pollinators diminished by up to 45% in areas with low temperature seasonality: urbanized areas likely posing thermic stress. Furthermore, the sugar mass available in nectar increased by 91% with impervious cover, indicating that city nectars were less consumed or flowers more productive. Furthermore, the species richness of pollen decreased by 32% in highly urbanized areas, and with a high incidence of exotic plants, hinting for anthropized plant communities.Synthesis and applications. Urbanization influences pollinator abundances, nectar resources and transported pollen. Pollinators are negatively affected by a thermally harsh climate in highly urbanized areas with isolated green areas and large parks. Suburban landscapes demonstrated the highest pollinator presence. In the city core, flowers contained more nectary sugar, while pollinators collected pollen from a small number of plants, mainly exotic. These findings highlight the influence of urban landscape structure and climate on pollinators and plants, showing that cities are heterogenous realities. Patterns from this study will serve as basis for pollinator-friendly planning and management of urban landscapes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The rapid expansion of urban areas in which natural and semi-natural areas are replaced by human infrastructure, such as buildings and streets, is a major threat to biodiversity worldwide. However, little is known about how the structure of biotic communities is affected by urbanization in the tropics. Here, we tested the effect of land use types in urban and peri-urban areas on frog species richness and community composition in central Brazil. We selected 20 ponds differing in size and surrounding levels of urbanization as well as natural forest cover. We then used a Poisson GLM and a distance-based Redundancy Analysis (db-RDA) to relate species richness and community composition, respectively, to environmental variables. Variation in species richness was best explained by pond size (positive effect) and amount of urbanization (negative effect) in the surrounding 500 m. Community composition was mainly driven by species turnover than by nestedness, with db-RDA showing that turnover was explained primarily by urban infrastructure and forest cover. Our results indicate that urbanization negatively influences species richness. Moreover, as the amount of urbanization increased, several species were replaced by others taxa that appear better adapted to urban environments. Our results indicate that maintaining large ponds with surrounding native vegetation in urban environments might be an effective strategy for conserving frog communities.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AU  - Bergey, Elizabeth A.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Residential yards constitute a substantive biodiverse greenspace within urban areas. This biodiversity results from a combination of native and non-native species and can contribute to biotic homogenization. Geographical climatic patterns affect the distribution of native species and may differently affect non-native species. In this study, we examined biodiversity and biotic homogenization patterns of yard-dwelling land snails across 12 towns in Oklahoma and Kansas (USA). The 3 × 4 array of towns incorporated a N-S winter temperature gradient (mean low January temperature range = −8.4 to 0.1 °C) and an E-W annual rainfall gradient (annual rainfall range = 113.8 to 61.3 cm/yr). Ten yards per town were surveyed. We hypothesized that mild winter temperatures and greater annual rainfall would be associated with greater snail abundance and richness, and that the presence of non-native species would contribute to biotic homogenization. Non-native snails were present and often abundant in all towns. Snail communities varied with both rainfall and cold temperature. Contrary to our prediction, snail abundance was inversely related to annual rainfall – likely because drier conditions resulted in greater yard watering that both augmented rainfall and maintained moist conditions. Sørensen similarity between towns for the entire land snail community and for only non-native species both showed distance-decay patterns, with snail composition becoming less similar with increasing distance - patterns resulting from species turnover. The biotic homogenization index also showed a distance-decay pattern, such that closer towns were more likely to have biotic homogenization whereas more distant towns tended to have biotic differentiation. These results support the concept that biotic homogenization is more likely regionally and that climatic changes over distance result in species turnover and can reduce spatially broad biotic homogenization.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - The dilution effect predicts increasing biodiversity to reduce the risk of infection, but the generality of this effect remains unresolved. Because biodiversity loss generates predictable changes in host community competence, we hypothesized that biodiversity loss might drive the dilution effect. We tested this hypothesis by reanalyzing four previously published meta-analyses that came to contradictory conclusions regarding generality of the dilution effect. In the context of biodiversity loss, our analyses revealed a unifying pattern: dilution effects were inconsistently observed for natural biodiversity gradients, but were commonly observed for biodiversity gradients generated by disturbances causing losses of native biodiversity. Incorporating biodiversity loss into tests of generality of the dilution effect further indicated that scale-dependency may strengthen the dilution effect only when biodiversity gradients are driven by biodiversity loss. Together, these results help to resolve one of the most contentious issues in disease ecology: the generality of the dilution effect.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Urbanization is the dominant trend of global land use change. The replicated nature of environmental change associated with urbanization should drive parallel evolution, yet insight into the repeatability of evolutionary processes in urban areas has been limited by a lack of multi-city studies. Here we leverage community science data on coat color in &gt;60,000 eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) across 43 North American cities to test for parallel clines in melanism, a genetically based trait associated with thermoregulation and crypsis. We show the prevalence of melanism was positively associated with urbanization as measured by impervious cover. Urban-rural clines in melanism were strongest in the largest cities with extensive forest cover and weakest or absent in cities with warmer winter temperatures, where thermal selection likely limits the prevalence of melanism. Our results suggest that novel traits can evolve in a highly repeatable manner among urban areas, modified by factors intrinsic to individual cities, including their size, land cover, and climate.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Connectivity among habitat patches in both natural and disturbed landscapes needs to be accounted for in conservation planning for biodiversity maintenance. Yet methods to assess connectivity are often limited, because simulating the dispersal of many species is computationally prohibitive, and current simulations make simplifying assumptions about movement that are potentially erroneous. Here we show how these limits can be circumvented and propose a novel framework for the assessment of omnifunctional and omnidirectional connectivity in a 28000 km2 area in the Laurentian region of Québec, Canada. Our approach relies on (i) the use of Omniscape, an improved version of Circuitscape which allows omnidirectional simulations that better emulate animal movement and (ii) the synthesis of large volume of species-level dispersal simulations through a posteriori clustering of the current intensity. Our analysis reveals that the movement of 93 species evaluated can be clustered into three functional dispersal guilds, corresponding to mostly aquatic species, terrestrial species able to use aquatic environments, and strictly terrestrial species. These functional guilds do not share connectivity hotspots, suggesting that corridor planning would need to account for the multiplicity of dispersal strategies. Although this approach requires a large volume of computing resources, it provides richer information on which landscape features are critical to maintain or need to be regenerated for broader biodiversity maintenance goals.

AB  - Tracking progress towards global biodiversity conservation targets requires appropriate allocation of research and monitoring efforts. We conducted a global review of camera trap research on mammals as a proxy for biodiversity research and monitoring over the last two decades. We assessed how 3395 research locations from 2324 studies tracked priority regions for attaining the 2020 Aichi Biodiversity Targets. We used a geospatial distribution modelling approach to predict the spatial allocation of biodiversity research and to identify its key drivers. We show that conservation research in the past two decades has often failed to target areas important for conservation, and that 76.8% of the global research allocation can be attributed to country income, biome, mammal richness and accessibility. We predicted lowest probabilities of research allocation in low income countries. The Amazon and Congo Forest basins — two highly biodiverse ecosystems facing unprecedented human alteration — received inadequate research attention. Even in the most researched regions, an average of 51.4% of the research locations were outside the top 20% most important areas for the global biodiversity Aichi Targets. To support biodiversity conservation targets, policy and practice, more research and monitoring is required in regions with high importance for conservation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Tropical forests are being deforested worldwide, and the remaining fragments are suffering from biomass and biodiversity erosion. Quantifying this erosion is challenging because ground data on tropical biodiversity and biomass are often sparse. Here, we use an unprecedented dataset of 1,819 field surveys covering the entire Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot. We show that 83–85% of the surveys presented losses in forest biomass and tree species richness, functional traits and conservation value. On average, forest fragments had 25–32% less biomass, 23–31% fewer species, and 33%, 36% and 42% fewer individuals of late-successional, large-seeded and endemic species, respectively. Biodiversity and biomass erosion were both lower inside strictly protected conservation units, particularly in large ones. We estimate that biomass erosion across the Atlantic Forest remnants was equivalent to the loss of 55-70 thousand km2 of forests or US$2.3-2.6 billion in carbon credits. These figures have direct implications on mechanisms of climate change mitigation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Background Traditional biomonitoring approaches have delivered a basic understanding of biodiversity, but they cannot support the large-scale assessments required to manage and protect entire ecosystems. This study employed DNA metabarcoding to assess spatial and temporal variation in species richness and diversity in arthropod communities from 52 protected areas spanning three Canadian ecoregions.Results This study revealed the presence of 26,263 arthropod species in the three ecoregions and indicated that at least another 3,000–5,000 await detection. Results further demonstrate that communities are more similar within than between ecoregions, even after controlling for geographical distance. Overall α-diversity declined from east to west, reflecting a gradient in habitat disturbance. Shifts in species composition were high at every site with turnover greater than nestedness, suggesting the presence of many transient species.Conclusions Differences in species composition among their arthropod communities confirm that ecoregions are a useful synoptic for biogeographic patterns and for structuring conservation efforts. The present results also demonstrate that metabarcoding enables large-scale monitoring of shifts in species composition, making it possible to move beyond the biomass measurements that have been the key metric employed in prior efforts to track change in arthropod communities.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

TI  - Determining Best Practice for the Spatial Poisson Process in Species Distribution Modelling

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Poisson processes have become a prominent tool in species distribution modelling when analysing citizen science data based on presence records. This study examines four distinct statistical approaches, each of which utilises a different approximation to fit a Poisson point process. These include two Poisson regressions with either uniform weights or the more elaborate Berman-Turner device, as well as two logistic regressions, namely the infinitely weighted logistic regression method and Baddeley’s logistic regression developed in the context of spatial Gibbs processes. This last method has not been considered in depth in the context of Poisson point processes in the previous literature. A comprehensive comparison has been conducted on the performance of these four approaches using both simulated and actual presence data sets. When the number of dummy points is sufficiently large, all approaches converge, with the Berman-Turner device demonstrating the most consistent performance. A Poisson process model was developed to accurately predict the distribution of Arctotheca calendula, an invasive weed in Australia that does not appear to have been the subject of any species niche modelling analysis in the existing literature. Our findings are valuable for ecologists and other non-statistical experts who wish to implement the best practices for predicting species’ distribution using Poisson point processes.Competing Interest StatementOne of the authors, Ian Flint, has been supported by the ARC DP grant.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Diverse and abundant sea anemones are common in shallow marine areas. Detailed biodiversity analysis in Peru are comparatively scarce. To contribute to the biodiversity inventory and distribution information of this taxa, we analyzed exhaustively the available bibliography in Peruvian waters. A total of 23 anemone species were identified, distributed in 68 localities, and grouped into 1 Order (Actiniaria), 6 Families (Actiniidae, Actinostolidae, Aiptasiidae, Isanthidae, Phelliidae and Sagartiidae) and 20 Genera. The most reported species are Anthothoe chilensis (37 references), Phymactis clematis (28), Phymanthea pluvia (27), Oulactis concinnata (18), and Antholoba achates (15). Lima is the region with the highest number of publications, followed by La Libertad, Piura, Lambayeque, and Ancash. Anthothoe chilensis occurs in almost all the Peruvian coastal regions. On the contrary, O. concinnata has been primarily observed in Lima, while A. achates occurred only in the southern regions (Ica, Arequipa, and Moquegua). Rocky substrates (~55% records) seem to be the most suitable habitat for sea anemones in Peru, corresponding to exposed (e.g. vertical walls) and sheltered zones (e.g. rocky crevices, caves, under rock areas). Although most of the species in Peru exhibit a relatively wide spatial distribution, our results suggest that there are several regions with little or no research efforts. Despite a growing study effort over the past 30 years (&gt;50% of biodiversity reported), the current biodiversity status for this group is still unclear. A significant effort is needed to better analyze occurrence patterns and unveil new species regarding a changing environmental scenario with human influence.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Local biodiversity patterns are expected to strongly reflect variation in topography, land use, dispersal boundaries, nutrient supplies, contaminant spread, management practices and other anthropogenic influences. In contrast, studies focusing on specific taxa revealed a biodiversity homogenization effect in areas subjected to long-term intensive industrial agriculture. We investigated whether land use affects biodiversity and metacommunity structure in 67 kettle holes (KH) representing small aquatic islands embedded in the patchwork matrix of a largely agricultural landscape comprising grassland, forest, and arable fields. These KH, similar to millions of standing water bodies of glacial origin, spread across northern Europe, Asia, and North America, are physico-chemically diverse, differ in the degree of coupling with their surroundings. We assessed biodiversity patterns of eukaryotes, Bacteria and Archaea in relation to environmental features of the KH, using deep-amplicon-sequencing of eDNA. First, we asked whether deep sequencing of eDNA provides a representative picture of KH biodiversity across the three domains of life. Second, we investigated if and to what extent KH biodiversity is influenced by the surrounding land-use. Our data shows that deep eDNA amplicon sequencing is useful for in-depth assessments of cross-domain biodiversity comprising both micro- and macro-organisms, but, has limitations with respect to single-taxa conservation studies. Using this broad method, we show that sediment eDNA, integrating several years to decades, depicts the history of agricultural land-use intensification. The latter, coupled with landscape wide nutrient enrichment (including by atmospheric deposition), groundwater connectivity between KH and organismal movement in the tight network of ponds, resulted in a biodiversity homogenization in the KH water, levelling off today’s detectable differences in KH biodiversity between land-use types.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Urbanization and deforestation impose severe challenges to wildlife, particularly for forest-living vertebrates. Understanding how the peri-urban matrix impacts their survival is critical for designing strategies to promote their conservation. We investigated the threats faced by brown howler monkeys (Alouatta guariba clamitans) in peri-urban regions of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) and Santa Catarina (SC) states, southern Brazil, by compiling negative interaction events (hereafter NIE) reported over more than two decades. We assessed the major NIEs, their distribution among age-sex classes, and the predictors of NIE-related mortality. After 20+ years of monitoring, we compiled 540 NIEs (RS = 248 and SC = 292). Electrocution by power lines was the most frequent cause of death or injury (37%), followed by dog attack (34%), vehicle collision (17%), and human mistreatment (12%). The occurrence of lethal injuries ranged from 5% to 69% depending on the type of NIE and on which state it occurred in. The overall post-NIE mortality was 56%. Adults of both sexes were the most affected individuals in both study regions. The minimal adequate GLM model explained 83% of the variation in NIE-related mortality. State, NIE type, and age-sex class were the main predictors of mortality. Overall, mortality was lower in SC and higher among adult females than in the other classes. We found that the survival of brown howler monkeys in the forest-urban interface is constrained by both the urban infrastructure and the growing interactions with humans and domestic and stray dogs (Canis familiaris). We propose the placement of aerial bridges, road signs and speed bumps in areas of frequent animal crossing, the sterilization of stray dogs, and the sensitization of local inhabitants on the importance of respecting and protecting wildlife to reduce their NIEs with humans and domestic animals in the forest-urban interface.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Actions to protect against biodiversity loss and climate change will require a framework that addresses synergies between these interrelated issues. In this study we present methods for identifying areas important for the implementation of nature-based climate solutions and biodiversity conservation by intersecting high resolution spatial data for carbon storage and terrestrial connectivity. We explored the spatial congruence of carbon and connectivity in Ontario, Canada and examined effectiveness of current protected areas coverage. We found a weak positive relationship between carbon stocks and terrestrial connectivity; however, our maps revealed large hotspots, with high values of both indices, throughout the boreal forest and northern peatlands and smaller, isolated hotspots in the settled landscapes of the south. Location of hotspots varied depending on whether we considered forest or soil carbon. Further, our results show that current protected and conserved areas in Ontario only cover 13% of landscapes with the highest values for both carbon storage and connectivity. Protection or restoration of areas that maximize the co-benefits of carbon storage and connectivity would make significant contributions towards ambitious national targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserve biodiversity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Macrosystems ecology is an emerging science that aims to integrate traditionally distinct disciplines to predict how hierarchical interacting processes influence the emergence of complex patterns across local to regional and global scales. Despite increased focus on cross-scale relationships and cross-disciplinary integration, few macroecology studies incorporate genetic-based processes. Here we used a community genetics approach to investigate the pattern-process relationships underlying the emergence of macroscale biodiversity patterns. We tested the hypothesis that environmental variation, geography, and genetic connectivity in a foundation tree species differentially predict associated community assembly patterns from local to continental scales. Using genome-wide SNP data, we assessed genetic connectivity as a function of genetic similarity and structure in Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii) across its distribution throughout the southwestern US and México. For the same trees, we measured community composition, diversity, and abundance of leaf modifying arthropods and sequenced targeted amplicons of twig fungal endophytes. Five key findings emerged. (1) We identified three primary and six secondary population genetic groups within P. fremontii, which occupy distinct climate niches. (2) Both the leaf modifying arthropod and fungal endophyte communities were significantly differentiated across host tree ecotypes, with genetic distance among sampling locations explaining 13-17% of respective macroscale community structure. (3) For arthropods, environmental distance was the strongest driver of community similarity. (4) Conversely, host genetic connectivity was the most important contributor to macroscale endophyte community structure, with no significant contribution of environmental distance. (5) Furthermore, we observed a shift in the strength of interspecific relationships, with host genetics most strongly influencing associated communities at the intermediate population scale. Our findings suggest that genetic connectivity and environmental variation play integrated roles in macroscale community assembly, and their relative importance changes with scale. Thus, conservation genetic management of the diversity harbored within foundation species is vital for sustaining associated regional biodiversity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The detrimental effects of human-induced environmental change on people and other species are acutely manifested in urban environments. While urban greenspaces are known to mitigate these effects and support functionally diverse ecological communities, evidence of the ecological outcomes of urban greening remains scarce. We use a longitudinal observational design to provide empirical evidence of the putative ecological benefits of greening actions. We show how a small greening action quickly led to large positive changes in the richness, demographic dynamics, and network structure of a depauperate insect community. An increase in the diversity and complexity of the plant community led to, after only three years, a large increase in insect species richness, a greater probability of occurrence of insects within the greenspace, and a higher number and diversity of interactions between insects and plant species. We demonstrate how large ecological benefits may be derived from investing in small greening actions and how these contribute to bring indigenous species back to greenspaces where they have become rare or locally extinct. Our findings provide crucial evidence that support best practice in greenspace design and contribute to re-invigorate policies aimed at mitigating the negative impacts of urbanisation on people and other species.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Biological invasions are becoming more prevalent due to the rise of global trade and expansion of urban areas. Ants are among the most prolific invaders, with many exhibiting a multi-queen colony structure, dispersal through budding and a lack of inter-nest aggression. Although these characteristics are generally associated with the invasions of exotic ants, they may also facilitate the spread of native ants into novel habitats (e.g., urban areas). Native to North American forests, the odorous house ant Tapinoma sessile has become abundant in urban environments throughout the United States. Forest-dwelling colonies typically have a small workforce, inhabit a single nest, and are headed by a single queen, whereas urban colonies tend to be several orders of magnitude larger, inhabit multiple nests and are headed by multiple queens. Here, we explore and compare the population genetic and breeding structure of T. sessile within and between urban and natural environments in several localities across its distribution range. We found the social structure of a colony to be a plastic trait in both habitats, although extreme polygyny (i.e., nests with multiple queens) was confined to urban habitats. Additionally, polydomous colonies (i.e., nests lacking genetic differentiation and behavioral antagonism) were only present in urban habitats, suggesting T. sessile can only achieve unicoloniality within urbanized areas. Finally, we identified strong differentiation between urban and natural populations in each locality and continent-wide, indicating cities may restrict gene flow and exert intense selection pressure. Overall, our study highlights urbanization’s influence in charting the evolutionary course for species.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The role of urban street trees has been extensively studied in large metropolises, where they contribute significantly to faunal habitat, provide critical ecosystem services to residents and contribute to human well-being. On the other hand, rapidly urbanizing cities in India have been poorly studied, despite multiple types of irreplaceable losses related to tree cover. However, being early in their urbanization history, these centers also represent opportunity for urban sustainability with potentially high remnant vegetation and human-nature connections. While megacities in developed countries move towards biophilic urban planning and participatory decision making, basic information on tree communities and their perceived services is a bottleneck in achieving these goals in such small urban centers. We assessed the street tree community and resident perceptions of ecosystem service values in Kochi and Panjim, two coastal cities in India under rapid development, through a combination of field measurements (258 transects, 931 trees) and semi-structured interviews (497 individuals). We found that mean street tree density is low in both cities, especially so in Kochi, and corresponds to perceptions of recent change in tree cover (−28% in Kochi, −11% in Panjim). The street tree community in both cities were dominated by ornamental avenue trees such as Albizia saman and Peltophorum pterocarpum, but native coastal species like Cocos nucifera, Terminalia catappa and Thespesia populnea were also common. Despite recent urban growth, residents in both cities reported low value of trees for food, fodder and medicine, but high value for regulating services like shade and water. Moreover, we found strong evidence for aesthetic and cultural values of trees in both cities, including through qualitative interviews. Our study establishes critical baselines for biophilic planning in these small urban centers towards urban sustainability.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Urban environmental characteristics such as direct human disturbance have been shown to create a double-edged sword effect on wildlife’s ability to solve novel problems (1). However, these characteristics would continue to affect related cognitive processes (the ‘ripple effect hypothesis’). Here, we demonstrate this in urban Eurasian red squirrels who have previously learned a successful solution for a food-extraction problem (the innovators) by using two established food-extraction problems. One of the problems assesses the generalisation process (applying the learned solution when solving a similar but novel problem) and another problem examining memory for the learned solution of the original problem. The innovators significantly improve their solving latency on their 3rd success, and efficiently solve the generalisation problem from the 5th success onward. They also quickly recall the learned solution for the original problem in the memory test. While urban environmental characteristics do not affect the innovators’ ability to solve either problem, characteristics like direct human disturbance enhance the innovators’ learning speed for the generalisation problem, first recall and recall speed in the memory test. Path analyses show that direct human disturbance and to a lesser extent, area of green coverage are the major variables affecting cognitive performance. Our results highlight that some urban environmental characteristics can induce a far-reaching impact on shaping cognitive performance, as well as provide direct evidence for better understanding the mechanism that supports wildlife in adapting to urban environments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Sampling approaches are commonly adapted to reflect the study objectives in biodiversity monitoring projects. This approach optimizes findings to be locally relevant but comes at the cost of generalizability of findings. Here, we detail a comparison study directly examining how researcher choice of arthropod trap and level of specimen identification affects observations made in small-scale arthropod biodiversity studies. Sampling efficiency of four traps: pitfall traps, yellow ramp traps, yellow sticky cards, and a novel jar ramp trap were compared with respect to an array of biodiversity metrics associated with the arthropods they captured at three levels of identification. We also outline how to construct, deploy, and collect jar ramp traps. Trapping efficiency and functional groups of arthropods (flying, crawling, and intermediate mobility) varied by trap type. Pitfalls and jar ramp traps performed similarly for most biodiversity metrics measured, suggesting that jar ramp traps provide a more comparable measurement of ground-dwelling arthropod communities to pitfall sampling than the yellow ramp traps. The jar ramp trap is a simple, inexpensive alternative when the physical aspects of an environment do not allow the use of pitfalls. This study illustrates the implications for biodiversity sampling of arthropods in environments with physical constraints on trapping, and the importance of directly comparing adapted methods to established sampling protocol. Future biodiversity monitoring schemes should conduct comparison experiments to provide important information on performance and potential limitations of sampling methodology.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The processes that give rise to species richness gradients are not well understood, but may be linked to resource-based limits on the number of species a region can support. Ecological limits placed on regional species richness would also limit population sizes, suggesting that these processes could also generate genetic diversity gradients. If true, we might better understand how broad-scale biodiversity patterns are formed by identifying the common causes of genetic diversity and species richness. We develop a hypothetical framework based on the consequences of regional variation in ecological limits to simultaneously explain spatial patterns of species richness and neutral genetic diversity. Repurposing raw genotypic data spanning 38 mammal species sampled across 801 sites in North America, we show that estimates of genome-wide genetic diversity and species richness share spatial structure. Notably, species richness hotspots tend to harbor lower levels of within-species genetic variation. A structural equation model encompassing eco-evolutionary processes related to resource availability, habitat heterogeneity, and human disturbance explained 78% of variation in genetic diversity and 74% of the variation in species richness. These results suggest we can infer broad-scale patterns of species and genetic diversity using two simple environmental measures of resource availability and ecological opportunity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Governments around the world have acknowledged the importance of conserving ecological connectivity to help reverse the decline of biodiversity. In this study we employed recent methodological developments in circuit theory to conduct the first pan-Canadian analysis of multi-species connectivity for all terrestrial regions of the country, at a spatial grain sufficient to support local land-management decisions. We developed a movement cost surface with a limited number of thematic categories using the most recently updated land cover data available for the country. We divided the country into 17 tiles and used a wall-to-wall, omnidirectional mode of Circuitscape on each tile in order to assess ecological connectivity throughout entire landscapes as opposed to strictly among protected areas. The resulting raw current density map of Canada revealed heterogenous patterns of current density across the country, strongly influenced by geography, natural barriers, and human development. We included a validation analysis of the output current density map with independent wildlife data from across the country and found that mammal and herpetofauna locations were predicted by areas of high current density. We believe our current density map can be used to identify areas important for connectivity throughout Canada and thereby contribute to efforts to conserve biodiversity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - To reframe the imperfect review processes of nation-scale actions on area-based conservation through protected area (PA) networks, we first created novel infrastructure to visualize nation-level biodiversity information in Japan. We then assessed the performance of the existing PA network relative to land exploitation pressure and evaluated conservation effectiveness of PA expansion for the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. The Zonation algorithm was used to spatially prioritize conservation areas to minimize biodiversity loss and the extinction risk for 8,500 Japanese vascular plant and vertebrate species under constraints of the existing PA network and land use. The spatial pattern of the identified priority areas, which were considered candidate areas for expansion of the current PA network, was influenced by land-use types according to the mask layers of non-PAs, and low-, middle-, and high-ranked PAs. The current PA network reduced the aggregate extinction risk of multiple species by 36.6%. Indeed, the percentage of built-up areas in the existing PAs was in general smaller than that in the areas surrounding PAs. Notably, high-ranked PAs fully restrained built-up pressure (0.037% per 10 years), whereas low-ranked PAs in the national park and wild-life protection areas did not (1.845% per 10 years). Conservation effects were predicted to substantially improve by expansion of high-ranked (legally strict) PAs into remote non-PAs without population/socio-economic activities, or expansion of medium-ranked PAs into agriculture forestry satoyama and urban areas. A 30% land conservation target was predicted to decrease extinction risk by 74.1% when PA expansion was implemented across remote areas, satoyama, and urban areas; moreover, PA connectivity almost doubled compared with the existing PA network. In contrast, a conventional scenario showed that placing national parks in state-owned and non-populated areas would reduce extinction risk by only 4.0%. The conservation prioritization analyses demonstrated an effectiveness of using a comprehensive conservation approach that reconciles land-sparing protection and land-sharing conservation in other effective area-based conservation measures (OECM) in satoyama and urban green spaces. Our results revealed that complementary inclusion of various PAs interventions related to their governance and land-use planning plays a critical role in effectively preventing biodiversity loss and makes it more feasible to achieve ambitious conservation targets.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Depending on management practices, agricultural lands can either pose substantial barriers to the movement of native species or can support landscape connectivity by linking areas of high-quality habitat. Balancing connectivity and sustainable food production on agricultural lands is critical to conservation in the conterminous United States (CONUS) where agriculture makes up close to half of total land area. However, limited guidance exists on where to target conservation resources to maximize benefits for native species and food security.To quantify the potential contribution of agricultural lands to the movement of organisms, we developed a novel method for estimating agricultural management intensity (based on remotely sensed temporal variation in vegetation cover on croplands and pastures) and incorporated these estimates into a CONUS-wide, circuit-theory based model of ecological flow connectivity. We then combined our connectivity results with data on the productivity, versatility, and resilience of agricultural lands (PVR) to identify conservation opportunities that support both biodiversity and food production.The highest levels of connectivity on agricultural lands occurred on relatively unmodified rangelands and on cropland and pasture in close proximity to large amounts of natural land cover.Mapping connectivity and PVR across CONUS revealed 10.2 Mha of agricultural lands (2.7%) with high value for both connectivity and food production, as well as large amounts of agricultural land (&gt;140 Mha in total) with high value for either cultivation or supporting biodiversity (e.g., through ecological restoration).Drawing on these findings, we provide recommendations on the types of conservation approaches most suitable for a given agricultural system and link these recommendations to specific government incentive programs. To help facilitate conservation planning based on our results, we have developed an interactive web application, allowing users to visualize the spatial data developed here within their regions of interest.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AU  - Varga-Szilay, Zsófia

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - BACKGROUND Pesticides are one of the most important anthropogenic-related stressors. In times of global pollinator decline, the role of integrated farming and that of urban gardens in supporting wild pollinators is becoming increasingly important. We circulated an online questionnaire to survey the plant protection practices among Hungarian farmers and garden owners with a particular emphasis on pollinator protection.RESULTS We found that plant growers heavily rely on pesticide use, and pesticides are widely used in otherwise pollinator-friendly gardens. Whether pesticide use practices were driven by expert opinion and the respondents’ gender were the best predictors of pesticide use. Although most respondents supported pollinators, pesticides are also widely used among home garden owners, which can pose a non-evident ecological trap for pollinator populations in the gardens.CONCLUSION Special attention should be paid to implementing measures to reduce pesticide, use not only in farmlands but also in home gardens. Environmental education and financial support through agroecological schemes could efficiently promote the transition. However, whereas farmers can be encouraged to reduce pesticide use mostly by expert advice, garden owners are likely to rely on more conventional information channels. The attitude of Hungarian plant growers can provide an insight into pesticide use practices of Central and Eastern European countries, but similar surveys are needed across Europe for a complete understanding of broad-scale processes. This work lays the foundations for similar studies which can inform and facilitate the transformation processes to pesticide-free farming and gardening.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

TI  - A Framework for Better Sensor-Based Beehive Health Monitoring
AU  - Zaman, Asaduz
AU  - Dorin, Alan
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Hive bees provide essential pollination services to human agriculture. Managed honey bees in particular pollinate many crops, but also create honey and other bee products that are now of global economic importance. Key aspects of honey bee behaviour can be understood by observing hives. Hence, the limitations of manual observation are increasingly being addressed by new technologies that automate and extend the reach of hive monitoring.Here we propose a framework to classify and clarify the potential for sensor-assisted hive monitoring to inform apiculture and, ultimately, improve hive bee management. This framework considers hive monitoring approaches across three newly proposed categories: Operational monitoring, Investigative monitoring, and Predictive monitoring. These categories constitute a new “OIP Framework” of hive monitoring. Each category has its own requirements for underlying technology that includes sensors and ICT resources we outline. Each category is associated with particular outcomes and benefits for apiculture and hive health monitoring detailed here. Application of these three classes of sensor-assisted hive monitoring can simplify understanding and improve best-practice management of hive bees.Our survey and classification of hive monitoring to date show that it is seldom practiced beyond honey bees, despite the need to understand bumble bees and stingless bees also. Perhaps unsurprisingly, sensor-based hive monitoring is shown to remain primarily a practice of developed nations. Yet we show how all countries, especially developing nations, stand to gain substantially from the benefits improved sensor-based hive monitoring offers. These include a better understanding of environmental change, an increased ability to manage pollination, an ability to respond rapidly to hive health issues such as pests and pathogens, and even an ability to react quickly to the danger posed to insects and humans alike by extreme events such as floods and fires. Finally, we anticipate that the future of hive monitoring lies in the application of Predictive monitoring, such that a hive’s anticipated future state can be preemptively managed by beekeepers working iteratively with novel hive monitoring technologies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases (MBDs) such as malaria, dengue, and Rift Valley fever threaten public health and food security globally. Despite their cohesive nature, they are typically treated as distinct entities. Applying biological system analysis to the African MBDs from a One Health perspective, we provide the first biogeographic description of the African mosquito fauna corresponding with the pathogens they transmit. After compiling records accumulated over a century, we find that there are 677 mosquito species in Africa, representing 16 genera, and 151 mosquito-borne pathogens (MBPs) circulating primarily among wild tetrapods, dominated by viruses (95) and protozoans (47). We estimate that reported MBPs represent ∼1% of the actual number. Unlike mosquitoes, African arboviruses and mammalian plasmodia represent a higher share of the World’s total based on the area – species richness relationship (P&lt;0.0001), explaining the disproportional large share of global MBPs that originated from Africa. Species richness of African mosquitoes and MBPs are similarly concentrated along the equator, peaking in central Africa, with a secondary “ridge” along eastern Africa. Moderate diversity and low endemicity in mosquitoes across the Sahel reveals a fauna with high propensity for long-range migration. Regional differences in species richness, endemicity, and composition agreed with country-based results. The composition of mosquitoes and MBPs separates sub-Saharan Africa from north Africa, in accordance with the Palearctic and Afrotropical faunal realms, and west and central Africa are clustered together distinctly from the cluster of eastern and southern Africa. With ∼25% of the species occupying a single country, ∼50% in 1–3 countries and &lt;5% found in &gt;25 countries, the typical ranges of both mosquitoes and MBPs are surprisingly small. The striking similarity in diversity and especially in range distributions of mosquitoes and MBPs suggest that most MBPs are transmitted by one or few narrow-range mosquito vectors. Exceptionally widespread mosquito species (e.g., Ae. aegypti, Cx. quinquefasciatus, and 10 Anopheles species) feed preferentially on people and domestic animals, and nearly half are windborne migrants. Likewise, exceptionally widespread MBPs are transmitted between people or domestic animals and are vectored by one or more of the aforementioned widespread mosquitoes. Our results suggest that few MBPs have undergone a dramatic range expansion, after adapting to people or domestic animals as well as to exceptionally-widespread mosquitoes. During the intermediate phase of range expansion, MBPs extend their vector and vertebrate host ranges with a concomitant gradual increase in geographical range. Because range size may serve as a marker of the phase of range expansion, ranking the African MBPs according to range, we identified several MBPs that pose elevated risk for disease emergence (e.g., Wesselsbron virus). Taken together, our database, approach, and results can help improve MBD surveillance and lead to a better understanding of disease emergence. This knowledge has the potential to improve capacity to prevent and mitigate new and emerging MBD threats.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Acoustic monitoring is an effective and scalable way to assess the health of important bioindicators like bats in the wild. However, the large amounts of resulting noisy data requires accurate tools for automatically determining the presence of different species of interest. Machine learning-based solutions offer the potential to reliably perform this task, but can require expertise in order to train and deploy.We propose BatDetect2, a novel deep learning-based pipeline for jointly detecting and classifying bat species from acoustic data. Distinct from existing deep learning-based acoustic methods, BatDetect2’s outputs are interpretable as they directly indicate at what time and frequency a predicted echolocation call occurs. BatDetect2 also makes use of surrounding temporal information in order to improve its predictions, while still remaining computationally efficient at deployment time.We present experiments on five challenging datasets, from four distinct geographical regions (UK, Mexico, Australia, and Brazil). BatDetect2 results in a mean average precision of 0.88 for a dataset containing 17 bat species from the UK. This is significantly better than the 0.71 obtained by a traditional call parameter extraction baseline method.We show that the same pipeline, without any modifications, can be applied to acoustic data from different regions with different species compositions. The data annotation, model training, and evaluation tools proposed will enable practitioners to easily develop and deploy their own models. BatDetect2 lowers the barrier to entry preventing researchers from availing of effective deep learning bat acoustic classifiers.

AB  - Background Previous human cases or epidemics have suggested that Monkeypox virus (MPXV) can be transmitted through contacts with animals of African rainforests. Although MPXV has been identified in many mammal species, most are likely secondary hosts and the reservoir host has yet to be discovered.Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we provide the full list of African mammal genera (and species) in which MPXV was previously detected and predict the geographic distributions of all species of these genera based on museum specimens and an ecological niche modelling (ENM) method. Then, we reconstruct the ecological niche of MPXV using georeferenced data on animal MPXV sequences and human index cases, and conduct overlap analyses with the ecological niches inferred for 99 mammal species in order to identify the most probable animal reservoir.Conclusions/Significance Our results show that the MPXV niche covers three African rainforests, the Congo Basin and Upper and Lower Guinean forests. The four mammal species showing the best niche overlap with MPXV are all arboreal rodents, including three squirrels, Funisciurus anerythrus, Funisciurus pyrropus, and Heliosciurus rufobrachium, and Graphiurus lorraineus. We conclude that the most probable MPXV reservoir is F. anerythrus based on two niche overlap metrics, the areas of higher probabilities of occurrence, and available data on MPXV detection.Summary Monkeypox (MPX) is an emerging zoonotic disease, endemic to rainforests of West and Central Africa, which manifests as a fever, swollen lymph nodes, and fatigue, followed by a rash with macular lesions progressing from papules to vesicles, pustules and scabs, usually on the face, hands, and feet for two to four weeks. The case fatality rate ranges from 1-3% in West Africa to 5-10% in Central Africa. The disease has been reported in 10 African countries between 1970 and today, with an increasing number of cases over the last decades and several exportations outside the continent, the last one in 2022 resulting in an epidemic involving mostly men who have sex with men, with more than 80,000 cases detected worldwide.Although MPX virus has been identified in many mammal species, most are likely secondary hosts and the reservoir host has yet to be discovered. In this study, we compare the predicted geographic distribution (ecological niche) of the MPX virus with that of 99 mammal species, and conclude that the most probable MPX reservoir is Thomas’s rope squirrel (Funisciurus anerythrus), followed by three other arboreal rodents, including two squirrels (Funisciurus pyrropus and Heliosciurus rufobrachium) and the Lorrain dormouse (Graphiurus lorraineus).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Eumaeus butterflies are obligate herbivores of Zamia, the most diverse neotropical genus of cycads. Eumaeus-Zamia interactions have been mainly characterized for species distributed in North and Central America. However, host plant use by the southern Eumaeus clade remains largely unknown, precluding a comprehensive study of co-evolution between the genera. Here, we combine fieldwork with museum and literature surveys to expand herbivory records for Eumaeus from 21 to 38 Zamia species. We inferred a time-calibrated phylogeny of Eumaeus to test for distinct macroevolutionary scenarios of host plant conservatism and co-evolution. We found remarkable coincidence between Eumaeus and Zamia diversification, with the butterfly stem group diverging at the same time as the most recent radiation of Zamia in the Miocene. Cophylogenetic reconciliation analyses show a strong cophylogenetic signal between cycads and their butterfly herbivores. Bipartite model-based approaches indicate that this is because closely related Zamia species are used by the same Eumaeus species, suggesting host plant resource tracking by the butterfly herbivores. Our results highlight a case of tight evolution between Eumaeus butterflies and cycads, pointing to the generality of correlated evolution and phylogenetic tracking in plant-herbivore interactions across seed plants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Soil fertility play a prominent role in biological sustenance in turn fungi are significant participants in bridging biotic and abiotic interactions between the components in the environment, and they involve in breakdown of organic/ inorganic materials during bioleaching/ bioconversion leading to bio-availability and thus recycling of nutrients. Local environmental factors (abiotic), such as the chemical and physical properties of the soil, greatly influence the composition of existing fungal communities and determine the diversity of soil fungi. A correlation study of the micro fungi found in ecologically two different regions (Karnataka state, India) of Uttara Kannada and Chitradurga districts. One being part of India’s Western Ghats, a biologically fertile ecosystem and the other being a dry, arid region of Deccan plateau with scanty rain fall. Soil samples were collected from various geographical locations in order to study and evaluate the role that certain soil physicochemical features play in fungi diversity. According to our findings, soil attributes (fertility) are related to the composition, richness, and diversity of fungi in soils and thus soil’s physico-chemical properties assessed were linked to fungal diversity measurements. This led us to indicate the role of abiotic factors effecting the fungal diversity in soil and their prominent role in soil fertility.Importance of the Work This work signifies the role of fungal diversity on soil fertility and the impact of abiotic and physico-chemical soil parameters on the same. Thus the work explores the importance of the each of these components and the wild fungal strain’s participation in value addition to their functional role in breakdown of organic/ inorganic materials during bioleaching/ bioconversion leading to bio-availability and thus recycling of nutrients. The work also highlights soil pH as one of key indicators to define the diversity of soil fungi and can provide a direct correlation between pH, bioconversion and fungal activity/ diversity. This work is first of a kind from southern India connecting the western ghat bio-diversity hot-spot fertile region with the neighbouring barren Bayaluseemae region of Karnataka State, South India with regards to abiotic factors, fungi and fertility.

AB  - Rapid coastal development continues to jeopardize the integrity of marine socio-ecological systems. China is now the largest bilateral creditor in the world, committing nearly half a trillion US dollars to overseas development finance since 2008. Meanwhile, there are growing concerns over the impacts of this boom in Chinese development finance on marine systems. Here, we quantify the risks of coastal development projects financed by China to marine biodiversity and coastal Indigenous communities. Ports present the greatest impact risks to marine systems, in terms of both magnitude and area at risk, with power plants, roads, and other facilities presenting relatively high localized risks. Risks are most prominent in Africa and the Caribbean, with coastal Indigenous communities in Western and Central Africa particularly vulnerable to the potential negative impacts of development. All projects present some risk to threatened marine species and potential critical habitats, but few present high risks to nearby marine protected areas. Most projects present additional risks to ecosystems that are already under increasing human pressures, but some are likely to introduce new risks to relatively intact ecosystems. “Bluing” future coastal development projects in China’s overseas development finance portfolio will require more social and environmental safeguards, higher standards for host-country impact assessments, and greater integration of land-sea risk mitigation and management approaches.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The availability of pollen in urban-rural landscapes is an essential factor that influences the population dynamics of insect pollinators. The amount and diversity of pollen play a pivotal role in the foraging ecology of pollinators for their growth and health, but investigations on the spatio-temporal patterns of foraged plants remain rare, especially in cities as neo-ecosystems. Here, we explored the temporal foraging habits of a highly polylectic pollinator (Apis mellifera L.) in a study area, including different landscape classes from rural to urban areas. Mixed-pollen in each month and each location (N = 17) were analysed using DNA meta-barcoding to identify plants visited by honeybees. The results showed that the landscape class (rural, suburban and urban areas) explains spatial variations in the plant composition foraged by honeybees, but not in taxa richness. Furthermore, pollen diversity and plant composition showed a strong seasonal dependence. Furthermore, a higher plant richness and foraged woody taxa was found to occur in spring, which was mainly dominated by the genera Prunus and Acer. In summer and autumn, the genera Trifolium and Plantago of the herbaceous stratum were the most visited plants. The Fabaceae, Rosaceae, Brassicaceae, Plantaginaceae, and Onagraceae plant families were the most frequently observed in all combined samples. The present study contributes to a broader understanding of the ecology and floral preferences of honeybees, on which urban planning can rely to promote biodiversity in cities.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Urban environments are heterogeneous landscapes of social and environmental features, with important consequences for human-nature entanglements, such as that of mosquito-borne disease.Investigations into this intra-urban heterogeneity in mosquito dynamics find conflicting results, likely due to the complex socio-ecological interactions and the importance of place-based context. Integrative research, which synthesizes multiple disciplines and epistemologies, can help place ecological results into their social context to explore these place-based differences.Here, we develop an integrative approach to understanding spatial patterns of mosquito burdens in urban systems by combining entomological surveys, semi-structured interviews, and sketch maps.Although we found no evidence for a difference in mosquito abundance across an urban gradient, there were differences in individuals’ everyday experiences with mosquitoes. These differences were mediated by how individuals moved through public space and their vulnerability to hazards in these spaces.This example of integrative research illustrates what can be gained from the inclusion of multiple epistemologies, particularly for research in socio-ecological systems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

TI  - Shades of grey: Coat-colour dependent effect of urbanization on the bacterial microbiome of a wild mammal
AU  - Stothart, Mason R.
AU  - Newman, Amy E.M.
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Background Host-associated microbiota can be fundamental to the ecology of their host and may even help wildlife species colonize novel niches or cope with rapid environmental change. Urbanization is a globally replicated form of severe environmental change which we can leverage to better understand wildlife microbiomes. Does the colonization of separate cities result in parallel changes in the intestinal microbiome of wildlife, and if so, does within-city habitat heterogeneity matter? Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we quantified the effect of urbanization on the microbiome of eastern grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis). Eastern grey squirrels are ubiquitous in both rural and urban environments throughout their native range, across which they display an apparent coat colour polymorphism (agouti, black, intermediate).Results Grey squirrel microbiomes differed between rural and city environments; however, comparable variation was explained by habitat heterogeneity within cities. Our analyses suggest that operational taxonomic unit (OTU) community structure was more strongly influenced by local environmental conditions (rural and city forests versus human built habitats) than urbanization of the broader landscape (city versus rural). Many of the bacterial genera identified as characterizing the microbiomes of built-environment squirrels are though to specialize on host-derived products and have been linked in previous research to low fibre diets. However, despite an effect of urbanization at fine spatial scales, phylogenetic patterns in the microbiome were coat colour phenotype dependent. City and built environment agouti squirrels displayed greater phylogenetic beta-dispersion than those in rural or forest environments, and null modelling results indicated that the phylogenetic structure of urban agouti squirrels did not differ greatly from stochastic phylogenetic expectations.Conclusions Habitat heterogeneity at fine spatial scales affects host-associated microbiomes, however, we found little evidence that this pattern was the result of similar selective pressures acting on the microbiome within environments. Further, this result, those of phylogeny-independent analyses, and patterns of beta-dispersion lead us to suggest that microbiota dispersal and ecological drift are integral to shaping the inter-environmental differences we observed. These patterns were partly mediated by squirrel coat colour phenotype, and therefore putatively, host physiology. Given a well-known urban cline in squirrel coat colour melanism, grey squirrels provide an ideal free-living system with which to study how host genetics mediate environment x microbiome interactions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

TI  - Vector diversity and malaria prevalence: global trends and local determinants
AU  - Hoi, Amber Gigi
AU  - Gilbert, Benjamin

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Identifying determinants of global infectious disease burden is a central goal of disease ecology. While it is widely accepted that host diversity structures parasite diversity and prevalence across large spatial scales, the influence of vector diversity on disease risk has rarely been examined despite the role of vectors as obligatory intermediate hosts for many parasites. Malaria, for instance, can be transmitted by over 70 species of mosquitoes, but the impact of this diversity on malaria risk remains unclear. Further, such relationships are likely dependent on the context in which disease transmission occurs, as arthropod life history and behavior are highly sensitive to environmental factors such as temperature. We studied the relationship between vector diversity, malaria prevalence, and environmental attributes using a unique dataset we curated by integrating several open-access sources. Globally, the association between vector species richness and malaria prevalence differed by latitude, indicating that this relationship is strongly dependent on underlying environmental conditions. Structural equation models further revealed different processes by which the environment impacts vector community assemblage and function, and subsequently disease prevalence, in different regions. In Africa, the environment exerted a top-down influence on disease through its role in shaping vector communities, whereas in Southeast Asia, disease prevalence is influenced by more complex interactions between the physical and socioeconomic environment (i.e., rainfall and GDP) and vector diversity across sites. This work highlights the key role of vector diversity in structuring disease distribution at large spatial scales and offers crucial insights to vector management and disease control.Significance statement The global health threat from persistent and emerging vector-borne diseases continues to increase and is exacerbated by rapid environmental and societal change. Predicting how disease burden will shift in response to these changes necessitates a clear understanding of existing determinants of disease risk. We focused on an underappreciated potential source of variation in disease burden – vector diversity – and its role in structuring global malaria distribution. Our work revealed that vector diversity influences malaria prevalence and that the strength and nature of this association strongly depend on local environmental context. Extending disease transmission theory, surveillance, and control to embrace heterogeneity in vector community structure and function across space and time is an asset in the fight against vector-borne diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Wildlife may be attracted or repelled by anthropogenic stimuli – by understanding these responses we gain powerful tools to modify their behavior. Anthropogenic lighting is ubiquitous but little is known about how it influences carnivores. We focused on pumas (Puma concolor) living around Los Angeles, California for which vehicular collision is an important source of mortality. We used GPS collars to track their movement around roads and combined this with ground-level and remotely sensed data of human generated nighttime light to see how that influenced activity around roads. There are multiple landscape level scales, and metrics of light relevant at each scale, that influence the perceptual landscape of wildlife and thus these different scales must be considered. We found that, at a broad spatial scale, pumas crossed roads more frequently in areas with low levels of anthropogenic light (controlling for distance to urbanization). However, while pumas crossed roads in darker parts of the landscape at a broad-landscape scale, we did not find a statistically significant relationship between puma eye-level light intensity and predicted road crossing locations.Regarding pumas and nighttime light, it appears that having dark swaths of land, at a broad spatial scale, is important. This is important for puma conservation and road design as little is currently known about wildlife movement response to nighttime light and the ideal placement for mitigation structures. Ultimately, anthropogenic light at night is a landscape aspect that needs to be better understood and integrated into conservation as the human footprint increases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Since its first record in urban areas of Central-Africa in 2000s, the invasive mosquito, Aedes albopictus, has continued to spread across the region, including in remote rural areas, and promoted outbreaks of Aedes-borne diseases, such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. From the One-Health perspective, such invasion might enhance Ae. albopictus interactions with wild animals in forest ecosystems and favor the spillover of zoonotic arboviruses to humans. From 2014 to 2018, we monitored the steady spread of this mosquito species in the wildlife reserve of La Lopé National Park (Gabon), and evaluated the magnitude of its colonization of the rainforest ecosystem using ovitraps, larval surveys, BG-Sentinel traps, and human landing catches following an anthropization gradient. We detected Ae. albopictus in forest galleries up to 15km away from La Lopé village. However, Ae. albopictus was significantly more abundant at anthropogenic sites than in less anthropized areas. The number of eggs laid by Ae. albopictus decreased progressively with the distance from the forest fringe up to 200m inside the forest, showing that its occurrence in forest ecosystems is restricted to anthropized-sylvatic interfaces with dense forest. This suggests that Ae. albopictus may act as bridge vector of zoonotic pathogens between wild and anthropogenic compartments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Background Declines in plant biodiversity often have negative consequences for plant community productivity, and it becomes increasingly acknowledged that this may be driven by shifts in soil microbial community composition. These relationships have been well-established in grasslands, and few studies also indicate that fungi play a role in driving tree diversity-productivity relationships in forests. However, the role of bacteria and archaea, which are also highly abundant in forest soils and perform pivotal ecosystem functions, has been largely overlooked. Here, we investigated how tree and shrub richness affects stand-level tree productivity via modulating bacterial and archaeal community diversity and composition. We used a landscape-scale, subtropical tree biodiversity experiment (BEF-China) where tree (1, 2 or 4 species) and shrub richness (0, 2, 4, 8 species) were modified.Results Our results showed that tree and shrub species richness affected bacterial diversity, community composition, and co-occurrence networks, but such effects were marginal for archaea. Both tree and shrub species richness increased stand-level tree productivity by modulating soil microbial community composition, with the effects being mediated via increases in soil C:N ratios.Conclusions Our findings imply the importance of bacterial and archaeal communities in driving the relationship between plant diversity and productivity in subtropical forests and highlight that we may require better a understanding of prokaryotic communities in forest soils.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AU  - Schipper, Jan
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Over the past century, the white-nosed coati (WNC; Nasua narica) has expanded its northernmost range from the United States-Mexico border into northern Arizona. WNC are medium-sized, opportunistic omnivores that often occur in large groups (“bands”) and forage on insects, fruits, and small vertebrates. We compiled data from iNaturalist, published literature, Arizona Game and Fish records, museum collections, personal communications, and our own camera trap photography to chronicle this range expansion. Historical records documented WNC populations in mountainous areas along the US-Mexican border but rarely north of Tucson, AZ. The popularity of using wildlife cameras in both research and recreation, paired with the advancement of citizen science projects like iNaturalist have generated a vast amount of new data on species distributions. With this new body of information we report the range of WNC now occurs over 400 km farther north, extending north of Flagstaff, Arizona. Recent records include occurrence in ponderosa pine forest that sustain sometimes heavy winter snow – an environment vastly different from the species’ normal range. The northward expansion of this meso-carnivore invites many questions about drivers of range expansion, including climate change, mesopredator release, or simple opportunism. More research into the behavior and ecology of WNC in the northern extent of their range is needed to guide understanding and potential future management of this species, its impacts, and prediction of other such range expansions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - This study evaluates how eDNA information could be used within Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). We developed an original model to simulate the conditions for which an eDNA signal detects, or does not detect, an impact on a targeted (receptor) species in a given project area. The simulation has four consecutive steps. First, a deterministic model simulated the dynamics of the receptor population and their eDNA fragment concentrations in the environment. Second, random distributions of receptor organisms and eDNA fragment quantities at steady-state were simulated within the project area. Then Simple Random Samplings were performed for both the receptor and eDNA. Third, post-sampling processes (eDNA extraction, amplification, analysis) were simulated to estimate the detection probability of the species from sample plan characteristics (size of sampling unit, number of samples collected). Fourth, we simulated an impact by modifying the growth, mortality and mobility (null, passive and active) parameters of the receptor species, then determined if an impact was detected. Detection probability curves were estimated for a range of sample volumes fitted with a Weibull cumulative distribution function. An F-like statistic compared detection curves before and after impact. Twelve scenarios were simulated. A statistically significant impact was detected with eDNA when receptor species growth rate was halved, but only in cases of null or passive mobility. When the receptor experienced both reduced growth and increased mortality rates, an impact was detected in all three mobility cases (null, passive and active). Our results suggest that an impact could be detected using eDNA if both the population dynamics of the receptor and the dynamics of DNA shed into the environment are known. These results indicate that caution should be exercised with eDNA data for EIA, but the proposed framework provides a valuable starting point to improve interpretation of indirect observation methods such as eDNA.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - 1: Citizen science is increasingly used to collect ecological data. Specifically, participation of school students in authentic research has been suggested as having a multitude of benefits from data collection to science education. Nevertheless, the overall quality and quantity of data concerns ecologists who are using data for further analysis.2: I coordinate a citizen science project, the Helsinki Urban Rat Project where lower and upper secondary school students collect data on urban rat occurrence through the use of track plates that record rat footprints. Within the project, both the success and accuracy of participating young citizen scientists can be assessed by comparing their results by professional researchers’ results and due to the use of an additional questionnaire relate this to the background variables (i.e., age, gender, available support, attitudes and sensitivity to disgust).3: I found out that, in contrast to results from previous studies, age was not a significant variable, but rather available support and voluntary participation with rewards increased data quality. Additionally, higher liking of biology as a school subject was associated with the lower accuracy, whereas a higher interest in environment with higher accuracy.4: The young citizen scientists provided reliable data with the exception of overrepresented false positive observations. My results suggest that the quality and quantity of citizen-generated data are not straightforwardly dependent on the selected target groups. Citizen science activities should be planned by careful consideration of the context, for example the school strongly shapes the participatory activities.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Predation is a fundamental ecological process that shapes communities and drives long-term evolutionary dynamics. As the world rapidly urbanizes, it is critical to understand how the built environment and other human perturbations alter predation across taxa. We conducted a meta-analysis to quantify the effects of urban environments on three components of trophic ecology in predators: dietary species richness (DSR), dietary evenness (DEV), and stable isotopic ratios (δ13C and δ15N IR). We then evaluated whether intensity of anthropogenic pressure, using the human footprint index (HFI), explained variation in the effect sizes of dietary attributes using a meta-regression. We calculated Hedges’ g effect sizes from 44 studies including 11,986 samples across 40 predatory species in 39 cities globally. The direction and magnitude of effect sizes varied between predator taxonomic groups with reptile diets exhibiting the most sensitivity to urbanization. Effect sizes revealed that predators in cities had comparable DSR, DEV, and nitrogen ratios, though carbon consumption was significantly higher. We found that HFI did not explain variation in effect sizes, a result consistent between the 1993 and 2009 editions of this metric. Our study provides the first assessment of how urbanization has perturbed predator-prey interactions for multiple taxa at a global scale, revealing that the functional role of predators is conserved in cities and urbanization does not inherently relax predation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Even during ongoing global biodiversity losses and extinctions, numerous species have shown recoveries in terms of increased abundance and/or range extent. Understanding the mechanisms that contribute to, or limit, these recoveries is critical not just to ensure they continue, but to promote similar recoveries across broader ecosystems. Here, we explore the changes in abundance and range extent of selected 47 recovering species (24 mammals and 23 birds) in Europe using official data reported by EU Member States and supplemented using the Living Planet Index database. We investigate how the diversity of ongoing threats and conservation measures contribute to the likelihood and extent of recoveries. For birds, long-term recoveries were less likely among species impacted by a greater diversity of threats, although this may be mitigated by the diversity of conservation measures in place. Similarly, for mammals, populations with reported threats recovered less quickly while those with management actions in place recovered more quickly. To achieve the aims of the UN Decade on Restoration, we need to ensure, even for recovering species, that threats continue to be reduced and that conservation management actions are ongoing and effective.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Long distance migrations are well known to occur in many baleen whale species. Yet, a global synthesis of this information is lacking. Here, we study baleen whales as a group and at a global scale, first analyzing the grey and peer-reviewed literature for information on the location of baleen whale calving and feeding grounds around the world. This information was then combined with modeled-data produced from an Earth System Model to estimate the global distribution of baleen whale calving and feeding habitats. A simple network theoretic heuristic was then used to identify the shortest over-water path connecting habitats. These shortest paths map well to known major migration routes for a number of species, suggesting that migration has evolved primarily to minimize travel distances. Identifying distance minimizing routes globally, that have demonstrable consistency to known migration routes for certain baleen whale species, offers a useful baseline perspective on large-scale migration patterns, from which many perturbations can by judged. As an example, we used our modeled migration routes to identify regions of the ocean that are likely hotspots of whale ship-strikes. Such information is useful for developing global conservation and management priorities for baleen whales.

AB  - Tropical forest restoration stands to deliver important conservation gains, particularly in lowland Southeast Asia, which has suffered some of the world’s highest rates of forest loss and degradation. This promise, however, depends on the extent to which biodiversity at forest restoration sites continues to be exposed to threats. A key knowledge gap concerns the extent to which biodiversity recovery in naturally regenerating tropical forests is impacted by trapping for the multi-million-dollar wildlife trade. Here, we use a repeated survey dataset to quantify rates of avian community recovery under forest regeneration, at a flagship restoration site in the lowland rainforests of Sumatra, Indonesia. We show that over a decade, forest regeneration was associated with significant abundance increases for 43.8% of bird species.However, the apparent negative impacts of trade-driven trapping on avian populations also intensified: the proportion of species that show increased abundance only in very remote forests increased from 5.4% to 16.2%, while the overall accessibility of the forest increased. We found that 14% of species did not recover as fast as predicted based on the observed improvement in forest conditions over the study period. Our results highlight the potential for rapid avifaunal recovery in regenerating tropical forests, but also emphasize the urgency of tackling the serious threat of wildlife trade to Southeast Asia’s biodiversity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

TI  - Road to ruin? Urbanization increases herbivory in a tropical wildflower but does not lead to the evolution of chemical defence traits
AU  - Rivkin, L. Ruth
AU  - Moura, Antonio
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Urbanization is associated with numerous changes to the biotic and abiotic environment, many of which degrade the environment and lead to a loss of biodiversity. Cities often have elevated pollution levels that harm wildlife; however, the increased concentration of some pollutants can fertilize urban plants, leading to corresponding positive effects on herbivore populations. Increases in herbivory rates may lead to natural selection for greater defence phenotypes in plants. However, evidence supporting increased herbivory leading to the evolution of plant defence in urban environments is contradictory, and entirely absent from tropical regions of the world. To address these research gaps, we evaluated herbivory on Turnera subulata, a common urban wildflower, along an urbanization gradient in Joao Pessoa, Brazil. We predicted that higher rates of herbivory in urban areas would lead these populations to evolve cyanogenesis, a chemical defence found in a closely related Turnera species. We assessed herbivory and screened for cyanogenesis in 32 populations along the urbanization gradient, quantified by the Human Footprint Index. Our results show that urbanization is significantly associated with increased herbivory rates in T. subulata populations. Despite elevated herbivory, we found no evidence for the evolution of cyanongenesis in any of the populations, suggesting that the fitness effects of leaf herbivory are not extreme enough to select for the evolution of plant defence in these populations. Habitat loss, predator release, and nutrient enrichment likely act together to increase the abundance of herbivorous arthropods, influencing the herbivory patterns observed in our study.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica) is a polyphagous pest that spreads rapidly and is estimated to cost more than 460 M$/year in damage and control in the USA alone. This study provides risk maps to inform surveillance strategies in Continental Europe, following the beetle’s introduction and successive spread in the last decade. We developed a species distribution model using a machine-learning algorithm, considering factors relevant to the beetle’s biology, climate, land use and human-related variables. This analysis was performed using presence-only data from native and invaded ranges (Japan, North America, Azores archipelago - Portugal). We gathered more than 30 000 presence data from citizen science platforms and standardized surveys, and generated pseudo-absences using the target-group method. We used the environmental structure of data to randomly sample pseudo-absences, and evaluate model performance via a block cross-validation strategy. Our results show that climate, in particular seasonal trends, and human-related variables, are major drivers of the Japanese beetle distribution at the global scale. Risk maps show that Central Europe can be considered as suitable, whereas Southern and Northern European countries are at lower risk. The region currently occupied is among the most suitable according to our predictions, and represents less than 1% of the highest suitable area in Europe. A major cluster of high suitability areas is located near the currently infested zone, whereas others are scattered across the continent. This highlights the importance of designing surveillance strategies considering both active insect dispersal and the possibility of hitchhiking to reach distant areas.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

These bacteria ferment organic matter, producing the short-chain fatty acid butyrate. Despite their importance, their global biogeography is poorly studied. Here we developed new normalised butyrate production capacity (BPC) indices derived from global metagenomic (n=16,176) and Australia-wide soil 16S rRNA (n=1,331) data to geographically detail their environmental associations. We show that the highest BPC scores were in anoxic and fermentative environments. Among land types, higher BPC scores were in soils from seasonally productive sandy zones, temperate rural residential areas, and pastures and croplands. Geographical and climatic variables, and the presence of humans, were the primary drivers of BPC score variation. These new biogeographical insights could be integrated into microbially-focussed health and environmental policies to better harness the contributions of butyrate-producing bacteria to ecosystem functionality and human health.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are rich and productive ecosystems that historically have been used by small-scale fisheries due to their role as refuges, feeding, and nursery habitats for commercial target species. We used wetland resource users’ Local Ecological Knowledge to document historical patterns of commercial species abundance, areas of fishing importance, trophic level, and species richness and composition in coastal wetlands in the Northern Gulf of California, Mexico. We also reconstructed the environmental history of coastal wetlands in this region from bibliographic sources and photographic records, to document impacts that could have affected coastal fisheries. We found a consistent downward trend in target species abundance; the decrease was perceived as more pronounced by fishers that began fishing in or prior to the 1950’s, pointing to shifting baselines, the failure for resource users to recognize environmental change and accept degraded states as normal. Areas of fishing importance within coastal wetlands also decreased through time. Trophic level of catch showed no distinct pattern across wetland sites or time. Perceived species richness and composition increased with wetland size. Our analysis of the small-scale use of coastal wetlands in the Northern Gulf is relevant to food security and can provide insight into how local populations adapt to depleted coastal food webs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Aim Despite their widespread use and value to unveil the complex structure of the interactions within ecological communities and their value to assess the resilience of communities, network analyses have seldom been applied in plant communities. We aim to evaluate how plant-plant interaction networks vary in global drylands, and to assess whether network structure is related to plant diversity in these ecosystems.Location 185 dryland ecosystems from all continents except Antarctica.Methods We built networks using the local spatial association between all the perennial plant species present in the communities studied, and used structural equation models to evaluate the effect of abiotic factors (including geography, topography, climate and soil conditions) and network structure on plant diversity.Results The structure of plant networks found at most study sites (72%) was not random and presented properties representative of robust systems, such as high link density and structural balance. Moreover, network indices linked to system robustness had a positive and significant effect on plant diversity, sometimes higher that the effect of abiotic factors.Main conclusions Our results constitute the first empirical evidence showing the existence of a common network architecture structuring terrestrial plant communities at the global scale, and provide novel evidence of the importance of the network of interactions for the maintenance of biodiversity. Furthermore, they highlight the importance of system-level approaches to explain the diversity and structure of interactions in plant communities, two major drivers of terrestrial ecosystem functioning and resilience against the likely impacts derived from global change.

AB  - Invasive alien species are one of the major threats to global biodiversity, ecosystem integrity, nature’s contribution to people and human health. While scenarios about potential future developments have been available for other global change drivers for quite some time, we largely lack an understanding of how biological invasions might unfold in the future across spatial scales.Based on previous work on global invasion scenarios, we developed a workflow to downscale global scenarios to a regional and policy-relevant context. We applied this workflow at the European scale to create four European scenarios of biological invasions until 2050 that consider different environmental, socio-economic and socio-cultural trajectories, namely the European Alien Species Narratives (Eur-ASNs).We compared the Eur-ASNs with their previously published global counterparts (Global-ASNs), assessing changes in 26 scenario variables. This assessment showed a high consistency between global and European scenarios in the logic and assumptions of the scenario variables. However, several discrepancies in scenario variable trends were detected that could be attributed to scale differences. This suggests that the workflow is able to capture scale-dependent differences across scenarios.We also compared the Global- and Eur-ASNs with the widely used Global and European Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), a set of scenarios developed in the context of climate change to capture different future socio-economic trends. Our comparison showed considerable divergences in the scenario space occupied by the different scenarios, with overall larger differences between the ASNs and SSPs than across scales (global vs. European) within the scenario initiatives.Given the differences between the ASNs and SSPs, it seems that the SSPs do not adequately capture the scenario space relevant to understanding the complex future of biological invasions. This underlines the importance of developing independent, but complementary, scenarios focused on biological invasions. The downscaling workflow we presented and implemented here provides a tool to develop such scenarios across different regions and contexts. This is a major step towards an improved understanding of all major drivers of global change including biological invasions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

TI  - Critical transitions and evolutionary hysteresis in movement: Habitat fragmentation can cause abrupt shifts in dispersal that are difficult to revert
AU  - de Jager, Monique
AU  - Soons, Merel
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Under habitat fragmentation, plant species’ survival hinges on the ability of individuals to disperse from one habitat patch to another. While there is evidence that severe habitat fragmentation leads to evolution of reduced dispersal ability and that such decreased mobility is generally detrimental for species’ survival, it is unknown whether species adapt via a gradual loss in dispersal ability or via a sudden shift from frequent to infrequent dispersal between patches (i.e., a critical transition). Using a spatially explicit, individual-based modelling approach, we show that a small increase in inter-patch distance can generate an abrupt shift in plant seed dispersal strategy from long to short distances. Most importantly, we found that a substantial increase in connectivity between habitat fragments is required to reverse this loss of long-distance dispersal, due to an evolutionary hysteresis effect. Our theory prompts for re-consideration of the eco-evolutionary consequences of habitat fragmentation as restoring habitat connectivity may require restoration of much higher connectivity levels than currently assumed.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - To control mosquito populations for managing vector-borne diseases, a critical need is to identify and predict their response to causal environmental variables. However, most existing attempts rely on linear approaches based on correlation, which cannot apply in complex, nonlinear natural systems, because correlation is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for causation. Appling empirical dynamic modelling that acknowledges nonlinear dynamics on nine subpopulations of tiger mosquitos from three neighbouring reef islets of the Raiatea atoll, we identified temperature, precipitation, dew point, air pressure, and mean tide level as causal environmental variables. Interestingly, responses of subpopulations in close proximity (100-500 m) differed with respect to their causal environmental variables and the time delay of effect, highlighting complexity in mosquito-environment causality network. Moreover, we demonstrated how to explore the effects of changing environmental variables on number and strength of mosquito outbreaks, providing a new framework for pest control and disease vector ecology.

AB  - Sustainability is a key concept in economic and policy debates. Nevertheless, it is usually treated only in a qualitative way and has eluded quantitative analysis. Here, we propose a sustainability index based on the premise that sustainable systems do not lose or gain Fisher Information over time. We test this approach using time series data from the AmeriFlux network that measures ecosystem respiration, water and energy fluxes in order to elucidate two key sustainability features: ecosystem health and stability. A novel definition of ecosystem health is developed based on the concept of criticality, which implies that if a system’s fluctuations are scale invariant then the system is in a balance between robustness and adaptability. We define ecosystem stability by taking an information theory approach that measures its entropy and Fisher information. Analysis of the Ameriflux consortium big data set of ecosystem respiration time series is contrasted with land condition data. In general we find a good agreement between the sustainability index and land condition data. However, we acknowledge that the results are a preliminary test of the approach and further verification will require a multi-signal analysis. For example, high values of the sustainability index for some croplands are counter-intuitive and we interpret these results as ecosystems maintained in artificial health due to continuous human-induced inflows of matter and energy in the form of soil nutrients and control of competition, pests and disease.

AB  - Defining a safe and just biosphere space requires a synthetic scaleable measure of biosphere functional integrity to secure Nature’s Contributions to People (NCP). Using a systematic review of 153 peer-reviewed studies we estimated the minimum level of functional integrity needed to secure multiple critical NCP, including pollination, pest and disease control, water quality regulation, soil protection, recreation and natural hazards mitigation in human-modified landscapes. We characterise functional integrity by the quantity, quality and spatial configuration of (semi-)natural habitat within any landscape. We find that at least 20-25% of structurally complex and biologically diverse (semi-)natural habitat in each 1 km2 of land area is needed to maintain the supply of multiple NCP simultaneously. Exact quantity, quality and spatial configuration required is dependent on local context, and may differ for individual NCP. Today, about 50-60% of human-modified lands have less than 10% and 20% (semi-)natural habitat per 1 km2 respectively. These areas require immediate attention to regenerate functional integrity in order to secure ecological functioning in those landscapes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Urbanization involves numerous environmental changes that may affect the timing of plant reproduction and foliar damage by pathogens, herbivores, and human activities. Yet such relationships have not been examined simultaneously in plant populations across levels of urbanization.We conducted monthly surveys of 22 populations of Plantago lanceolata and P. rugelii in parks spanning an urbanization gradient. We quantified plant reproductive development and prevalence of powdery mildew infection, insect herbivory, and mowing damage. Additionally, we placed potted “sentinel” plants into field populations to directly measure infection and herbivory rates.Urbanization was associated with earlier flowering and more seed production for P. rugelii, but less seed maturation for P. lanceolata. Mildew epidemics on P. rugelii started earlier and achieved greater prevalence in more urban sites. Correspondingly, sentinels only became infected in suburban and urban sites. There was less infection on P. lanceolata, including sentinels, suggesting low availability of pathogen genotypes able to infect this species. Early-summer herbivory on both plant species was accelerated in urban sites.Urbanization has species-specific associations with reproductive phenology and is associated with increased early-summer herbivory, larger epidemics of a foliar pathogen, and more mowing damage on two weedy herbsCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Passive acoustic sensing has emerged as a powerful tool for quantifying anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity, especially for echolocating bat species. To better assess bat population trends there is a critical need for accurate, reliable, and open source tools that allow the detection and classification of bat calls in large collections of audio recordings. The majority of existing tools are commercial or have focused on the species classification task, neglecting the important problem of first localizing echolocation calls in audio which is particularly problematic in noisy recordings.We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) based open-source pipeline for detecting ultrasonic, full-spectrum, search-phase calls produced by echolocating bats (BatDetect). Our deep learning algorithms (CNN FULL and CNN FAST) were trained on full-spectrum ultrasonic audio collected along road-transects across Romania and Bulgaria by citizen scientists as part of the iBats programme and labelled by users of www.batdetective.org. We compared the performance of our system to other algorithms and commercial systems on expert verified test datasets recorded from different sensors and countries. As an example application, we ran our detection pipeline on iBats monitoring data collected over five years from Jersey (UK), and compared results to a widely-used commercial system.Here, we show that both CNNFULL and CNNFAST deep learning algorithms have a higher detection performance (average precision, and recall) of search-phase echolocation calls with our test sets, when compared to other existing algorithms and commercial systems tested. Precision scores for commercial systems were reasonably good across all test datasets (&gt;0.7), but this was at the expense of recall rates. In particular, our deep learning approaches were better at detecting calls in road-transect data, which contained more noisy recordings. Our comparison of CNNFULL and CNNFAST algorithms was favourable, although CNNFAST had a slightly poorer performance, displaying a trade-off between speed and accuracy. Our example monitoring application demonstrated that our open-source, fully automatic, BatDetect CNNFAST pipeline does as well or better compared to a commercial system with manual verification previously used to analyse monitoring data.We show that it is possible to both accurately and automatically detect bat search-phase echolocation calls, particularly from noisy audio recordings. Our detection pipeline enables the automatic detection and monitoring of bat populations, and further facilitates their use as indicator species on a large scale, particularly when combined with automatic species identification. We release our system and datasets to encourage future progress and transparency.

AB  - In animals, behavioural responses may play an important role in determining population persistence in the face of environmental changes. Body size is a key trait central to many life history traits and behaviours. While behaviours are typically assumed to be highly plastic, size correlations may impose constraints on their adaptive value when size itself is subject to environmental changes.Urbanization is an important human-induced rapid environmental change that imposes multiple selection pressures on both body size and (size-constrained) behaviour. How these combine to shape behavioural responses of urban-dwelling species is unclear.Using web-building, an easily quantifiable behaviour linked to body size, and the garden spider Araneus diadematus as a model, we disentangle direct behavioural responses to urbanization and body size constraints across a network of 63 selected populations differing in urbanization intensity at two spatial scales.Spiders were smaller in highly urbanized sites (local scale only), in line with expectations based on reduced prey biomass availability and the Urban Heat Island effect. The use of multivariate mixed modelling reveals that although web traits and body size are correlated within populations, behavioural responses to urbanization do not appear to be constrained by size: there is no evidence of size-web correlations among populations or among landscapes. Spiders thus altered different components of their web-building behaviours independently in response to urbanization: mesh width and web surface decreased independently with urbanization at the local scale, while web surface also increased with urbanization at the landscape scale. These responses are expected to compensate, at least in part, for reduced prey biomass availability.Our results demonstrate that responses in typically size-dependent behaviours may be decoupled from size changes, thereby allowing fitness maximisation in novel environments. The spatial scale of the behavioural responses to urbanization suggest contributions of both genetic adaptation and plasticity. Although fecundity decreased with local-scale urbanization, Araneus diadematus abundances were remarkably similar across urbanization gradients; behavioural responses thus appear overall successful at the population level.

AB  - Wildlife-vehicle collisions are an important cause of mortality for many species, and the number of collisions is expected to grow rapidly as the global road network quickly expands over the next few decades. Wildlife-vehicle collisions also have the potential to be extremely detrimental to small wildlife populations, such as the critically endangered Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus), with only 43 individuals remaining in the wild. We assessed the spatial distribution of road mortalities between 2004 and 2016 to identify roadkill hotspots involving Asiatic cheetahs in Iran using network kernel density estimation. A total of sixteen cheetah fatalities due to wildlife-vehicle collisions were recorded, and we identified six road fragments as roadkill hotspots. Efforts to reduce wildlife-cheetah collisions should be targeted in the densest hotspots. We review the options available to achieve this, and we recommend a strategic shift away from the ineffective warning signage currently used, and instead suggest adopting an evidence-based approach focusing on installing wildlife crossing structures in conjunction with fencing in roadkill hotspots. These measures will help to enhance the conservation status of the Asiatic cheetah, as the current high level of mortality of Asiatic cheetahs on Iran’s roads could have potentially dramatic impacts on this critically endangered subspecies.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Protected areas have been one of the most commonly applied conservation tools to prevent ecosystem degradation. International conservation targets have been created to incentivize widespread expansion of protected area networks, but this call might clash with expected future land use change. Here we investigated how future land use trajectories (2015-2090), representing a wide range of plausible future scenarios would impact the remaining areas of primary vegetation under different protection levels across the world’s biomes. We then highlight areas under greater risk of conflict between conservation (highly protected) and land use expansion (high projected change), and areas where these two can better co-exist (lower protection with high projected change and/or high protection with low projected change).While the most positive pathway of development led to the least loss of primary vegetation globally, this was not observed in all biomes. Further, we found no significant correlation between existing extent of protection and average proportion of vegetation loss. Mediterranean Forests, Woodlands &amp; Scrub had the largest projected loss occurring in the highest protected areas. Tropical Forests in Central Africa and the Boreal Forests of North Euro-Asia and Canada emerge as the areas where most projected change occurs, and existing protection is still low. Areas in India and Southeast Asia emerge as potential areas for intervention as they have significant projected loss of primary vegetation, and considerably low protection.Our results can help inform policy and decision-makers to prevent such conflicts and support the development of management actions. These policy and management actions should target conservation in areas under expected great pressure of change with high ecological value (e.g., composed mainly by primary vegetation), but still not protected. This study also opens the discussion to the future of current protected areas and to the potential to expand the existing network of protected areas.

AB  - The temperature-dependence of many important mosquito-borne diseases has never been quantified. These relationships are critical for understanding current distributions and predicting future shifts from climate change. We used trait-based models to characterize temperature-dependent transmission of 10 vector–pathogen pairs of mosquitoes (Culex pipiens, Cx. quinquefascsiatus, Cx. tarsalis, and others) and viruses (West Nile, Eastern and Western Equine Encephalitis, St. Louis Encephalitis, Sindbis, and Rift Valley Fever viruses), most with substantial transmission in temperate regions. Transmission is optimized at intermediate temperatures (23–26°C) and often has wider thermal breadths (due to cooler lower thermal limits) compared to pathogens with predominately tropical distributions (in previous studies). The incidence of human West Nile virus cases across US counties responded unimodally to average summer temperature and peaked at 24°C, matching model-predicted optima (24–25°C). Climate warming will likely shift transmission of these diseases, increasing it in cooler locations while decreasing it in warmer locations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Fission-fusion social dynamics are common among a number of vertebrate taxa, and yet the factors shaping these variable associations among subgroup members have not been widely addressed. Associations may occur simply because of shared habitat preferences; however, social ties may also be influenced by genetic relatedness (kinship) or social attraction. Here, we investigate the association patterns of wild black-and-white ruffed lemurs, Varecia variegata, in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar using behavioural, spatial (home range), and genetic data from twenty-four individually identified animals. We collected 40,840 records of group composition over a 17-month period and from this calculated pairwise association indices. We also used ranging coordinates and genetic samples to estimate patterns of spatial overlap and kinship, and then related these measures to patterns of affiliation. From these analyses, we found that dyadic ruffed lemur social associations were generally sparse and weak; that home range overlap was minimal; and that average relatedness within the community was low. We found no evidence that kinship was related to patterns of either spatial overlap or social association; instead, associations were primarily driven by space use. Moreover, social preferences were unrelated to kinship. While home range overlap explained most of the variation seen in social association, some variation remains unaccounted for, suggesting that other social, ecological, and biological factors such as shared resource defense or communal breeding might also play a role in social attraction. Our results further highlight the need to consider individual space use and nuances of species behavior when investigating social preference and social association more generally.

AB  - The spread of SARS-CoV-2 since December 2019 has become a pandemic and impacted many aspects of human society. Here, we analyzed genetic variation of SARS-CoV-2 and its related coronavirus and found the evidence of intergenomic recombination. After correction for mutational bias, analysis of 137 SARS-CoV-2 genomes as of 2/23/2020 revealed the excess of low frequency mutations on both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites which is consistent with recent origin of the virus. In contrast to adaptive evolution previously reported for SARS-CoV in its brief epidemic in 2003, our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes shows signs of relaxation of selection. The sequence similarity of the spike receptor binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and a sequence from pangolin is probably due to an ancient intergenomic introgression. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 might have cryptically circulated within humans for years before being recently noticed. Data from the early outbreak and hospital archives are needed to trace its evolutionary path and reveal critical steps required for effective spreading. Two mutations, 84S in orf8 protein and 251V in orf3 protein, occurred coincidentally with human intervention. The 84S first appeared on 1/5/2020 and reached a plateau around 1/23/2020, the lockdown of Wuhan. 251V emerged on 1/21/2020 and rapidly increased its frequency. Thus, the roles of these mutations on infectivity need to be elucidated. Genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 collected from China was two time higher than those derived from the rest of the world. In addition, in network analysis, haplotypes collected from Wuhan city were at interior and have more mutational connections, both of which are consistent with the observation that the outbreak of cov-19 was originated from China.SUMMARY In contrast to adaptive evolution previously reported for SARS-CoV in its brief epidemic, our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes shows signs of relaxation of selection.

AB  - Recent advances in animal tracking technology have ushered in a new era in biologging. However, the considerable size of many sophisticated biologging devices restricts their application to larger animals, while old-fashioned techniques often still represent the state-of-the-art for studying small vertebrates. In industrial applications, low-power wireless sensor networks fulfill requirements similar to those needed to monitor animal behavior at high resolution and at low tag weight. We developed a wireless biologging network (WBN), which enables simultaneous direct proximity sensing, high-resolution tracking, and long-range remote data download at tag weights of one to two grams. Deployments to study wild bats created social networks and flight trajectories of unprecedented quality. Our developments highlight the vast capabilities of WBNs and their potential to close an important gap in biologging: fully automated tracking and proximity sensing of small animals, even in closed habitats, at high spatial and temporal resolution.

AB  - Determining critical ecological protected areas at the city (county) spatial scale is crucial for coordinating regional ecological environment management, control, and governance. It is a recognized consensus in academia that human activities significantly impact natural ecosystems. Many scholars ignore this point in the research process and only use several factors to characterize human influence. Therefore, this study takes Aksu City and Wensu County, important cities and towns in southern Xinjiang, as examples, focusing on the impact of human activities on the distribution of critical ecological protection areas. First, we simulated the range, intensity, and local natural conditions of human activities in the study area using geospatial data. We created corresponding resistance surfaces (human activity resistance surface and natural landscape resistance surface). We then assign different weights to the two resistance surfaces based on several possible scenarios, resulting in different synthetic resistance surfaces. Finally, we used the Linkage Mapper plugin to identify critical ecological reserves and compared several results. The results show that: Human activities have greatly interfered with the migration and dispersal of species, affecting the distribution of critical ecological reserves. The specific performance is that in the urban center area with high intensity of human activities, the number and location of the surrounding ecological corridors change significantly with the increase in the proportion of human activity resistance and the total area remains unchanged; As part of the ecological corridors, the ecological pinch points changes with the location of the corridor, and the whole area remains unchanged; The threshold range of the restoration value of ecological barrier points is reduced. The maximum value generated by the restoration of ecological barrier points is reduced, which shows that the restoration value of ecological barrier points decreases with increased human activities.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - We developed a discrete and qualitative model of integrated socio-ecosystems, with the help of formal Petri nets. We illustrated such Petri nets in the case study of temporary marshes in the Mediterranean part of France, the Camargue delta, by integrating biotic, abiotic and human-related components along with their processes into the same interaction network. The model demonstrated that when marshes are exposed to extensive grazing the presence of marsh heritage species is facilitated by opening up the vegetation through various trajectories. This supports the commonly used management practice of extensive grazing to conserve certain protected habitats. With this Possibilistic approach, we identified all potential ecosystem trajectories and provided their differential (non-systematic) impacts on heritage species richness (number). Hence, we rigorously demonstrate with this new type of model that grazing benefits marsh species which are faced with competition from common grassland species. The detailed analysis of the explicit state space and trajectories allows exploring simultaneously the identification of a range of recommendations for management strategies.

TI  - Nature protection across countries: Do size and power matter?
AU  - Baldi, Germán
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Protected areas are one of the most effective tools for nature conservation. Consequently, almost all countries have agreed to set increasingly demanding goals for the expansion of their protected area systems. However, there is a large disparity among countries, and research on the cultural drivers of differences remains quite unexplored. Here, we explore the relationship between protected extent and a limited spectrum of socio-economic characteristics, making focus on size and power features. Protected areas under strict conservation categories (I to IV, IUCN) were considered for 195 countries, and relationships were modeled by means of LOESS regressions, violin plots, and a random forest ensemble learning method. Larger and more powerful countries (in terms of land area, gross domestic product, or military expenditure) protect less and in relatively smaller units than smaller and less powerful countries. Out of the twenty most extensive countries of the world, only two exceed 10% of protection. This situation is problematic since an effective growth of the global protected area network depends on the willingness of larger and more powerful countries. We propose different hypotheses a posteriori that explain the role of size and power driving protection. These hypotheses involve direct mechanisms (e.g., the persuasive capacity of large countries) or mechanisms that mediate the interactions of some others (e.g., tourism contribution to GDP and insularity). Independently of mechanisms, our results emphasize the conservation responsibilities of large and powerful countries and contribute to envision conservation scenarios in the face of changes in the number and size of countries.

AB  - Infectious diseases are one of the most important constraints to livestock agriculture, and hence food, nutritional and economic security in developing countries. In any livestock system, the movement of animals is key to production and sustainability. This is especially true in pastoralist systems where animal movement occurs for a myriad of social, ecological, economic and management reasons. Understanding the dynamics of livestock movement within an ecosystem is important for disease surveillance and control, yet there is limited data available on the dynamics of animal movement in such populations. The aim of this study was to investigate animal transfer networks in a pastoralist community in Kenya, and assess network-based strategies for disease control. We used network analysis to characterize five types of animal transfer networks and evaluated implications of these networks for disease control through quantifying topological changes in the network because of targeted or random removal of nodes. To construct these networks, data were collected using a standardized questionnaire (N=164 households) from communities living within the Maasai Mara Ecosystem in southwestern Kenya. The median livestock movement distance for agistment (dry season grazing) was 39.49 kilometers (22.03-63.49 km), while that for gift, bride price, buying and selling were 13.97 km (0-40.30 km), 30.75 km (10.02-66.03 km), 31.14 km (17.56-59.08 km), and 33.21 km (17.78-58.49 km), respectively. Our analyses show that the Maasai Mara National Reserve, a protected area, was critical for maintaining connectivity in the agistment network. In addition, villages closer to the Maasai Mara National Reserve were regularly used for dry season grazing. In terms of disease control, targeted removal of highly connected village nodes was more effective at fragmenting each network than random removal of nodes, indicating that network-based targeting of interventions such as vaccination could potentially disrupt transmission pathways and reduce pathogen circulation in the ecosystem. In conclusion, this work shows that animal movements have the potential to shape patterns of disease transmission and control in this ecosystem. Further, we show that targeted control is a more practical and efficient measure for disease control.

TI  - Deforestation in Belize-What, Where and Why
AU  - Folkard-Tapp, Hollie
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - The tropical forests of Belize are a dynamic environment influenced by much disturbance throughout their natural history. In recent times, logging and agriculture have once more become the dominant drivers of land use change, yet the Belizean forests remain some of the most complete swathes of forest in the region. However, it is largely unknown how the abundance of specific forest types has changed. This study aims to critically assess whether valuable habitat types have been disproportionately affected by deforestation between 1986 and 2018. ENVI Classic 5.5 was used to calculate the NDVI values of Landsat imagery, with values over 0.6 deemed to indicate primary forest. ArcMap 10.6 was used for detecting change in forest cover between 1986 and 2018, in addition to digitising colonial maps. Results show variation in the percentage of forest lost between habitat types, with a bias towards forests fragmented by or replaced by agriculture, particularly in the north and along the Guatemalan border. The protected area network was found overall to have little influence on deforestation, though this varies between reserves. Of the three forest types experiencing the highest percentage of forest loss, only Ensino-Pixoy occurs exclusively outside protected areas. Cohune Santa-Maria and Sapote-Mahogany are found at least partially within protected areas and experience loss within them. Analysis of IUCN ratings of forest species revealed data deficiency, particularly concerning taxa indigenous to Mesoamerica, against which this study recommends further vegetation studies. to allow recommendations for protection of particularly threatened forest types. A review of management strategies in protected areas, especially the Caracol Archaeological Reserve, is necessary to avert the worrying deforestation trends this study has identified. The country-wide deforestation data can be used to advise future forest policy as well as calculation of national carbon stocks or determining integrity of ecosystem services.

AB  - Natural Protected Areas (NPAs) are the main biodiversity conservation strategy in Mexico. Generally, NPAs are established on the territories of indigenous and rural groups driving important changes in their local resource management practices. In this paper we study the case of Otoch Ma’ax Yetel Kooh, an NPA in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, that has been studied in a multidisciplinary way for more than twenty years. This reserve and its buffer zone is homeland to Yucatec Mayan communities that until recently used to manage their resources following a multiple use strategy (MUS), which involves local agricultural practices and has been proposed as resilience-enhancing mechanism. However, due to the restrictions imposed by the decree of the reserve and the growth of tourism in the region, some of these communities have started to abandon the MUS and specialize on tourism-related activities. We build a dynamical computational model to explore the effects of some of these changes on the capacity of this NPA to conserve the biodiversity and on the resilience of households to some frequent disturbances in the region. The model, through the incorporation of agent-based and boolean network modelling, explores the interaction between the forest, the monkey population and some productive activities done by the households (milpa agriculture, ecotourism, agriculture, charcoal production). We calibrated the model, explored its sensibility, compared it with empirical data and simulated different management scenarios. Our results suggest that those management strategies that do not exclude traditional activities may be compatible with conservation objectives, supporting previous studies. Also, our results support the hypothesis that the MUS, throughout a balanced integration of traditional and alternative activities, is a mechanism to enhance household resilience in terms of income and food availability, as it reduces variability and increases the resistance to some disturbances. Our study, in addition to highlighting the importance of local management practices for resilience, also illustrates how computational modeling and systems perspective are effective means of integrating and synthesizing information from different sources.

AB  - Image-based cell classification has become a common tool to identify phenotypic changes in cell populations. However, this methodology is limited to organisms possessing well characterized species-specific reagents (e.g., antibodies) that allow cell identification, clustering and convolutional neural network (CNN) training. In the absence of such reagents, the power of image-based classification has remained mostly off-limits to many research organisms. We have developed an image-based classification methodology we named Image3C (Image-Cytometry Cell Classification) that does not require species-specific reagents nor pre-existing knowledge about the sample. Image3C combines image-based flow cytometry with an unbiased, high-throughput cell cluster pipeline and CNN integration. Image3C exploits intrinsic cellular features and non-species-specific dyes to perform de novo cell composition analysis and to detect changes in cellular composition between different conditions. Therefore, Image3C expands the use of imaged-based analyses of cell population composition to research organisms in which detailed cellular phenotypes are unknown or for which species-specific reagents are not available.Impact statement Image3C analyzes cell populations through image-based clustering and neural network training, which allows single-cell analysis in research organisms devoid of species-specific reagents or pre-existing knowledge on cell phenotypes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The biogeography of soil fungi has attracted much attention in recent years; however, studies on this topic have mainly focused on mid- and low-altitude regions. The seasonal patterns of soil fungal community structure and diversity along altitudinal gradients under the unique climatic conditions at high latitudes remain unclear, which limits our insight into soil microbial interactions and the mechanisms of community assembly. In this study, Illumina MiSeq sequencing was used to investigate the spatiotemporal changes in soil fungal communities along an altitudinal gradient (from 750 m to 1420 m) on Oakley Mountain in the northern Greater Khingan Mountains. Altitude had significant impacts on the relative abundances of the dominant phyla and classes of soil fungi, and the interaction of altitude and season significantly affected the relative abundances of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. The number of soil fungal taxa and Faith’s phylogenetic diversity (PD) index tended to monotonically decline with increasing elevation. Soil moisture (SM), soil temperature (ST) and pH were the main factors affecting fungal community structure in May, July and September, respectively. The soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content significantly shaped the soil fungal community composition along the altitudinal gradient throughout the growing season. Compared to that in May and July, the soil fungal network in September had more nodes and links, a higher average degree and a higher average clustering coefficient. The nine module nodes in the co-occurrence network were all Ascomycota taxa, and the identities of the keystone taxa of soil fungi in the network showed obvious seasonality. Our results demonstrated that altitude has stronger effects than season on soil fungal community structure and diversity at high latitudes. In addition, the co-occurrence network of soil fungi exhibited obvious seasonal succession, which indicated that the keystone taxa of soil fungi exhibit niche differentiation among seasons.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Urbanization exerts many pressures on species, yet little is known about how these pressures impact species interactions. Studies of urban plant-pollinator systems provide mounting evidence that urbanization impairs pollinator movement in fragmented urban landscapes, yet the consequences for pollinator-mediated plant reproduction remains unclear. In non-urban areas, habitat corridors can facilitate the movement of organisms including pollinators, but whether these corridors facilitate plant-pollinator interactions in urban areas remains understudied. To examine how urban environments and green corridors influence plant-pollinator interactions, we measured reproductive success in the native plant common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), and the community structure of its pollinators, for two years along two urban-rural transects in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada, one of which followed a green corridor. We found that urbanization decreased male fitness (i.e., pollen removal), increased fruit set (i.e., mean no. of follicles per inflorescence), and inconsistently affected female fitness (i.e., no. of follicles) in A. syriaca. Urbanization simultaneously decreased pollinator abundance but increased pollinator richness. Proximity to a green corridor inconsistently affected male fitness but increased reproductive effort (i.e., no. of inflorescences) in A. syriaca, while pollinator diversity and richness was lower in corridors. Notably, there were no consistent relationships between pollinator community structure and reproductive success in A. syriaca in both the presence, and absence, of a green corridor. These results demonstrate the complexity with which urbanization, green corridors, and pollinator communities can shape the reproductive investment and fitness of native plant populations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Representing data as networks cuts across all sub-disciplines in ecology and evolutionary biology. Besides providing a compact representation of the interconnections between agents, network analysis allows the identification of especially important nodes, according to various metrics that often rely on the calculation of the shortest paths connecting any two nodes. While the interpretation of a shortest paths is straightforward in binary, unweighted networks, whenever weights are reported, the calculation could yield unexpected results. We analyzed 129 studies of ecological networks published in the last decade and making use of shortest paths, and discovered a methodological inaccuracy related to the edge weights used to calculate shortest paths (and related centrality measures), particularly in interaction networks. Specifically, 49% of the studies do not report sufficient information on the calculation to allow their replication, and 61% of the studies on weighted networks may contain errors in how shortest paths are calculated. Using toy models and empirical ecological data, we show how to transform the data prior to calculation and illustrate the pitfalls that need to be avoided. We conclude by proposing a five-point check-list to foster best-practices in the calculation and reporting of centrality measures in ecology and evolution studies.

Here, we provide the latest temporally inter-comparable maps of the terrestrial Human Footprint, and assessment of change in human pressure at global, biome, and ecoregional scales. In 2013, 42% of terrestrial Earth could be considered relatively free of anthropogenic disturbance, and 25% could be classed as ‘wilderness’ (the least degraded end of the human footprint spectrum). Between 2000 and 2013, 1.9 million km2 - an area the size of Mexico - of land relatively free of human disturbance became highly modified. The majority of this occurred within tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannah, and shrubland ecosystems, but the rainforests of Southeast Asia also underwent rapid modification. Our results show that humanity’s footprint is eroding Earth’s last intact ecosystems, and greater efforts are urgently needed to retain them.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Citizen science aims to engage the wider population beyond scientists and statutory agencies, providing a catalyst for positive change and influencing policymakers and institutions. The Riverfly Partnership has been supporting a growing network of citizen science volunteers monitoring aquatic macroinvertebrates in rivers and streams across the United Kingdom since 2004. In Manchester, Salford and surrounding areas, Riverfly Partnership monitoring began in 2011 with volunteers from a catchment-wide fishing club. This provided a catalyst for broader public engagement, wider environmental projects, and the establishment of a new grassroots environmental charity. The vigilance of the network demonstrated its value by flagging a major pollution event wiping out all macroinvertebrates along 19 km of the River Irwell in April 2017. By evaluating monitoring data and the citizen science program’s impacts, we identify key lessons for taking forward public engagement in river catchment management both in Greater Manchester and elsewhere.

AB  - The emergence of citizen science, passive sensors (e.g., trail cameras and acoustic monitoring), and satellite remote sensing have enabled biological data to be collected at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales. There is growing interest in networking these datastreams to expedite the collection and synthesis of environmental and biological data to improve broad-scale ecological monitoring, but there are no examples of such networks being developed to directly inform decision-making by managing agencies. Here, we present the implementation of one such jurisdictional observation network (JON), Snapshot Wisconsin (SW), that links satellite remote sensing (RS) with a volunteer-based trail camera network to generate new insights into wildlife distributions and improve their management by the state agency. SW relies on citizen scientists to deploy trail cameras across the state and classify images of wildlife. As of early 2020 SW comprises nearly 1800 volunteers hosting &gt;2100 active cameras recording &gt;37 million images across a sampling effort of &gt;2000 combined trap-years at &gt;3300 distinct camera locations. We use a set of case studies to demonstrate the potential power of a JON to monitor wildlife with unprecedented combinations of spatial, temporal, and biological resolution and extent. Specifically, we demonstrate that SW markedly improves the spatial and temporal resolution with which black bear distributions can be monitored or forecast, in turn improving the resolution of decision-making. Enhancing the biological resolution of monitoring (e.g., monitoring the distribution of species traits or behaviors) may provide new insights into population drivers, such as the connection between vegetation productivity and white-tailed deer foraging behaviors. Enhanced taxonomic extent provided by trail cameras and other passive sensor networks provide managers new information for a wide range of species and communities that are not otherwise monitored. Our cases further show that JONs synergize existing monitoring practices by serving as a complementary and independent line of evidence or as a tool to enhance the extent and precision of existing models through integrated modeling approaches. SW and other JONS are a powerful new tool for agencies to better achieve their missions and reshape the nature of environmental decision-making.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Extracting species calls from passive acoustic recordings is a common preliminary step to ecological analysis. For many species, particularly those occupying noisy, acoustically variable habitats, the call extraction process continues to be largely manual, a time-consuming and increasingly unsustainable process. Deep neural networks have been shown to offer excellent performance across a range of acoustic classification applications, but are relatively underused in ecology.We describe the steps involved in developing an automated classifier for a passive acoustic monitoring project, using the identification of calls of the Hainan gibbon (Nomascus hainanus), one of the world’s rarest mammal species, as a case study. This includes preprocessing - selecting a temporal resolution, windowing and annotation; data augmentation; processing - choosing and fitting appropriate neural network models; and postprocessing - linking model predictions to replace, or more likely facilitate, manual labelling.Our best model converted acoustic recordings into spectrogram images on the mel frequency scale, using these to train a convolutional neural network. Model predictions were highly accurate, with per-second false positive and false negative rates of 1.5% and 22.3%. Nearly all false negatives were at the fringes of calls, adjacent to segments where the call was correctly identified, so that very few calls were missed altogether. A postprocessing step identifying intervals of repeated calling reduced an eight-hour recording to, on average, 22 minutes for manual processing, and did not miss any calling bouts over 72 hours of test recordings. Gibbon calling bouts were detected regularly in multi-month recordings from all selected survey points within Bawangling National Nature Reserve, Hainan.We demonstrate that passive acoustic monitoring incorporating an automated classifier represents an effective tool for remote detection of one of the world’s rarest and most threatened species. Our study highlights the viability of using neural networks to automate or greatly assist the manual labelling of data collected by passive acoustic monitoring projects. We emphasise that model development and implementation be informed and guided by ecological objectives, and increase accessibility of these tools with a series of notebooks that allow users to build and deploy their own acoustic classifiers.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Social interactions between animals can provide many benefits, including the ability to gain useful environmental information through social learning. However, these social contacts can also facilitate the transmission of infectious diseases through a population. Animals engaging in social interactions must therefore face a trade-off between the potential informational benefits and the risk of acquiring disease. In order to understand how this trade-off can influence animal sociality, it is necessary to quantify the effects of different social structures on individuals’ likelihood of acquiring information versus infection Theoretical models have suggested that modular social networks, associated with the formation of groups or sub-groups, can slow spread of infection by trapping it within particular groups. However these social structures will not necessarily impact the spread of information in the same way if its transmission is considered as a “complex contagion”, e.g. through individuals copying the majority (conformist learning). Here we use simulation models to demonstrate that modular networks can promote the spread of information relative to the spread of infection, but only when the network is fragmented and group sizes are small. We show that the difference in transmission between information and disease is maximised for more well-connected social networks when the likelihood of transmission is intermediate. Our results have important implications for understanding the selective pressures operating on the social structure of animal societies, revealing that highly fragmented networks such as those formed in fission-fusion social groups and multilevel societies can be effective in modulating the infection-information trade-off for individuals within them.Significance statement Risk of infection is commonly regarded as one of the costs of animal social behaviours, while the potential for acquiring useful information is seen as a benefit. Balancing this risk of infection with the potential to gain useful information is one of the key trade-offs facing animals that engage in social interactions. In order to better understand this trade-off, it is necessary to quantify how different social structures can promote access to useful information while minimising risk of infection. We used simulations of disease and information spread to examine how group sizes and social network fragmentation influences both these transmission processes. Our models find that more subdivided networks slow the spread of disease far more than infection, but only group sizes are small. Our results demonstrate that showing that fragmented social structures can be more effective in balancing the infection-information trade-off for individuals within them.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Animal culture and social bonds are relevant to wildlife conservation because they influence patterns of geography, behavior, and strategies of survival. Numerous examples of socially-driven habitat partitioning and ecological-niche specialization can be found among vertebrates, including toothed whales. But such social-ecological dynamics, described here as ‘social niche partitioning’, are not known among baleen whales, whose societies -- particularly on foraging grounds -- are largely perceived as unstructured and incidental to matters of habitat use and conservation. However, through 16 years of behavioral and photo-identification observations of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) feeding within a fjord system in British Columbia, Canada, we have documented long-term pair bonds (lasting up to 12 years) as well as a complex societal structure, which corresponds closely to persistent patterns in feeding strategy, long-term site fidelity (extended seasonal occupancy and annual rate of return up to 75%), specific geographic preferences within the fjord system, and other forms of habitat use. Randomization tests of network congruency and clustering algorithms were used to test for overlap in patterns of social structure and habitat use, which confirmed the occurrence of social niche partitioning on the feeding grounds of this baleen whale. In addition, we document the extensive practice of group bubble net feeding in Pacific Canada. This coordinated feeding behavior was found to strongly mediate the social structure and habitat use within this humpback whale society. Additionally, during our 2004 – 2019 study, we observed a shift in social network structure in 2010 – 2012, which corresponded with environmental and demographic shifts including a sudden decline in the population’s calving rate. Our findings indicate that the social lives of humpback whales, and perhaps baleen whales generally, are more complex than previously supposed and should be a primary consideration in the assessment of potential impacts to important habitat.

AB  - Exposure to biodiverse aerobiomes may support human health, but it is unclear which ecological factors influence exposure. Few studies have investigated near-surface green space aerobiome dynamics, and no studies have investigated aerobiome vertical stratification in different green spaces. We used columnar sampling and next generation sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, combined with geospatial and network analyses to investigate aerobiome spatio-compositional dynamics. We show a strong effect of habitat on bacterial diversity and network complexity. We observed aerobiome vertical stratification and network complexity that was contingent on habitat type. Tree density, closer proximity, and canopy coverage associated with greater aerobiome alpha diversity. Grassland aerobiomes exhibited greater proportions of putative pathogens compared to scrub, and also stratified vertically. We provide new insights into the urban ecosystem with potential importance for public health, whereby the possibility of differential aerobiome exposures appears to depend on habitat type and height in the airspace.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Community structure contributes to ecosystem persistence and stability. To understand the mechanisms underlying pollination and community stability of natural areas in a human influenced landscape, a better understanding of the interaction patterns between plants and pollinators in disturbed landscapes is needed. The Northern Great Plains still retain extensive tracts of remnant temperate grassland habitat within a matrix of varying land-uses. We used a network-based approach to quantify how temperate grassland attributes and landscape heterogeneity influence plant-pollinator community structure in natural habitats. We also quantified pollinator diversity and floral diversity to assess the functional role of temperate grassland attributes and the surrounding landscape on the composition of the plant-pollinator communities in natural habitats. We found that the amount of local nectar sugar and increased proportions of certain land-uses contribute to pollinator diversity that in turn influences the structure of interactions between plants and pollinators. Understanding the factors contributing to plant-pollinator network structure can guide management decisions to support resilient plant-pollinator communities and conserve the stability of pollination services.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Interspecific competition can strongly influence community structure and shape niche breadth and overlap. One of the main factors that determine the hummingbird community structure is competition for food. Hummingbirds functional attributes, such as beak length and body mass, influence nectar acquisition in the flowers, shaping foraging niches according to hummingbird dominance and foraging strategy. This study evaluates how the hummingbirds’ functional and behavioral attributes are related to plants assemblage in rocky outcrops’ habitats. We tested the following hypothesis: H1) Functional traits (beak length and body mass) are related to the richness and frequency of pollen grain morphotypes carried by hummingbirds; H2) Dominant and territorial hummingbirds carry a lower richness and frequency of pollen types when compared to subordinate hummingbirds, and H3) Hummingbird species carry different types of pollen grains. We conducted the study between September 2018 and March 2019 in a Campo Rupestre (rocky outcrops) in Southeastern Brazil. Hummingbirds were captured with a trap built based on trapdoors. We recorded their beak size and body masses, marked with commercial bird rings and ink on parts of the body, and then released. Behavioral responses to artificial feeders were collected regarding each visit’s time and duration and the outcome of aggressive interactions. The pollen adhered to the body parts was collected and identified in the laboratory. Our results showed that neither body size nor aggressive behaviors influenced pollen richness and frequency in rocky outcrops. Beak length was the most important hummingbirds’ attribute that influenced pollen richness, but not pollen frequency. Short-billed hummingbirds carried the greatest richness of pollen grains. Pollen grain richness and frequency were not related to hummingbird body mass or aggressive behavior. The hummingbird-pollen grain interaction network has shown to be generalized in the pollen grain transport. We conclude that hummingbirds’ beak length is the central morphological variable to measure pollen grain transport. It has direct implications for the pollination of different plant species.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - In urban landscapes, granivores play a key ecosystem service: they contribute to the establishment of plants and thereby increase the probability of vegetal community recovery. It is therefore a priority to determine how and by whom seeds are removed, which seeds are removed and where they are removed. Our objective here was to determine the removal patterns in three core zones of an urban reserve, three urban parks, and three peri-urban parks, all in and around Mexico City. We performed a selective exclusion experiment with treatments for each type of seed consumer (ants, birds, and rodents) and seeds of nine plant species. Ants were the most important granivores in terms of seed removal (especially small seeds), followed by rodents and birds. Seeds of the native plants Passiflora subpeltata, Pittocaulon praecox and Opuntia joconostle had higher removal rates than other exotic and cosmopolitan species. The urban reserve had higher rates of seed predation compared to the urban and peri-urban parks. Thus, ants are pivotal in keeping seed removal and vegetation communities. We propose a series of measures to promote the ecosystem function of seed removal and increase plant diversity in these different urban patches.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Freshwater systems are experiencing rapid biodiversity losses resulting from high rates of habitat degradation. Ecological condition is typically determined through identifying either macroinvertebrate or diatom bioindicator assemblages and comparing them to their known tolerance to stressors. These comparisons are typically conducted at family or genus levels depending on the availability of taxonomic keys and expertise for focal groups. The objective of this study was to test whether a more taxonomically comprehensive assessment of communities in benthic samples can provide a different perspective of ecological conditions. DNA metabarcoding was used to identify macroinvertebrates and diatoms from kick-net samples collected from sites with different habitat status. Sites with ‘good’ condition were associated with higher beta diversity as well as slightly higher directed connectance and modularity indicating higher resilience compared with ‘fair’ condition sites. Indicator value and correlation analyses used DNA metabarcoding data to detect 29 site condition indicator species consistent with known bioindicators and expected relative tolerances. DNA metabarcoding and trophic network analysis also recovered 11 keystone taxa. This study demonstrates the importance of taxonomic breadth across trophic levels for generating biotic data to study ecosystem status, with the potential to scale-up ecological assessments of freshwater condition, trophic stability, and resilience.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Because it is impossible to comprehensively characterize biodiversity at all levels of organization, conservation prioritization efforts need to rely on surrogates. As species distribution maps of relished groups as well as high-resolution remotely sensed data increasingly become available, both types of surrogates are commonly used. A good surrogate should represent as much of biodiversity as possible, but it often remains unclear to what extent this is the case. Here, we aimed to address this question by assessing how well bird species and habitat diversity represent one another. We conducted our study in Romania, a species-rich country with high landscape heterogeneity where bird species distribution data have only recently started to become available. First, we prioritized areas for conservation based on either 137 breeding bird species or 36 habitat classes, and then evaluated their reciprocal surrogacy performance. Second, we examined how well these features are represented in already existing protected areas. Finally, we identified target regions of high conservation value for the potential expansion of the current network of reserves (as planned under the new EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030). We found that bird species were a better surrogate for habitat diversity than vice versa. Highly ranked areas based on habitat diversity were represented better than areas based on bird species, which varied considerably between species. Our results highlight that taxonomic and environmental (i.e., habitat types) data may perform rather poorly as reciprocal surrogates, and multiple sources of data are required for a full evaluation of protected areas expansion.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Pandemics caused by wildlife-origin pathogens, like COVID-19, highlight the importance of understanding the ecology of zoonotic transmission and outbreaks among wildlife populations at human-wildlife interfaces. To-date, the relative effects of human-wildlife and wildlife-wildlife interactions on the likelihood of such outbreaks remain unclear.In this study, we used social network analysis and epidemiological Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) models, to track zoonotic outbreaks through wild animals’ joint propensities to engage in social-ecological co-interactions with humans, and their social grooming interactions with conspecifics.We collected behavioral and demographic data on 10 groups of macaques (Macaca spp.) living in (peri)urban environments across Asia. Outbreak sizes predicted by the SIR models were related to structural features of the social networks, and particular properties of individual animals’ connectivity within those networks.Outbreak sizes were larger when the first-infected animal was highly central, in both types of networks. Across host-species, particularly for rhesus and bonnet macaques, the effects of network centrality on outbreak sizes were stronger through macaques’ human co-interaction networks compared to grooming networks.Our findings, independent of pathogen-transmissibility, suggest that wildlife populations in the Anthropocene are vulnerable to zoonosis more so due to their propensities to aggregate around anthropogenic factors than their gregariousness with conspecifics. Thus, the costs of zoonotic outbreaks may outweigh the potential/perceived benefits of jointly interacting with humans to procure anthropogenic food. From One Health perspectives, animals that consistently interact with both humans and conspecifics across time and space are useful targets for disease spillover assessments and control.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Climate-smart conservation addresses the vulnerability of biodiversity to climate change impacts but may require transboundary considerations. Here, we adapt and refine 16 biophysical guidelines for climate-smart marine reserves for the transboundary California Bight ecoregion. We link several climate-adaptation strategies (e.g., maintaining connectivity, representing climate refugia, and forecasting effectiveness of protection) by focusing on kelp forests and associated species. We quantify transboundary larval connectivity along ∼800 km of coast and find that the number of connections and the average density of larvae dispersing through the network under future climate scenarios could decrease by ∼50%, highlighting the need to protect critical steppingstone nodes. We also find that although focal species will generally recover with 30% protection, marine heatwaves could hinder subsequent recovery in the following 50 years, suggesting that protecting climate refugia and expanding the coverage of marine reserves is a priority. Together, these findings provide a first comprehensive framework for integrating climate resilience for networks of marine reserves and highlight the need for a coordinated approach in the California Bight ecoregion.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Botanical gardens have contributed to plant conservation through the maintenance of both living and preserved plant specimens for decades. However, there is still a large gap in the literature with regards to understanding the potential conservation value botanical gardens could provide for local pollinators. We investigated how plant-pollinator community structure and diversity may differ between botanical gardens and native habitats by sampling and comparing between two environments: a restored native grassland patch within a local botanical garden and fifteen native, remnant temperate grassland sites in the Northern Great Plains. We found pollinator diversity within the restored native grassland patch was greater than 55% of total remnant temperate grassland transects throughout the entire flowering season, while plant diversity and network community metrics between the two environments remained similar throughout, except that remnant prairies have more links (higher connectance) with pollinators than the garden patch. Overall, our findings demonstrate the promising role restored native grassland patches in botanical gardens could play as reservoirs for local pollinator communities by supporting plant-pollinator interactions comparable to those found in native habitat remnants in the same region.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

This is commonly done by overlapping range maps of individual species, which requires dense availability of occurrence data or relies on assumptions about the presence of species in unsampled areas deemed suitable by environmental niche models. Here we present a deep learning approach that directly estimates species richness, skipping the step of estimating individual species ranges. We train a neural network model based on species lists from inventory plots, which provide ground truthing for supervised machine learning. The model learns to predict species richness based on spatially associated variables, including climatic and geographic predictors, as well as counts of available species records from online databases. We assess the empirical utility of our approach by producing independently verifiable maps of alpha, beta and gamma plant diversity at high spatial resolutions for Australia, a continent with highly contrasting diversity patterns. Our deep learning framework provides a powerful and flexible new approach for estimating biodiversity patterns.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Invertebrate biodiversity remains poorly explored although it comprises much of the terrestrial animal biomass, more than 90% of the species-level diversity and supplies many ecosystem services. The main obstacle is specimen- and species-rich samples. Traditional sorting techniques require manual handling and are slow while molecular techniques based on metabarcoding struggle with obtaining reliable abundance information. Here we present a fully automated sorting robot, which detects each specimen, images and measures it before moving it from a mixed invertebrate sample to the well of a 96-well microplate in preparation for DNA barcoding. The images are then used by a newly trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to assign the specimens to 14 particularly common, usually family-level “classes” of insects in Malaise trap samples and an “other-class” (N=15). The average assignment precision for the classes is 91.4% (75-100%). In order to obtain biomass information, the specimen images are also used to measure specimen length and estimate body volume. We outline how the DiversityScanner robot can be a key component for tackling and monitoring invertebrate diversity. The robot generates large numbers of images that become training sets for CNNs once the images are labelled with identifications based on DNA barcodes. In addition, the robot allows for taxon-specific subsampling of large invertebrate samples by only removing the specimens that belong to one of the 14 classes. We conclude that a combination of automation, machine learning, and DNA barcoding has the potential to tackle invertebrate diversity at an unprecedented scale.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Our knowledge of aquatic fungal communities, their assembly, distributions and ecological roles in marine ecosystems is scarce. Hence, we aimed to investigate fungal metacommunities of coastal habitats in a subarctic zone (northern Baltic Sea, Sweden). Using a novel joint species distribution model and network approach, we quantified the importance of biotic associations contributing to the assembly of mycoplankton, further, detected potential biotic interactions between fungi–algae pairs, respectively. Our long-read metabarcoding approach identified 504 fungal taxa, of which a dominant fraction (44.8 %) was assigned as early-diverging fungi (i.e., Cryptomycota and Chytridiomycota). Alpha diversity of mycoplankton declined and community compositions changed along inlet–bay– offshore transects. The distributions of most fungi were rather influenced by spatial factors than by environmental drivers, and the influence of biotic associations was pronounced when environmental filtering was weak and spatial patterning lessened. We found great number of co-occurrences (138) among the dominant fungal groups, and the forty associations between fungal and algal OTUs suggested potential host–parasite/saprotroph links, supporting a Cryptomycota-based mycoloop pathway. We emphasize that the contribution of biotic associations to mycoplankton assembly are important to consider in future studies as it helps to improve predictions of species distributions in aquatic ecosystems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems have been most severely impacted in the Anthropocene with 27% of its species threatened with extinction. Fishing Cat is a globally threatened South and South-east Asian wetland felid that is also a highly rated Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) species, i.e., it is a global priority for conservation and research. Being an understudied species, knowledge gaps exist on its basic ecology, such as distribution and niche.To address this, ensemble species distribution modeling (ESDM) was used to clarify doubts on its potential distribution and niche. To provide a relatable current context, loss of suitable habitat to urbanization (2010-2020) was estimated by analyzing range-wide survey data with environmental and anthropogenic variables (night-time lights and land surface temperature as proxies for urbanization).Wetlands (18.36%) and elevation (17.15%) are the most important variables determining the ecological niche of Fishing Cat. It was predicted to be mainly restricted to low-elevation (&lt;111 m) wetlands in river basins of South and South-east Asia. An estimated 23.74% suitable habitat was lost to urbanization.Incrementally building on the ESDM outputs, high priority movement corridors and landscape conservation units were identified.South Asia holds the core of the global Fishing Cat population with two very important regions - Ganges Brahmaputra Basin and Indus Basin - sharing transboundary areas with highly suitable habitat and many priority conservation units. The former is strategic to maintaining connectivity between South and South-east Asian Fishing Cat populations while isolation effects in the latter need investigation. Coastal wetlands of South-east Asia, though severely impacted, are crucial for the felid’s persistence.More than 90% of Fishing Cat’s potential range lies outside the protected area network. Here, the felid can be adopted as a flagship species to conserve rapidly degrading low- elevation wetlands within a socio-ecological framework by involving multiple stakeholders.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Müllerian mimicry among Neotropical Heliconiini butterflies is an excellent example of natural selection, and is associated with the diversification of a large continental-scale radiation. Some of the processes driving the evolution of mimicry rings are likely to generate incongruent phylogenetic signals across the assemblage, and thus pose a challenge for systematics. We use a dataset of 22 mitochondrial and nuclear markers from 92% of species in the tribe to re-examine the phylogeny of Heliconiini with both supermatrix and multi-species coalescent approaches, characterise the patterns of conflicting signal and compare the performance of various methodological approaches to reflect the heterogeneity across the data. Despite the large extent of reticulate signal and strong conflict between markers, nearly identical topologies are consistently recovered by most of the analyses, although the supermatrix approach fails to reflect the underlying variation in the history of individual loci. The first comprehensive, time-calibrated phylogeny of this group is used to test the hypotheses of a diversification rate increase driven by the dramatic environmental changes in the Amazonia over the past 23 million years, or changes caused by diversity-dependent effects on the rate of diversification. We find that the tribe Heliconiini had doubled its rate of speciation around 11 Ma and that the presently most speciose genus Heliconius started diversifying rapidly at 10 Ma, likely in response to the recent drastic changes in topography of the region. Our study provides comprehensive evidence for a rapid adaptive radiation among an important insect radiation in the most biodiverse region of the planet.

AB  - Geographical areas where two species come into contact and hybridize serve as natural laboratories for assessing mechanisms that limit gene flow between species. The ranges of about half of all closely related Drosophila species overlap, and the genomes of several pairs reveal signatures of past introgression. However, only two contemporary hybrid zones have been characterized in the genus, and both are recently diverged sister species (D. simulans-D. sechellia, Ks = 0.05; D. yakuba-D. santomea, Ks = 0.048). Here we present evidence of a new hybrid zone, and the ecological mechanisms that maintain it, between two highly divergent Drosophila species (Ks = 0.11). On the island of Bioko in west Africa, D. teissieri occupies mostly forests, D. yakuba occupies mostly open agricultural areas, and recently, we discovered that hybrids between these species occur near the interface of these habitats. Genome sequencing revealed that all field-sampled hybrids are F1 progeny of D. yakuba females and D. teissieri males. We found no evidence for either advanced-generation hybrids or F1 hybrids produced by D. teissieri females and D.yakuba males. The lack of advanced-generation hybrids on Bioko is consistent with mark-recapture and laboratory experiments that we conducted, which indicate hybrids have a maladaptive combination of traits. Like D. yakuba, hybrids behaviorally prefer open habitat that is relatively warm and dry, but like D. teissieri, hybrids have low desiccation tolerance, which we predict leaves them physiologically ill-equipped to cope with their preferred habitat. These observations are consistent with recent findings of limited introgression in the D. yakuba clade and identify an ecological mechanism for limiting gene flow between D. yakuba and D. teissieri; namely, selection against hybrids that we have documented, in combination with hybrid male sterility, contributes to the maintenance of this narrow (~30m), stable hybrid zone centered on the forest-open habitat ecotone. Our results show how a deleterious combination of parental traits can result in unfit or maladapted hybrids.

AB  - The range of the Illinois chorus frog (Pseudacris streckeri illinoensis) in Arkansas is restricted to the eastern quarter of Clay County. Nearly 100% of this species’ native sand-prairie habitat has been converted to agricultural fields. The original range of the Illinois chorus frog encompassed at least 9,982 ha. Although two new localities were identified in 2002, the current range is only 4,399 ha in 2002. This represents a 56% range contraction since 1992. Calling was heard in only 44.5% of its original range. This species may be experiencing a severe range contraction. Decay models predict the extirpation of the Illinois chorus frog in Arkansas within 17.5 to 101 yr. Suggested factors contributing to this range contraction may include drought, pesticide use, changes in surface water hydrology, U.S. E.P.A. Best management practices, and this species’ limited ability to recolonize extirpated sites.

AB  - Parasites of animals and plants can encounter trade-offs between their specificity to any single host and their fitness on alternative hosts. For parasites that manipulate their host’s behavior, the complexity of that manipulation may further limit the parasite’s host range. The recently described crypt-keeper wasp, Euderus set, changes the behavior of the gall wasp Bassettia pallida such that B. pallida chews an incomplete exit hole in the side of its larval chamber and “plugs” that hole with its head. E. set benefits from this head plug, as it facilitates the escape of the parasitoid from the crypt after it completes development. Here, we ask whether this behavioral manipulator is limited to Bassettia hosts. We find that E. set attacks and manipulates the behavior of at least six additional gall wasp species, and that these hosts are taxonomically diverse. Interestingly, each of E. set’s hosts has converged upon similarities in their extended phenotypes: the galls they induce on oaks share characters that may make them vulnerable to attack by E. set. Behavioral manipulation in this parasitoid system may be less important to its host range than other dimensions of the host-parasitoid interaction, like the host’s physical defenses.

AB  - We investigated the effect of tree cover, forest patch and disturbances on tree species richness in a highly diverse conservation area of northeast Bangladesh. A systematic sampling protocol was adopted and 80 sub-plots from twenty five 1 ha plots were used for the vegetation survey. Linear regression analysis was performed to understand the effect of patch area, disturbances and tree cover on tree species richness. Ordination using Redundancy analysis (RDA) and Non-metric Multi Dimensional Scaling (NMDS) were also performed to explore the tree species compositional similarities along the stand characteristics gradient and locations of the sample plots. Our study revealed that, forest patch size has greater influence on species richness. Areas with medium level of disturbances have shown greater species richness. In constrained ordination the selected explanatory variables regulated the richness of common species. Our findings can be useful for better forest management and restoration of landscapes of conservation needs using ecologically important species.

AB  - This contribution adopts the taxonomic concept approach, including the use of taxonomic concept labels (name sec. [according to] source) and Region Connection Calculus (RCC-5) articulations and alignments. Prior to this study, the broad-nosed weevil genus Minyomerus Horn, 1876 sec. Jansen &amp; Franz, 2015 (Curculionidae [non-focal]: Entiminae [non-focal]: Tanymecini [non-focal]) contained 17 species distributed throughout the desert and plains regions of North America. In this review of Minyomerus sec. Jansen &amp; Franz, 2018, we describe the following four species as new to science: Minyomerus ampullaceus sec. Jansen &amp; Franz, 2018 (henceforth: [JF2018]), new species, Minyomerus franko [JF2018], new species, Minyomerus sculptilis [JF2018], new species, and Minyomerus tylotos [JF2018], new species. The four new species are added to, and integrated with, the preceding revision, and an updated key and phylogeny of Minyomerus [JF2018] are presented. A cladistic analysis using 52 morphological characters of 26 terminal taxa (5/21 outgroup/ingroup) yielded a single most-parsimonious cladogram (Length = 99 steps, Consistency Index = 60, Retention Index = 80). The analysis reaffirms the monophyly of Minyomerus [JF2018] with eight unreversed synapomorphies. The species-group placements, possible biogeographic origins, and natural history of the new species are discussed in detail.

AB  - Biodiversity loss is a global problem and island species/populations are particularly vulnerable to such loss. Low genetic diversity is one of the factors that can lead a population to extinction. Loss of bee populations is of particular concern because of the knock-on consequences for the pollination guilds that the lost bees once serviced. Here we evaluate the genetic structure of the bumble bee Bombus morio populations on the mainland of South East Brazil and on nearby islands. We analyzed a total of 659 individuals from 24 populations by sequencing two mitochondrial genes (COI and Cytb) and using 14 microsatellite loci. Levels of diversity were high in most of populations and were similar on islands and the mainland. Furthermore, genetic diversity was not significantly correlated with island area, although it was lower in populations from distant islands. Our data suggest that long-term isolation on islands is not affecting the population viability of this species. This may be attributed to the high dispersal ability of B. morio, its capacity to suvive in urban environments, and the characteristics of the studied islands.

AB  - The delimitation of species-boundaries, particularly those obscured by reticulation, is a critical step in contemporary biodiversity assessment. It is especially relevant for conservation and management of indigenous fishes in western North America, represented herein by two species with dissimilar life-histories co-distributed in the highly modified Colorado River (i.e., Flannelmouth Sucker, Catostomus latipinnis; Bluehead Sucker, C. Pantosteus discobolus). To quantify phylogenomic patterns and examine proposed taxonomic revisions, we first employed double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD), yielding 39,755 unlinked SNPs across 139 samples. These were subsequently evaluated with multiple analytical approaches and by contrasting life history data. Three phylogenetic methods and a Bayesian assignment test highlighted similar phylogenomic patterns in each, but with considerable difference in presumed times of divergence. Three lineages were detected in Bluehead Sucker, supporting elevation of C. P. virescens to species-status, and recognizing C. P. discobolus yarrowi (Zuni Bluehead Sucker) as a discrete entity. Admixture in the latter necessitated a reevaluation of its contemporary and historic distributions, underscoring how biodiversity identification can be confounded by complex evolutionary histories. In addition, we defined three separate Flannelmouth Sucker lineages as ESUs (Evolutionarily Significant Units), given limited phenotypic and genetic differentiation, contemporary isolation, and lack of concordance (per the genealogical concordance component of the phylogenetic species concept). Introgression was diagnosed in both species, with the Little Colorado and Virgin rivers in particular. Our diagnostic methods, and the alignment of our SNPs with previous morphological, enzymatic, and mitochondrial work, allowed us to partition complex evolutionary histories into requisite components, such as isolation versus secondary contact.

AB  - Background Male genitals have repeatedly evolved left-right asymmetries, and the causes of such evolution remain unclear. The Drosophila nannoptera group contains four species, among which three exhibit left-right asymmetries of distinct genital organs. In the most studied species, Drosophila pachea, males display asymmetric genital lobes and they mate right-sided on top of the female. Copulation position of the other species is unknown.Results To assess whether the evolution of genital asymmetry could be linked to the evolution of one-sided mating, we examined phallus morphology and copulation position in D. pachea and closely related species. The phallus was found to be symmetric in all investigated species except D. pachea, which display an asymmetric phallus with a right-sided gonopore, and D. acanthoptera, which harbor an asymmetrically bent phallus. In all examined species, males were found to position themselves symmetrically on top of the female, except in D. pachea and D. nannoptera, where males mated right-sided, in distinctive, species-specific positions. In addition, the copulation duration was found to be increased in nannoptera group species compared to closely related outgroup species.Conclusion Our study shows that gains, and possibly losses, of asymmetry in genital morphology and mating position have evolved repeatedly in the nannoptera group. Current data does not allow us to conclude whether genital asymmetry has evolved in response to changes in mating position, or vice versa.

AB  - Speciation is a central mechanism of biological diversification. While speciation is well studied in plants and animals, in comparison, relatively little is known about speciation in fungi. One fungal model is the Cryptococcus genus, which is best known for the pathogenic Cryptococcus neoformans/Cryptococcus gattii species complex that causes over 200,000 new infections in humans annually. The closest non-human pathogenic relatives are the sibling species, Cryptococcus amylolentus and Tsuchiyaea wingfieldii. However, because relatively few isolates of each species are available, it is unclear whether they represent divergent lineages of the same species or different biological species. The recent isolation of an additional strain, preliminarily identified as T. wingfieldii, prompted us to reexamine this group as it may inform about the evolutionary processes underlying the diversification of both non-pathogenic and pathogenic Cryptococcus lineages. Using genomic data, we reappraised the phylogenetic relationship of the four available strains and confirmed the genetic separation of C. amylolentus and T. wingfieldii (now Cryptococcus wingfieldii), and revealed an additional cryptic species, for which the name Cryptococcus floricola is proposed. Comparison of full-length chromosome assemblies revealed approximately 6% pairwise sequence divergence between the three species, and identified significant genomic changes, including inversions as well as a reciprocal translocation that involved inter-centromeric ectopic recombination, which together likely impose significant barriers to genetic exchange. Using genetic crosses, we show that while C. wingfieldii cannot interbreed with any of the other strains, C. floricola can undergo sexual reproduction with C. amylolentus. However, most of the spores resulting from this cross were inviable, and many were sterile, indicating that the two species are genetically isolated through intrinsic post-zygotic barriers and possibly due to niche differentiation. Genome sequencing and analysis of the progeny demonstrated decreased recombination frequency during meiosis in heterospecific crosses compared to C. amylolentus conspecific crosses. This study advances our understanding of speciation in fungi and highlights the power of genomics in assisting our ability to correctly identify and discriminate fungal species.Author Summary The idea of species as discrete natural units seems rather intuitive for most people, just as cells are the basic units of life. However, when observing variation across a species range, boundaries can become blurred making it less than obvious when different populations evolve into separate species. Additionally, separate species can still interbreed, such as lions breeding with tigers to produce a liger or a tigon (depending on the paternal and maternal species of origin), but the resulting offspring is usually inviable or sterile, which in turn is evidence that the parents involved are distinct species. Therefore, what species are and how they originate is still an open question in evolutionary biology. While recent advances have been made in the fields of animal and plant speciation, many other important components of biological diversity, such as fungi, are still understudied. Genome sequencing is now providing new tools to address the genetic mechanisms that drive divergence and reproductive isolation between populations, including genetic incompatibilities, sequence divergence, and chromosomal rearrangements. Here we focus on the Cryptococcus amylolentus species complex, a non-pathogenic fungal lineage closely related to the human pathogenic Cryptococcus neoformans/Cryptococcus gattii complex. Using genetic and genomic analysis we reexamined the species boundaries of four available isolates within the C. amylolentus complex and revealed three genetically isolated species. The genomes of these species are ~6% divergent and exhibit chromosome rearrangements, including translocations and small-scale inversions. Although two of the species (C. amylolentus and newly described C. floricola) are still able to interbreed, the resulting hybrid progeny were mostly inviable, and many were sterile, indicating that barriers to reproduction have already been established. Our results will foster additional studies addressing the transitions between non-pathogenic and pathogenic Cryptococcus lineages.

Here, we tested short-term responses of dryland plant communities to contrasting rainfall regimes using a novel experimental approach.(2) We exposed three annual plant communities to sharp changes in climatic conditions using whole community reciprocal transplants of soil and seed banks. We tested for the role of climate vs. community origin on community response and resistance. In parallel, we asked whether origin-specific climatic adaptations predict compositional shifts across climates.(3) For both community origins, the most dry-adapted species in each community increased in dry climate and the wet-adapted species increased in wet climate. Dry community origins showed large compositional shifts while maintaining stable plant density, biomass and species richness across climates. Conversely, wet communities showed smaller compositional shifts, but larger variation in biomass and richness.(4) Asynchrony in species abundances in response to rainfall variability could maintain structural community stability. This, in combination with seed dormancy, has the ability to delay extinction in response to climate change. However, increasing occurrence of extreme droughts may, in the long-term, lead to loss of wet-adapted species.

AB  - Examining how the landscape may influence gene flow is at the forefront of understanding population differentiation and adaptation. Such understanding is crucial in light of ongoing environmental changes and the elevated risk of ecosystems alteration. In particular, knowledge of how humans may influence the structure of populations is imperative to allow for informed decisions in management and conservation as well as to gain a better understanding of anthropogenic impacts on the interplay between gene flow, genetic drift and selection. Here we use genome-wide molecular markers to characterize the population genetic structure and connectivity of Ipomoea purpurea, a noxious invasive weed. We likewise assess the interaction between natural and human-driven influences on genetic differentiation among populations. Our analyses find that human population density is an important predictor of pairwise population differentiation, suggesting that the agricultural and/or horticultural trade may be involved in maintaining some level of connectivity across distant agricultural fields. Climatic variation appears as an additional predictor of genetic connectivity in this species. We discuss the implications of these results and highlight future research needed to disentangle the mechanistic processes underlying population connectivity of weeds.

AB  - As coral populations decline worldwide in the face of ongoing environmental change, documenting their distribution, diversity and conservation status is now more imperative than ever. Accurate delimitation and identification of species is a critical first step. This task, however, is not trivial as morphological variation and slowly evolving molecular markers confound species identification. New approaches to species delimitation in corals are needed to overcome these challenges. Here, we test whether target enrichment of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and exons can be used for delimiting species boundaries and population structure within species of corals by focusing on two octocoral genera, Alcyonium and Sinularia, as exemplary case studies. We designed an updated bait set (29,363 baits) to target-capture 3,040 UCE and exon loci, recovering a mean of 1,910 ± 168 SD per sample with a mean length of 1,055 ± 208 bp. Similar numbers of loci were recovered from Sinularia (1,946 ± 227 SD) and Alcyonium (1,863 ± 177 SD). Species-level phylogenies were highly supported for both genera. Clustering methods based on filtered SNPs delimited species and populations that are congruent with previous allozyme, DNA barcoding, reproductive and ecological data for Alcyonium, and offered further evidence of hybridization among species. For Sinularia, results were congruent with those obtained from a previous study using Restriction Site Associated DNA Sequencing. Both case studies demonstrate the utility of target-enrichment of UCEs and exons to address a wide range of evolutionary and taxonomic questions across deep to shallow time scales in corals.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Ecological studies of species pairs demonstrated that biotic interactions promote phenotypic change and eco-evolutionary feedbacks. However, we have a limited understanding of how phenotypes respond to interactions with multiple taxa. We investigate how interactions with a network of prey species contribute to spatially structured variation in the skin toxins of the Neotropical poison frog Oophaga pumilio. Specifically, we assess how beta-diversity of alkaloid-bearing arthropod prey assemblages (68 ant species) and evolutionary divergence among populations (from a neutral genetic marker) contribute to frog poison dissimilarity (toxin profiles composed of 230 different lipophilic alkaloids sampled from 934 frogs at 46 sites). We show that ant assemblage turnover predicts alkaloid turnover and unique toxin combinations across the range of O. pumilio. By contrast, evolutionary relatedness is barely correlated with toxin variation. We discuss how the analytical framework proposed here can be extended to other multi-trophic systems, coevolutionary mosaics, microbial assemblages, and ecosystem services.

AU  - Fritz, Johannes
AU  - Janák, Jiří
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Once widespread around the Mediterranean, the Northern Bald Ibis (Geronticus eremita) became one of the rarest birds in the world. We trace the history of this species through different epochs to the present. A particular focus is on its life and disappearance in ancient Egypt, where it attained the greatest mythological significance as a hieroglyphic sign for ‘blessed ancestor spirits’, and on modern endeavours to rewild and restore the species. The close association of the Northern Bald Ibis with human culture in ancient Egypt, as in other regions, is caused by primarily two reasons, the characteristic appearance and behaviour, as well as the need for open foraging areas. In consequence, a mutualistic relationship between humans and birds was formed in some cultures. The benefit for the Northern Bald Ibis was mainly the availability of feeding habitats, which were cleared by humans for farming or grazing and might have contributed to the spread of the species. The benefit to people was primarily cultural and mythological, whereby the bird was worshiped in ancient Egypt and in Muslim cultures, while Christian cultures in Europe rather regarded it as bad omen or nuisance, like any black bird species. Another benefit was profane in nature, the species was also hunted for food, mainly in Europe. But alike many other species, proximity to humans also carried a high risk for the Northern Bald Ibis. We discuss various kinds of human impacts that were driving causes for the extinction of the species in almost all regions. However, the historical disappearance of populations also correlates markedly with changes in climate, especially in ancient Egypt and the Middle Ages. This fact has important implications for current conservation efforts, especially since international action plans for the Northern Bald Ibis have taken little account of climate change effects so far. The Northern Bald Ibis is an outstanding example of how an interdisciplinary cultural-historical and natural-scientific approach significantly promotes the interpretation of historical evidence as well as the implementation of current rewilding and restoration efforts.

AU  - Moran, Daniel

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Summary Sentence Spatially explicit footprints make it possible to locate biodiversity hotspots linked to global supply chains.Identifying species threat hotspots has been a successful approach for setting conservation priorities. One major challenge in conservation is that in many hotspots export industries continue to drive overexploitation. Conservation measures must consider not just the point of impact, but also the consumer demand that ultimately drives resource use. To understand which species threat hotspots are driven by which consumers, we have developed a new approach to link a set of biodiversity footprint accounts to the hotspots of threatened species on the IUCN Red List. The result is a map connecting global supply chains to impact locations. Connecting consumption to spatially explicit hotspots driven by production has not been done before on a global scale. Locating biodiversity threat hotspots driven by consumption of goods and services can help connect conservationists, consumers, companies, and governments in order to better target conservation actions.

AB  - Crop diversity is shaped by biological and social processes interacting at different spatiotemporal scales. Here we combined population genetics and ethnobotany to investigate date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) diversity in Siwa Oasis, Egypt. Based on interviews with farmers and observation of practices in the field, we collected 149 date palms from Siwa Oasis and 27 uncultivated date palms from abandoned oases in the surrounding desert. Using genotyping data from 18 nuclear and plastid microsatellite loci, we confirmed that some named types each constitute a clonal line, i.e. a true-to-type cultivar. We also found that others are collections of clonal lines, i.e. ethnovarieties, or even unrelated samples, i.e. local categories. This alters current assessments of agrobiodiversity, which are visibly underestimated, and uncovers the impact of low-intensity, but highly effective, farming practices on biodiversity. These hardly observable practices, hypothesized by ethnographic survey and confirmed by genetic analysis, are enabled by the way Isiwans conceive and classify living beings in their oasis, which do not quite match the way biologists do: a classic disparity of etic vs. emic categorizations. In addition, we established that Siwa date palms represent a unique and highly diverse genetic cluster, rather than a subset of North African and Middle Eastern palm diversity. As previously shown, North African date palms display evidence of introgression by the wild relative Phoenix theophrasti, and we found that the uncultivated date palms from the abandoned oases share even more alleles with this species than cultivated palms in this region. The study of Siwa date palms could hence be a key to the understanding of date palm diversification in North Africa. Integration of ethnography and population genetics promoted the understanding of the interplay between diversity management in the oasis (short-time scale), and the origins and dynamic of diversity through domestication and diversification (long-time scale).

AB  - How urbanization shapes population genomic diversity and evolution of urban wildlife is largely unexplored. We investigated the impact of urbanization on white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, in the New York City metropolitan area using coalescent-based simulations to infer demographic history from the site frequency spectrum. We assigned individuals to evolutionary clusters and then inferred recent divergence times, population size changes, and migration using genome-wide SNPs genotyped in 23 populations sampled along an urban-to-rural gradient. Both prehistoric climatic events and recent urbanization impacted these populations. Our modeling indicates that post-glacial sea level rise led to isolation of mainland and Long Island populations. These models also indicate that several urban parks represent recently-isolated P. leucopus populations, and the estimated divergence times for these populations are consistent with the history of urbanization in New York City.

TI  - Inter-basin water transfers and the expansion of aquatic invasive species
AU  - Gallardo, Belinda

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Inter-basin Water Transfers (IBWT) are recognized as one of the major pathways of freshwater invasion. They provide a direct link between previously isolated catchments and may modify the habitat conditions of the receiving waters such that they become more favourable for the establishment of invasive species. Combined, IBWT and invasive species will intensify the stress upon native species and ecosystems. Using the Severn and Thames Rivers-two of the largest river systems in Great Britain—as a case study, here we assess the potential influence of IBWT on the expansion of invasive species and thus their impact on biodiversity conservation. The Thames Valley is subject to extensive water abstraction, and an increasing population means that supplemented flow from the River Severn is being considered. Multi-scale Suitability Models, based on climate and water chemistry respectively, provided novel evidence that there is serious risk for further spread of invasive species in the focus area, particularly of the quagga mussel, a recent invader of the Thames River. Native freshwater mussels are particularly vulnerable to changing environmental conditions, and may suffer the decrease in alkalinity and increase in sedimentation associated with an IBWT from the lower Severn to the upper Thames. Regional models suggest considerable overlap between the areas suitable for three vulnerable native freshwater mussels and the expansion of invasive species that negatively impact upon the native mussels. This study illustrates the use of novel spatially-explicit techniques to help managers make informed decisions about the risks associated with introducing aquatic invasive species under different engineering scenarios. Such information may be especially important under new legislation (e.g. EU Invasive Species Regulation No 1143/2014) which increases the responsibility of water managers to contain and not transfer invasive species into new locations.

AB  - Using next-generation sequencing, we obtained for the first time a complete mitochondrial DNA genome from a museum specimen of the extinct wolf (Canis lupus) population of the island of Sicily (Italy). Phylogenetic analyses showed that this genome, which was aligned with a number of historical and extant complete wolf and dog mtDNAs sampled worldwide, was closely related to an Italian wolf mtDNA genome (TN93 and p-distances = 0.0012), five to seven times shorter than divergence among Sicilian and any other known wolf mtDNA genomes (distance range = 0.0050 – 0.0070). Sicilian and Italian haplotypes joined a basal clade belonging to the mtDNA haplogroup-2 of ancient western European wolf populations (Pilot et al. 2010). Bayesian calibration of divergence times indicated that this clade coalesced at MRCA = 13.400 years (with 95% HPD = 4000 – 21.230 years). These mtDNA findings suggest that wolves probably colonized Sicily from southern Italy towards the end of the last Pleistocene glacial maximum, when the Strait of Messina was almost totally dry. Additional mtDNA and genomic data will further clarify the origin and population dynamics before the extinction of wolves in Sicily.

AB  - Macrophytes are key players in aquatic ecosystems diversity, but knowledge on variability of their functional traits, among and within species, is still limited. Remote sensing is a high-throughput, feasible option for characterizing plant traits at different scales, provided that reliable spectroscopy models are calibrated with congruous empirical data.We sampled leaves from six floating and emergent macrophyte species common in temperate areas, covering different phenological stages, seasons, and environmental conditions, and measured leaf reflectance (400-2500 nm) and leaf traits (dealing with photophysiology, pigments and structure). We explored optimal spectral bands combinations and established non-parametric reflectance-based models for selected traits, eventually showing how airborne hyperspectral data can capture spatial-temporal macrophyte variability.Our key finding is that structural - leaf dry matter content, leaf mass per area - and biochemical - chlorophyll-a content and chlorophylls to carotenoids ratio - traits can be surrogated by leaf reflectance with relative error under 20% across macrophyte species, while performance of reflectance-based models for photophysiological traits depends on species.This finding shows the link between leaf reflectance and leaf economics (structure and biochemistry) for aquatic plants, thus supporting the use of remote sensing for enhancing the level of detail of macrophyte functional diversity analysis, to intra-site and intra-species scales.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Model-based approaches that attempt to delimit species are hampered by computational limitations as well as the unfortunate tendency by users to disregard algorithmic assumptions. Alternatives are clearly needed, and machine-learning (M-L) is attractive in this regard as it functions without the need to explicitly define a species concept. Unfortunately, its performance will vary according to which (of several) bioinformatic parameters are invoked. Herein, we gauge the effectiveness of M-L-based species-delimitation algorithms by parsing 64 variably-filtered versions of a ddRAD-derived SNP dataset collected from North American box turtles (Terrapene spp.). Our filtering strategies included: (A) minor allele frequencies (MAF) of 5%, 3%, 1%, and 0% (=none), and (B) maximum missing data per-individual/per-population at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% (=no filtering). We found that species-delimitation via unsupervised M-L impacted the signal-to-noise ratio in our data, as well as the discordance among resolved clades. The latter may also reflect biogeographic history, gene flow, incomplete lineage sorting, or combinations thereof (as corroborated from previously observed patterns of differential introgression). Our results substantiate M-L as a viable species-delimitation method, but also demonstrate how commonly observed patterns of phylogenetic discordance can seriously impact M-L-classification.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Analyzing hybrid zones between previously isolated lineages allows insight into processes determining the fate of re-encounter of these taxa. The distributions of Fire-bellied (Bombina bombina) and Yellow-bellied toads (B. variegata) meet in the Carpathian Basin resulting in a narrow contact zone in the foothill regions, where hybrids often appear. Our aim was to explore a transient zone between B. bombina and B. variegata within the Carpathian Basin along a transect including the Börzsöny Hills in Hungary and Krupinská Planina in Slovakia. We visited 28 locations in these areas and collected altogether 230 specimens, photographed and sampled them using buccal swabs. In order to distinguish between the two species and determine hybrid individuals, we used mitochondrial markers and designed a novel technique based on the restriction of the Ncx-1 gene. The geographical distribution pattern of these two species delivered unexpected results, as Börzsöny Hills was completely colonised by B. bombina including locations which can be classified as typical habitats of B. variegata. Moreover, in Krupinská Planina many locations were also colonised by B. bombina, including high altitude ponds. The most remote sites still harbour B. variegata populations, but seven of these were found with hybrid individuals. This pattern may indicate the northward and altitudinal range expansion of B. bombina and the colonisation of habitats of its sister species in these areas. Our results warrant enhanced attention to hybrid zones, where introgression and changes in population composition may reflect recent rapid environmental alterations and redirect conservation focus.

AB  - Soil bacterial and fungal communities with different key ecological functions play an important role in the boreal forest ecosystem. Despite several studies have reported the microbial altitudinal distribution patterns, our understanding about the characteristics of the microbial community and the core composition of the microbiome in cold-temperate mountain forests is still limited. In this study, Illumina MiSeq sequencing was used to investigate the changes in soil bacterial and fungal communities in surface and subsurface soils along at an altitudinal gradient (from 830 m to 1300 m) on Oakley Mountain in the northern Greater Khingan Mountains. Altitude and soil depth had significant impacts on the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria (dominant phylum for bacteria), and altitude had significant impacts on the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Mucoromycota (dominant phylum for fungi). The diversity of bacterial and fungal communities showed a monotonous decrease and increase with altitude. The influence of altitude on bacterial and fungal community composition was greater than that of soil depth. The variation of pH and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) content in different altitudes were the main factors driving the bacterial and fungal community structure, respectively. There is no obvious difference between the network structure of surface and subsurface soil fungal communities, while the network of subsurface soil bacterial communities was more complex and compact than the surface layer. The network nodes mainly belonging to Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria are the key species in the two soil layers. Our results demonstrated that the altitude had a stronger influence on soil bacterial and fungal communities than soil depth, and bacterial and fungal communities showed divergent patterns along the altitudes and soil profiles.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - To support the assessments of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the IPBES Expert Group on Scenarios and Models is carrying out an intercomparison of biodiversity and ecosystem services models using harmonized scenarios (BES-SIM). The goals of BES-SIM are (1) to project the global impacts of land use and climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services (i.e. nature’s contributions to people) over the coming decades, compared to the 20th century, using a set of common metrics at multiple scales, and (2) to identify model uncertainties and research gaps through the comparisons of projected biodiversity and ecosystem services across models. BES-SIM uses three scenarios combining specific Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to explore a wide range of land-use change and climate change futures. This paper describes the rationale for scenarios selection, the process of harmonizing input data for land use, based on the second phase of the Land Use Harmonization Project (LUH2), and climate, the biodiversity and ecosystem service models used, the core simulations carried out, the harmonization of the model output metrics, and the treatment of uncertainty. The results of this collaborative modelling project will support the ongoing global assessment of IPBES, strengthen ties between IPBES and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios and modelling processes, advise the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) on its development of a post-2020 strategic plans and conservation goals, and inform the development of a new generation of nature-centred scenarios.

AB  - The emergence and persistence of closely-related species in sympatry is puzzling because the potential gene flow and the common local selective pressures may lead to either merging or competitive exclusion. Some species of Morpho butterflies occurring in sympatry display highly similar wing colour patterns. Associated with erratic flight abilities, their bright colouration may limit predator success and discourage future attacks. The evolution of similar colouration in sympatric species is thus likely under local selection by predators (i.e. escape mimicry). Such phenotypic similarity may promote interspecific territoriality and/or reproductive interference, questioning how closely-related co-mimetic species become sexually isolated and coexist in sympatry. We performed a series of field experiments using flying Morpho dummies placed in a natural habitat where wild males commonly patrol. Analysing the interactions of wild Morpho with different dummies, we show that similarity in wing colour pattern leads to interspecific territoriality and courtship among sympatric species. Using genomic data, we then showed that sympatric Morpho species are surprisingly strictly isolated despite their close relatedness and the observed heterospecific interactions. Finally, using a mark-recapture experiment, we discovered a strong temporal segregation in patrolling activity of males from two co-mimetic sister species. Such divergence in phenology may favour sympatry between closely-related species, despite behavioural interferences induced by the local convergence in colour pattern. Altogether, our findings show that temporal segregation may facilitate the co-existence of closely-related species sharing the same ecological niche, suggesting that phenological shifts may represent an overlooked factor of sympatric speciation. Our study therefore highlights how the evolution of multiple traits may favour species diversification in sympatry by partitioning niche in different dimensions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Semi-natural grasslands are ecosystems rich in biodiversity. However, their decline has been reported worldwide, and identification of grasslands with high conservation priority is urgently required. Recently, an increasing number of studies have reported that past vegetation history affects current biological communities. To evaluate whether the temporal continuity of grasslands promotes biodiversity, and thus can be an indicator of conservation priority, we studied vascular plant communities in old (160– 1000s years) and new (52–70 years after deforestation) grasslands, as well as in forests, of Sugadaira Highland in central Japan. The number of plant species was highest in old grasslands, followed by new grasslands and forests. This pattern was much clearer in the number of grassland-dependent native and grassland-dependent endangered species, indicating the role of old grasslands as refugia for those species. The species composition differed between old and new grasslands. New grasslands had species compositions in between those of old grasslands and forests, suggesting that the plant community in new grasslands retains the influence of past forestation for more than 52 years after deforestation. Eleven indicator species were detected in old grasslands, but none in new grasslands, suggesting the uniqueness of the plant community in old grasslands. We conclude that the temporal continuity of grasslands increases plant diversity and can be an indicator of grasslands with high conservation priority.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Designing an effective conservation strategy requires understanding where rare species are located. Although species distribution models are primarily used to identify patterns at large spatial scales, their general methodology is relevant for predicting the occurrence of individual species at specific locations. Here we present a new approach that uses Bayesian networks to improve predictions by modelling environmental co-responses among species. For species from a European peat bog community, our approach consistently performs better than single-species models, and better than conventional multi-species models for rare species when calibration data are limited. Furthermore, we identify a group of “predictor species” that are relatively common, insensitive to the presence of other species, and can be used to improve occurrence predictions of rare species. Predictor species are distinct from other categories of conservation surrogates such as umbrella or indicator species, which motivates focused data collection of predictor species to enhance conservation practices.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Premise Invasive species are expected to experience a reduction in genetic diversity due to founder effects, which should limit their ability to adapt to new habitats. Still, many invasive species achieve widespread distributions and dense populations. This paradox of invasions could potentially be overcome through multiple introductions or hybridization, both of which increase genetic diversity. We conducted a population genomics study of Japanese knotweed (Reynoutria japonica), which is a polyploid, clonally reproducing invasive species that has been notoriously successful worldwide despite supposedly low genetic diversity.Methods We used Genotyping-by-Sequencing to collect 12,912 SNP markers from 88 samples collected at 38 locations across North America for the species complex. We used non-alignment based k-mer hashing analysis in addition to traditional population genetic analyses to account for the challenges of genotyping polyploids.Results Genotypes conformed to three genetic clusters, likely representing Japanese knotweed, Giant knotweed, and hybrid Bohemian knotweed. We found that, contrary to previous findings, the Japanese knotweed cluster had substantial genetic diversity, though it had no apparent genetic structure across the landscape. In contrast, Giant knotweed and hybrids showed distinct population groups. We did not find evidence of Isolation-by-Distance in the species complex, likely reflecting the stochastic introduction history of this species complex. Among species, we found no correlations between SNPs and several temperature- and precipitation-based climatic variables.Conclusions The results indicate that clonal invasive species can show substantial genetic diversity and can be successful at colonizing a variety of habitats without showing evidence of local adaptation or genetic structure.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The land-sparing/land-sharing debate remains an oversimplified framework to evaluate landscape management strategies that aim to reconcile food production and biodiversity conservation. Still, biodiversity-yield curves, on which the framework has relied, provide valuable qualitative information on biodiversity’s sensitivity to agricultural practices, and much research has studied this relationship. But the potential effect of landscape configuration on biodiversity’s response to intensification has rarely been considered; besides, studies have often taken yield as an indicator of agricultural management and have generalized conclusions from studying particular taxonomic groups. In this work we adapt a metacommunity model to analyze factors that shape biodiversity’s response to agricultural intensification while addressing some of the simplifications of the land-sparing/land-sharing dichotomy. In particular, we study species richness decline in landscapes encompassing a combined gradient in matrix quality and configurational heterogeneity of habitat patches, and considering community dynamics. We found that species richness along an intensification gradient shifts from following a robust response to presenting an abrupt decline, as landscape heterogeneity increases, as stricter survival thresholds are applied to species or as habitat area is reduced. Our work highlights the interdependent effects of heterogeneity, habitat availability and matrix quality on biodiversity and contributes to a nuanced understanding of ecological and landscape factors that enable a robust response of biodiversity in the face of spatiotemporal perturbations.

AB  - Divergence-time estimation based on molecular phylogenies and the fossil record has provided insights into fundamental questions of evolutionary biology. In Bayesian node dating, phylogenies are commonly time calibrated through the specification of calibration densities on nodes representing clades with known fossil occurrences. Unfortunately, the optimal shape of these calibration densities is usually unknown and they are therefore often chosen arbitrarily, which directly impacts the reliability of the resulting age estimates. As possible solutions to this problem, two non-exclusive alternative approaches have recently been developed, the “fossilized birth-death” model and “total-evidence dating”. While these approaches have been shown to perform well under certain conditions, they require including all (or a random subset) of the fossils of each clade in the analysis, rather than just relying on the oldest fossils of clades. In addition, both approaches assume that fossil records of different clades in the phylogeny are all the product of the same underlying fossil sampling rate, even though this rate has been shown to differ strongly between higher-level taxa. We here develop a flexible new approach to Bayesian node dating that combines advantages of traditional node dating and the fossilized birth-death model. In our new approach, calibration densities are defined on the basis of first fossil occurrences and sampling rate estimates that can be specified separately for all clades. We verify our approach with a large number of simulated datasets, and compare its performance to that of the fossilized birth-death model. We find that our approach produces reliable age estimates that are robust to model violation, on par with the fossilized birth-death model. By applying our approach to a large dataset including sequence data from over 1000 species of teleost fishes as well as 147 carefully selected fossil constraints, we recover a timeline of teleost diversification that is incompatible with previously assumed vicariant divergences of freshwater fishes. Our results instead provide strong evidence for trans-oceanic dispersal of cichlids and other groups of teleost fishes.

AB  - Behavioral and sensory adaptations are often based in the differential expansion of brain components. These volumetric differences represent changes in investment, processing capacity and/or connectivity, and can be used to investigate functional and evolutionary relationships between different brain regions, and between brain composition and behavioral ecology. Here, we describe the brain composition of two species of Heliconius butterflies, a long-standing study system for investigating ecological adaptation and speciation. We confirm a previous report of striking mushroom body expansion, and explore patterns of post-eclosion growth and experience-dependent plasticity in neural development. This analysis uncovers age-and experience-dependent post-emergence mushroom body growth comparable to that in foraging hymenoptera, but also identifies plasticity in several other neuropil. An interspecific analysis indicates that Heliconius display remarkable levels of investment in mushroom bodies for a lepidopteran, and indeed rank highly compared to other insects. Our analyses lay the foundation for future comparative and experimental analyses that will establish Heliconius as a useful case study in evolutionary neurobiology.

AB  - Dispersal is one of the strategies for organisms to deal with climate change and habitat degradation. Therefore, investigating the effects of dispersal evolution on natural populations is of considerable interest to ecologists and conservation biologists. Although it is known that dispersal itself can evolve due to selection, the behavioral, life-history and metabolic consequences of dispersal evolution are not well understood. Here we explore these issues by subjecting four outbred laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster to selection for increased dispersal. The dispersal-selected populations had similar values of body size, fecundity and longevity as the non-selected lines (controls), but evolved significantly greater locomotor activity, exploratory tendency, and aggression. Untargeted metabolomic fingerprinting through NMR spectroscopy suggested that the selected flies evolved elevated cellular respiration characterized by greater amounts of glucose, AMP and NAD. Concurrent evolution of higher level of Octopamine and other neurotransmitters indicate a possible mechanism for the behavioural changes in the selected lines. We discuss the generalizability of our findings in the context of observations from natural populations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the evolution of metabolome due to selection for dispersal and its connection to dispersal syndrome evolution.

AU  - Yavit, Noah
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Bamboo-dominated forests in Southwestern Amazonia encompass an estimated 180,000 km2 of nearly contiguous primary, tropical lowland forest. This area, largely composed of two bamboo species, Guadua weberbaueri Pilger and G. sarcocarpa Londoño &amp; Peterson, comprises a significant portion of the Amazon Basin and has a potentially important effect on regional carbon storage. Numerous local REDD(+) projects would benefit from the development of allometric models for these species, although there has been just one effort to do so. The aim of this research was to create a set of improved allometric equations relating the above and belowground biomass to the full range of natural size and growth patterns observed. Four variables (DBH, stem length, small branch number and branch number ≥ 2cm diameter) were highly significant predictors of stem biomass (N≤ 278, p&lt; 0.0001 for all predictors, complete model R2=0.93). A secondary field model (containing DBH and branch number &gt; 2cm diameter), proved highly significant as well (N= 278, p&lt; 0.0001 for both predictors, R2=0.84). The belowground biomass was estimated to be 19.2±6.2% of the total dry biomass of the bamboo species examined. To demonstrate the utility of these models in the field and derive stand-level estimates of bamboo biomass, ten 0.36-ha plots were analyzed (N= 3,966 culms), yielding above + belowground biomass values ranging from 4.3–14.5 Mg·ha-1. The results of this research provide novel allometric models and estimates of the contribution of G. weberbaueri and G. sarcocarpa to the total carbon budget of this vast and largely unexplored Amazonian habitat.

AB  - Why and how sexual reproduction is maintained in natural populations, the so-called “queen of problems”, is a key unanswered question in evolutionary biology. Recent efforts to solve the problem of sex have often emphasized results generated from laboratory settings. Here, we use a survey of representative “sex in the wild” literature to review and synthesize the outcomes of empirical studies focused on natural populations. Especially notable results included relatively strong support for mechanisms involving niche differentiation and a near absence of attention to adaptive evolution. Support for a major role of parasites is largely confined to a single study system, and only three systems contribute most of the support for mutation accumulation hypotheses. This evidence for taxon specificity suggests that outcomes of particular studies should not be more broadly extrapolated without extreme caution. We conclude by suggesting steps forward, highlighting tests of niche differentiation mechanisms in both lab and nature and empirical evaluation of adaptive evolution-focused hypotheses in the wild. We also emphasize the value of leveraging the growing body of genomic resources for non-model taxa to address whether the clearance of harmful mutations and spread of beneficial variants in natural populations proceeds as expected under various hypotheses for sex.Author contributions SM and MN conceived the paper idea, SM, PM, MN, and TS designed the review strategy, reviewed and analysed the literature, and wrote the manuscript.

AB  - Acacia-ant mutualists in the genus Pseudomyrmex nest obligately in acacia plants and, through stable isotope analysis, we show that they are among the strictest of herbivores, feeding exclusively from their hosts. The diets of herbivorous insects such as these are often enriched by obligate bacterial endosymbionts through nitrogen recycling and even gaseous di-nitrogen fixation. We, therefore, examine the bacterial communities associated with mutualistic acacia-ants, comparing them with related non-mutualists in order to determine whether they host bacterial partners likely to contribute to the enrichment of their diets. However, despite their low trophic position, we find no evidence for bacteria-assisted nutrition in either adults or larvae. These acacia-ants do not host any species- or clade-specific bacteria, though several lineages of acetic acid bacteria present across social insects do differ in abundance between mutualists and non-mutualists, likely in response to the sugar-rich diets of their hosts. In addition, two novel lineages of Actinomycetales inhabit both mutualistic and non-mutualistic Pseudomyrmex and differ in abundance between the juveniles of these groups, potentially serving as defensive symbionts. Metagenomic sequencing of these taxa reveal substantial capacity for the production of defensive chemicals. Overall, we find little evidence for nutrition-associated bacteria in these strictly herbivorous ants, showing that bacteria are not as essential to animal nutrition as is often hypothesized.

AB  - Target enrichment of conserved nuclear loci has helped reconstruct evolutionary relationships among a wide variety of species. While there are preexisting bait sets to enrich a few hundred loci across all fishes or a thousand loci from acanthomorph fishes, no bait set exists to enrich large numbers (&gt;1000 loci) of ultraconserved nuclear loci from ostariophysans, the second largest actinopterygian superorder.In this manuscript, we describe how we designed a bait set to enrich 2,708 ultraconserved nuclear loci from ostariophysan fishes by combining an existing genome assembly with low coverage sequence data collected from two ostariophysan lineages.We perform a series of enrichment experiments using this bait set across the ostariophysan Tree of Life, from the deepest splits among the major groups (&gt;150 MYA) to more recent divergence events that have occured during the last 50 million years.Our results demonstrate that the bait set we designed is useful for addressing phylogenetic questions from the origin of crown ostariophysans to more recent divergence events, and our in silico results suggest that this bait set may be useful for addressing evolutionary questions in closely related groups of fishes, like Clupeiformes.

AB  - The Sonic Kayak is a musical instrument with which to investigate nature, developed during open hacklab events. Kayaks rigged with underwater environmental sensors allow paddlers to hear real-time water temperature sonifications and underwater sounds, generating live music from the marine world. Sensor data is also logged every second with GPS, time and date, allowing fine scale mapping of water temperatures and underwater noise that was previously unattainable using standard research equipment. The system provides the paddler with an extra dimension of senses with which to explore the underwater climate, while enabling citizens to gather data for scientific research. The system can be used as a citizen-science data-collection device, research equipment for professional scientists, or a sound-art installation in its own right, and has been implemented in a public setting at the British Science Festival 2016, demonstrating the considerable advantages of adopting transdisciplinary approaches during project development. Here we present instructions for building the open-hardware and open-source software, tests of the sensors used, and preliminary data demonstrating applications for the Sonic Kayak in marine climate and noise-pollution research.

AB  - A new roadmap for quantitative methodologies of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is proposed, using an ecosystem-based approach. EIA recommendations are currently based on case-by-case rankings, distant from statistical methodologies, and based on ecological ideas that lack proof of generality or predictive capacities. These qualitative approaches ignore process dynamics, scales of variations and interdependencies and are unable to address societal demands to link socio-economic and ecological processes (e.g. population dynamics). We propose to re-focus EIA around the systemic formulation of interactions between organisms (organized in populations and communities) and their environments but inserted within a strict statistical framework. A systemic formulation allows scenarios to be built that simulate impacts on chosen receptors. To illustrate the approach, we design a minimum ecosystem model that demonstrates non-trivial effects and complex responses to environmental changes. We suggest further that an Ecosystem-Based EIA - in which the socio-economic system is an evolving driver of the ecological one - is more promising than a socio-economic-ecological system where all variables are treated as equal. This refocuses the debate on cause-and-effect, processes, identification of essential portable variables, and a potential for quantitative comparisons between projects, which is important in cumulative effects determinations.

AB  - The eco-evolutionary dynamics of species are fundamentally linked to the energetic constraints of its constituent individuals. Of particular importance is the interplay between reproduction and the dynamics of starvation and recovery. To elucidate this interplay, we introduce a nutritional state-structured model that incorporates two classes of consumer: nutritionally replete, reproducing consumers, and undernourished, non-reproducing consumers. We obtain strong constraints on starvation and recovery rates by deriving allometric scaling relationships and find that population dynamics are typically driven to a steady state. Moreover, these rates fall within a ‘refuge’ in parameter space, where the probability of population extinction is minimized. We also show that our model provides a natural framework to predict maximum mammalian body size by determining the relative stability of an otherwise homogeneous population to a competing population with altered percent body fat. This framework provides a principled mechanism for a selective driver of Cope’s rule.

AB  - Taxonomic over-splitting of extinct or endangered taxa, due to an incomplete knowledge of both skeletal morphological variability and the geographical ranges of past populations, continues to confuse the link between isolated extant populations and their ancestors. This is particularly problematic with the genus Equus. To more reliably determine the evolution and phylogeographic history of the endangered Asiatic wild ass, we studied the genetic diversity and inter-relationships of both extinct and extant populations over the last 100,000 years, including samples throughout its previous range from Western Europe to Southwest and East Asia. Using 229 bp of the mitochondrial hypervariable region, an approach which allowed the inclusion of information from extremely poorly preserved ancient samples, we classify all non-African wild asses into nine clades that show a clear phylogeographic structure revealing their phylogenetic history. This study places the extinct European wild ass, E. hydruntinus, the phylogeny of which has been debated since the end of the 19th century, into its phylogenetic context within the Asiatic wild asses and reveals recent gene flow events between populations currently regarded as separate species. The phylogeographic organization of clades resulting from these efforts can be used not only to improve future taxonomic determination of a poorly characterized group of equids, but also to identify historic ranges, interbreeding events between various populations, and the impact of ancient climatic changes. In addition, appropriately placing extant relict populations into a broader phylogeographic and genetic context can better inform ongoing conservation strategies for this highly endangered species.

AB  - Background The emergence and spread of tick-borne arboviruses pose an increased challenge to human and animal health. In Europe this is demonstrated by the increasingly wide distribution of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV, Flavivirus, Flaviviridae), which has recently been found in the UK. However, much less is known about other tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFV), such as the closely related louping ill virus (LIV), an animal pathogen which is endemic to the UK and Ireland but which has been detected in other parts of Europe including Scandinavia and Russia. The emergence and potential spatial overlap of these viruses necessitates improved understanding of LIV genomic diversity, geographic spread and evolutionary history.Methodology/principal findings We sequenced a virus archive composed of 22 LIV isolates which had been sampled throughout the UK over a period of over 80 years. Combining this dataset with published virus sequences, we detected no sign of recombination and found low diversity and limited evidence for positive selection in the LIV genome. Phylogenetic analysis provided evidence of geographic clustering as well as long-distance movement, including movement events that appear recent. However, despite genomic data and an 80-year time span, we found that the data contained insufficient temporal signal to reliably estimate a molecular clock rate for LIV. Additional analyses revealed that this also applied to TBEV, albeit to a lesser extent, pointing to a general problem with phylogenetic dating for TBFV.Conclusions/significance The 22 LIV genomes generated during this study provide a more reliable LIV phylogeny, improving our knowledge of the evolution of tick-borne flaviviruses. Our inability to estimate a molecular clock rate for both LIV and TBEV suggests that temporal calibration of tick-borne flavivirus evolution should be interpreted with caution and highlight a unique aspect of these viruses which may be explained by their reliance on tick vectors.Author Summary Tick-borne pathogens represent a major emerging threat to public health and in recent years have been expanding into new areas. LIV is a neglected virus endemic to the UK and Ireland (though it has been detected in Scandinavia and Russia) which is closely related to the major human pathogen TBEV, but predominantly causes disease in sheep and grouse. The recent detection of TBEV in the UK, which has also emerged elsewhere in Europe, requires more detailed understanding of the spread and sequence diversity of LIV. This could be important for diagnosis and vaccination, but also to improve our understanding of the evolution and emergence of these tick-borne viruses. Here we describe the sequencing of 22 LIV isolates which have been sampled from several host species across the past century. We have utilised this dataset to investigate the evolutionary pressures that LIV is subjected to and have explored the evolution of LIV using phylogenetic analysis. Crucially we were unable to estimate a reliable molecular clock rate for LIV and found that this problem also extends to a larger phylogeny of TBEV sequences. This work highlights a previously unknown caveat of tick-borne flavivirus evolutionary analysis which may be important for understanding the evolution of these important pathogens.

AB  - Aim The standard latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG), in which species richness decreases from equator to pole, is a pervasive pattern observed in most groups of organisms. Despite its commonness, an increasing number of non-conforming lineages have been identified, presenting a challenge for general explanations of the standard LDG. Although problematic, documenting and studying these contrarian groups can help us to better understand LDGs generally. To that end we identify the ant tribe Stenammini, a diverse lineage with over 400 species, as a contrarian clade, and we attempt to explain the group’s atypical diversity pattern using a historical approach. We evaluate the following alternative hypotheses: time-for-speciation/center-of-origin (TFS/COO), niche conservatism, and differences in diversification rate.Location Global.Methods We examine the shape of the LDG in Stenammini by plotting latitudinal midpoints for all extant species. We then infer a robust phylogeny using a phylogenomic approach that employs ultraconserved element loci and we use the phylogeny to estimate divergence dates, biogeographic history, and ancestral habitats. We also test for diversification rate heterogeneity across the tree and among lineages within the tribe.Results Stenammini has a skewed inverse latitudinal diversity gradient with an extratropical richness peak in the northern temperate zone. Our phylogenomic approach resulted in a robust phylogeny revealing five major clades and several instances of non-monophyly among genera (Goniomma, Aphaenogaster). The tribe and most major lineages originated in the temperate zone and inhabited temperate niches. Crown Stenammini dates to 52 Ma (Eocene Climatic Optimum) and most major lineages appeared soon after during a period of global cooling. Despite its temperate origin, the group invaded the tropics at least six times, but failed to diversify greatly there. Across the tree diversification increased from 17.2-1.9 Ma following the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum, and among lineages there was a rate increase in Holarctic Aphaenogaster + Messor just prior to 17.2 Ma.Main Conclusions Our results suggest that time, niche conservatism, and increased diversification have all contributed to the inverse latitudinal gradient in Stenammini. Among these processes, niche conservatism may be less important given that the tribe has dispersed to the tropics multiple times.

AB  - Climate change is a global issue with effects that are difficult to manage at a regional scale. Yet more often than not climate factors are just some of multiple stressors affecting species on a population level. Non-climatic factors - especially those of anthropogenic origins - may play equally important roles with regard to impacts on species and are often more feasible to address. Here we assess the influence of climate change on population trends of the endangered Yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) over the last 30 years, using a Bayesian model. Sea surface temperature (SST) proved to be the dominating factor influencing survival of both adult birds and fledglings. Increasing SST since the mid-1990s was accompanied by a reduction in survival rates and population decline. The population model showed that 33% of the variation in population numbers could be explained by SST alone, significantly increasing pressure on the penguin population. Consequently, the population becomes less resilient to non-climate related impacts, such as fisheries interactions, habitat degradation and human disturbance. However, the extent of the contribution of these factors to declining population trends is extremely difficult to assess principally due to the absence of quantifiable data, creating a discussion bias towards climate variables, and effectively distracting from non-climate factors that can be managed on a regional scale to ensure the viability of the population.

However, in groups with no obvious morphological innovations, observed upticks in diversification rates have also been attributed to the colonization of a new geographic environment. In this study, we explore the systematics, diversification dynamics, and historical biogeography of the plant clade Rhinantheae in the Orobanchaceae, with a special focus on the Andean clade of the genus Bartsia L..Methods We sampled taxa from across Rhinantheae, including a representative sample of Andean Bartsia species. Using standard phylogenetic methods, we reconstructed evolutionary relationships, inferred divergence times among the clades of Rhinantheae, elucidated their biogeographic history, and investigated diversification dynamics.Key results We confirmed that the South American Bartsia species form a highly supported monophyletic group. The median crown age of Rhinantheae was determined to be ca. 30 Ma, and Europe played an important role in the biogeographic history of the lineages. South America was first reconstructed in the biogeographic analyses around 9 Ma, and with a median age of 2.59 Ma, this clade shows a significant uptick in diversification.Conclusions Increased net diversification of the South American clade corresponds with biogeographic movement into the New World. This happened at a time when the Andes were reaching the necessary elevation to host an alpine environment. Although a specific route could not be identified with certainty, we provide plausible hypotheses to how the group colonized the New World.

AB  - Blanchard’s Cricket Frog, Acris blanchardi, is a small hylid frog that was once among the most common amphibians in any part of its range. Today, it remains abundant in much of the southern portion of its range, but is now disappearing elsewhere. Our analysis of habitat characters observed across several states revealed interesting relationships of these factors with the abundance or presence of Blanchard’s Cricket Frog. Further, we later established two ½ acre ponds based on these relationships that led to immediate colonization of the ponds by cricket frogs followed by explosive production of juveniles less than a year later. Our findings suggest that habitat management for this species should specifically manage the shoreline grade and especially the aquatic floating vegetation to maximize population growth and sustenance.

AB  - The relationship between animals and their gut flora is simultaneously one of the most common and most complex symbioses on Earth. Despite its ubiquity, our understanding of this invisible but often critical relationship is still in its infancy. We employed adult Neotropical butterflies as a study system to ask three questions: First, how does gut microbial community composition vary across host individuals, species and dietary guilds? Second, how do gut flora compare to food microbial communities? Finally, are gut flora functionally adapted to the chemical makeup of host foods? To answer these questions we captured nearly 300 Costa Rican butterflies representing over 50 species, six families and two feeding guilds: frugivores and nectivores. We characterized the bacteria and fungi in guts, wild fruits and wild nectars via amplicon sequencing and assessed the catabolic abilities of the gut flora via culture-based assays.Gut communities were distinct from food communities, suggesting that the gut environment acts as a strong filter on potential colonists. Nevertheless, gut flora varied widely among individuals and species. On average, a pair of butterflies shared 21% of their bacterial species and 6% of their fungi. Host species explained 25-30% of total variation in microbial communities while host diet explained 4%. However, diet was still relevant at the individual microbe level—half of the most abundant microbial species differed in abundance between frugivores and nectivores. Diet was also related to the functional profile of gut flora: compared to frugivores, nectivores’ gut flora exhibited increased catabolism of sugars and sugar alcohols and decreased catabolism of amino acids, carboxylic acids and dicarboxylic acids. Since fermented juice contains more amino acids and less sugar than nectar, it appears that host diet filters the gut flora by favoring microbes that digest compounds abundant in foods.By quantifying the degree to which gut communities vary among host individuals, species and dietary guilds and evaluating how gut microbial composition and catabolic potential are related to host diet, this study deepens our understanding of the structure and function of one of the most complex and ubiquitous symbioses in the animal kingdom.

AB  - Aggregating multiple non-expert opinions into a collective estimate can improve accuracy across many contexts. However, two sources of error can diminish collective wisdom: individual estimation biases and information sharing between individuals. Here we measure individual biases and social influence rules in multiple experiments involving hundreds of individuals performing a classic numerosity estimation task. We first investigate how existing aggregation methods, such as calculating the arithmetic mean or the median, are influenced by these sources of error. We show that the mean tends to overestimate, and the median underestimate, the true value for a wide range of numerosities. Quantifying estimation bias, and mapping individual bias to collective bias, allows us to develop and validate three new aggregation measures that effectively counter sources of collective estimation error. In addition, we present results from a further experiment that quantifies the social influence rules that individuals employ when incorporating personal estimates with social information. We show that the corrected mean is remarkably robust to social influence, retaining high accuracy in the presence or absence of social influence, across numerosities, and across different methods for averaging social information. Utilizing knowledge of estimation biases and social influence rules may therefore be an inexpensive and general strategy to improve the wisdom of crowds.

AB  - This paper presents the Regime Shifts Database (RSDB), a new online, open-access database that uses a novel consistent framework to systematically analyze regime shifts based on their impacts, key drivers, underlying feedbacks, and management options. The database currently contains 27 generic types of regime shifts, and over 300 specific case studies of a variety of regime shifts. These regime shifts occur across diverse types of systems and are driven by many different types of processes. Besides impacting provisioning and regulating services, our work shows that regime shifts substantially impact cultural and aesthetic ecosystem services. We found that social-ecological feedbacks are difficult to characterize and more work is needed to develop new tools and approaches to better understand social-ecological regime shifts. We hope that the database will stimulate further research on regime shifts and make available information that can be used in management, planning and assessment.

AB  - Lichenized fungi are evolutionarily diverse and ecologically important, but little is known about the processes driving diversification and genetic differentiation in these lineages. Though few studies have examined population genetic patterns in lichens, their geographic distributions are often assumed to be wholly shaped by ecological requirements rather than dispersal limitations. Furthermore, while their reproductive structures are observable, the lack of information about recombination mechanisms and rates can make inferences about reproductive strategies difficult. Here we investigate the population genomics of Cetradonia linearis, an endangered lichen narrowly endemic to the southern Appalachians of eastern North America, to test the relative contributions of environmental factors and geographic distance in shaping genetic structure, and to gain insights into the demography and reproductive biology of range restricted fungi. Analysis of genome-wide SNP data indicated strong evidence for both low rates of recombination and for strong isolation by distance, but did not support isolation by environment. Hindcast species distribution models and the spatial distribution of genetic diversity also suggested that C. linearis had a larger range during the last glacial maximum, especially in the southern portion of its current extent, consistent with previous findings in other southern Appalachian taxa. These results contribute to our understanding of intrinsic and extrinsic factors shaping genetic diversity and biogeographic patterns in C. linearis, and more broadly, in rare and endangered fungi.We would like to thank the following people for aiding with this research: Alex Cecil and Jenna Dorey for their field assistance, Gary Kauffman for help locating populations throughout the National Forest and many helpful discussions about Gymnoderma, Chris Ulrey for help locating the species on Blue Ridge National Park land, and especially for rapelling expertise, Dr. Richard Harris for conducting microscopy to search for trichogynes and spores.

AB  - Good hygiene, in both health care and the community, is central to containing the rise of antibiotic resistance, as well as to infection control more generally. But despite the well-known importance, the ecological mechanisms by which hygiene affects resistance evolution remain obscure. Using metacommunity ecology theory, we here propose that hygiene attenuates the effect of antibiotic selection pressure. Specifically, we predict that hygiene limits the scope for antibiotics to induce competitive release of resistant bacteria within treated hosts, and that this is due to a modulating effect of hygiene on the distribution of resistant and sensitive strains in the host population. We show this in a mathematical model of bacterial metacommunity dynamics, and test the results against data on antibiotic resistance, antibiotic treatment, and the use of alcohol-based hand rub in long-term care facilities. Our results underscore the importance of hygiene, and point to a concrete way to weaken the link between antibiotic use and increasing resistance.

AB  - Dispersal, and the underlying movement behaviour, are processes of pivotal importance for understanding and predicting metapopulation and metacommunity dynamics. Generally, dispersal decisions are non-random and rely on information, such as the presence of conspecifics. However, studies on metacommunities that include interspecific interactions generally disregard information use. Therefore, it remains unclear whether and how dispersal in metacommunities is informed and whether rules derived from single-species contexts can be scaled up to (meta-)communities. Using experimental protist metacommunities, we show how dispersal and movement are informed and adjusted by the strength of inter-specific interactions. We found that predicting informed movement and dispersal in metacommunities requires knowledge on behavioural responses to intra- and inter-specific interaction strength. Consequently, metacommunity dynamics inferred directly from single-species metapopulations without taking inter-specific interactions into account are likely flawed. Our work identifies the significance of information use for understanding metacommunity dynamics, stability and the coexistence and distribution of species.Author contributions All authors designed the study.

TI  - Total evidence tip-dating phylogeny of platyrrhine primates and 27 well-justified fossil calibrations for primate divergences
AU  - de Vries, Dorien
AU  - Beck, Robin M. D.
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Phylogenies with estimates of divergence times are essential for investigating many evolutionary questions. In principle, “tip-dating” is arguably the most appropriate approach, with fossil and extant taxa analyzed together in a single analysis, and topology and divergence times estimated simultaneously. However, “node-dating” (as used in many molecular clock analyses), in which fossil evidence is used to calibrate the age of particular nodes a priori, will probably remain the dominant approach, due to various issues with analyzing morphological and molecular data together. Tip-dating may nevertheless play a key role in robustly identifying fossil taxa that can be used to inform node-dating calibrations. Here, we present tip-dating analyses of platyrrhine primates (so-called “New World monkeys”) based on a total evidence dataset of 418 morphological characters and 10.2 kb of DNA sequence data from 17 nuclear genes, combined from previous studies. The resultant analyses support a late Oligocene or early Miocene age for crown Platyrrhini (composite age estimate: 20.7-28.2 Ma). Other key findings include placement of the early Miocene putative cebid Panamacebus outside crown Platyrrhini, equivocal support for Proteropithecia being a pitheciine, and support for a clade comprising three subfossil platyrrhines from the Caribbean (Xenothrix, Antillothrix and Paralouatta), related to Callicebinae. Based on these results and the available literature, we provide a list of 27 well-justified node calibrations for primate divergences, following best practices: 17 within Haplorhini, five within Strepsirrhini, one for crown Primates, and four for deeper divergences within Euarchontoglires. In each case, we provide a hard minimum bound, and for 23 of these we also provide a soft maximum bound and a suggested prior distribution. For each calibrated node, we provide the age of the oldest fossil of each daughter lineage that descends from it, which allows use of the “CladeAge” method for specifying priors on node ages.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - In this study, we explored the diversity and community composition of bacteria along a vertical gradient in Lake Issyk Kul, Kyrgyzstan, one of the largest and deepest brackish lakes in in the world. We identified 4904 bacterial ASVs based on analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences and determined significant changes in the composition responding mainly to the variables depth and salinity. A higher abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes was observed in the surface waters and the lake tributaries. Cyanobacteria were more abundant in the deep chlorophyll maximum (28.5 to 128 m), while Planctomycetes and Chloroflexi were dominant at depths between 128 to 600 m. According to our machine learning analysis used for identifying the most critical environmental factors, depth and temperature revealed the strongest effect on members of Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Chloroflexi, while oxygen is associated with the variations in Cyanobacteria. Also, a notable increase in alpha diversity estimations was observed with increasing water depth. This work evidences significant differences in the structure of bacterial communities along the depth gradient in deep, transparent lake ecosystems. Notably, there is a dominance of Planctomycetes and Chloroflexi in the deepest layers, which can only be seen in a few other lakes with similar characteristics as Lake Issyk Kul and raises questions about their ecological role.

AB  - Microbial eukaryotes (protists) contribute substantially to ecological functioning in marine ecosystems, but factors shaping protist diversity, such as dispersal barriers and environmental selection, remain difficult to parse. Deep-sea water masses, which form geographic barriers, and hydrothermal vents, which represent isolated productivity hotspots, are ideal opportunities for studying the effects of dispersal barriers and environmental selection on protist communities. The Okinawa Trough, a deep, back-arc spreading basin, contains distinct water masses in the bottom waters of northern and southern regions and at least twenty-five active hydrothermal vents. In this study, we used metabarcoding to characterize protist communities from fourteen stations spanning the length of the Okinawa Trough, including three hydrothermal vent sites. Significant differences in community structure reflecting regional oceanography and water mass composition were present, indicating the importance of geographic factors in shaping protist communities. Protist communities in bottom waters affected by hydrothermal activity were significantly different from communities in other bottom waters, suggesting that environmental factors can be especially important in shaping community composition under specific conditions. Amplicon sequence variants that were enriched in hydrothermally influenced bottom waters largely derived from cosmopolitan protists that were present, but rare, in other near-bottom samples, thus highlighting the importance of the rare biosphere.

TI  - An Extended Maximum Likelihood Inference of Geographic Range Evolution by Dispersal, Local Extinction and Cladogenesis
AU  - Beeravolu, Champak R.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - The origin and evolution of species’ ranges remains a central focus of historical biogeography and the advent of likelihood methods based on phylogenies has revolutionized the way in which range evolution has been studied. A decade ago, the first elements of what turned out to be a popular inference approach of ancestral ranges based on the processes of Dispersal, local Extinction and Cladogenesis (DEC) was proposed. The success of the DEC model lies in its use of a flexible statistical framework known as a Continuous Time Markov Chain and since, several conceptual and computational improvements have been proposed using this as a baseline approach. In the spirit of the original version of DEC, we introduce DEC eXtended (DECX) by accounting for rapid expansion and local extinction as possible anagenetic events on the phylogeny but without increasing model complexity (i.e. in the number of free parameters). Classical vicariance as a cladogenetic event is also incorporated by making use of temporally flexible constraints on the connectivity between any two given areas in accordance with the movement of landmasses and dispersal opportunity over time. DECX is built upon a previous implementation in C/C++ and can analyze phylogenies on the order of several thousand tips in a few minutes. We test our model extensively on Pseudo Observed Datasets and on well-curated and recently published data from various island clades and a worldwide phylogeny of Amphibians (3309 species). We also propose the very first implementation of the DEC model that can specifically account for trees with fossil tips (i.e. non-ultrametric) using the phylogeny of palpimanoid spiders as a case study. In this paper, we argue in favour of the proposed improvements, which have the advantage of being computationally efficient while toeing the line of increased biological realism.

AB  - Uncovering the spatial dynamics of range expansions is a major goal in studies of historical demographic inference, with applications ranging from understanding the evolutionary origins of domesticated crops, epidemiology, invasive species, and understanding specieslevel responses to climate change. Following the surge in advances that make explicit use of the spatial distribution of genetic data from georeferenced SNP variants, we present a novel summary statistic vector, the geographic spectrum of shared alleles (GSSA). Using simulations of twodimensional serial expansion, we find that the information from the GSSA, summarized with Harpending’s Raggedness Index (RI), can accurately detect the spatial origins of a range expansion under serial founder models, even with sparse sampling of only ten individuals. When applying to SNP data from two species of the holarctic butterfly genus Lycaeides, the suggested origins of expansion are consistent with hindcasts obtained from ecological niche models (ENMs). These results demonstrate the GSSA to be a useful exploratory tool for generating hypotheses of range expansion with genomewide SNP data. Our simulation experiments suggest high performance even with sampling found in studies of nonmodel organisms (one sampled individual per location, no outgroup information, and only 5,000 SNP loci).

TI  - Death recognition by undertaker bees
AU  - Wen, Ping
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Dead conspecifics removal is important of being social to avoid pathogen transmission, which resulted in the evolution of a specific caste of undertaking workers in all hives bee species. However, it is mysterious that how the undertakers distinguish death and life instantly. Through integrative studies of behavioural tests and chemical analyses, a novel mechanism for dead conspecifics recognition is found in the Asian bee Apis cerana cerana Fabricius. The bees detect quickly the death of conspecifics based on decreased cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) emissions, caused by the cooling of the dead bee. Specifically, with the decline of body temperature in death, the CHC emission was reduced. Undertakers perceived the major CHCs. Addition of synthetic CHCs, followed by heating, inhibited undertaking behaviour. Among these CHCs, heptacosane and nonacosane are the major compounds in a natural bee hive, providing a continuous signal associated with life. Via changing the vapour pressure then the ratio of emitted compounds encoding the physiological status of signal sender, insect chemical communication can be finely tuned by body temperature. This straightforward death recognition mechanism requiring little cost can be universal in animal living in social groups, especially in the social insects. Body temperature affected behaviour can response to increasing frequency of extreme weathers in global climate change, which help explain the recent worldwide bee health problem.

AB  - Intensive and trait-selective harvesting of fish and wildlife can cause evolutionary changes in a range of life-history and behavioural traits. These changes might in turn alter the circadian system both at behavioral and molecular levels, with knock-on effects on daily physiological processes and behavioural outputs. We examined the evolutionary impact of size-selective mortality on collective risk-taking behavior and the circadian system in a model fish species. We exposed zebrafish (Danio rerio) to either large or small size-selective mortality relative to a control over five generations, followed by eight generations during which harvesting halted to remove maternal effects. Large size-selective mortality typical of many fisheries and specialized predators targeting larger size classes decreased collective risk-taking behavior compared to controls. The opposite occurred in response to small size-selective mortality typical of specialized fisheries and most gape-limited predators. The evolutionary changes in risk-taking behavior were linked to daily activity rhythms in response to small size-selective mortality, while no changes were observed in response to large size-selective mortality. We also found changes in the molecular circadian core clockwork in response to both size selective mortality treatments. These changes disappeared in the clock output pathway, resulting in similar transcription profiles of both size-selected lines. The results suggest a switch downstream to the molecular circadian core clockwork, leading to overall similar daily activity patterns across selection lines. Our experimental harvest left an evolutionary legacy in collective risktaking behavior and relatedly in the circadian system, both at behavioral and molecular levels. Changes to risk-sensitive behavior of exploited organisms can have far-reaching consequences for how space and time is used and may also affect catchability and natural predation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

TI  - Diverse Early Life-History Strategies in Migratory Amazonian Catfish: Implications for Conservation and Management
AU  - Hegg, Jens C.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Animal migrations provide important ecological functions and can allow for increased biodiversity through habitat and niche diversification. However, aquatic migrations in general, and those of the world’s largest fish in particular, are imperiled worldwide and are often poorly understood. Several species of large Amazonian catfish carry out some of the longest freshwater fish migrations in the world, travelling from the Amazon River estuary to the Andes foothills. These species are important apex predators in the main stem rivers of the Amazon Basin and make up the regions largest fishery. They are also the only species to utilize the entire Amazon Basin to complete their life cycle. Studies indicate both that the fisheries may be declining due to overfishing, and that the proposed and completed dams in their upstream range threaten spawning migrations. Despite this, surprisingly little is known about the details of these species’ migrations, or their life history. Otolith microchemistry has been an effective method for quantifying and reconstructing fish migrations worldwide across multiple spatial scales and may provide a powerful tool to understand the movements of Amazonian migratory catfish. Our objective was to describe the migratory behaviors of the three most populous and commercially important migratory catfish species, Dourada (Brachyplatystoma rousseauxii), Piramutaba (Brachyplatystoma vaillantii), and Piraíba (Brachyplatystoma filamentosum). We collected fish from the mouth of the Amazon River and the Central Amazon and used strontium isotope signatures (87Sr/86Sr) recorded in their otoliths to determine the location of early rearing and subsequent. Fish location was determined through discriminant function classification, using water chemistry data from the literature as a training set. Where water chemistry data was unavailable, we successfully in predicted 87Sr/86Sr isotope values using a regression-based approach that related the geology of the upstream watershed to the Sr isotope ratio. Our results provide the first reported otolith microchemical reconstruction of Brachyplatystoma migratory movements in the Amazon Basin. Our results indicate that juveniles exhibit diverse rearing strategies, rearing in both upstream and estuary environments. This contrasts with the prevailing understanding that juveniles rear in the estuary before migrating upstream; however it is supported by some fisheries data that has indicated the presence of alternate spawning and rearing life-histories. The presence of alternate juvenile rearing strategies may have important implications for conservation and management of the fisheries in the region.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - In environments where females mate multiply, males should adjust their behaviour and physiology in response to the prevailing perceived level of sperm competition. This expectation is well supported by both laboratory and field studies, but we don’t yet know what mechanisms facilitate these plastic responses in natural populations. One way in which males appear to assess sperm competition risk is through encounter rates with conspecific males. Such encounter rates may be driven by the spatial distribution of resources required by male. However, explicit links between resource distribution, male encounter rate, and shifts in behaviour related to sperm competition have not been demonstrated. Here we show that a small increase in the distance of patches of food resources in the laboratory: (a) approximately halves the mean distances between pairs of males; and (b) is associated with an increase in subsequent copulation duration – previously shown to be a reliable indicator of male perception of sperm competition risk – by more than two minutes. Aggregation of resources, operating via increased encounter rate, is a mechanism that can stimulate plastic male sperm competition responses. Because spatial distribution of resources, including those exploited by Drosophila, is variable in nature, this may explain one way in which sperm competition-related plasticity is influenced in wild-living males.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Ecologists are increasingly using technology to improve the quality of data collected on wildlife, particularly for assessing the environmental impacts of human activities. Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS; commonly known as ‘drones’) are widely touted as a cost-effective way to collect high quality wildlife population data, however, the validity of these claims is unclear. Using life-sized seabird colonies containing a known number of replica birds, we show that RPAS-derived data are, on average, between 43% and 96% more accurate than data from the traditional ground-based collection method. We also demonstrate that counts from this remotely sensed imagery can be semi-automated with a high degree of accuracy. The increased accuracy and precision of RPAS-derived wildlife monitoring data provides greater statistical power to detect fine-scale population fluctuations allowing for more informed and proactive ecological management.

AB  - Stilbonematinae are a subfamily of conspicuous marine nematodes, distinguished by a coat of sulphur-oxidizing bacterial ectosymbionts on their cuticle. As most nematodes, the worm hosts have a simple anatomy and few taxonomically informative characters, and this has resulted in numerous taxonomic reassignments and synonymizations. Recent studies using a combination of morphological and molecular traits have helped to improve the taxonomy of Stilbonematinae but also raised questions on the validity of several genera. Here we describe a new circumtropically distributed genus Paralaxus (Stilbonematinae) with three species: Paralaxus cocos sp. nov., P. bermudensis sp. nov. and P. columbae sp. nov.. We used single worm metagenomes to generate host 18S rRNA and cytochrome oxidase I (COI) as well as symbiont 16S rRNA gene sequences. Intriguingly, COI alignments and primer matching analyses suggest that the COI is not suitxable for PCR-based barcoding approaches in Stilbonematinae as the genera have a highly diverse base composition and no conserved primer sites. The phylogenetic analyses of all three gene sets however confirm the morphological assignments and support the erection of the new genus Paralaxus as well as corroborate the status of the other stilbonematine genera. Paralaxus most closely resembles the stilbonematine genus Laxus in overlapping sets of diagnostic features but can be distinguished from Laxus by the morphology of the genus-specific symbiont coat. Our re-analyses of key parameters of the symbiont coat morphology as character for all Stilbonematinae genera show that with amended descriptions, including the coat, highly reliable genus assignments can be obtained.

AB  - Variation in susceptibility is ubiquitous in multi-host, multi-parasite assemblages, and can have profound implications for ecology and evolution. The extent to which susceptibility is phylogenetically conserved among hosts is poorly understood and has rarely been appropriately tested. We screened for haemosporidian parasites in 3983 birds representing 40 families and 523 species, spanning ~4500 meters elevation in the tropical Andes. To quantify the influence of host phylogeny on infection status, we applied Bayesian phylogenetic multilevel models that included a suite of environmental, spatial, temporal, life history, and ecological predictors. We found evidence of deeply-conserved susceptibility across the avian tree; host phylogeny explained substantial variation in infection rate, and results were robust to phylogenetic uncertainty. Our study suggests that susceptibility is governed, in part, by conserved, latent aspects of anti-parasite defense. This demonstrates the importance of deep phylogeny for understanding the outcomes of present-day ecological interactions.Statement of authorship LNB, SMM, NM, and CCW designed the study; SMM, SCG, HLL, HS, TV, JDW, and CCW collected the data; LNB and NM analyzed the data; LNB, NM, and CCW wrote the paper with input from all authors.Data accessibility statement Specimen information is available from the Arctos database (arctosdb.org) and in supplementary tables (Appendix S1).

AB  - The Andean uplift is one of the major orographic events in the New World and has impacted considerably the diversification of numerous Neotropical organisms. Despite its importance for biogeography, the specific role of mountain ranges as a dispersal barrier between South and Central American lowland plant lineages is still poorly understood. The swan orchids (Cycnoches) comprise ca 34 epiphytic species distributed in lowland and pre-montane forests of Central and South America. Here, we study the historical biogeography of Cycnoches to better understand the impact of the Andean uplift on the diversification of Neotropical lowland plant lineages. Using novel molecular sequences (five nuclear and plastid regions) and twelve biogeographic models with and without founder-event speciation, we infer that the most recent common ancestor of Cycnoches may have originated in Amazonia ca 5 Mya. The first colonization of Central America occurred from a direct migration event from Amazonia, and multiple bidirectional trans-Andean migrations between Amazonia and Central America took place subsequently. Notably, such biological exchange occurred well after major mountain building periods. The Andes have not acted as an impassable barrier for epiphytic lowland lineages such as orchids having a great potential for effortless dispersal because of the very light, anemochorous seeds.

AB  - In response to noxious stimuli, planarians cease their typical ciliary gliding and exhibit an oscillatory type of locomotion called scrunching. We have previously characterized the biomechanics of scrunching and shown that it is induced by specific stimuli, such as amputation, noxious heat, and extreme pH. Because these specific inducers are known to activate Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels in other systems, we hypothesized that TRP channels control scrunching. We found that chemicals known to activate TRPA1 (allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) and hydrogen peroxide) and TRPV (capsaicin and anandamide) in other systems induce scrunching in the planarian species Dugesia japonica and, except for anandamide, in Schmidtea mediterranea. To confirm that these responses were specific to either TRPA1 or TRPV, respectively, we tried to block scrunching using selective TRPA1 or TRPV antagonists and RNA interference (RNAi) mediated knockdown. Unexpectedly, co-treatment with a mammalian TRPA1 antagonist, HC-030031, enhanced AITC-induced scrunching by decreasing the latency time, suggesting an agonistic relationship in planarians. We further confirmed that TRPA1 in both species is necessary for AITC-induced scrunching using RNAi. Conversely, while co-treatment of a mammalian TRPV antagonist, SB-366791, also enhanced capsaicin-induced reactions in D. japonica, combined knockdown of two previously identified D. japonica TRPV genes (DjTRPVa and DjTRPVb) did not inhibit capsaicin-induced scrunching. Surprisingly, RNAi of either DjTRPAa or DjTRPVa/DjTRPVb disrupted scrunching induced by the endocannabinoid and TRPV agonist, anandamide. Overall, our results show that although scrunching induction can involve different initial pathways for sensing stimuli, this behavior’s signature dynamical features are independent of the inducer, implying that scrunching is a stereotypical planarian escape behavior in response to various noxious stimuli that converge on a single downstream pathway. Understanding which aspects of nociception are conserved or not across different organisms can provide insight into the underlying regulatory mechanisms to better understand pain sensation.

AB  - Coral cover on tropical reefs has declined during the last three decades due to the combined effects of climate change, destructive fishing, pollution, and land use change. Drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions combined with effective coastal management and conservation strategies are essential to slow this decline. Innovative approaches, such as selective breeding for adaptive traits combined with large-scale sexual propagation, are being developed with the aim of pre-adapting reefs to increased ocean warming. However, there are still major gaps in our understanding of the technical and methodological constraints to producing corals for such restoration interventions. Here we propose a framework for selectively breeding corals and rearing them from eggs to 2.5-year old colonies using the coral Acropora digitifera as a model species. We present methods for choosing colonies for selective crossing, enhancing early survivorship in ex situ and in situ nurseries, and outplanting and monitoring colonies on natal reefs. We used a short-term (7-day) temperature stress assay to select parental colonies based on heat tolerance of excised branches. From six parental colonies, we produced 12 distinct crosses, and compared survivorship and growth of colonies transferred to in situ nurseries or outplanted to the reef at different ages. We demonstrate that selectively breeding and rearing coral colonies is technically feasible at small scales and could be upscaled as part of restorative assisted evolution initiatives. Nonetheless, there are still challenges to overcome before selective breeding can be implemented as a viable conservation tool, especially at the post-settlement and outplanting phases. Although interdisciplinary approaches will be needed to overcome many of the challenges identified in this study, selective breeding has the potential to be a viable tool within reef managers’ toolbox to support the persistence of selected reefs in the face of climate change.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Chronobiological research has seen a continuous development of novel approaches and techniques to measure rhythmicity at different levels of biological organization from locomotor activity (e.g. migratory restlessness) to physiology (e.g. temperature and hormone rhythms, and relatively recently also in genes, proteins and metabolites). However, the methodological advancements in this field have been mostly and sometimes exclusively used only in indoor laboratory settings. In parallel, there has been an unprecedented and rapid improvement in our ability to track animals and their behaviour in the wild. However, while the spatial analysis of tracking data is widespread, its temporal aspect is largely unexplored. Here, we review the tools that are available or have potential to record rhythms in the wild animals with emphasis on currently overlooked approaches and monitoring systems. We then demonstrate, in three question-driven case studies, how the integration of traditional and newer approaches can help answer novel chronobiological questions in free-living animals. Finally, we highlight unresolved issues in field chronobiology that may benefit from technological development in the future. As most of the studies in the field are descriptive, the future challenge lies in applying the diverse technologies to experimental set-ups in the wild.

AB  - Invasions of leaf beetles are of great ecological and economic significance, but poorly studied. The rate of these invasions in Europe is dramatically increasing. Some established species spread quickly occupying almost the whole continent within several decades. We present the first inventory of alien leaf beetles of European Russia. For each species the map of distribution is provided and the history of invasion in the world is discussed. Two species native to Mediterranean Region: Chrysolina americana (pest of Rosmarinus and Lavandula) and Leptomona erythrocephala feeding on Lotus corniculatus are recorded in European Russia for the first time. A polyphagous pest of floriculture Luperomorpha xanthodera native to China and Korea and pest of soybeans Medythia nigrobilineata native to East Asia were recorded in 2016. A pest of tobacco Epitrix hirtipennis native to North America was recorded in 2013. A pest of corn Diabrotica virgifera was intercepted at the border of Russia in 2011, but is not established. Three alien species were recorded in the 20th century: Zygogramma suturalis introduced from North America for control of Ambrosia, Phyllotreta reitteri native to Afghanistan and Tajikistan and feeding on Lepidium latifolium, and the Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata. The Black Sea region is more prone to leaf beetle invasions than other regions of European Russia. Leaf beetles usually occur only on alien or cultivated plants. Some species feed on native plants in native communities. So it is difficult to distinguish species established before the 20th century from native ones.

AB  - Disentangling the contemporary and historical factors underlying the spatial distributions of species is a central goal of biogeography. For species with broad distributions but little capacity to actively disperse, disconnected geographic distributions highlight the potential influence of passive, long-distance dispersal (LDD) on their evolutionary histories. However, dispersal alone cannot completely account for the biogeography of any species, and other factors–e.g., habitat suitability, life history–must also be considered. North American ice worms (Mesenchytraeus solifugus) are ice-obligate annelids that inhabit coastal glaciers from Oregon to Alaska. Previous studies identified a complex biogeographic history for ice worms, with evidence for genetic isolation, unexpectedly close relationships among geographically disjunct lineages, and contemporary migration across large (&gt; 1,500 km) areas of unsuitable habitat. In this study, we analyzed genome-scale sequence data for most of the known ice worm range. We found clear support for divergence between populations along the Pacific Coast and the inland flanks of the Coast Mountains (mean FST = 0.60), likely precipitated by episodic ice sheet expansion and contraction during the Pleistocene. We also found support for LDD of ice worms from Alaska to Vancouver Island, perhaps mediated by migrating birds. Our results highlight the power of genomic data for disentangling complex biogeographic patterns, including the presence of LDD.

AB  - Summary statement This study describes for the first time long-lasting behavioral effects of hypoxia on a tropical fish, the white grunt (Haemulon plumieri) from Puerto Rico.Anthropogenic activities and climate change have resulted in an increase in hypoxia in nearshore ecosystems worldwide. The San Juan Bay Estuary System in Puerto Rico is one such ecosystem that has undergone an increase in hypoxic events over the past few years. We collected white grunts (Haemulon plumieri) from one of the estuary lagoons to study the effects of hypoxia on fast startle responses (fast-starts). We hypothesized that exposure to hypoxia would significantly decrease the frequency of fast-starts evoked by an abrupt sound stimulus. After an exposure to an oxygen concentration of 2.5 mg L-1 (40% of air saturation), there is a significant reduction in the frequency of fast-starts that is maintained for at least 24 h after the exposure. Exposure to a random sequence of oxygen levels of 5.0, 4.3 and 3.7 mg L-1 (80, 70, and 60% of air saturation) did not show a significant effect until one hour after exposure. We speculate that the lasting effect of hypoxia on fast-starts, thought to be involved in escape, will result in a greater susceptibility of the white grunt to predation. We have identified the Mauthner cell, known to initiate fast-starts, to allow future studies on how low oxygen levels impact a single cell and its circuit, the behavior it initiates and ultimately how changes in the behavior affect population and ecosystem levels.List of Symbols and AbbreviationsASR-Aquatic surface respirationDODissolved OxygenM-cell-Mauthner CellNEP -Environmental Protection Agency National Estuary ProgramSJBE-San Juan Bay EstuarySJBEP-San Juan Bay Estuary Program

AB  - Recently, molecular studies have uncovered significant cryptic diversity in the Mexican Highlands, leading to the description of many new endemic species. DNA approaches to this kind of species discovery have included both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing and multilocus genomic methods. While these marker types have often been pitted against one another, there are benefits to deploying them together, as linked mtDNA data can provide the bridge between uncovering lineages through rigorous multilocus genomic analysis and identifying lineages through comparison to existing mtDNA databases. Here, we apply one class of multilocus genomic marker, ultraconserved elements (UCEs), and linked mtDNA data to a species complex of frogs (Sarcohyla bistincta) found in the Mexican Highlands. We generated data from 1,891 UCEs, which contained 1,742 informative SNPs for S. bistincta and closely related species and captured mitochondrial genomes for most samples. Genetic analyses based on both whole loci and SNPs agree there are numerous distinct and divergent lineages within S. bistincta. The SNP-based species tree provides the most conservative estimate of 8 well-supported lineages in three major clades. Having linked mtDNA data allowed us to tap into the large number of mtDNA sequences available on GenBank and identify one of these lineages as an already-described species, S. pentheter. One identified clade (containing 2 of the 8 lineages) was 10% divergent in mtDNA and paraphyletic with other S. bistincta, making this clade a clear candidate for species status. Phylogenies from UCEs and mtDNA mostly agreed in their topologies, but differed in that mtDNA suggested a more complex evolutionary history perhaps influenced by gene flow between some neighboring lineages. Our study demonstrates that the Mexican Highlands still hold substantial undescribed diversity. Combining multilocus genomic data with linked mtDNA data is a useful approach for identifying potential new species and associating them with already described taxa, which is especially important in groups with undescribed subadult phenotypes, where geographic ranges are unclear, or where phenotypes are conserved.UCEsultraconserved elementsSNPssingle nucleotide polymorphismsmtDNAmitochondrial DNAbpbase pairsMLmaximum-likelihoodUMMZUniversity of Michigan Museum of ZoologyRAD locirestriction digest-associated loci

AB  - Behavioral isolation is a potent barrier to gene flow and a source of striking diversity in the animal kingdom. However, it remains unclear if the linkage disequilibrium (LD) between sex-specific traits required for behavioral isolation results mostly from physical linkage between signal and preference loci or from directional mate preferences. Here, we test this in the field crickets Gryllus rubens and G. texensis. These closely related species diverged with gene flow and have strongly diverged songs and preference functions for the mate calling song rhythm. We map quantitative trait loci for signal and preference traits (pQTL) as well as for gene expression associated with these traits (eQTL). We find strong, positive genetic covariance between song traits and between song and preference. Our results show that this is in part explained by incomplete physical linkage: although both linked pQTL and eQTL couple male and female traits, major effect loci for different traits were never on the same chromosome. We suggest that the finely-tuned, highly divergent preference functions are likely an additional source of LD between male and female traits in this system. Furthermore, pleiotropy of gene expression presents an underappreciated mechanism to link sexually dimorphic phenotypes.

AB  - As a result of ocean warming, the species composition of the Arctic seas has begun to shift in a boreal direction. One ecosystem prone to fauna shifts is the Northeast Greenland shelf. The dispersal route taken by boreal fauna to this area is, however, not known. This knowledge is essential to predict to what extent boreal biota will colonise Arctic habitats. Using population genetics, we show that Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), beaked redfish (Sebastes mentella), and deep-sea shrimp (Pandalus borealis) specimens recently found on the Northeast Greenland shelf originate from the Barents Sea, and suggest that pelagic offspring were dispersed via advection across the Fram Strait. Our results indicate that boreal invasions of Arctic habitats can be driven by advection, and that the fauna of the Barents Sea can project into adjacent habitats with the potential to colonise putatively isolated Arctic ecosystems such as Northeast Greenland.

AB  - Modification of flow regimes and habitat degradation are the strongest, most common, and often co-occurring human activities affecting riverine populations. Ongoing efforts to restore peak flow events found under pristine flow regimes could increase advection-driven dispersal for many species. In rivers with extensive habitat loss, increased advection could transport individuals from remnant populations into degraded downstream areas, causing restored flow regimes to decrease persistence of threatened species. To resolve the capacity for such ‘washout’ effects across imperiled taxa, we evaluate population growth in spatial matrix models of insect, fish, and mollusc taxa experiencing advective dispersal and either long-term habitat loss or temporary disturbances. As a case study to quantify advective dispersal in threatened species, we use intensive mark-recapture methods in a Rio Grande population of the federally endangered unionid mussel Texas horhshell (Popenaias popeii). Among unionids, the most threatened freshwater taxa of North America, we find high levels of annual downstream emigration (16-51%) of adult P. popeii, concomitant with strong immigration from upstream habitats. For different taxa experiencing such advective dispersal during specific life stages, our population model shows that washout effects strongly reduce population recovery under high levels of habitat loss. Averting this negative consequence of restoring hydrology requires simultaneously restoring or protecting long, contiguous stretches of suitable habitats. Across taxa in heavily impacted systems, we suggest integrating hydrodynamic studies and field surveys to detect the presence of advective dispersal and prioritize areas for habitat restoration to enhance population persistence.

AB  - Microbes assemble into complex, dynamic, and species-rich communities that play critical roles in human health and in the environment. The complexity of natural environments and the large number of niches present in most habitats are often invoked to explain the maintenance of microbial diversity in the presence of competitive exclusion. Here we show that soil and plant-associated microbiota, cultivated ex situ in minimal synthetic environments with a single supplied source of carbon, universally re-assemble into large and dynamically stable communities with strikingly predictable coarse-grained taxonomic and functional compositions. We find that generic, non-specific metabolic cross-feeding leads to the assembly of dense facilitation networks that enable the coexistence of multiple competitors for the supplied carbon source. The inclusion of universal and non-specific cross-feeding in ecological consumer-resource models is sufficient to explain our observations, and predicts a simple determinism in community structure, a property reflected in our experiments.

TI  - Annual Cycle Dampening and the Decrease Predictability of Water Level Fluctuations in a Dam-Regulated Neotropical Floodplain
AU  - Zanon, Jaques Everton
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - The flood pulse concept refers to seasonal variations in river water level and is the driving force in river-floodplain systems that ‘responsible for the existence, productivity and interactions’ of these system’s biota. This seasonal variation is inherent to river-floodplain systems and establishes a natural pattern of these ecosystems that has frequently been observed in nature. One particular river-floodplain system of interest is the Upper Parana River and its floodplain, whose upstream contains a reservoir cascade that caused profound alterations on its flooding regime by having diminished flood magnitude, but increased its frequency. In this study, I sought to explore the flood pulse condition in the Upper Paraná River Floodplain by using a set of state-of-the-art spectral and non-linear analyses and a time series of water level fluctuations (1968-2017) from this system. I divided the data into four periods: i) natural regime period, ii) transitional period, iii) dam cascade period, and iv) Primavera’s dam period. Spectral analysis demonstrated a decrease in the annual cycle amplitude, reflected in its power spectrum, which means a weakening in the difference between flood and drought events. Additionally, nonlinear dynamical analysis revealed a less deterministic and predicable behavior leading to more erratic fluctuations jeopardizing the temporal heterogeneity of that system.

AB  - The problem of pattern and scale is a central challenge in ecology. The problem of scale is central to community ecology, where functional ecological groups are aggregated and treated as a unit underlying an ecological pattern, such as aggregation of “nitrogen fixing trees” into a total abundance of a trait underlying ecosystem physiology. With the emergence of massive community ecological datasets, from microbiomes to breeding bird surveys, there is a need to objectively identify the scales of organization pertaining to well-defined patterns in community ecological data.The phylogeny is a scaffold for identifying key phylogenetic scales associated with macroscopic patterns. Phylofactorization was developed to objectively identify phylogenetic scales underlying patterns in relative abundance data. However, many ecological data, such as presence-absences and counts, are not relative abundances, yet it is still desireable and informative to identify phylogenetic scales underlying a pattern of interest. Here, we generalize phylofactorization beyond relative abundances to a graph-partitioning algorithm for any community ecological data.Generalizing phylofactorization connects many tools from data analysis to phylogenetically-informe analysis of community ecological data. Two-sample tests identify three phylogenetic factors of mammalian body mass which arose during the K-Pg extinction event, consistent with other analyses of mammalian body mass evolution. Projection of data onto coordinates defined by the phylogeny yield a phylogenetic principal components analysis which refines our understanding of the major sources of variation in the human gut microbiome. These same coordinates allow generalized additive modeling of microbes in Central Park soils and confirm that a large clade of Acidobacteria thrive in neutral soils. Generalized linear and additive modeling of exponential family random variables can be performed by phylogenetically-constrained reduced-rank regression or stepwise factor contrasts. We finish with a discussion of how phylofac-torization produces an ecological species concept with a phylogenetic constraint. All of these tools can be implemented with a new R package available online.

AB  - Stratified lakes and ponds featuring steep oxygen gradients are significant net sources of greenhouse gases and hotspots in the carbon cycle. Despite their significant biogeochemical roles, the microbial communities, especially in the oxygen depleted compartments, are poorly known. Here, we present a comprehensive dataset including 267 shotgun metagenomes from 41 stratified lakes and ponds mainly located in the boreal and subarctic regions, but also including one tropical reservoir and one temperate lake. For most lakes and ponds, the data includes a vertical sample set spanning from the oxic surface to the anoxic bottom layer. The majority of the samples were collected during the open water period, but also a total of 29 samples were collected from under the ice. In addition to the metagenomic sequences, the dataset includes environmental variables for the samples, such as oxygen, nutrient and organic carbon concentrations. The dataset is ideal for further exploring the microbial taxonomic and functional diversity in freshwater environments and potential climate change impacts on the functioning of these ecosystems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

TI  - A demogenetic individual based model for the evolution of traits and genome architecture under sexual selection
AU  - Chevalier, Louise

AU  - Labonne, Jacques
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Sexual selection has long been known to favor the evolution of mating behaviors such as mate preference and competitiveness, and to affect their genetic architecture, for instance by favoring genetic correlation between some traits. Reciprocally, genetic architecture can affect the expression and the evolvability of traits and mating behaviors. But sexual selection is highly context-dependent, making interactions between individuals a central process in evolution, governing the transmission of genotypes to the next generation. This loop between the genetic structure conditioning the expression and evolution of traits and behaviour, and the feedback of this phenotypic evolution on the architecture of the genome in the dynamic context of sexual selection, has yet to be thoroughly investigated. We argue that demogenetic agent-based models (DG-ABM) are especially suited to tackle such a challenge because they allow explicit modelling of both the genetic architecture of traits and the behavioural interactions in a dynamic population context. We here present a DG-ABM able to simultaneously track individual variation in traits (such as gametic investment, preference, competitiveness), fitness and genetic architecture throughout evolution. Using two simulation experiments, we compare various mating systems and show that behavioral interactions during mating triggered some complex feedback in our model, between fitness, population demography, and genetic architecture, placing interactions between individuals at the core of evolution through sexual selection. DG-ABMs can, therefore, relate to theoretical patterns expected at the population level from simpler analytical models in evolutionary biology, and at the same time provide a more comprehensive framework regarding individual trait and behaviour variation, that is usually envisioned separately from genome architecture in behavioural ecology.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

We observed 1,896 individuals of dusky grouper, Epinephelus marginatus, in Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro, from September 2013 to February 2019. The total weight of the catches was 6,065.57 kg, with an average of 1,442.50 kg/year and a std of 147.30 kg.We integrated fishers in our study through citizen science (CS): individuals were trained to monitor grouper gonads and supplied information on fishing spots and prices. After comparing catch curves (based on weight) and curve prices (in the Brazilian monetary currency of reals), our results showed that catches in the Copacabana fishery have been stable (the results of the Kruskal-Wallis test showed no significant difference for either the weight of the catches or the average prices of dusky groupers in the years compared). Copacabana has been a sustainable fishery when considering its catches of dusky grouper. This is a very important result for conservation and management, considering the importance of small-scale fisheries in terms of their low fishing efforts and their possible effects on vulnerable species, as well as their ecological and economic importance in developing countries. Citizen science, alomng with local ecological knowledge, helps integrate research and fisheries as well as researchers and fishers and allows for larger sampling efforts and management training for fishers.

AB  - In plants, local adaptation across species range is frequent. Yet, much has to be discovered on its environmental drivers, the underlying functional traits and their molecular determinants. Genome scans are popular to uncover outlier loci potentially involved in the genetic architecture of local adaptation, however links between outliers and phenotypic variation are rarely addressed. Here we focused on adaptation of teosinte populations along two elevation gradients in Mexico that display continuous environmental changes at a short geographical scale. We used two common gardens, and phenotyped 18 traits in 1664 plants from 11 populations of annual teosintes. In parallel, we genotyped these plants for 38 microsatellite markers as well as for 171 outlier single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that displayed excess of allele differentiation between pairs of lowland and highland populations and/or correlation with environmental variables. Our results revealed that phenotypic differentiation at 10 out of the 18 traits was driven by local selection. Trait covariation along the elevation gradient indicated that adaptation to altitude results from the assembly of multiple co-adapted traits into a complex syndrome: as elevation increases, plants flower earlier, produce less tillers, display lower stomata density and carry larger, longer and heavier grains. The proportion of outlier SNPs associating with phenotypic variation, however, largely depended on whether we considered a neutral structure with 5 genetic groups (73.7%) or 11 populations (13.5%), indicating that population stratification greatly affected our results. Finally, chromosomal inversions were enriched for both SNPs whose allele frequencies shifted along elevation as well as phenotypically-associated SNPs. Altogether, our results are consistent with the establishment of an altitudinal syndrome promoted by local selective forces in teosinte populations in spite of detectable gene flow. Because elevation mimics climate change through space, SNPs that we found underlying phenotypic variation at adaptive traits may be relevant for future maize breeding.Author summary Across their native range species encounter a diversity of habitats promoting local adaptation of geographically distributed populations. While local adaptation is widespread, much has yet to be discovered about the conditions of its emergence, the targeted traits, their molecular determinants and the underlying ecological drivers. Here we employed a reverse ecology approach, combining phenotypes and genotypes, to mine the determinants of local adaptation of teosinte populations distributed along two steep altitudinal gradients in Mexico. Evaluation of 11 populations in two common gardens located at mid-elevation pointed to adaptation via an altitudinal multivariate syndrome, in spite of gene flow. We scanned genomes to identify loci with allele frequency shifts along elevation, a subset of which associated to trait variation. Because elevation mimics climate change through space, these polymorphisms may be relevant for future maize breeding.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - A primary goal of biogeography is to understand how large-scale environmental processes, like climate change, affect diversification One often-invoked but seldom tested process is the “species-pump” model, in which repeated bouts of co-speciation are driven by oscillating climate-induced habitat connectivity cycles. For example, over the past three million years, the landscape of the Philippine Islands has repeatedly coalesced and fragmented due to sea-level changes associated with glacial cycles. This repeated climate-driven vicariance has been proposed as a model of speciation across evolutionary lineages codistributed throughout the islands. This model predicts speciation times that are temporally clustered around the times when interglacial rises in sea level fragmented the islands. To test this prediction, we collected comparative genomic data from 16 pairs of insular gecko populations. We analyze these data in a full-likelihood, Bayesian model-choice framework to test for shared divergence times among the pairs. Our results provide support against the species-pump model prediction in favor of an alternative interpretation, namely that each pair of gecko populations diverged independently. These results suggest the repeated bouts of climate-driven landscape fragmentation has not been an important mechanism of speciation for gekkonid lizards on the Philippine Islands.

AB  - Comparative genomics of fungal mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) have revealed a remarkable pattern of rearrangement between and within major phyla owing to horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and recombination. The role of recombination was exemplified at a finer evolutionary time scale in basidiomycetes group of fungi as they display a diversity of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) inheritance patterns. Here, we assembled mitogenomes of six species from the Hymenochaetales order of basidiomycetes and examined 59 mitogenomes from two genetic lineages of Pyrrhoderma noxium. Gene order is largely colinear while intergene regions are major determinants of mitogenome size variation. Substantial sequence divergence was found in shared introns consistent with high HGT frequency observed in yeasts, but we also identified a rare case where an intron was retained in five species since speciation. In contrast to the hyperdiversity observed in nuclear genomes of P. noxium, mitogenomes’ intraspecific polymorphisms at protein coding sequences are extremely low. Phylogeny based on introns revealed turnover as well as exchange of introns between two lineages. Strikingly, some strains harbor a mosaic origin of introns from both lineages. Analysis of intergenic sequence indicated substantial differences between and within lineages, and an expansion may be ongoing as a result of exchange between distal intergenes. These findings suggest that the evolution in mtDNAs is usually lineage specific but chimeric mitotypes are frequently observed, thus capturing the possible evolutionary processes shaping mitogenomes in a basidiomycete. The large mitogenome sizes reported in various basidiomycetes appear to be a result of interspecific reshuffling of intergenes.

AB  - Multidimensional fitness landscapes provide insights into the molecular basis of laboratory and natural evolution. Yet such efforts are rare and focus only on limited protein families and a single enzyme trait, with little concern about the relationship between protein epistasis and conformational dynamics. Here, we report the first multiparametric fitness landscape for a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that was engineered for the regio- and stereoselective hydroxylation of a steroid. We developed a computational program to automatically quantify non-additive effects among all possible mutational pathways, finding pervasive cooperative sign and magnitude epistasis on multiple catalytic traits. By using quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that these effects are modulated by long-range interactions in loops, helices and beta-strands that gate the substrate access channel allowing for optimal catalysis. Our work highlights the importance of conformational dynamics on epistasis in an enzyme involved in secondary metabolism and offers lessons for engineering P450s.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Species interactions in food webs are usually recognized as dynamic, varying across species, space and time due to biotic and abiotic drivers. Yet food webs also show emergent properties that appear consistent, such as a skewed frequency distribution of interaction strengths (many weak, few strong). Reconciling these two properties requires an understanding of the variation in pairwise interaction strengths and its underlying mechanisms. We estimated stream sculpin feeding rates in three seasons at nine sites in Oregon to examine variation in trophic interaction strengths both across and within predator-prey pairs. We considered predator and prey densities, prey body mass, and abiotic factors as putative drivers of within-pair variation over space and time. We hypothesized that consistently skewed interaction strength distributions could result if individual interaction strengths show relatively little variation, or alternatively, if interaction strengths vary but shift in ways that conserve their overall frequency distribution. We show that feeding rate distributions remained consistently and positively skewed across all sites and seasons. The mean coefficient of variation in feeding rates within each of 25 focal species pairs across surveys was less than half the mean coefficient of variation seen across species pairs within a given survey. The rank order of feeding rates also remained relatively conserved across streams, seasons and individual surveys. On average, feeding rates on each prey taxon nonetheless varied by a hundredfold across surveys, with some feeding rates showing more variation in space and others in time. For most species pairs, feeding rates increased with prey density and decreased with high stream flows and low water temperatures. For nearly half of all species pairs, factors other than prey density explained the most variation, indicating that the strength of density dependence in feeding rates can vary greatly among a generalist predator’s prey species. Our findings show that although individual interaction strengths exhibit considerable variation in space and time, they can nonetheless remain relatively consistent, and thus predictable, compared to the even larger variation that occurs across species pairs. These insights help reconcile how the skewed nature of interaction strength distributions can persist in highly dynamic food webs.

AB  - Natural and anthropogenic disturbances commonly alter patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. However, how food webs respond to these changes remains poorly understood. Here, we have described aquatic food webs using invertebrate and fish community composition, functional traits, and stable isotopes from twelve agricultural streams along a landscape disturbance gradient.We predicted that excessive inputs of fine inorganic sediment (sedimentation) associated with agricultural land uses would negatively influence stream trophic diversity (e.g., reduced vertical and horizontal trophic niche breadths).Food-web properties based on Bayesian analyses of stable isotope data (δ13C and δ15N) from consumers showed that increasing sediment disturbance was associated with reduced trophic diversity, indicated by the whole community (fish and invertebrates combined) occupying a smaller area in isotopic niche space. Reductions in trophic diversity were best explained by a narrowing of the consumer δ13C range, and to a lesser extent, consumer δ15N range along the sedimentation gradient.We hypothesized that multiple mechanisms associated with sedimentation may have caused trophic niche ‘compression’. Decreased niche partitioning, driven by increasing habitat homogeneity, environmental filtering, and resource scarcity seemingly lead to a greater similarity in trophic roles. These pathways may have contributed to a reduction in trophic diversity, whereas increased resource homogeneity was seemingly less important.Our results also indicate downward shifts in the vertical trophic position of benthic meospredators and invertebrate prey relative to higher consumers. This ‘trophic decoupling’ suggests that terrestrial resource subsidies may offset reductions of aquatic prey for larger stream fishes.Sedimentation was associated with reduced trophic diversity, which may affect the functioning and stability of stream ecosystems. Our study helps explain how multiple mechanisms can influence food-web properties in response to this type of disturbance.

AB  - The relative influence of deterministic niche-based (i.e. abiotic conditions, biotic interactions) and stochastic-distance dependent neutral processes (i.e. demography, dispersal) in shaping communities has been extensively studied for various organisms, but is far less explored jointly across the tree of life, in particular in soil environments. Here, using a thorough DNA-based census of the whole soil biota in a large tropical forest plot, we show that soil aluminium, topography, and plant species identity are all important drivers of soil richness and community composition. Body size emerges as an important feature of the comparative ecology of the different taxa at the studied spatial scale, with microorganisms being more importantly controlled by environmental factors, while soil mesofauna rather display random spatial distribution. We infer that niche-based processes contribute differently to community assembly across trophic levels due to spatial scaling. Body size could hence help better quantifying important properties of multitrophic assemblages.

AB  - Aim Employ phylogeographic analyses of a widespread species complex to examine the role of historical and evolutionary processes in the origin and maintenance of high species diversity in the Neotropical montane region.Location Neotropical highlands.Taxon Henicorhina wood-wrens (Aves, Troglodytidae).Methods We collected mtDNA sequence data for 288 individuals thoroughly covering the range of the Henicorhina leucophrys complex from Mexico to Bolivia. Sequences were employed to characterize population structure, infer phylogenetic relationships among populations and their divergence times, examine lineage accumulation through time, and identify presumptive species using coalescent methods. We also explored the origin of elevational and latitudinal replacements involved in spatial changes in species assemblages in the Andes.Results We found remarkable genetic structure within the complex, which consists of numerous lineages reaching &gt;12% sequence divergence; most divergent populations occur in areas separated by topographic barriers but several of them, typically not sister to each other, co-occur with elevational segregation on mountain slopes or replace each other with latitude along the Andes. Some close relatives occur in areas separated by thousands of kilometers, with more distant relatives occupying intervening areas. The complex likely originated in the Mexican highlands and expanded extensively in South America while diverging rapidly at a constant rate into many different lineages which have persisted for millions of years. Coalescent analyses consistently revealed that the complex may comprise more than 30 species; while we do not suggest these presumptive species should be recognized by taxonomists in the absence of additional data, H. leucophrys is a distant outlier among New World birds in terms of high lineage diversity within a single recognized species.Main Conclusions Our study captured wood-wren lineages in the act of building up diversity via divergence and persistence in allopatry, achievement of secondary sympatry, and coexistence at the landscape scale mediated by ecological and evolutionary divergence. Although dispersal by wood-wrens is restricted at present and this likely accounts for strong population structure across topographic barriers, their ranges have been dynamic, managing to disperse over much of the montane Neotropics. Phases of expansion and contraction of ranges and localized extinctions of populations likely account for phylogeographic patterns which are precursors to the origin of new species and the accumulation of diversity in tropical mountains.

AB  - Understanding the consequences of habitat fragmentation to biological populations is crucial to develop sound conservation polices. The Straight-billed Reedhaunter (Limnoctites rectirostris) is a little known and threatened Passeriform that is highly dependent Erygo wetlands patches. Here, we evaluated the effects of habitat fragmentation on populations of the Straight-billed Reedhaunter, during the construction of a water reservoir in southern Brazil. During eight months, we monitored five Eryngo wetlands patches occupied (n=3) and no occupied (n=2) by Straight-billed Reedhaunter individuals, collecting data on their temporal occupancy patterns and registering new fragmentation events in formally continuous habitat patches. We evaluated the consequences of habitat fragmentation on the probabilities of patch occupancy, colonization and extinction of populations of the Straight-billed Reedhaunter using an information-theoretic approach. Out of the three patches occupied by Straight-billed Reedhaunter, two were not altered by construction activities and their populations were present during the entire study period. After fragmentation events, local extinction in one of the wetland patches was observed, and individuals were sporadically observed in two other initially unoccupied sites. The model in which fragmentation affected only the extinction probability was the most plausible among the set of candidate models. Fragmentation greatly increased the chance of local population extinction within patches. Our results indicate that the conservation of populations of the Straight-billed Reedhaunter is highly dependent on continuous and unaltered wetland patches.

AB  - Almost all animals and plants are inhabited by diverse communities of microorganisms, the microbiota, thereby forming an integrated entity, the metaorganism. Natural selection should favor hosts that shape the community composition of these microbes to promote a beneficial host-microbe symbiosis. Indeed, animal hosts often pose selective environments, which only a subset of the environmentally available microbes are able to colonize. How these microbes assemble after colonization to form the complex microbiota is less clear. Neutral models are based on the assumption that the alternatives in microbiota community composition are selectively equivalent and thus entirely shaped by random population dynamics and dispersal. Here, we use the neutral model as a null hypothesis to assess microbiata composition in host organisms, which does not rely on invoking any adaptive processes underlying microbial community assembly. We show that the overall microbiota community structure from a wide range of host organisms, in particular including previously understudied invertebrates, is in many cases consistent with neutral expectations. Our approach allows to identify individual microbes that are deviating from the neutral expectation and which are therefore interesting candidates for further study. Moreover, using simulated communities we demonstrate that transient community states may play a role in the deviations from the neutral expectation. Our findings highlight that the consideration of neutral processes and temporal changes in community composition are critical for an in-depth understanding of microbiota-host interactions.

AB  - Large vertebrates are extremely sensitive to anthropogenic pressure, and their populations are declining fast. The white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum) is a paradigmatic case: this African megaherbivore suffered a remarkable population reduction in the last 150 years due to human activities. The two white rhinoceros subspecies, the northern (NWR) and the southern white rhinoceros (SWR), however, underwent opposite fates: the NWR vanished quickly after the onset of the decline, while the SWR recovered after a severe bottleneck. Such demographic events are predicted to have an erosive effect at the genomic level, in connection with the extirpation of diversity, and increased genetic drift and inbreeding. However there is currently little empirical data available that allows us to directly reconstruct the subtleties of such processes in light of distinct demographic histories. Therefore to assess these effects, we generated a whole-genome, temporal dataset consisting of 52 re-sequenced white rhinoceros genomes, that represents both subspecies at two time windows: before and during/after the bottleneck. Our data not only reveals previously unknown population substructure within both subspecies, but allowed us to quantify the genomic erosion undergone by both, with post-bottleneck white rhinoceroses harbouring significantly fewer heterozygous sites, and showing higher inbreeding coefficients than pre-bottleneck individuals. Moreover, the effective population size suffered a decrease of two and three orders of magnitude in the NWR and SWR respectively, due to the recent bottleneck. Our data therefore provides much needed empirical support for theoretical predictions about the genomic consequences of shrinking populations, information that is relevant for understanding the process of population extinction. Furthermore, our findings have the potential to inform management approaches for the conservation of the remaining white rhinoceroses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Although natural and anthropogenic influences affect freshwater ecosystems globally at unprecedented levels, the effects of co-occurring physico-chemical stress on zooplankton phenotypic plasticity under extreme conditions remain understudied.We exposed a laboratory-raised clonal population of Daphnia magna to different stress levels of acidity and salinity undergoing complete constant light over 30 days. Overall, population size and age structure at day 10 considerably differed between specific stress contexts. All populations expanded compared to the starting population on day 1. On day 30, overall, population size increased but showed significant differences between treatment groups. Surprisingly, Daphnia performed better under combined stress of salinity and acidity than under acidity alone as the extra salinity in the medium may have counterbalanced sodium loss caused by lower pH. Our results reveal a considerable degree of differential reproductive and ontogenetic plasticity in response to combined stressors under disrupted photoperiod. Exposure to constant light led to increased population size, which may be a result of supercharged ion regulation that enables zooplankton to survive better under specific levels of extreme environmental change and adverse chemical stress. Our findings merit further molecular investigation of phenotypic plasticity of the congeners across severe combined stress conditions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Dispersal is a critical process for the persistence and productivity of marine populations. For many reef species, there is increasing evidence that local demography and self-recruitment have major consequences on their genetic diversity and adaptation to environmental change. Yet empirical data of dispersal patterns in reef-building species remain scarce. Here, we document the first genetic estimates of local dispersal and self-recruitment in a broadcasting reef-builder, the hydrocoral Millepora platyphylla. Using microsatellite markers, we gathered genotypic information from 3160 georeferenced colonies collected over 9000 m2 of reef in three adjacent habitats in Moorea, French Polynesia; the mid slope, upper slope and back reef. Our parentage analysis revealed a predominance of self-recruitment with 58% of sexual propagules produced locally. Sexual propagules often settled at less than 10 meters from their parents and dispersal events decrease with increasing geographic distance. Limited dispersal among adjacent habitats via cross-reef transport was also detected. Sibship analysis showed that both full and half siblings recruit together on the reef, resulting in sibling aggregations. The identification of local families revealed discrepancies between dispersal patterns of sexual and asexual propagules. Self-recruits are dispersed with along-reef currents and settled in alignment with the location of their parents, while the dispersal of asexual fragments is heavily influenced by wave-driven cross-reef currents. Our findings highlight the importance of self-recruitment together with clonality in stabilising population dynamics, as it can enhance local sustainability and resilience to disturbance, but also raise uncertainties on the widely accepted high dispersal ability of broadcasting reef species.

AB  - Supplementary feeding of garden birds has benefits for both bird populations and human wellbeing. Birds have excellent colour vision, and show preferences for food items of particular colours, but research into colour preferences associated with artificial feeders is limited to hummingbirds. Here, we investigated the colour preferences of common UK garden birds foraging at seed-dispensing artificial feeders containing identical food. We presented birds simultaneously with an array of eight differently coloured feeders, and recorded the number of visits made to each colour over 370 30-minute observation periods in the winter of 2014/15. In addition, we surveyed visitors to a garden centre and science festival to determine the colour preferences of likely purchasers of seed feeders. Our results suggest that silver and green feeders were visited by higher numbers of individuals of several common garden bird species, while red and yellow feeders received fewer visits. In contrast, people preferred red, yellow, blue and green feeders.

AB  - Background Gut microbiomes can vary across development, a pattern often found for insects with complete metamorphosis. With varying nutritional need and distinct opportunities for microbial acquisition, questions arise as to how such ‘holometabolous’ insects retain helpful microbes at larval and adult stages. Ants are an intriguing system for such study. In a number of lineages adults digest only liquid food sources, while larvae digest solid foods. Like some other social insects, workers and soldiers of some ant species engage in oral-anal trophallaxes, enabling microbial transfer among siblings. But do queens, the typical colony founding caste, obtain symbionts through such transfer? Does this enable transgenerational symbiont passage? And does the resulting partner fidelity promote the evolution of beneficial symbionts? Furthermore, how might such adult-centric biology shape larval microbiomes? To address these questions, we characterized symbiotic gut bacteria across 13 species of Cephalotes turtle ants, with up to 40-million years of divergence. Adding to the prior focus on workers we, here, study underexplored castes and stages including queens, soldiers, and larvae, by performing 16S rRNA qPCR, amplicon sequencing, and phylogenetic classification.Results We show that adult microbiomes are conserved across species and largely across castes. Nearly 95% of the bacteria in adults have, thus far, been found only in Cephalotes ants. Furthermore, the microbiomes from most adults exhibit phylosymbiosis, a trend in which microbiome community similarity recapitulates patterns of host relatedness. Additionally, an abundant, adult-enriched symbiont cospeciates with some Cephalotes. Evidence here suggests that these partner fidelity patterns extend from transgenerational symbiont transfer through alate gyne dispersal and subsequent colony-founding by queens. Like adults, larvae of Cephalotes species exhibit strong microbiome conservation. Phylosymbiosis patterns are weaker, however, with further evidence elevating environmental filtering as a primary mechanism behind such conservation. Specifically, while adult-enriched symbionts are found in most larvae, symbionts of older larvae are highly related to free-living bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae, Lactobacillales, and Actinobacteria.Conclusions Our findings suggest that both partner fidelity and conserved environmental filtering drive stable, stage-specific, social insect symbioses. We discuss the implications for our broader understanding of insect microbiomes, and the means of sustaining a beneficial microbiome.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Survival rates vary dramatically among species and predictably across latitudes, but causes of this variation are unclear. The rate of living hypothesis posits that physiological damage from metabolism causes species with faster metabolic rates to exhibit lower survival rates. However, whether increased survival commonly observed in tropical and south temperate latitudes is associated with slower metabolic rate remains unclear. We compared metabolic rates and annual survival rates across 46 species that we measured, and 147 species from literature data across northern, southern, and tropical latitudes. High metabolic rates were associated with lower survival but latitude had substantial direct effects on survival independent of metabolism. The inability of metabolic rate to explain latitudinal variation in survival suggests 1) that species may evolve physiological mechanisms that mitigate physiological damage from cellular metabolism, and 2) a larger role of extrinsic environmental, rather than intrinsic metabolic, causes of latitudinal differences in mortality.

AB  - Aim This paper aims to inform our knowledge of common baby’s breath’s (Gypsophila paniculata) current population structure and invasion status using a combination of contemporary genetic methods and historical herbarium data.Taxon Gypsophila paniculata (Angiosperms: Eudicot, Caryophyllaceae)Location Samples were collected from seven locations spanning a portion of the plant’s North American range: Washington, North Dakota, Minnesota, and Michigan, United States.Methods To analyze contemporary population structure, individuals of G. paniculata from 7 distinct sampling locations were collected and genotyped at 14 microsatellite loci. Population structure was inferred using both Bayesian and multivariate methods. To investigate G. paniculata’s invasion status, public herbarium databases were searched for mention of the species. Records were combined, resulting in a database of 307 herbarium collections dating from the late 1800’s to current day. Using this database, invasion curves were created at different geospatial scales.Results Results of genetic analyses suggest the presence of at least two genetic clusters spanning our seven sampling locations. Sampling locations in Washington, North Dakota, Minnesota, and northwestern Michigan form one genetic cluster, distinct from our two more southern sampling locations in Michigan, which form a second cluster with increased relative genetic diversity. Invasion curves created for these two clusters show different time periods of invasion. An invasion curve created for North America suggests G. paniculata’s range may still be expanding.Main conclusions Gypsophila paniculata has likely undergone at least two distinct invasions in North America, and its range may still be expanding. Restricted genetic diversity seen across a wide geographic area could be a signature of limited seed distributors present during the early period of this garden ornamental’s invasion.

AB  - The relative role of hybridization, de novo evolution, and standing variation in weed adaptation to agricultural environments is largely unknown. In Amaranthus tuberculatus, a widespread North American agricultural weed, adaptation is likely influenced by recent secondary contact and admixture of two previously isolated subspecies. We characterized the extent of adaptation and phenotypic differentiation accompanying the spread of A. tuberculatus into agricultural environments and the contribution of subspecies divergence. We generated phenotypic and whole-genome sequence data from a manipulative common garden experiment, using paired samples from natural and agricultural populations. We found strong latitudinal, longitudinal, and sex differentiation in phenotypes, and subtle differences among agricultural and natural environments that were further resolved with ancestry inference. The transition into agricultural environments has favoured southwestern var. rudis ancestry that leads to higher biomass and environment-specific phenotypes: increased biomass and earlier flowering under reduced water availability, and reduced plasticity in fitness-related traits. We also detected de novo adaptation to agricultural habitats independent of ancestry effects, including marginally higher biomass and later flowering in agricultural populations, and a time to germination home advantage. Therefore, the invasion of A. tuberculatus into agricultural environments has drawn on adaptive variation across multiple timescales—through both preadaptation via the preferential sorting of var. rudis ancestry and de novo local adaptation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

To understand the position of A. carishina in the morphospace occupied by large Anoura, we conducted a Principal Component Analysis on 12 craniodental and 11 external variables. We complement our results with further analysis of traits thought to be diagnostic for these species, including 1) an elliptical Fourier transformation analysis of the shape of the third upper premolar (P4), 2) a comparison of the area of the second (P3) and third (P4) upper premolars, and 3) a comparison of maxillary toothrow angles. We find that A. carishina is morphologically indistinguishable from A. latidens, and that there is broad overlap in morphology between A. latidens and A. geoffroyi. However several characters found in A. latidens are lacking in A. geoffroyi, including a triangular shape to the P4 caused by a medial-internal cusp enclosed by the base of the tooth, a lack of development of the anterobasal cusp in the P3, a smaller braincase, and a shorter rostrum. We reassess the distribution of Anoura latidens in Colombia, adding new records and correcting previously-published records that were misidentified. Overall, our results suggest that a stable taxonomy for the group should consider A. carishina as a junior synonym of A. latidens, and that, although A. latidens is distinguishable from A. geoffroyi, further genetic and taxonomic work is needed in to clarify species limits within the A. geoffroyi species complex.El complejo de especies Anoura geoffroyi se compone de 3 especies, A. geoffroyi, A. peruana, y A. carishina. La descripción de Anoura carishina posee varias inconsistencias, y dado que no se realizó una comparación con A. latidens, realizamos una comparación de los caracteres taxonómicos de ambas especies. Para entender la posición de A. carishina en el morfoespacio ocupado por los Anoura grandes realizamos un Análisis de Componentes Principales usando 12 variables cráneo-dentales y 11 variables externas. Complementamos nuestros resultados con 1) un análisis de transformación elíptica de Fourier de la forma del tercer premolar superior (P4) 2) una comparación del área del segundo (P3) y tercer (P4) premolares superiores y 3) una comparación de los ángulos de las hileras dentales maxilares. Encontramos que A. carishina es morfológicamente indistinguible de A. latidens y que existe una amplio superposición en la morfología de A. latidens y A. geoffroyi. Sin embargo, la forma del P4, una cúspide anterobasal no desarrollada en el P3, y caracteres relacionados con una caja craneana menos inflada y un rostro corto son útiles en distinguir A. latidens de A. geoffroyi. Reevaluamos la distribución de Anoura latidens en Colombia, al agregar nuevos registros y corrigiendo registros previamente publicados que se encontraban mal identificados. En general, nuestros resultados sugieren que una taxonomía estable para el grupo debería considerar a A. carishina como un sinónimo junior de A. latidens, que A. latidens es distinguible de A. geoffroyi utilizando medidas cráneo-dentales y resalta la necesidad de estudios genéticos para esclarecer las relaciones filogenéticas entre A. latidens y el complejo de especies A. geoffroyi.

AB  - Coccidioides posadasii is a pathogenic fungus that causes coccidioidomycosis in many arid regions of the Americas. One of these regions is bordered by the Caribbean Sea, and the surrounding landscape may play an important role in the dispersion of C. posadasii across South America through southeastern Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and Venezuela. Comparative phylogenomic analyses of C. posadasii reveal that clinical strains from Venezuela are genetically distinct from the North American populations found in Arizona (AZ), Texas, Mexico, and the rest of South America (TX/MX/SA). We find evidence for admixture between the Venezuela and the North American populations of C. posadasii in Central America. As expected, the proportion of Venezuelan alleles in the admixed population decreases as latitude (and distance from Venezuela) increases. Our results indicate that the population in Venezuela may have been subjected to a recent bottleneck, and shows strong population structure. This analysis provides insight into potential for Coccidioides spp. to invade new regions.

AB  - We investigate whether inbreeding has particularly fatal consequences for dioecious plants by diminishing their floral attractiveness and the associated pollinator visitation rates disproportionally in females. We also test whether the magnitude of such effects depends on the evolutionary histories of plant populations. We recorded spatial, olfactory, colour and rewarding flower attractiveness traits as well as pollinator visitation rates in experimentally inbred and outbred, male and female Silene latifolia plants from European and North American populations differing in their evolutionary histories. We found that inbreeding specifically impairs spatial and olfactory attractiveness. Our results support that sex-specific selection and gene expression partially magnified these inbreeding costs for females, and that divergent evolutionary histories altered the genetic architecture underlying inbreeding effects across population origins. Moreover, they highlight that inbreeding effects on olfactory attractiveness have a huge potential to disrupt interactions among plants and specialist moth pollinators, which are mediated by elaborate chemical communication.

AB  - Shelf seas provide valuable ecosystem services, but their productivity and ecological functioning depend critically on sunlight transmitted through the water column. Anthropogenic reductions in underwater light availability are thus recognized as a serious threat to coastal habitats. The flux of strongly light-absorbing coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) from land to sea may have increased world-wide, but how this has altered the availability and spectral quality of light in shelf seas remains poorly known. Here, we present time-series data from the Sunda Shelf in Southeast Asia, where the monsoon-driven reversal in ocean currents supplies water enriched in CDOM from tropical peatlands for part of the year, resulting in 5–10-fold seasonal variation in light absorption by CDOM. We show that this terrigenous CDOM can dominate underwater light absorption at wavelengths up to 500 nm, and shift in the underwater irradiance spectrum towards longer wavelengths. The seasonal presence of terrigenous CDOM also causes the depth of 10% light penetration to shoal by 1–5 m, or 10–45%. We further estimate that on average 0.6 m, or 25%, of this terrigenous CDOM-mediated shoaling might be attributable to the enhanced loss of dissolved organic matter caused by peatland disturbance. We show that the seasonal change in the light environment is correlated with photo-acclimation by phytoplankton, and infer that terrigenous CDOM likely contributes to limiting the depth distribution of photosynthetic corals. Our results thus reveal an ecologically important but largely overlooked impact of human modifications to carbon fluxes that is likely becoming increasingly important in coastal seas.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Many species that are extensively studied in the laboratory are less well characterized in their natural habitat, and laboratory strains represent only a small fraction of the variation in a species’ genome. Here we investigate genomic variation in three natural North American populations of an agricultural pest and a model insect for many scientific disciplines, the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta). We show that hornworms from Arizona, Kansas, and North Carolina are genetically distinct, with Arizona being particularly differentiated from the other two populations using Illumina whole-genome resequencing. Peaks of differentiation exist across the genome, but here we focus in on the most striking regions. In particular, we identify two likely segregating inversions found in the Arizona population. One inversion on the Z chromosome may enhance adaptive evolution of the sex chromosome. The larger, autosomal inversion contains a pseudogene may be involved in the exploitation of a novel hostplant in Arizona, but functional genetic assays will be required to support this hypothesis. Nevertheless, our results reveal undiscovered natural variation and provide useful genomic data for both pest management and evolutionary genetics of this insect species.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The marine ciliate Mesodinium rubrum is famous for its ability to acquire and exploit chloroplasts and other cell organelles from some cryptophyte algal species. We sequenced genomes and transcriptomes of free-swimming Teleaulax amphioxeia, as well as well-fed and starved M. rubrum in order to understand cellular processes upon sequestration under different prey and light conditions. From its prey, the ciliate acquires the ability to photosynthesize as well as the potential to metabolize several essential compounds including lysine, glycan, and vitamins that elucidate its specific prey dependency. M. rubrum does not express photosynthesis related genes itself, but elicits considerable transcriptional control of the acquired cryptophyte organelles. This control is limited as light dependent transcriptional changes found in free-swimming T. amphioxeia got lost after sequestration. We found strong transcriptional rewiring of the cryptophyte nucleus upon sequestration, where 35% of the T. amphioxeia genes were significantly differentially expressed within well-fed M. rubrum. Qualitatively, 68% of all genes expressed within well-fed M. rubrum originated from T. amphioxeia. Quantitatively, these genes contributed up to 48% to the global transcriptome in well-fed M. rubrum and down to 11% in starved M. rubrum. This tertiary endosymbiosis system functions for several weeks, when deprived of prey. After this point in time, the ciliate dies if not supplied with fresh prey cells. M. rubrum represents one evolutionary way of acquiring photosystems from its algal prey, and might represent a step on the evolutionary way towards a permanent tertiary endosymbiosis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Predicting evolution of expanding populations is critical to control biological threats such as invasive species and cancer metastasis. Expansion is primarily driven by reproduction and dispersal, but nature abounds with examples of evolution where organisms pay a reproductive cost to disperse faster. When does selection favor this ‘survival of the fastest?’ We searched for a simple rule, motivated by evolution experiments where swarming bacteria evolved into an hy-perswarmer mutant which disperses ∼ 100% faster but pays a growth cost of ∼ 10% to make many copies of its flagellum. We analyzed a two-species model based on the Fisher equation to explain this observation: the population expansion rate (v) results from an interplay of growth (r) and dispersal (D) and is independent of the carrying capacity: . A mutant can take over the edge only if its expansion rate (v2) exceeds the expansion rate of the established species’ (v1); this simple condition (v2 &gt; v1) determines the maximum cost in slower growth that a faster mutant can pay and still be able to take over. Numerical simulations and time-course experiments where we tracked evolution by imaging bacteria suggest that our findings are general: less favorable conditions delay but do not entirely prevent the success of the fastest. Thus, the expansion rate defines a traveling wave fitness, which could be combined with trade-offs to predict evolution of expanding populations.

AB  - Repeated and independent adaptation to specific environmental conditions from standing genetic variation is common. However, if genetic variation is limited, the evolution of similar locally adapted traits may be restricted to genetically different and potentially less optimal solutions or prevented from happening altogether. Using a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping approach, we identified the genomic regions responsible for the repeated pelvic reduction (PR) in three crosses between nine-spined stickleback populations expressing full and reduced pelvic structures. In one cross, PR mapped to linkage group 7 (LG7) containing the gene Pitx1, known to control pelvic reduction also in the three-spined stickleback. In the two other crosses, PR was polygenic and attributed to ten novel QTL, of which 90% were unique to specific crosses. When screening the genomes from 27 different populations for deletions in the Pitx1 regulatory element, these were only found in the population in which PR mapped to LG7, even though the morphological data indicated large effect QTL for PR in several other populations as well. Consistent with the available theory and simulations parameterised on empirical data, we hypothesise that the observed variability in genetic architecture of PR is due to heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of standing genetic variation caused by &gt;2x stronger population structuring among freshwater populations and &gt;10x stronger genetic isolation by distance in the sea in nine-spined sticklebacks as compared to three-spined sticklebacks.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Understanding demographic trends and patterns of gene flow in an endangered species is crucial for devising conservation strategies. Here, we examined the extent of population structure and recent evolution of the critically endangered Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis). By analysing genetic variation at the mitochondrial and nuclear microsatellite loci for 148 individuals, we identified three populations along the Yangtze River, each one connected to a group of admixed ancestry. Each population displayed extremely low genetic diversity, consistent with extremely small effective size (≤92 individuals). Habitat degradation and distribution gaps correlated with highly asymmetric gene-flow that was inefficient in maintaining connectivity between populations. Genetic inferences of historical demography revealed that the populations in the Yangtze descended from a small number of founders colonizing the river from the sea during the last Ice Age. The colonization was followed by a rapid population split during the last millennium predating the Chinese Modern Economy Development. However, genetic diversity showed a clear footprint of population contraction over the last 50 years leaving only ~2% of the pre-collapsed size, consistent with the population collapses reported from field studies. This genetic perspective provides background information for devising mitigation strategies to prevent this species from extinction.

AB  - From micro to planetary scales, spatial heterogeneity—patchiness—is ubiquitous in ecological systems, defining the environments in which organisms move and interact. While this fact has been recognized for decades, most large-scale ecosystem models still use spatially averaged “mean fields” to represent natural populations, while fine-scale, spatially explicit models are mostly restricted to particular organisms or systems. In a conceptual paper, Grünbaum (2012, Interface Focus 2: 150-155) introduced a heuristic framework, based on three dimensionless ratios quantifying movement, reproduction, and resource consumption, to characterize patchy ecological interactions and identify when mean-field assumptions are justifiable. In this paper, we calculated Grünbaum’s dimensionless numbers for 33 real interactions between consumers and their resource patches in terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial environments. Consumers ranged in size from bacteria to blue whales, and patches lasted from minutes to millennia, spanning spatial scales of mm to hundreds of km. We found that none of the interactions could be accurately represented by a purely mean-field model, though 26 of them (79%) could be partially simplified by averaging out movement, reproductive, or consumption dynamics. Clustering consumer-resource pairs by their non-dimensional ratios revealed several unexpected dynamic similarities between disparate interactions. For example, bacterial Pseudoalteromonas exploit nutrient plumes in a similar manner to Mongolian gazelles grazing on ephemeral patches of steppe vegetation. Our findings suggest that dimensional analysis is a valuable tool for characterizing ecological patchiness, and can link the dynamics of widely different systems into a single quantitative framework.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Island systems provide excellent arenas to test evolutionary hypotheses pertaining to gene flow and diversification of dispersal-limited organisms. Here we focus on an orbweaver spider genus Cyrtognatha (Tetragnathidae) from the Caribbean, with the aims to reconstruct its evolutionary history, describe its biogeographic history in the archipelago, and to estimate the timing and route of Caribbean colonization. Specifically, we test if Cyrtognatha biogeographic history is consistent with an ancient vicariant scenario (the GAARlandia landbridge hypothesis) or overwater dispersal. We reconstructed a species level phylogeny based on one mitochondrial (CO1) and one nuclear (28S) marker. We then used this topology to constrain a time-calibrated mtDNA phylogeny, for subsequent biogeographical analyses of over 100 originally sampled Cyrtognatha individuals. Our results suggest a monophyletic radiation of Caribbean Cyrtognatha, containing 11 to 14 species that are exclusively single island endemics. Our analyses refute vicariance and instead support an overwater colonization to the Caribbean in mid-Miocene. Having colonized Hispaniola first, Cyrtognatha subsequently dispersed to, and diversified on, the other islands of the Greater, and Lesser Antilles.

Here we tested the feasibility for in situ molecular analyses of endemic fauna using a portable laboratory fitting within a single backpack, in one of the world’s most imperiled biodiversity hotspots: the Ecuadorian Chocó rainforest. We utilized portable equipment, including the MinION DNA sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and miniPCR (miniPCR), to perform DNA extraction, PCR amplification and real-time DNA barcode sequencing of reptile specimens in the field. We demonstrate that nanopore sequencing can be implemented in a remote tropical forest to quickly and accurately identify species using DNA barcoding, as we generated consensus sequences for species resolution with an accuracy of &gt;99% in less than 24 hours after collecting specimens. In addition, we generated sequence information at Universidad Tecnológica Indoamérica in Quito for the recently re-discovered Jambato toad Atelopus ignescens, which was thought to be extinct for 28 years, a rare species of blind snake Trilepida guayaquilensis, and two undescribed species of Dipsas snakes. In this study we establish how mobile laboratories and nanopore sequencing can help to accelerate species identification in remote areas (especially for species that are difficult to diagnose based on characters of external morphology), be applied to local research facilities in developing countries, and rapidly generate information for species that are rare, endangered and undescribed, which can potentially aid in conservation efforts.

AB  - Nutrient availability varies seasonally and spatially in the wild. The resulting nutrient limitation or restricted access to nutrients pose a major challenge for every organism. While many animals, such as hibernating animals, evolved strategies to overcome periods of nutrient scarcity, the cellular mechanisms of these strategies are poorly understood. Cave environments represent an extreme example of nutrient deprived environments since the lack of sunlight and therefore primary energy production drastically diminishes the nutrient availability. Here, we used Astyanax mexicanus, which includes river-dwelling surface fish and cave adapted cavefish populations to study the genetic adaptation to nutrient limitations. We show that cavefish populations store large amounts of fat in different body regions when fed ad libitum in the lab. We found higher expression of lipogenesis genes in cavefish livers when fed the same amount of food as surface fish, suggesting an improved ability of cavefish to use lipogenesis to convert available energy into triglycerides for storage into adipose tissue. Moreover, the lipid metabolism regulator, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (Pparγ), is upregulated at both transcript and protein levels in cavefish livers. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP seq) showed that Pparγ binds cavefish promoter regions of genes to a higher extent than surface fish. Finally, we identified two possible regulatory mechanisms of Pparγ in cavefish: higher amounts of ligands of the nuclear receptor, and nonsense mutations in per2, a known repressor of Pparγ. Taken together, our study reveals that upregulated Pparγ promotes higher levels of lipogenesis in the liver and contributes to higher body fat accumulation in cavefish populations, an important adaptation to nutrient limited environments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Mycoheterotrophic plants derive most or all carbon and nutrients from fungal partners and represent poorly understood components of forest biodiversity. Many are rare or endangered yet can be ecological indicators of forest ecosystem function due to their often highly specific fungal host requirements. One such species is the IUCN red-listed (‘vulnerable’), fully mycoheterotrophic orchid, Corallorhiza bentleyi. This recently described species is among the rarest plants in Appalachia, known from five counties in Virginia and West Virginia, USA. The species has a restricted range, small population size, and is self-pollinating. Here we take an integrative approach to conservation genetic assessment in C. bentleyi using floral morphometrics, simple-sequence repeats, and fungal host DNA to characterize variation within and among sampling localities. Morphology reveals some differentiation among individuals from six sampling localities. Surprisingly, most genetic variation is found within localities, contra to the expectation for a selfing species. Fungal host DNA reveals extreme specificity upon a few genotypes of a single ectomycorrhizal host species, Tomentella fuscocinerea, across all localities. We discuss the conservation implications of morphological, genetic, and symbiotic diversity in this vulnerable species, and recommend additional assessment of conservation status based on: an obligate reproductive mode of selfing, preventing benefits of outcrossing among genetically non-identical individuals; extreme host specificity, severely restricting niche space; and highly fragmented habitat under threat from anthropogenic disturbance. This study underscores the importance of integrative conservation assessment, analyzing multiple data sources, and reveals patterns not readily apparent from census-based assessments alone.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Large scale digitization projects such as #ScanAllFishes and oVert are generating high-resolution microCT scans of vertebrates by the thousands. Data from these projects are shared with the community using aggregate 3D specimen repositories like MorphoSource through various open licenses. MorphoSource currently hosts tens of thousands of 3D scans of eukaryotes. Along with the data from similarly scoped projects such as 10kPhenomes, DigiMorph and many others, soon hundreds of thousands of specimens that represent biodiversity of extinct and extant organisms will be conveniently available to researchers. We anticipate an explosion of quantitative research in organismal biology with the convergence of available data and the methodologies to analyze them.Though the data are available, the road from a series of images to analysis is fraught with challenges for most biologists. It involves tedious tasks of data format conversions, preserving spatial scale of the data accurately, 3D visualization and segmentations, acquiring measurements and annotations. When scientists use commercial software with proprietary formats, a roadblock for data exchange, collaboration, and reproducibility is erected that hurts the efforts of the scientific community to broaden participation in research. Another relevant concern is that ultimate derivative data from individual research projects (e.g., 3D models of segmentation) are shared in formats that do not preserve the correct spatial scale of the data.In this paper, we present our effort to tackle challenges biologists face when conducting 3D specimen-based research. We developed SlicerMorph as an extension of 3D Slicer, a biomedical visualization and analysis ecosystem with extensive visualization and segmentation capabilities built on proven python-scriptable open-source libraries such as Visualization Toolkit and Insight Toolkit. In addition to the core functionalities of Slicer, SlicerMorph provides users with modules to conveniently retrieve open-access 3D models or import users own 3D volumes, to annotate 3D curve and patch-based landmarks, generate canonical templates, conduct geometric morphometric analyses of 3D organismal form using both landmark-driven and landmark-free approaches, and create 3D animations from their results. We highlight how these individual modules can be tied together to establish complete workflow(s) from image sequence to morphospace. Our software development efforts were supplemented with short courses and workshops that cover the fundamentals of 3D imaging and morphometric analyses as it applies to study of organismal form and shape in evolutionary biology, and extensive links to the existing tutorials are provided as supplemental material.Our goal is to establish a community of organismal biologists centered around Slicer and SlicerMorph to facilitate easy exchange of data and results and collaborations using 3D specimens. Our proposition to our colleagues is that using a common open platform supported by a large user and developer community ensures the longevity and sustainability of the tools beyond the initial development effort.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Ecological and morphological divergence within populations can be a signal of adaptive divergence, which can maintain intraspecific polymorphisms and promote ecological speciation in the event of reproductive isolation. Here, we evaluate correlations among morphology, trophic ecology, and genetic differentiation between two divergent morphs (elongate and deep-body) of the fish genus Astyanax in the San Juan River basin in Central America, to infer the putative evolutionary mechanism shaping this system. We collected the two morphs from three water bodies and analyzed: 1) the correlation between body shape and the shape of the premaxilla, a relevant trophic structure, 2) the trophic level and niche width of each morph, 3) the correspondence between trophic level and body and premaxillary shape, and 4) the genetic differentiation between morphs using mitochondrial and nuclear markers. We found a strong correlation between the body and premaxillary shape of the morphs. The elongate-body morph had a streamlined body, a premaxilla with acuter angles and a narrower ascending process, and a higher trophic level, characteristic of species with predatorial habits. By contrast, the deep-body morph had a higher body depth, a premaxilla with less acute angles, and a broader trophic niche, suggesting generalist habits. Despite the strong correlation between morphological and ecological divergence, the morphs showed limited genetic differentiation, supporting the idea that morphs may be undergoing incipient ecological speciation, although alternative scenarios such as stable polymorphism or plasticity should also be considered. This study provides evidence about the role of ecological factors in the diversification processes in Astyanax.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Forests are currently a substantial carbon sink globally. Many climate change mitigation strategies rely on forest preservation and expansion, but the effectiveness of these approaches hinges on forests sequestering carbon for centuries despite anthropogenic climate change. Yet climate-driven disturbances pose critical risks to the long-term stability of forest carbon. We quantify the key climate drivers that fuel wildfire, drought, and insects, for the United States over 1984-2018 and project future disturbance risks over the 21st century. We find that current risks are widespread and projected to increase across different emission scenarios by a factor of 4-14 for fire and 1.3-1.8 for drought and insects. Our results provide insights for carbon cycle modeling, conservation, and climate policy, underscoring the escalating climate risks facing forests and the need for emissions reductions to mitigate climate change.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AU  - Eisen, Michael B.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Animal agriculture contributes significantly to global warming through ongoing emissions of the potent greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide, and displacement of biomass carbon on the land used to support livestock. However, because estimates of the magnitude of the effect of ending animal agriculture often focus on only one factor, the full potential benefit of a more radical change remains underappreciated. Here we quantify the full “climate opportunity cost” of current global livestock production, by modeling the combined, long-term effects of emission reductions and biomass recovery that would be unlocked by a phaseout of animal agriculture. We show that, even in the absence of any other emission reductions, persistent drops in atmospheric methane and nitrous oxide levels, and slower carbon dioxide accumulation, following a phaseout of livestock production would, through the end of the century, have the same cumulative effect on the warming potential of the atmosphere as a 25 gigaton per year reduction in anthropogenic CO2 emissions, providing half of the net emission reductions necessary to limit warming to 2°C. The magnitude and rapidity of these potential effects should place the reduction or elimination of animal agriculture at the forefront of strategies for averting disastrous climate change.Significance Statement The use of animals to produce food has a negative impact on the climate, but the benefits of a global switch to a plant based diet are underappreciated. We show that the global warming impact, through the rest of this century, of eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from livestock and allowing native ecosystems to regrow on the land currently used to house and feed livestock, would be equivalent to a 68% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. We hope putting clearer numbers on the “climate opportunity cost” of our continued use of animals as food technology will help policymakers and the public properly prioritize dietary change as a climate defense strategy.Declaration of Conflict of Interest Patrick Brown is the founder and CEO of Impossible Foods, a company developing alternatives to animals in food-production.

AB  - Inferring the intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of species diversification and phenotypic disparity across the Tree of Life is a major challenge in evolutionary biology. In green plants, polyploidy (or whole-genome duplication, WGD) is known to play a major role in microevolution and speciation1, but the extent to which WGD has shaped macroevolutionary patterns of diversification and phenotypic innovation across plant phylogeny remains an open question. Here we examine the relationship of various facets of genomic evolution—including gene and genome duplication, genome size, and chromosome number—with macroevolutionary patterns of phenotypic innovation, species diversification, and climatic occupancy in gymnosperms. We show that genomic changes, such as WGD and genome-size shifts, underlie the origins of most major extant gymnosperm clades, and notably our results support an ancestral WGD in the gymnosperm lineage. Spikes of gene duplication typically coincide with major spikes of phenotypic innovation, while increased rates of phenotypic evolution are typically found at nodes with high gene-tree conflict, representing historic population-level dynamics during speciation. Most shifts in gymnosperm diversification since the rise of angiosperms are decoupled from putative WGDs and instead are associated with increased rates of climatic occupancy evolution, particularly in cooler and/or more arid climatic conditions, suggesting that ecological opportunity, especially in the later Cenozoic, and environmental heterogeneity have driven a resurgence of gymnosperm diversification. Our study provides critical insight on the processes underlying diversification and phenotypic evolution in gymnosperms, with important broader implications for the major drivers of both micro- and macroevolution in plants.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - In a polymorphic species, stable differences in resource use are expected among ecotypes, and homogeneity in resource use is predicted within an ecotype. Yet, using a broad resource spectrum has been identified as a strategy for fishes living in unproductive northern environments, where food is patchily distributed and ephemeral. We investigated whether individual specialization of trophic resources occurred within the generalist piscivore ecotype of lake trout from Great Bear Lake, Canada, reflective of a form of diversity. Four distinct dietary patterns of resource use within the lake trout ecotype were detected from fatty acid composition, with some variation linked to spatial patterns within Great Bear Lake. Feeding habits of different groups within the ecotype were not associated with detectable morphological or genetic differentiation, suggesting that behavioral plasticity caused the trophic differences. A low level of genetic differentiation was detected between exceptionally large-sized individuals and other individuals. Investigating a geologically young system that displays high levels of intraspecific diversity and focusing on individual variation in diet suggested that individual trophic specialization can occur within an ecotype. The characterization of niche use among individuals, as done in this study, is necessary to understand the role that individual variation can play at the beginning of differentiation processes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.BPbefore presentmmetermmmillimeterhhourca.aroundi.e.,stands fore.g.,for exampleNaClSodium ChlorideFAMEfatty acid methyl estersH2SO4Sulfuric acidGCGas chromatographic°Cdegree Celsius°C/mindegree Celsius/minutesUPGMAUnweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic MeanPCAprincipal component analysisPERMANOVAPermutational Multivariate Analysis of VarianceMANOVAMultivariate analysis of varianceSIMPERsimilarity percentage routineANOSIManalysis of similaritiesNNumber of individuals genotypedNAnumber of allelesHEexpected heterozygosityHOobserved heterozygosityARallelic richnessPARprivate allelic richnessAalphaFCAFactorial correspondence analysis k=number of allelesDAPCDiscriminant Analysis of Principal ComponentsIMPIntegrated Ecotypeometrics ProgramsCVACanonical Variate Analyses

AB  - Large tropical river dam projects are set to accelerate over the forthcoming decades to satisfy growing demand for energy, irrigation and flood control. When tropical rivers are dammed, the immediate impacts are well studied, but the long-term (decades-centuries) consequences of impoundment remain poorly known. Here, we gather historical and paleoecological data from Gatun Lake, formed by the building of the Gatun Dam (Panama Canal, Panamá) over 100 years ago, to reconstruct the limnological evolution of the system in response to individual and linked stressors (river damming, forest flooding, deforestation, invasive species, pollution and hydro-climate). We found that after a century of dam construction parallels associated with the natural hydrological functioning of river floodplains persist. Hence, hydrology remains the most important temporal structural factor positively stimulating primary productivity, deposition of new minerals, and reduction of water transparency during wet periods. During dry periods, clear water and aerobic conditions prevail and nutrients transform into available forms in the detrital-rich reductive sediments. We highlight the importance of climate change as an ultimate rather than proximate anthropogenic factor for sustainable management options of tropical dams.

AB  - Organismal variation in dispersal ability can directly affect levels of gene flow amongst populations, therefore importantly shaping species distributions and species richness patterns. The intermediate dispersal model of biogeography (IDM) predicts that in island systems, species diversity of those lineages with an intermediate dispersal potential is the highest. We broadly test this prediction, focusing on ‘four-jawed spiders’ (genus Tetragnatha) of the Caribbean archipelago. First, we report on original sampling of this globally distributed genus with numerous widespread as well as endemic species. We then reconstruct multiple Tetragnatha phylogenies from roughly 300 individuals delineated into 54 putative species. Our results support the monophyly of the four-jawed spiders but reject the monophyly of those lineages that reach the Caribbean, where we find low levels of endemism yet high diversity within Tetragnatha. The chronogram detects a potential early overwater colonization of the Caribbean, and in combination with reconstructed biogeographic history, refutes the possibility of ancient vicariant origins of Caribbean Tetragnatha as well as the GAARlandia land-bridge scenario. Instead, biogeographic results hypothesize multiple colonization events to, and from the Caribbean since mid-Eocene to late-Miocene. Tetragnatha seems unique among the arachnids explored so far in comprising some species that are excellent dispersers, and others that are not, perhaps having secondarily lost this dispersal propensity. A direct test of the IDM would require consideration of three categories of dispersers. However, four-jawed spiders do not fit one of these three a priori definitions, but rather represent a more complex combination of attributes of a ‘dynamic disperser’.

AB  - Tropical forests are the most diverse terrestrial ecosystems and home to numerous tree species with diverse ecological strategies competing for resources in space and time. Functional traits influence the ecophysiological performance of tree species, yet the relationship between traits and emergent long-term growth pattern is poorly understood. Here, we present a novel 3D forest stand model in which growth patterns of individual trees and forest stands are emergent properties of leaf traits. Individual trees are simulated as 3D functional-structural tree models (FSTMs), considering branches up to the second order and leaf dynamics at a resolution of one m3. Each species is characterized by a set of leaf traits that corresponds to a specific position on the leaf economic spectrum and determines light-driven carbon assimilation, respiration and mortality rates. Applying principles of the pipe model theory, these leaf scale-processes are coupled with within-tree carbon allocation, i.e., 3D tree growth emerges from low-level processes. By integrating these FSTMs into a dynamic forest stand model, we go beyond modern stand models to integrate structurally-detailed internal physiological processes with interspecific competition, and interactions with the environment in diverse tree communities. For model calibration and validation, we simultaneously compared a large number of emergent patterns at both the tree and forest levels in a pattern-oriented modeling framework. At the tree level, varying specific leaf area and correlated leaf traits determined the maximum height and age of a tree, as well as its size-dependent growth rate and shade tolerance. Trait variations along the leaf economic spectrum led to a continuous transition from fast-growing, short-lived and shade-intolerant to slow-growing, long-lived and shade-tolerant trees. These emerging patterns resembled well-known functional tree types, indicating a fundamental impact of leaf traits on long-term growth patterns. At the forest level, a large number of patterns taken from lowland Neotropical forests were reproduced, indicating that our forest model simulates structurally realistic forests over long time spans. Our ecophysiological approach improves the understanding of how leaf level processes scale up to the tree and the stand level, and facilitates the development of next-generation forest models for species-rich forests in which tree performance emerges directly from functional traits.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Lifestyle convergences and related phenotypes are a major topic in evolutionary biology. Low bone cortical compactness (CC), shared by the two genera of ‘tree sloths’, has been linked to their convergently evolved slow arboreal ecology. The proposed relationship of low CC with ‘tree sloths’ lifestyle suggests a potential convergent acquisition of this trait in other slow arboreal mammals. ‘Tree sloths’, ‘Lorisidae’, Palaeopropithecidae, Megaladapis and koalas were included in a phylogenetically informed CC analysis of the humerus and femur, as well as closely related but ecologically distinct taxa. We found that ‘tree sloths’ are unparalleled by any analysed clade, in featuring an extremely low CC. A tendency for low CC was however found in palaeopropithecids (especially Palaeopropithecus) and Megaladapis. On the other hand, low CC was not found in ‘Lorisidae’. Koalas, although deviating from the compact structure generally observed in mammals, are not clearly distinct from their sister taxon (wombats) and show humeral CC that is higher than femoral CC. Multiple factors seem to influence CC, preventing the recognition of a simple relationship between slow arborealism and low CC. Highly compact cortical bone in extinct sloths confirms that low CC in ‘tree sloths’ likely represents a recent convergence.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Variation in floral displays, both between and within species, has been long known to be shaped by the mutualistic interactions that plants establish with their pollinators. However, increasing evidence suggests that abiotic selection pressures influence floral diversity as well. Here we analyze the genetic and environmental factors that underlie patterns of floral pigmentation in wild sunflowers. While sunflower inflorescences appear invariably yellow to the human eye, they display extreme diversity for patterns of ultraviolet pigmentation, which are visible to most pollinators. We show that this diversity is largely controlled by cis-regulatory variation at a single MYB transcription factor, HaMYB111, through accumulation of UV-absorbing flavonol glycosides. As expected, different patterns of ultraviolet pigments in flowers have a strong effect on pollinator preferences. However, variation for floral ultraviolet patterns is also associated with environmental variables, especially relative humidity, across populations of wild sunflowers. Larger ultraviolet patterns, which are found in drier environments, limit transpiration, therefore reducing water loss. The dual role of floral UV patterns in pollination attraction and abiotic responses reveals the complex adaptive balance underlying the evolution of floral traits.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The evolutionary history of the Cingulata, as for many groups, remains a highly debated topic to this day, particularly for one of their most emblematic representatives: the glyptodonts. There is no consensus among morphological and molecular phylogenies relative to their position within Cingulata. As demonstrated by recent works, the study of the internal anatomy constitutes a promising path for enriching morphological matrices for the phylogenetic study of armadillos. However, internal cranial anatomy remains under-studied in the Cingulata. Here we explored and compared the anatomy of intracranial osseous canals and cavities in a diverse sample of extant and extinct cingulates, including the earliest well-preserved glyptodont crania. The virtual 3D reconstruction (using X-ray microtomography) of selected canals, i.e., the nasolacrimal canal, the palatine canal, the sphenopalatine canal, the canal for the frontal diploic vein, the transverse canal, the orbitotemporal canal, the canal for the capsuloparietal emissary vein and the posttemporal canal, and alveolar cavities related to cranial vascularization, innervation or tooth insertion allowed us to compare the locations, trajectories and shape of these structures and to discuss their potential interest for cingulate systematics. We tentatively reconstructed evolutionary scenarios for eight selected traits on these structures, in which glyptodonts often showed a greater resemblance to pampatheres, to the genus Proeutatus and/or to chlamyphorines. This latter pattern was partly congruent with recent molecular hypotheses, but more research is needed on these resemblances and on the potential effects of development and allometry on the observed variations. Overall, these comparisons have enabled us to highlight new anatomical variation that may be of great interest to further explore the evolutionary history of cingulates and the origins of glyptodonts on a morphological basis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Taxa with disjunct distributions are common in montane biotas and offer excellent opportunities to investigate historical processes underlying genetic and phenotypic divergence. In this context, subgenomic datasets offer novel opportunities to explore historical demography in detail, which is key to better understand the origins and maintenance of diversity in montane regions. Here we used a large ultraconserved elements dataset to get insights into the main biogeographic processes driving the evolution of the Montane Atlantic Forest biota. Specifically, we studied two species of warbling finches disjunctly distributed across a region of complex geological and environmental history. We found that a scenario of three genetically differentiated populations is best supported by genomic clustering methods. Also, demographic simulations support simultaneous isolation of these populations at ~10 kya, relatively stable population sizes over recent time, and recent gene flow. Our results suggest a dual role of climate: population divergence, mediated by isolation in mountain tops during warm periods, as well as population maintenance - allowing persistence mediated by shifts in elevation distribution during periods of climate change, with episodic bouts contact and gene flow. Additional support for the role of climate comes from evidence of their contact in a recent past. We propose that two major gaps, which we call São Paulo and Caparaó subtropical gaps, have been historically important in the divergence of cold adapted organisms in the Atlantic Forest, and could be associated to cryptic diversity. Finally, our results suggest that shallow divergence and past gene flow may be common in montane organisms, but complex demographic histories may be detectable only when using subgenomic or genomic datasets.

AB  - Understanding the historical extent of biogenic habitats can provide insight into the nature of human impacts and inform restoration and conservation actions. Kelp forests form an important biogenic habitat that responds to natural and human drivers. Global concerns exist about threats to kelp forests, yet long term information is limited and research suggests that trends are geographically distinct. We examined distribution of the bull kelp Nereocystis luetkeana over 145 years in South Puget Sound (SPS), a semi-protected inner basin in a fjord estuary complex in the northeast Pacific Ocean. We synthesized 48 historical and modern Nereocystis surveys and examined presence/absence within 1-km shoreline segments along 452 km of shoreline. Over the last 145 years, Nereocystis has been documented in 26% of the shoreline segments. Its extent decreased 62% basin-wide between the 1870s and 2017, with extreme losses in the two out of three sub-basins (96% in Central and 83% in West). In recent years, almost all Nereocystis occurred in the East sub-basin. In the majority of segments where Nereocystis disappeared, the most recent observation was 4 decades ago, or earlier. Multiple natural and human factors that are known to impact kelp could have contributed to observed patterns, but limited data exist at the spatial and temporal scale of this study. In some areas, recent environmental conditions approached thresholds associated with decreased kelp performance. Longstanding Nereocystis losses occurred exclusively in areas with relatively low current velocities. Remaining Nereocystis predominantly occurred in areas where circulation is stronger. Exceptions to this pattern demonstrate that additional factors outside the scope of this study contributed to trajectories of Nereocystis persistence or loss.

AB  - The Tapanuli Orangutan (Pongo tapanuliensis) is the most threatened great ape species in the world. It is restricted to an area of about 1,000 km2 of upland forest where fewer than 800 animals survive in three declining subpopulations. Through a historical ecology approach involving analysis of newspaper, journals, books and museum records from the early 1800s to 2009, we demonstrate that historically Pongo tapanuliensis inhabited a much larger area, and across a much wider range of habitat types than now. Its current Extent of Occurrence is between 2.5% and 5.0% of the historical range in the 1890s and 1940s respectively. A combination of historical fragmentation of forest habitats, mostly for small-scale agriculture, and unsustainable hunting likely drove various populations to the south, east and west of the current population to extinction. This happened prior to the industrial-scale forest conversion that started in the 1970s. Our findings indicate how sensitive P. tapanuliensis is to the combined effects of habitat fragmentation and unsustainable take-off rates. Saving this species will require prevention of any further fragmentation and killings or other removal of animals from the remaining population. Without concerted action to achieve this, the remaining populations of P. tapanuliensis are doomed to become extinct within several orangutan generations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The tree of life is highly reticulate, with the history of population divergence buried amongst phylogenies deriving from introgression and lineage sorting. In this study, we test the hypothesis that there are regions of the oak (Quercus, Fagaceae) genome that are broadly informative about phylogeny and investigate global patterns of oak diversity.We utilize fossil data and restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) for 632 individuals representing ca. 250 oak species to infer a time-calibrated phylogeny of the world’s oaks. We use reversible-jump MCMC to reconstruct shifts in lineage diversification rates, accounting for among-clade sampling biases. We then map the &gt; 20,000 RAD-seq loci back to a recently published oak genome and investigate genomic distribution of introgression and phylogenetic support across the phylogeny.Oak lineages have diversified among geographic regions, followed by ecological divergence within regions, in the Americas and Eurasia. Roughly 60% of oak diversity traces back to four clades that experienced increases in net diversification due to climatic transitions or ecological opportunity.The support we find for the phylogeny contrasts with high genomic heterogeneity in phylogenetic signal and introgression. Oaks are phylogenomic mosaics, and their diversity may in fact depend on the gene flow that shapes the oak genome.

AB  - Change in behavior is one of the earliest measurable responses to variation in habitat suitability, making the study of factors that promote behaviors particularly important in areas undergoing environmental change. We applied hidden Markov models to movement data of 14 polar bears, Ursus maritimus, from Western Hudson Bay, Canada between 2011 and 2021 during the foraging season (January–June) when bears inhabit the sea ice. The model incorporated bear movement and orientation relative to wind to classify three behaviors (stationary/drifting, area-restricted search, and olfactory search), and investigated 11 factors to identify conditions that may promote these behaviors. In contrast to other polar bear populations, we found high levels of evening activity, with active behaviors peaking around 20:00. We identified an increase in activity as the ice-covered season progressed. This apparent shift in foraging strategy from still-hunting to active search corresponds to a shift in prey availability (i.e., increase in haul-out behavior during winter to the spring pupping and molting seasons). Last, we described spatial patterns of distribution with respect to season and ice concentration that may be indicative of variation in habitat quality and segregation by bear age that may reflect competitive exclusion. Our observations were generally consistent with predictions of the marginal value theorem, and differences between our findings compared to other populations could be explained by variation in regional or temporal variation in resource abundance or distribution. Our findings and novel methodology can help identify periods, locations, and environmental conditions representing critical habitat.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - An organism’s ability to disperse influences many fundamental processes in ecology. However, standardised estimates of dispersal ability are rarely available, and thus the patterns and drivers of broad-scale variation in dispersal ability remain unclear. Here we present a global dataset of avian hand-wing index (HWI), an estimate of wingtip pointedness widely adopted as a proxy for flight efficiency and dispersal in birds. We show that HWI is correlated with geography and ecology across 10,391 (&gt;99 %) bird species, increasing at higher latitudes and in migratory and/or non-territorial species. After controlling for these effects, the strongest predictor of HWI is temperature variability (i.e. seasonality), with secondary effects of diet and habitat type. Our analyses (1) reveal a prominent latitudinal gradient in HWI shaped by ecological and environmental factors, and (2) provide a global index of avian dispersal ability for wider use in community ecology, macroecology, and macroevolution.Statement of authorship The study was conceived by CS and JAT.

TI  - An Examination of an Enhanced Remote Sensing Method for Agent Attribution of Forest Disturbance
AU  - Worsham, Hugh Marshall
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Patterns of disturbance in Sierra Nevada forests are shifting as a result of changing climate and land uses. These changes have underscored the need for a monitoring system that both detects disturbances and attributes them to different agents. Addressing this need will aid forest management and conservation decision-making, potentially enhancing forests’ resilience to changing climatic conditions. In addition, it will advance understanding of the patterns, drivers, and consequences of forest disturbance in space and time. This study proposed and evaluated an enhanced method for disturbance agent attribution. Specifically, it tested the extent to which textural information could improve the performance of an ensemble learning method in predicting the agents of disturbance from remote sensing observations. Random Forest (RF) models were developed to attribute disturbance to three primary agents (fire, harvest, and drought) in Stanislaus National Forest, California, U.S.A., between 1999 and 2015. To account for spectral behavior and topographical characteristics that regulate vegetation and disturbance dynamics, the models were trained on predictors derived from both the Landsat record and from a digital elevation model. The predictors included measurements of spectral change acquired through temporal segmentation of Landsat data; measurements of patch geometry; and a series of landscape texture metrics. The texture metrics were generated using the Grey-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM). Two models were produced: one with GLCM texture metrics and one without. The per-class and overall accuracies of each model were evaluated with out-of-bag (OOB) observations and compared statistically to quantify the contribution of texture metrics to classification skill. Overall OOB accuracy was 72.0% for the texture-free model and 72.2% for the texture-dependent model, with no significant accuracy difference between them. Spatial patterns in prediction maps cohered with expectations, with most harvest concentrated in mid-elevation forests and fire and stress co-occurring at lower elevations. Altogether, the method yielded adequate identification of disturbance and moderate attribution accuracy for multiple disturbance agents. While textures did not contribute meaningfully to model skill, the study offers a strong foundation for future development, which should focus on improving the efficacy of the model and generalizing it for systems beyond the Central Sierra Nevada.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AU  - Orchard, Shane
AU  - Schiel, David R.
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Galaxias maculatus is a declining amphidromous fish that supports culturally-important whitebait fisheries in New Zealand and elsewhere in the Pacific. As a largely annual species, the seasonal productivity of spawning grounds has a strong influence on the availability of recruits. Spawning ground protection is urgently required to reverse historical degradation and improve prospects for the maintenance of sustainable fisheries. Although spawning habitat has been well characterised in tidal rivers where it is structured by water level changes on spring high tides, there has been no previous study of spawning in non-tidal rivermouths. We assessed seven non-tidal rivers over four months using a census survey approach to quantify spawning activity, identify environmental cues, and characterise fundamental aspects of the biogeography of spawning grounds. We report conclusive results that include a) identification of compact spawning reaches near the rivermouths, b) triggering of spawning events by periods of elevated water levels that were often of very short duration, suggesting that potential lunar cues were less important and that rapid fish movements had likely occurred within the catchment prior to spawning events, and c) consistent vertical structuring of spawning grounds above typical low-flow levels with associated horizontal translation away from the river channel, leading to increased exposure to anthropogenic stressors and associated management implications for protecting the areas concerned. These consistent patterns provide a sound basis for advancing the management of non-tidal rivermouths. Attention to flood management, vegetation control, and bankside recreational activities is required and may be assisted by quantifying spawning ground biogeography. The identification of rapid responses to environmental cues deserves further research to assess implications for floodplain connectivity management to support fish movements in emphemeral flowpaths, and as a potential source of bias in commonly-used fish survey methodologies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - In northeast Asia, substantial portion of the floras, including endangered species, are shared among its component countries in the continental, peninsula, and island parts largely through Quaternary migration. To effectively conserve nationally endangered plants in Northeast Asia, transnational conservation studies are vitally needed. Lychnis wilfordii (Caryophyllaceae) has disjunct distribution in Russian Far East (Primorsky Krai), northeast China (Jilin), Korea (Gangwon-do) and Japan (Hokkaido, Aomori, Nagano), surrounding the sea, and this is designated as an endangered species in Japan and Korea. Population genetic and molecular dating analyses were conducted 1) to elucidate geographic genetic structure covering the species range, 2) to test possible scenarios of migration, and 3) to develop logical plans for effective conservation. Population genetic analyses indicated the continent and peninsula parts (north and south Primorsky Krai, Jilin, and Gangwon-do) had higher genetic diversity compared to those in the Japanese Archipelago (Hokkaido and Nagano). Five genetically distinct groups were recognized, namely, Nagano, Gangwon-do, Jilin, north and south Primorsky Krai plus Aomori, and Hokkaido. Genetic distance between Hokkaido and Nagano was larger than between Hokkaido and north Primorsky Krai, and between Nagano and Gangwon-do, crossing national borders and the natural barrier of the sea. Considering these results, L. wilfordii likely migrated from the Asian continent to the Japanese Archipelago using two routes: north route from Russian Far East to Hokkaido and Aomori, and south route from the Korean Peninsula to Nagano. Based on molecular dating, migration from the continent to the islands likely occurred from the middle Pleistocene to the Holocene. For effective conservation of L. wilfordii, Hokkaido and Nagano populations should be distinguished as different evolutionary significant units, although these two regions belong to the same country, because Hokkaido and Nagano populations are at the different ends of the two migratory routes based on the migration scenario.

AB  - The phylogenetic relationships and the phylogeography of seven species of Caucasian barbels of the genus Barbus s. str. were studied based on extended geographic coverage and the use of mtDNA and nDNA markers. Based on the 26 species studied, matrilineal phylogeny of the genus Barbus is composed of two clades: a) West European clade, and b) Central and East European clade. The latter comprises two subclades: b1) Balkanian subclade, and b2) Ponto-Caspian subclade, which includes 11 lineages mainly from Black and Caspian Sea drainages. Caucasian barbels are not monophyletic and are subdivided into two groups. The Black Sea group encompasses species from tributaries of the Black Sea, including the reinstalled B. rionicus, except for B. kubanicus. The Caspian group includes B. ciscaucasicus, B. cyri (with B. goktschaicus, which might be synonymized with B. cyri), B. lacerta from the Tigris-Euphrates basin and B. kubanicus from the Kuban basin. The genetic structure of Black Sea barbels was influenced by glaciation-deglaciation periods accompanied by freshwater phases, periods of migration and the colonization of Black Sea tributaries. Intra- and intergeneric hybridization among Caucasian barbines was revealed for the first time. In the present study, we report the discovery of B. escherichii in the Kuban basin, where only B. kubanicus was known to inhabit. Hybrids of these two species were detected based on both mtDNA and nDNA markers. Remarkably, the Kuban population of B. escherichii is distant to closely located conspecific populations, and we consider it as a relic. We reveal the intergeneric hybridization between evolutionary tetraploid (2n=100) B. goktschaicus and evolutionary hexaploid (2n=150) Capoeta sevangi in Lake Sevan.

AB  - The latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) is arguably one of the most striking patterns in nature. The global increase in species richness toward the tropics across continents and taxonomic groups stimulated the formulation of many hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms of this pattern. We evaluated several of these hypotheses to explain spatial diversity patterns in the butterfly family, Nymphalidae, by assessing the contributions of speciation, extinction, and dispersal to the LDG, and also the extent to which these processes differ among regions at the same latitude. We generated a new, time-calibrated phylogeny of Nymphalidae based on 10 gene fragments and containing ca. 2,800 species (∼45% of extant diversity). Neither speciation nor extinction rate variations consistently explain the LDG among regions because temporal diversification dynamics differ greatly across longitude. For example, we found that Neotropical nymphalid diversity results from low extinction rates, not high speciation rates, and that biotic interchanges with other regions were rare. Southeast Asia was also characterized by a low speciation rate but, unlike the Neotropics, was the main source of dispersal events through time. Our results suggest that global climate change throughout the Cenozoic, particularly during the Eocene-Oligocene transition, combined with the conserved ancestral tropical niches, played a major role in generating the modern LDG of butterflies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Biological invasions are major anthropogenic changes associated with threats to biodiversity and health. What determines the successful establishment and spread of introduced populations still remains unsolved. Here, we explore the assertion that invasion success relies on immune phenotypic traits that would be advantageous in recently invaded sites. We compared gene expression profiles between anciently and recently established populations of two major invading species, the house mouse Mus musculus domesticus and the black rat Rattus rattus, in Senegal (West Africa). Transcriptome analyses revealed respectively 364 and 83 differentially expressed genes between anciently and recently established mouse and rat populations. Among them, 20.0% and 10.6% were annotated with functions related to immunity. All immune-related genes detected along the mouse invasion route were over-expressed in recently invaded sites. Genes of the complement activation pathway were over-represented. Results were less straightforward for the black rat as no particular immunological process was over-represented. We revealed changes in transcriptome profiles along invasion routes, although specific patterns differed between the two invasive species. These changes could potentially be driven by increased infection risks in recently invaded sites for the house mouse and stochastic events associated with colonization history for the black rat. These results provide a first step in identifying the immune eco-evolutionary processes potentially involved in invasion success.

AB  - For ecological research to make important contributions towards understanding and managing temporally-variable global change processes, such as responses to land-use and climatic change, we must have effective and comparable ways to quantify and analyse compositional change over time in biological communities. These changes are the sum of local colonisation and extinction events, or changes in the biomass and relative abundance of taxa within and among samples. We conducted a quantitative review of currently available methods for the analysis of multivariate datasets collected at temporal intervals. This review identified the need for the application of quantitative, hypothesis-based approaches to understand temporal change in community composition, particularly for small datasets with less than 15 temporal replicates. To address this gap, we: (1) conceptually present how temporal patterns in community dynamics can be framed as specific, testable hypotheses; (2) provide three fully-worked case-studies, complete with R code, demonstrating multivariate analysis methods for temporal hypothesis testing and pattern visualisation; and (3) present a road map for testing specific, quantitative hypotheses relating to the underlying mechanisms of temporal community dynamics.

AB  - The relationship between invasive plant functional traits and their invasiveness is still the subject of scientific investigation, and the backgrounds of transition from non-native to invasive species in ecosystems are therefore poorly understood. Furthermore, our current knowledge on species invasiveness is heavily biased toward terrestrial species; we know much less about the influence of allochthonous plant traits on their invasiveness in aquatic ecosystems. We studied physiological and ecological traits of two introduced and three native macrophyte species in the Mantua lakes system (northern Italy). We compared their photophysiology, pigment content, leaf reflectance, and phenology in order to assess how the invasive Nelumbo nucifera and Ludwigia hexapetala perform compared to native species, Nuphar lutea, Nymphaea alba, and Trapa natans. We found L. hexapetala to have higher photosynthetic efficiency and able to tolerate higher light intensities than N. nucifera and the native species especially at extreme weather conditions (prolonged exposure to high light and higher temperatures). Chlorophyll a and b, and carotenoid contents of both allochthonous species was substantially higher than that of the native plants suggesting adaptive response to the ecosystem of Mantua lakes system. Higher variability of recorded data in invasive species also was observed. These observations suggest advanced photosynthetic efficiency of the invasive species, especially L. hexapetala, resulting in faster growth rates and higher productivity. This was supported by the evaluation of seasonal dynamics mapped from satellite remote sensing data. This study provides empirical evidence for the relationship between specific plant physiological traits and invasiveness of aquatic plant species, highlighting the importance of trait studies in predicting ecosystem-level impacts of invasive plant species.

AB  - The number of offspring an organism can produce is a key component of its evolutionary fitness and life-history. Here we perform a test of the hypothesized trade off between the number and size of offspring using thousands of descriptions of the number of egg-producing compartments in the insect ovary (ovarioles), a common proxy for potential offspring number in insects. We find evidence of a negative relationship between egg size and ovariole number when accounting for adult body size. However in contrast to prior claims, we note that this relationship is not generalizable across all insect clades, and we highlight several factors that may have contributed to this size-number trade off being stated as a general rule in previous studies. We reconstruct the evolutionary history of the nurse cell arrangement within the ovariole, and show that the diversification of ovariole number and egg size have both been largely independent of nurse cell presence or position within the ovariole. Instead we show that ovariole number evolution has been shaped by a series of transitions between variable and invariant states, with multiple independent lineages evolving to have almost no variation in ovariole number. We highlight the implications of these invariant lineages on our understanding of the specification of ovariole number during development, as well as the importance of considering developmental processes in theories of life-history evolution.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The rearing habitat for juvenile Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in California, the southernmost portion of their range, has drastically declined throughout the past century. Recently, through cooperative agreements with diverse stakeholders, winter-flooded agricultural rice fields in California’s Central Valley have emerged as promising habitat for rearing juvenile Chinook Salmon. From 2013 to 2016, we conducted a series of experiments examining methods for rearing fall-run Chinook Salmon on winter-flooded rice fields in the Yolo Bypass, a modified floodplain of the Sacramento River in California. These included: 1) influence of field substrate differences from previous season rice harvest; 2) effects of depth refugia from avian predators (trenches); 3) field drainage methods to promote efficient egress of fish; and 4) in-field salmon survivorship over time. Zooplankton (fish food) in the winter-flooded rice fields were 53-150x more abundant when directly compared to the adjacent Sacramento River. Correspondingly, somatic growth rates of juvenile hatchery-sourced fall-run Chinook Salmon stocked in rice fields were two to five times greater versus fish in the adjacent Sacramento River. Post-harvest field substrate treatments had little effect on the lower trophic food web and had an insignificant effect on growth rates of in-field salmon. Though depth refugia did not directly increase survival, it buffered maximum water temperatures in the trenches and facilitated outmigration from fields during draining. Rapid field drainage methods yielded the highest survival and were preferable to drawn-out drainage methods. High initial mortality immediately after stocking was observed in the survival over time experiment with stable and high survival after the first week. In-field survival ranged 7.4–61.6% and increased over the course of the experiments. Despite coinciding with the most extreme drought in California’s recorded history, which elevated water temperatures and reduced the regional extent of adjacent flooded habitats which concentrated avian predators, the adaptive research framework enabled incremental improvements in design to increase survival. The abundance of food resources and exceptionally high growth rates observed during these experiments illustrate the benefits associated with reconciling off-season agricultural land use with fish conservation practices. Without any detriment to flood control or agricultural yield, there is great promise for reconciliation ecology between agricultural floodplains and endangered fish conservation where minor alterations to farm management practices could greatly enhance the effectiveness of fish conservation outcomes.

AB  - Several hypotheses (such as ‘enemy release’, ‘novel weapon’, ‘spillback’ and ‘dilution/density effect’) suggest changes in host-parasite ecological interactions during biological invasion events. Such changes can impact both invasion process outcome and the dynamics of exotic and/or endemic zoonotic diseases. To evaluate these predictions, we investigated the ongoing invasions of the house mouse Mus musculus domesticus, and the black rat, Rattus rattus, in Senegal (West Africa). We focused on zoonotic bacterial communities depicted using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing approach in both invasive and native rodents sampled along two well-defined invasion routes. Overall, this study provided new ecological evidence connecting parasitism and rodent invasion process, with diverse potential roles of zoonotic bacteria in the invasion success. Our results also highlighted the main factors that lie behind bacterial community structure in commensal rodents. Further experimental studies as well as comparative spatio-temporal surveys are necessary to decipher the actual role of zoonotic bacteria in these invasions. Our data also gave new support for the difficulty to predict the direction in which the relationship between biodiversity changes and disease risk could go. These results should be used as a basis for public health prevention services to design reservoir monitoring strategies based on multiple pathogen surveillance.

AB  - Coastal biogenic habitats are particularly vulnerable to cumulative human impacts from both terrestrial and marine realms. Yet the broad spatial scale used in current global or regional approaches of quantifying multiple anthropogenic stressors are not relevant to the local or bay-wide scales affecting most coastal biogenic habitats. To fill this gap, we developed a standardized human impact metric to quantify the magnitude of anthropogenic impacts to coastal ecosystems more broadly, and biogenic habitats in particular. We applied this metric to 180 seagrass beds (Zostera marina), an important biogenic habitat prioritized for marine protection, across Atlantic Canada. Our impact metric includes five bay-scale and four local-scale terrestrial and marine-based impacts. Results show that seagrass beds and coastal bays in Atlantic Canada exist across a wide gradient of human impacts. Considerable differences in the range and intensity of impacts within and between regions provide insight into where coastal bays and seagrass ecosystems are expected to be most and least affected by individual or cumulative human threats. We discuss implications for management and conservation planning, and the general application of our impact metric to other coastal regions and habitats in Canada and beyond.

AB  - Amphibian conservation in farming landscapes should address two challenges. First, to understand the relationship between landuse and amphibian habitat quality and second, to understand and support of the capacity of the local communities to continue those farming practices which supports amphibian friendly habitats. While the first challenge is addressed by several studies, there is virtually no study addressing the socio-economic drivers of landuse change. The major aim of this study to fill this knowledge gap by (i) documenting the temporary pond loss in 10 years in a traditionally managed pasture as a result of land abandonment and (ii) exploring the socio-economic and environmental drivers of abandonment. The results show a dramatic increase of scrub cover in the study area as a result of land abandonment. The formation of temporary ponds was negatively influenced by the increase of scrub cover in the vicinity of ponds. There were no differences between the amphibian species assemblages nor the species richness between the lost- and persisting ponds. The social component of the research highlights possible maladaptive paths in pasture management reinforced by the village depopulation, wrong interpretation of nature protection law by officials, scrub encroachment caused decrease in pasture quality and the demotivation of locals to restart traditional grazing. Conservation efforts in traditional farming landscapes facing land abandonment should (i) target the maximization of the quality of the remaining ponds for amphibians and (ii) should support reviving traditional farming practices within the local community.

AB  - The brown macroalgae of the genus Cystoseira are important habitat forming species along the rocky coasts all over the Mediterranean Sea. However, their decline at basin and local scale has been documented in many studies. We have characterized malacofauna associated with Cystoseira amentacea, C. compressa and C. crinita along the coasts of Ischia Island (Gulf of Naples). Samples were collected by snorkeling in the infralittoral belt. The surface within 20 x 20 cm frames was scraped off and collected in three replicates each sites. The diversity and structure of community were described by number of species, the exponential Shannon and the reciprocal Simpson’s indexes of diversity. The patterns of diversity at spatial scale were assessed by alpha, beta and gamma diversity. A total of 53 species of molluscs were identified in those associations. Gastropoda were the most species-rich class followed by Bivalvia and Polyplacophora. Bivalves were dominant in terms of number of individuals because of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. The species M. galloprovincialis was the most frequent and top dominant one inhabiting Cystoseira associations along the coasts of Ischia Island (96.6 % of the total abundance). Most of the identified molluscs species belonged to two feeding guilds: micrograzers and filter feeders (29 and 13 species respectively). Only juveniles were found providing the importance of Cystoseira associations as nursery for molluscs recruitment. Differences in composition and structure of molluscs assemblages were found within the three algal associations and seem to correspond both to different morphology and habitat in which these algal species live.

AB  - Pacific salmon are a keystone resource in Alaska, generating annual revenues of well over ∼US$500 million/yr. Due to their anadromous life history, adult spawners distribute amongst thousands of streams, posing a huge management challenge. Currently, spawners are enumerated at just a few streams because of reliance on human counters and, rarely, sonar. The ability to detect organisms by shed tissue (environmental DNA, eDNA) promises a more efficient counting method. However, although eDNA correlates generally with local fish abundances, we do not know if eDNA can accurately enumerate salmon. Here we show that daily, and near-daily, flow-corrected eDNA rate closely tracks daily numbers of returning sockeye and coho spawners and outmigrating sockeye smolts. eDNA thus promises accurate and efficient enumeration, but to deliver the most robust numbers will need higher-resolution stream-flow data, at-least-daily sampling, and a focus on species with simple life histories, since shedding rate varies amongst jacks, juveniles, and adults.

AB  - The improved representation of inland aquatic (freshwater) and estuarine ecosystems and associated data was a key component of the 2018 National Biodiversity Assessment, and is an essential step in enhancing defensible land use planning and decision making. This paper reports on this enhancement of the National Wetland Map version 5 (NWM5) for South Africa and other data layers associated with the South African Inventory of Inland Aquatic Ecosystems. Detail is provided on (i) the extent of wetlands mapped in NWM5, compared to previous versions of the NWMs; (ii) the improved extent of inland wetlands mapped in focus areas in NWM5 relative to NWM4; (iii) the type of cover associated with the wetlands (inundated, vegetated or arid); (iv) the ecotone between rivers or inland wetlands and estuaries mapped as freshwater—estuarine transition zones; and (v) level of confidence for the inland wetlands in terms of how well the extent and hydrogeomorphic units were captured for each sub-quaternary catchment of South Africa. A total of 4 698 824 ha (3.9% of South Africa) of inland aquatic ecosystems and artificial wetlands have now been mapped, with NWM5 delineating 123% more inland wetlands (2 635 809 ha or 2.2% of SA) compared with NWM4. The estuarine functional zone, which encapsulates all estuarine processes, associated habitats and biota, was refined for 292 systems totalling 188 944 ha, with the addition of 42 micro-estuaries totalling 246 ha. Nearly 600 000 ha (0.5% of SA) of artificial wetlands were mapped in SA. Inland wetlands are predominantly palustrine (55%), some arid (34%) and few inundated systems (11%). Transition zones between freshwater ecosystems and estuaries formed a small fraction (&lt;1.5%) of river total extent (164 018 km), indicating an ecotone where biota and processes continuously vary from freshwater to estuarine. The majority of inland wetlands (~70%) had a low confidence ranking for designation of extent and typing. Future improvements of the map should be focussed on catchment-based improvements particularly in strategic water-source areas, areas of high development pressure and those with low confidence designation of wetland type.

AB  - Epitomized by the well-studied Astyanax mexicanus, cavefishes provide important model organisms to understand adaptations in response to divergent natural selection. However, the spectacular Sinocyclocheilus diversification of China, the most diverse cavefish clade in the world harboring nearly 75 species, demonstrate evolutionary convergence for many traits, yet remain poorly understood in terms of their morphological evolution. Here, using a broad sample of 49 species representative of this diversification, we analyze patterns of Sinocylocheilus evolution in a phylogenetic context. We categorized species into morphs based on eye-related condition: Blind, Micro-eyed (small-eyed), and Normal-eyed and we also considered three habitat types (Troglodytic – cave-restricted; Troglophilic – cave-associated; Surface – outside of caves). Geometric morphometric analyses show Normal-eyed morphs with fusiform shapes being segregated from Blind/Micro-eyed (Eye-regressed) morphs with deeper bodies along the first principal component (“PC”) axis. The second PC axis accounts for shape complexity related to the presence of horns. Ancestral character reconstructions of morphs suggest at least three independent origins of Blind morphs, each with different levels of modification in relation to the typical morphology of ancestral Normal-eyed morphs. Interestingly, only some Blind or Micro-eyed morphs bear horns and they are restricted to a single clade (Clade B) and arising from a Troglodytic ancestral species. Our geophylogeny shows an east-to-west diversification spanning the Pliocene and the Pleistocene, with Troglodytic species dominating karstic subterranean habitats of the plains whereas predominantly Surface species inhabit streams and pools in hills to the west (perhaps due to the scarcity of caves). Integration of morphology, phylogeny and geography suggests Sinocyclocheilus are pre-adapted for cave dwelling. Analyses of evolutionary rates suggest that lineages leading to Blind morphs were characterized by significant rate shifts, such as a slowdown in body size evolution and a 3.3 to 12.5 fold increase in the evolutionary rate of eye regression. Furthermore, body size and eye size have undergone reversals, but horns have not, a trait that seem to require substantial evolutionary time to form. These results, compared to the Astyanax model system, indicate Sinocyclocheilus fishes demonstrate extraordinary morphological diversity and variation, offering an invaluable model system to explore evolutionary novelty.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Target enrichment is becoming increasingly popular for phylogenomic studies. Although baits for enrichment are typically designed to target single-copy genes, paralogs are often recovered with increased sequencing depth, sometimes from a significant proportion of loci, especially in groups experiencing whole-genome duplication (WGD) events. Common approaches for processing paralogs in target enrichment datasets include random selection, manual pruning, and mainly, the removal of entire genes that show any evidence of paralogy. These approaches are prone to errors in orthology inference or removing large numbers of genes. By removing entire genes, valuable information that could be used to detect and place WGD events is discarded. Here we use an automated approach for orthology inference in a target enrichment dataset of 68 species of Alchemilla s.l. (Rosaceae), a widely distributed clade of plants primarily from temperate climate regions. Previous molecular phylogenetic studies and chromosome numbers both suggested ancient WGDs in the group. However, both the phylogenetic location and putative parental lineages of these WGD events remain unknown. By taking paralogs into consideration, we identified four nodes in the backbone of Alchemilla s.l. with an elevated proportion of gene duplication. Furthermore, using a gene-tree reconciliation approach we established the autopolyploid origin of the entire Alchemilla s.l. and the nested allopolyploid origin of four major clades within the group. Here we showed the utility of automated tree-based orthology inference methods, previously designed for genomic or transcriptomic datasets, to study complex scenarios of polyploidy and reticulate evolution from target enrichment datasets.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Invasive holoparasitic plants of the genus Cuscuta (dodder) threaten Africa’s ecosystems, due to their rapid spread and attack on various host plant species. Most Cuscuta species cannot photosynthesize, hence rely on host plants for nourishment. After attachment through a peg-like organ called a haustorium, the parasites deprive hosts of water and nutrients leading to their death. Despite their rapid spread in Africa, dodders have attracted limited research attention, although data on their taxonomy, host range and epidemiology are critical for their management. Here, we combine taxonomy and phylogenetics to reveal presence of field dodder (Cuscuta campestris) and C. kilimanjari (both either naturalized or endemic to East Africa), and for the first time in continental Africa, presence of the giant dodder (C. reflexa) a south Asian species. These parasites have a wide host range, parasitizing species across 13 angiosperm orders. Evaluating the possibility of C. reflexa to expand this host range to tea, coffee, and mango, crops of economic importance to Africa, revealed successful parasitism, following haustorial formation and vascular bundle connections in all three crops. However, only mango mounted a successful post-attachment resistance response. Furthermore, species distribution models predicted high habitat suitability for all three Cuscuta species across major tea- and coffee-growing regions of Eastern Africa, suggesting an imminent risk to these crops. Our findings provide relevant insights into a little-understood threat to biodiversity and economic wellbeing in Eastern Africa, and providing critical information to guide development of management strategies to avert their spread.Sentence Summary Microscopy and habitat suitability modeling provide an early warning that dodder’s invasion in Eastern Africa poses a threat to important cash crops

AB  - Duikers are among the most sought after antelope species for bush meat in central Africa. Estimates of population abundance of duikers based on reliable methods is therefore of prime importance for their sustainable management. Here we retrieved 31 studies from the literature and compared methods used to estimate the abundance of duiker populations in African rainforests. Implemented methods all derived from seven main combinations of sampling designs and population abundance estimators. We then evaluated the relevance of those seven methods by scoring them based on eight criteria selected according to their pros and cons reported in the litterature for large-scale population management of wildlife. For management purposes, methods derived from distance sampling offer the best compromise between the implementation costs and the biological information collected. In particular, both diurnal and nocturnal distance sampling can be recommended. Hunter calls and drive-netting are less reliable, but can be used in association with other measurements in the framework of indicators of ecological changes, a monitoring approach that has been successfully used in temperate ecosystems for managing large herbivores.Funding information Ministère de l’Environnement et du Développement Durable de la République Démocratique du Congo, Campus France and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS).Résumé Les céphalophes sont parmi les espèces d’antilopes les plus recherchées pour la viande de brousse en Afrique centrale.

Nous avons évalué la pertinence de ces sept méthodes sur la base de critères sélectionnés en fonction de leurs avantages et inconvénients pour une gestion à grande échelle de la population. Les méthodes dérivées de l’échantillonnage par distance offrent le meilleur compromis entre les coûts de mise en œuvre et les informations biologiques collectées. Les méthodes d’échantillonnage diurne et nocturne se sont montrées les plus satisfaisantes. Les méthodes d’appel par les chasseurs et de battue au filet sont moins fiables, mais peuvent être utilisées en association avec d’autres mesures biologiques comme indicateurs de changements écologiques, une approche qui a été utilisée avec succès dans les écosystèmes tempérés pour la gestion des grands herbivores.Mots-clés: gestion durable, grands herbivores, indicateurs de changement écologique, méthode de recensement, viande de brousse

AB  - Understanding the genetic causes of evolutionary diversification is challenging because differences across species are complex, often involving many genes. However, cases where single or few genetic loci affect a feature that varies dramatically across a radiation of species would provide tractable opportunities to understand the genetics of diversification. Here, we show the diversification of bioluminescent signals in cypridinid ostracods (“sea fireflies”) to be strongly influenced by a single gene, cypridinid-luciferase. We find different evolutionary processes, including selection, drift, and constraint, each acted on c-luciferase at different times during evolutionary history and impacted different phenotypes, diversifying behavioral signals across species. In particular, some amino acid sites in c-luciferase evolved under episodic diversifying selection, and are associated significantly with phenotypic changes in both enzyme kinetics and color, which impact signals directly. We also find that multiple other amino acid positions in c-luciferase evolved neutrally or under purifying selection and may have impacted the variation of color of bioluminescent signals across genera. This work provides a rare glimpse into the genetic basis of diversification across many species, showing how multiple evolutionary processes may act at different times during a radiation of species to diversify phenotypes. These results indicate not only selection but also drift and constraint may be important evolutionary drivers of species diversification.Significance statement A hallmark of life is its astounding diversity. While we are beginning to understand the drivers of biodiversity, uncovering the genetic basis remains challenging. As such, how different molecular evolutionary processes act to diversify phenotypes is a major question in biology. Here we show a single gene to be important in a riotous diversity of fantastical behaviors - the bioluminescent signals of sea fireflies - allowing us to demonstrate multiple evolutionary forces including selection, drift, and constraint contributed to diversification. Our work highlights that not only selection but also neutral processes and constraint have each worked at different times to shape phenotypic diversity.

AB  - Members of Solanum sect. Lycopersicum are commonly used as a source of exotic germplasm for improvement of the cultivated tomato, and are increasingly employed in basic research. Although it experienced significant early and ongoing work, the taxonomic status of many wild species in this section has undergone a number of significant revisions, and remains uncertain.Here, we examine the taxonomic status of obligately outcrossing Chilean wild tomato (Solanum chilense) using reduced-representation sequencing (RAD-seq), a range of phylogenetic and population genetic analyses, crossing data, and morphological data.Overall, each of our analyses provides some weight of evidence that the Pacific coastal populations and Andean inland populations of the currently described S. chilense represent separately evolving populations.Despite its vast economic importance, Solanum sect. Lycopersicon still exhibits considerable taxonomic instability. A pattern of under-recognition of outcrossing species may be common across flowering plants. We discuss the possible causes and implications of this observation, with a focus on macroevolutionary inference.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Benthic suspension feeders have significant impacts on plankton communities by depleting plankton or modifying composition of the plankton through prey selectivity. Quantifying diets of planktivorous animals can be difficult because plankton are frequently microscopic, may lack diagnostic characters, and are digested at variable rates. With DNA metabarcoding, the identification of gut contents has become faster and more accurate, and the technique allows for higher taxonomic resolution-n while also identifying rare and highly degraded items that would otherwise not be detected. We used DNA metabarcoding to examine the diet of the giant plumose anemone Metridium farcimen, a large, abundant, competitively-dominant anemone on subtidal rock surfaces and floating docks in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Gut contents of 12 individuals were compared to 80- and 330-μm filtered plankton samples collected one hour prior between 0.02 and 1.5 km from the anemones. The objectives of this study were to determine if M. farcimen has a selective diet and compare our findings with traditional gut content analyses. Metridium farcimen captured a wider range of prey than previously suspected and metabarcoding found many more taxa than traditional sampling techniques. Gut contents were less diverse than 80-μm filtered plankton samples, but more diverse than 330-μm filtered plankton samples. The diet of the anemones was 52% arthropods with a surprisingly high relative abundance of an ant (10%) that has mating flights in August when this study was conducted. The gut contents of M. farcimen likely include all prey that it can detect and that cannot escape. There were no overrepresented taxa in the gut contents compared to the plankton but there were underrepresented taxa. This study highlights the usefulness of the metabarcoding method in identifying prey within the gut of planktivorous animals and the significant terrestrial input into marine food webs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Haplanthodes (Acanthaceae) is an Indian endemic genus with four species. It is closely related to Andrographis which is also mainly distributed in India. Haplanthodes differs from Andrographis by the presence of cladodes in the inflorescences, sub actinomorphic flowers, stamens included within the corolla tube, pouched stamens and oblate pollen grains. To understand the phylogenetic relationship of Haplanthodes with Andrographis and Haplanthus, another related genus, we used four plastid markers, matK, rbcL, psbA-trnH and trnGR to construct a molecular phylogeny. Our results established the monophyly of this genus and revealed a sister relationship to Andrographis and Haplanthus. Further, to understand the historical biogeography of the genus, we inferred the divergence time and performed ancestral area reconstruction. Our analyses suggest that Haplanthodes has evolved during Late Miocene 5.85 Ma [95%HPD: 2.18-10.34 Ma] in peninsular India where it might have shared a common ancestor with Andrographis. To understand character evolution, the ancestral states of important morphological characters were inferred based on the equal rate model and discussed. The generic status of Haplanthus is not resolved due to incomplete sampling.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Across various animal groups, adaptation to the extreme conditions of cave environments has resulted in convergent evolution of morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits. We document a Neotropical cave fish system with ample potential to study questions related to convergent adaptation to cave environments at the population level. In the karstic region of the Andes of Santander, Colombia, cave-dwelling catfishes in the genus Trichomycterus exhibit variable levels of reduction of eyes and body pigmentation relative to surface congeners. We tested whether cave-dwelling, eye reduced, depigmented Trichomycterus from separate caves in Santander were the result of a single event of cave colonization and subsequent dispersal, or of multiple colonizations to caves by surface ancestors followed by phenotypic convergence. Using mitochondrial DNA sequences to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships of Trichomycterus from Santander, we found that caves in this region have been colonized independently by two separate clades. Additional events of cave colonization -and possibly recolonization of surface streams- may have occurred in one of the clades, where surface and cave-dwelling populations exhibit shallow mtDNA differentiation, suggesting recent divergence or divergence in the face of gene flow. We also identified various taxonomic challenges including both a considerable number of potentially undescribed species and likely problems with the circumscription of named taxa. The system appears especially promising for studies on a wide range of ecological and evolutionary questions.

AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV; genus Hepacivirus) represents a major public health problem, infecting about 3 % of the human population (± 185,000,000 people). Because no plausible animal reservoir carrying closely related hepaciviruses has been identified, the zoonotic origins of HCV still remain elusive. Motivated by recent findings of divergent hepaciviruses in rodents and a plausible African origin of HCV genotypes, we have screened a comprehensive collection of small mammals samples from seven sub-Saharan African countries. Out of 4,303 samples screened, 80 were found positive for the presence of hepaciviruses in 29 different host species. We here report 56 novel genomes that considerably increase the diversity of three divergent rodent hepacivirus lineages, which previously were almost exclusively represented by New World and European hepaciviruses. Further-more, we provide undisputable evidence for hepacivirus co-infections in rodents, which remarkably, we exclusively but repeatedly found in four sampled species of brush-furred mice. We also point at hepacivirus co-infections indirectly in different animal hosts by demonstrating evidence for recombination within specific host lineages. Our study considerably expands the available hepacivirus genomic data and elucidates the relatively deep evolutionary history that these pathogens have in rodents compared to other mammalian hosts. Overall, our results emphasize the importance of rodents as a potential hepacivirus reservoir and as models for investigating HCV infection dynamics.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Compared to selection on new mutations and standing genetic variation, the role of gene flow in generating adaptive genetic variation has been subject to much debate. Theory predicts that gene flow constrains adaptive evolution via natural selection by homogenizing allele frequencies among populations and introducing migrant alleles that may be locally maladaptive1. However, recent work has revealed that populations can diverge even when high levels of gene flow are present2–4 and that gene flow may play an underappreciated role in facilitating local adaptation by increasing the amount of genetic variation present for selection to act upon5–8. Here, we investigate how genetic variation introduced by gene flow contributes to adaptive evolution of complex traits using an emerging eco-evolutionary model system, the Mexican tetra (Astyanax mexicanus). The ancestral surface form of the Mexican tetra has repeatedly invaded and adapted to cave environments. The Chica cave is unique in that it contains several pool microenvironments inhabited by putative hybrids between surface and cave populations9, providing an opportunity to investigate the dynamics of complex trait evolution and gene flow on a local scale. Here we conduct high-resolution genomic mapping and analysis of eye morphology and pigmentation in fish from multiple pools within Chica cave. We demonstrate that hybridization between cave and surface populations contributes to highly localized variation in behavioral and morphological traits. Analysis of sleep and locomotor behaviors between individual pools within this cave revealed reduced sleep associated with an increase in ancestry derived from cave populations, suggesting pool-specific ecological differences may drive the highly-localized evolution of sleep and locomotor behaviors. Lastly, our analyses uncovered a compelling example of convergent evolution in a core circadian clock gene in multiple independent cavefish lineages and burrowing mammals, indicating a shared genetic mechanism underlying circadian disruption in subterranean vertebrates. Together, our results provide insight into the evolutionary mechanisms that promote adaptive genetic variation and the genetic basis of complex behavioral phenotypes involved in local adaptation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - For migratory species, seasonal movements complicate local climate adaptation, as it is unclear whether individuals track climate niches across the annual cycle. In the migratory songbird yellow warbler (Setophaga petechia), we find a correlation between individual-level wintering and breeding precipitation but not temperature. Birds wintering in the driest regions of the Neotropics breed in the driest regions of North America. Individuals from drier regions also possess distinct morphologies and population responses to varying rainfall. We find a positive association between bill size and breeding season precipitation which, given documented climate-associated genomic variation, might reflect adaptation to local precipitation regimes. Relative abundance in the breeding range is linked to interannual fluctuations in precipitation, but the directionality of this response varies across geography. Together, our results suggest that variation in climate optima may exist across the breeding range of yellow warblers and provide a mechanism for selection across the annual cycle.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Intraspecific diversity informs the demographic and evolutionary histories of populations, and should be a main conservation target. Although approaches exist for identifying relevant biological conservation units, attempts to identify priority conservation areas for intraspecific diversity are scarce, especially within a multi-specific framework. We used neutral molecular data on six European freshwater fish species (Squalius cephalus, Phoxinus phoxinus, Barbatula barbatula, Gobio occitaniae, Leuciscus burdigalensis and Parachondrostoma toxostoma) sampled at the riverscape scale (i.e. the Garonne-Dordogne River basin, France) to determine hot- and cold-spots of genetic diversity, and to identify priority conservation areas using a systematic conservation planning approach. We demonstrate that systematic conservation planning is efficient for identifying priority areas representing a predefined part of the total genetic diversity of a whole landscape. With the exception of private allelic richness, classical genetic diversity indices (allelic richness, genetic uniqueness) were poor predictors for identifying priority areas. Moreover, we identified weak surrogacies among conservation solutions found for each species, implying that conservation solutions are highly species-specific. Nonetheless, we showed that priority areas identified using intraspecific genetic data from multiple species provide more effective conservation solutions than areas identified for single species or on the basis of traditional taxonomic criteria.

AB  - Over 100 years of studies in Drosophila melanogaster and related species in the genus Drosophila have facilitated key discoveries in genetics, genomics, and evolution. While high-quality genome assemblies exist for several species in this group, they only encompass a small fraction of the genus. Recent advances in long read sequencing allow high quality genome assemblies for tens or even hundreds of species to be generated. Here, we utilize Oxford Nanopore sequencing to build an open community resource of high-quality assemblies for 101 lines of 95 drosophilid species encompassing 14 species groups and 35 sub-groups with an average contig N50 of 10.5 Mb and greater than 97% BUSCO completeness in 97/101 assemblies. These assemblies, along with detailed wet lab protocol and assembly pipelines, are released as a public resource and will serve as a starting point for addressing broad questions of genetics, ecology, and evolution within this key group.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Background Entomological monitoring of Aedes vectors has largely relied on surveillance of larvae, pupae and non-host-seeking adults, which have been poorly correlated with human disease incidence. Exposure to mosquito-borne diseases can be more directly estimated using Human Landing Catches (HLC), although this method is not recommended for Aedes-borne arboviruses. We evaluated a new method previously tested with malaria vectors, the Mosquito Electrocuting Trap (MET) as an exposure-free alternative for measuring landing rates of Aedes mosquitoes on people. Aims were to 1) compare the MET to the BG-sentinel (BGS) trap gold standard approach for sampling host-seeking Aedes vectors; 2) characterize the diel activity of Aedes vectors and their association with microclimatic conditions.Methods The study was conducted over 12 days in Quinindé – Ecuador in May 2017. Mosquito sampling stations were set up in the peridomestic area of four houses. On each day of sampling, each house was allocated either a MET or a BGS trap, which were rotated amongst the four houses daily in a Latin square design. Mosquito abundance and microclimatic conditions were recorded hourly at each sampling station between 07:00-19:00 hours to assess variation between vector abundance, trapping methods, and environmental conditions. All Aedes aegypti females were tested for the presence of Zika (ZIKV), dengue (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses.Results A higher number of Ae. aegypti females were found in MET than in BGS collections, although no statistically significant differences in mean Ae. aegypti abundance between trapping methods were found. Both trapping methods indicated female Ae. aegypti had bimodal patterns of host seeking, being highest during early morning and late afternoon hours. Mean Ae. aegypti daily abundance was negatively associated with daily temperature. No infection by ZIKV, DENV or CHIKV was detected in any Aedes mosquitoes caught by either trapping method.Conclusion We conclude the MET performs at least as well as the BGS standard, and offers the additional advantage of direct measurement of per capita human biting rates. If detection of arboviruses can be confirmed in MET-collected Aedes in future studies, this surveillance method could provide a valuable tool for surveillance and prediction on human arboviral exposure risk.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Language diversity is distributed unevenly over the globe. Why do some areas have so many different languages and other areas so few? Intriguingly, patterns of language diversity resemble biodiversity patterns, leading to suggestions that similar mechanisms may underlie both linguistic and biological diversification. Here we present the first global analysis of language diversity that identifies the relative importance of two key ecological mechanisms suggested to promote language diversification - isolation and ecological risk - after correcting for spatial autocorrelation and phylogenetic non-independence. We find significant effects of climate on language diversity consistent with the ecological risk hypothesis that areas of high year-round productivity lead to more languages by supporting human cultural groups with smaller distributions. Climate has a much stronger effect on language diversity than landscape features that might contribute to isolation of cultural groups, such as altitudinal variation, river density, or landscape roughness. The association between biodiversity and language diversity appears to be an incidental effect of their covariation with climate, rather than a causal link between the two. While climate and landscape provide strong explanatory signal for variation in language diversity, we identify a number of areas of high unexplained language diversity, with more languages than would be predicted from environmental features alone; notably New Guinea, the Himalayan foothills, West Africa, and Mesoamerica. Additional processes may be at play in generating higher than expected language diversity in these regions.

AB  - Persistence and extinction are key processes in infectious disease dynamics that, due to incomplete reporting, are seldom directly observable. For fully-immunizing diseases, reporting probabilities can be readily estimated from demographic records and case reports. Yet reporting probabilities are not sufficient to unambiguously reconstruct disease incidence from case reports. Here, we focus on disease presence (i.e., marginal probability of non-zero incidence), which provides an upper bound on the marginal probability of disease extinction. We examine measles and pertussis in pre-vaccine era U.S. cities, and describe a conserved scaling relationship between population size, reporting probability, and observed presence (i.e., non-zero case reports). We use this relationship to estimate disease presence given perfect reporting, and define cryptic presence as the difference between estimated and observed presence. We estimate that, in early 20th century U.S. cities, pertussis presence was higher than measles presence across a range of population sizes, and that cryptic presence was common in small cities with imperfect reporting. While the methods employed here are specific to fully-immunizing diseases, our results suggest that cryptic incidence deserves careful attention, particularly in diseases with low case counts, poor reporting, and longer infectious periods.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Forest canopies are hotspots of biodiversity even in temperate forests but which and how many ecological mechanisms contribute to the high diversity remains elusive. This biodiversity is not distributed evenly throughout the complex fractal structures formed by individual tree crowns. They are non-stationary, constantly expose new surface habitat via growth, and create contrasting abiotic conditions. These features give rise to a range of vertical gradients in habitat optimality, heterogeneity, available surface area and time for succession - all known to be mechanisms shaping diversity patterns. Using a canopy crane facility and epiphytic lichens on Fraxinus excelsior and Quercus robur as model system, we aim to assess the relative importance as well as the interplay of these mechanisms in shaping biodiversity patterns within tree canopies by detecting their distinct mechanistic fingerprints. Lichen species richness exhibited a hump-shaped vertical pattern, skewed towards the top of the crown. This pattern was observable at both the level of individual plots and that of aggregate height layers and it was correlated with lichen cover. Also, a vertical gradient in species composition was found and could be related to species traits known to reflect successional niches such as dispersal mode and growth form. Habitat heterogeneity and available surface area have been found to have little effect on vertical lichen diversity patterns. We conclude that the vertical lichen diversity patterns in the tree crown are mainly shaped by the successional accumulation of species along a branch age gradient and a pronounced vertical gradient in environmental optimality from harshly exposed young branches at the top crown over suitable habitats with a balance in light and humidity towards the limiting light conditions in the dim understory. At the level of the whole canopy, successional and environmental niche dynamics jointly operate to generate lichen diversity.

AB  - Background Morphological traits offer insights into an organism’s ecological niche, species interactions, and patterns of community organisation. Pantropical lineages - animals and plants distributed across the three tropical continental regions of Asia, Africa, and America - provide a way to test how different environments and communities influence morphological diversification. Here, we examined a monophyletic group of frugivorous birds, the barbets and toucans (Ramphastoidea), which diversified independently on three continents, to investigate whether clades in each region exhibit similar (phylogenetically constrained) or distinct (ecologically influenced) patterns of morphological diversification.Results Our results show that despite differences in community dynamics in these regions, lineage accumulation patterns through time on all three continents are broadly similar, putatively due to phylogenetic niche conservatism. We quantified morphological variation in light of phylogenetic relatedness to further reveal that all barbet lineages across continents occupy a conserved region of morphospace after correcting for variation in size. However, in the Neotropics, one lineage, the toucans, have diverged dramatically from typical barbet space and converged toward (yet are distinct from) the trait space occupied by the distantly related hornbills in Asia and Africa. Additionally, we found no link between climatic variables and morphological traits. We conclude that barbets exhibit a conserved morphotype across continents and have diversified by scaling mainly in body size. However, the absence of other large frugivorous birds may have allowed toucans to diversify into a different region of morphospace of increased bill/wing to tail/wing ratios.Conclusions A combination of photographic and specimen measurements enabled us to demonstrate the presence of a globally conserved barbet morphotype across three tropical continents. By examining different continental lineages of a single monophyletic bird group, we shed light on the contrasting effects of regional ecological factors and phylogenetic constraints on morphological diversification.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Adaptive radiation is an important mechanism of organismal diversification, and can be triggered by new ecological opportunities. Although poorly studied in this regard, parasites present an ideal system to study adaptive radiations because of their close associations with host species. Both experimental and comparative studies suggest that the ectoparasitic wing lice of pigeons and doves have undergone an adaptive radiation, resulting in differences in both body size and overall coloration. Here we show that long-distance dispersal by dove hosts was important for parasite diversification, providing new ecological opportunities for parasites to speciate by host-switching. We further show that these new opportunities for host-switching decreased over time, and cospeciation became the more dominant mode of parasite speciation. Taken together, our results suggest that host dispersal, followed by host-switching, provided novel ecological opportunities that facilitated adaptive radiation by parasites.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Human-mediated transport creates secondary contacts between genetically differentiated lineages, bringing new opportunities for gene exchange. When similar introductions occur in different places, they provide informally replicated experiments for studying hybridisation. We here examined 4279 Mytilus mussels, sampled in Europe and genotyped with 77 ancestry informative markers. We identified a type of introduced mussels, called ‘dock mussels’, associated with port habitats and displaying a particular genetic signal of admixture between M. edulis and the Mediterranean lineage of M. galloprovincialis. These mussels exhibit similarities in their ancestry compositions, regardless of the local native genetic backgrounds and the distance separating colonised ports. We observed fine-scale genetic shifts at the port entrance, at scales below natural dispersal distance. Such sharp clines do not fit with migration-selection tension zone models, and instead suggest habitat choice and early stage adaptation to the port environment, possibly coupled with connectivity barriers. Variations in the spread and admixture patterns of dock mussels seem to be influenced by the local native genetic backgrounds encountered. We next examined departures from the average admixture rate at different loci, and compared human-mediated admixture events, to naturally admixed populations and experimental crosses. When the same M. galloprovincialis background was involved, positive correlations in the departures of loci across locations were found; but when different backgrounds were involved, no or negative correlations were observed. While some observed positive correlations might be best explained by a shared history and saltatory colonisation, others are likely produced by parallel selective events. Altogether, genome-wide effect of admixture seems repeatable, and more dependent on genetic background than environmental context. Our results pave the way towards further genomic analyses of admixture, and monitoring of the spread of dock mussels both at large and fine spacial scales.

AB  - Voles can reach high densities with multi-annual population fluctuations of large amplitude, and they are at the base of large and rich communities of predators in temperate and arctic food webs. This status places them at the heart of management conflicts wherein crop protection and health concerns are often raised against conservation issues. Here, a 20-year survey describes the effects of large variations in grassland vole populations on the densities and the daily theoretical food intakes (TFI) of vole predators based on roadside counts. Our results show how the predator community responds to prey variations of large amplitude and how it reorganized with the increase in a dominant predator, here the red fox, which likely negatively impacted hare, European wildcat and domestic cat populations. They also indicate which subset of predator species might have a role in vole population control in the critical phase of a low density of grassland voles. Our study provides empirical support for more timely and better focused actions in wildlife management and vole population control, and it supports an evidence-based and constructive dialogue about management targets and options between all stakeholders of such socio-ecosystems.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Thermodynamics predicts a positive correlation between environmental redox potential and oxidation state of molecules; if found for microbial communities it would imply a new kind of deterministic eco-evolutionary process. This study examines evidence for local- and global-scale correlations between oxidation-reduction potential (ORP or Eh) in environmental samples and carbon oxidation state (ZC) of estimated bacterial and archaeal community proteomes. Seventy-nine public datasets for seven environment types (river &amp; seawater, lake &amp; pond, alkaline spring, hot spring, groundwater, sediment, and soil) were analyzed. Taxonomic abundances inferred from high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequences were combined with NCBI Reference Sequence (RefSeq) proteomes to estimate the amino acid compositions and chemical formulas (CcHhNnOoSs) of community proteomes, which yield ZC. Alkaline hot springs have the lowest ZC for both bacterial and archaeal domains of any environment. Positive global correlations between redox potential and ZC are found for bacterial communities in lake &amp; pond, groundwater, and soil environments, but not archaeal communities, suggesting a broad ecological signal of chemical shaping in Bacteria.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Alien molluscs pose a serious threat to global freshwater diversity and have been implicated in many ecosystem-altering invasion events over the past few decades. Biomonitoring surveys are therefore a key tool for ensuring biosecurity in diversity hotspots and vulnerable habitats. In this study, we use DNA barcoding to provide the first record of the viviparid, Sinotaia cf. quadrata from North America. Reciprocal monophyly and low genetic divergence (uncorrected p-distance: 0.004) with a Bellamya quadrata individual from the type region (China) provides strong support for this identification. The species was recovered as part of a routine biomonitoring survey of the Adirondack region of northern New York. Only three adults were recovered (no populations or juveniles) indicating that the discovery represents a very recent arrival. Considering the proximity of the sampling site from the massive St. Lawrence River, it is likely that S. cf. quadrata was introduced into the St. Lawrence, probably via the aquarium plant trade, and was able to spread into smaller river system in northern New York and possibly other border states. This record represents the fourth alien viviparid, the third of which is of Asian origin, that have made its way to New York waters. Future biomonitoring efforts for the upcoming summer period will involve targeted searches for S. cf. quadrata to determine the extent of its spread in the region.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Migration influences population dynamics on networks, thereby playing a vital role in scenarios ranging from species extinction to epidemic propagation. While low migration rates prevent local populations from becoming extinct, high migration rates enhance the risk of global extinction by synchronizing the dynamics of connected populations. Here, we investigate this trade-off using two mutualistic strains of E. coli that exhibit population oscillations when co-cultured. In experiments, as well as in simulations using a mechanistic model, we observe that high migration rates lead to in-phase synchronization whereas intermediate migration rates perturb the oscillations and change their period. Further, our simulations predict, and experiments show, that connected populations subjected to more challenging antibiotic concentrations have the highest probability of survival at intermediate migration rates. Finally, we identify altered population dynamics, rather than recolonization, as the primary cause of extended survival.

AB  - Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) experiments have predominantly focused on communities of higher organisms, in particular plants, with comparably little known to date about the relevance of biodiversity for microbially-driven biogeochemical processes. Methanotrophic bacteria play a key role in Earth’s methane (CH4) cycle by removing atmospheric CH4 and reducing emissions from methanogenesis in wetlands and landfills. Here, we used a dilution-to-extinction approach to simulate diversity loss in a methanotrophic landfill cover soil community. Combining analyses of CH4 flux and community structure, we found a linear decrease of CH4 oxidation rates with the number of taxonomic units lost. This effect was independent of community size, consistent over the three-month study, and occurred in relatively diverse communities, challenging the notion of high functional redundancy mediating high resistance to diversity erosion in natural microbial systems. The effects we report resemble the ones for higher organisms, suggesting that BEF-relationships are universal across taxa and spatial scales.

AB  - The oceans are in a state of rapid change – both negatively, due climate destabilization and misuse, and positively, due to strengthening of policies for sustainable use combined with momentum to grow the blue economy. Globally, more than 121 million people enjoy nature-based marine tourism — e.g., recreational fishing, diving, whale watching — making it one of the largest marine sectors. This industry is increasingly threatened by ocean degradation and management has not kept pace to ensure long-term sustainability. In response, individuals within the industry are taking it upon themselves to monitor the oceans and provide the data needed to assist management decisions. Fiji is one such place where the dive tourism industry is motivated to monitor the oceans (e.g., track sharks). In 2012, 39 dive operators in collaboration with eOceans commenced the Great Fiji Shark Count (GFSC) to document sharks (and other species) on 592 dive sites. Here, using 146,304 shark observations from 30,668 dives we document spatial patterns of 11 shark species. High variability demonstrates the value of longitudinal data that include absences for describing mobile megafauna and the capacity of stakeholders to document the oceans. Our results may be used to guide future scientific questions, provide a baseline for future assessments, or to evaluate conservation needs. It also shows the value of scientists collaborating with stakeholders to address questions that are most important to the local community so that they have the information needed to make science-based decisions.

AB  - Sub-Saharan savanna ecosystems are undergoing transitions such as bush encroachment, desertification or agricultural expansion. Such shifts and persistence of land cover are increasingly well understood, especially bush encroachment which is of major concern in pastoral systems. Although dominant factors can explain such transformations, they often result from intertwined causes in which human activities play a significant role. Therefore, in this latter case, these issues may require integrated solutions, involving many interacting components. Ecosystem modelling has proved appropriate to support decision-makers in such complex situations. However, ecosystem models often require lots of quantitative information for estimating parameters and the precise functional form of interactions is often unknown. Alternatively, in rangeland management, States-and-Transitions Models (STMs) have been developed to organize knowledge about system transitions and to help decision-makers. However, these conceptual diagrams often lack mathematical analyzing tools, which strongly constrains their complexity. In this paper, we introduce the Ecological Discrete-Event Network (EDEN) modelling approach for representing the qualitative dynamics of an East-African savanna as a set of discrete states and transitions generated from empirical rules. These rules are derived from local knowledge, field observations and scientific literature. In contrast with STMs, EDEN generates automatically every possible states and transitions, thus enabling the prediction of novel ecosystem structures. Our results show that the savanna is potentially resilient to the disturbances considered. Moreover, the model highlights all transitions between vegetation types and socio-economic profiles under various climatic scenarios. The model also suggests that wildlife diversity may increase socio-economic resistance to seasonal drought. Tree-grass coexistence and agropastoralism have the widest ranges of conditions of existence of all vegetation types and socio-economic profiles, respectively. As this is a preliminary use of EDEN for applied purpose, analysis tools should be improved to enable finer investigation of desirable trajectories. By translating local knowledge into ecosystem dynamics, the EDEN approach seems promising to build a new bridge between managers and modellers.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The role of infectious disease in regulating host populations is increasingly recognized, but how environmental conditions affect pathogen communities and infection levels remains poorly understood. Over three years, we compared foliar disease burden, fungal pathogen community composition, and foliar chemistry in the perennial bunchgrass Stipa pulchra occurring in adjacent serpentine and nonserpentine grassland habitats with distinct soil types and plant communities. We found that serpentine and nonserpentine S. pulchra experienced consistent, low disease pressure associated with distinct fungal pathogen communities with high interannual species turnover. Additionally, plant chemistry differed with habitat type. The results indicate that this species experiences minimal foliar disease associated with diverse fungal communities that are structured across landscapes by spatially and temporally variable conditions. Distinct fungal communities associated with different growing conditions may shield S. pulchra from large disease outbreaks, contributing to the low disease burden observed on this and other Mediterranean grassland species.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - In the face of global pollinator declines, plant-pollinator interaction networks have been studied to guide ecological conservation and restoration. In order to obtain more comprehensive and unbiased knowledge of these networks, perspectives of both plants and pollinators need to be considered integratively. Metabarcoding has seen increasing applications in characterizing pollen transported by pollinators. However, amplification bias across taxa could lead to unpredictable artefacts in pollen compositions. We examined the efficacy of a PCR-free genome-skimming method in quantifying mixed pollen, using mock samples constructed with known pollen species (5 mocks of flower pollen and 14 mocks of bee pollen). The results demonstrated a high level of repeatability and accuracy in identifying pollen from mixtures of varied species ratios. All pollen species were detected in all mock samples, and pollen frequencies estimated from the number of sequence reads of each species were significantly correlated with pollen count proportions (linear model, R2 =86.7%, P = 2.2e- 16). For &gt;97% of the mixed taxa, pollen proportion could be quantified by sequencing to the correct order of magnitude, even for species which constituted only 0.2% of the total pollen. We also showed that DNA extracted from pollen grains equivalent to those collected from a single honeybee corbicula was sufficient for the genome-skimming pipeline. We conclude that genome-skimming is a feasible approach to identifying and quantifying pollen compositions for mixed pollen samples. By providing reliable and sensitive taxon identification and relative abundance, this method is expected to improve the understanding of pollen diversity transported by pollinators and their ecological roles in the plant-pollinator networks.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - A multitude of landscape characterisation and mapping methods exist, but few methods take into account that landscapes properties vary in a gradual, continuous manner along multiple directions of variation. In this study, we used gradient analytic methods, rooted in ecological continuum theory, to analyse landscape variation throughout Norway. The aim is to explain differences in landscape properties in the simplest possible way, by identifying ‘complex landscape gradients’ (CLGs), i.e. composite gradients of co-occurring landscape elements and properties.We collected data by stratified sampling of 100 test areas (20×20 km), in which we delineated a total of 3966 observation units (landscape polygons 4–30 km²) based on geomorphological criteria. For each observation unit, 85 landscape variables were recorded. We identified patterns of variation in landscape element composition by parallel use of two multivariate statistical methods, detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and global nonmetric multidimensional scaling (GNMDS).The analyses revealed that the most important properties explaining differences in total landscape elements composition was location of the landscape relative to the coastline and coarse-scale landform variation. Most landscape elements had distinct optima within specific segments along broad-scale complex-gradients in landscape properties. A tentative landscape-type hierarchy was built by an iterative procedure by which the amount of compositional turnover in landscape-element composition between adjacent types was standardised. Six ‘major landscape types’ were identified based on geomorphological criteria. Within each major type, we identified a unique set of 2–5 important CLGs, representing geo-ecological, bio-ecological, and land use-related landscape variation. Minor landscape types were obtained by combining segments along two or more CLGs.The study shows that geological diversity, biological diversity and human land-use are tightly intertwined at the landscape level of ecological complexity, and that predominantly abiotic processes control and constrain both biotic processes and human land use.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Catastrophic events, such as volcanic eruptions, can have profound impacts on the demographic histories of resident taxa. Due to its presumed effect on biodiversity, the Pleistocene eruption of super-volcano Toba has received abundant attention. We test the effects of the Toba eruption on the diversification, genetic diversity, and demography of three co-distributed species of parachuting frogs (Genus Rhacophorus) on Sumatra. We generate target-capture data (∼950 loci and ∼440,000 bp) for three species of parachuting frogs and use these data paired with previously generated double digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRADseq) data to estimate population structure and genetic diversity, to test for population size changes using demographic modelling, and to estimate the temporal clustering of size change events using a full-likelihood Bayesian method. We find that populations around Toba exhibit reduced genetic diversity compared with southern populations, and that northern populations exhibit a shift in effective population size around the time of the eruption (∼80 kya). However, we infer a stronger signal of expansion in southern populations around ∼400 kya, and at least two of the northern populations may have also expanded at this time. Taken together, these findings suggest that the Toba eruption precipitated population declines in northern populations, but that the demographic history of these three species was also strongly impacted by mid-Pleistocene forest expansion during glacial periods. We propose local rather than regional effects of the Toba eruption, and emphasize the dynamic nature of diversification on the Sunda Shelf.

AB  - We analyze the number of marine fish species as a function of fish body size and occurrence depth. For this purpose, we analyze the FishBase database. We compare these data to predictions of fish species numbers derived from the neutral theory of biodiversity combined with well-established ecological scaling laws, and measured oceanic biomass data. We consider several variants of these scaling laws, and we find that more large fish species exist compared to the prediction, which is especially true for elasmobranchs, possibly due to their overwhelmingly predatory niches. We find species numbers decreasing with occurrence depth somewhat quicker than our predictions based on the decrease of the number of individuals with depth indicates. This is especially true for the elasmobranchs. This is unsurprising, since the individuals versus depth data did not specifically determine elasmobranch biomass, and since sharks are known to be limited to depths &lt; 3,000 m.Finally, we discuss how a reduced rate of speciation in larger animals could explain why large species are rare, in spite of the advantages of large body sizes outlined in Cope’s rule.

AB  - The need to monitor and protect biodiversity has never been greater, yet resources are often constrained economically. The ecosystem service paradigm could promote nature conservation while sustaining economic activity and other societal benefits, but most efforts to assess biodiversity-ecosystem service (B-ES) links have focused on diversity measures, with little attention on how species abundance relates to the magnitude of ES provision.Here, we utilised four national scale, multi-decadal, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) datasets to investigate links between juvenile density, the abundance of returning adults, and two measures of recreational angling provision: rod catches and angling effort.Recreational rod catches only tracked juvenile density and returning adult numbers in catchments where juvenile and adult numbers were decreasing, implying important early-warning of ES decline. In contrast, angling effort declined consistently through time.Synthesis and applications. These data illustrate i) the difficulty in measuring ES in ways that explicitly relate human resource use to nature conservation, and ii) the need for better quantification of populations at all life stages that determine ES provision, particularly in species where long-distance movements bring exposure to multiple global pressures. We suggest additional opportunities (e.g., monitoring of smolts, eDNA and citizen science initiatives) to facilitate conservation efforts and increase capacity to monitor ecosystem service sustainability.

AB  - Prairies of the Pacific Northwest are highly threatened, with only ∼2% of historic land area remaining. The combined risk of global climate change and land use change make these prairies a high conservation priority. However, little attention has been paid to the microbiota of these systems, including the hyper diverse fungi that live asymptomatically in their leaves, the endophytes. Using culture-free, full-community DNA sequencing, we investigated the diversity, composition, and structure of full fungal foliar endophyte and ecological guild communities in two native, cool-season bunchgrasses along a climate gradient. We quantified the relative importance of host, host fitness, environment, and spatial structuring in microbial community structure. We found markedly different communities between the southern and central-northern sites, suggesting a potential dispersal limitation in the Klamath Mountains. We also found that each host species was home to distinct fungal communities. Climate was the strongest predictor of endophyte community, while fitness (e.g., plant size, reproductive status, density) was less important for community structure. For both host species, seasonality contributed strongly to the variation we observed. At the ecological guild level, saprotrophs tended to decline with latitude, whereas symbiotrophs and pathotrophs both tended to increase with latitude. Our results suggest that climate change will have large consequences for these diverse fungal communities.

AB  - Physical inactivity – specifically the lack of moderate-to-vigorous activity – is a scourge to human health, promoting metabolic disease and muscle wasting. Interestingly, multiple ecological niches have relaxed investment into physical activity, providing unique evolutionary insight into adaptive physical inactivity. The Mexican cavefish Astyanax mexicanus lost moderate-to-vigorous activity following cave colonization, reaching basal swim speeds ~3-fold slower than their river-dwelling counterpart. We found that this was accompanied by a marked shift in body composition, decreasing muscle mass by 30% and increasing fat mass by 40%. This shift persisted at the single muscle fiber level via increased lipid and sugar accumulation at the expense of myofibrillar volume. Transcriptomic analysis of laboratory-reared and wild-caught cavefish indicated this shift in investment is driven by increased expression of pparγ – the master regulator of adipogenesis – with a simultaneous decrease in fast myosin heavy chain expression. Ex vivo and in vivo analysis confirmed these investment strategies come with a functional trade-off, decreasing cavefish muscle fiber shortening velocity, time to maximal force, and ultimately maximal swimming velocity. Despite this, cavefish displayed a striking degree of muscular endurance, reaching maximal swim speeds ~3.5-fold faster than their basal swim speeds. Multi-omics analysis indicated metabolic reprogramming, specifically increased phosphoglucomutase-1 abundance, phosphorylation, and activity, as contributing mechanisms enhancing cavefish glycogen utilization under metabolically strenuous conditions. Collectively, we reveal broad skeletal muscle reprogramming following cave colonization, displaying an adaptive skeletal muscle phenotype reminiscent to mammalian disuse and high-fat models while simultaneously maintaining a unique capacity for sustained muscle contraction under fatiguing conditions.Significance The evolutionary consequence of decreased physical activity upon skeletal muscle physiology remains unexplored. Using the Mexican cavefish, we find loss of moderate-to-vigorous swimming following cave colonization has resulted in broad shifts in skeletal muscle investment – away from muscle mass and instead toward fat and sugar accumulation – ultimately decreasing muscle fiber twitch kinetics. Surprisingly though, cavefish possessed marked muscular endurance, reaching maximal swimming speeds rivaling their river-dwelling counterpart. Multi-omics analysis revealed carbohydrate metabolic reprogramming as a contributing component, most notably elevated abundance and phosphorylation of the glycogenolytic enzyme Phosphoglucomutase-1 – a likely adaptation to cave-specific hypoxia. These findings emphasize the impact multiple selective pressures have on skeletal muscle physiology, providing the first evolutionary insight into skeletal muscle adaptation following decreased activity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Earth is home to over 350,000 vascular plant species1 that differ in their traits in innumerable ways. Yet, a handful of functional traits can help explaining major differences among species in photosynthetic rate, growth rate, reproductive output and other aspects of plant performance2–6. A key challenge, coined “the Holy Grail” in ecology, is to upscale this understanding in order to predict how natural or anthropogenically driven changes in the identity and diversity of co-occurring plant species drive the functioning of ecosystems7, 8. Here, we analyze the extent to which 42 different ecosystem functions can be predicted by 41 plant traits in 78 experimentally manipulated grassland plots over 10 years. Despite the unprecedented number of traits analyzed, the average percentage of variation in ecosystem functioning that they jointly explained was only moderate (32.6%) within individual years, and even much lower (12.7%) across years. Most other studies linking ecosystem functioning to plant traits analyzed no more than six traits, and when including either only six random or the six most frequently studied traits in our analysis, the average percentage of explained variation in across-year ecosystem functioning dropped to 4.8%. Furthermore, different ecosystem functions were driven by different traits, with on average only 12.2% overlap in significant predictors. Thus, we did not find evidence for the existence of a small set of key traits able to explain variation in multiple ecosystem functions across years. Our results therefore suggest that there are strong limits in the extent to which we can predict the long-term functional consequences of the ongoing, rapid changes in the composition and diversity of plant communities that humanity is currently facing.

AB  - Woolly ash aphid or ash leaf curl aphid Prociphilus fraxinifolii (Riley, 1879) is an alien invasive pest of ash trees native to North America. After its first record in Europe in 2003 in Hungary it has spread to the Ukraine, Serbia, Bulgaria, Great Britain, Spain, Poland and Germany. In 2016 P. fraxinifolii was firstly recorded at the southwestern border of Russia. Now Prociphilus fraxinifolii is firstly recorded in the center of European Russia, namely in Moscow Region, which is more than 700 km far from all other known localities of the species. In September 2017 five groups of ash trees (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) with colonies of Prociphilus fraxinifolii were found in Moscow Region. The example of Prociphilus fraxinifolii shows that alien pest insects can spread in Europe very quickly. Now Moscow region is the only regions of Europe, where the expanding range of Prociphilus fraxinifolii has overlapped with expanding ranges of other invasive alien species established in Europe in the last 20 years and severely damaging ash trees: ash dieback fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus Baral et al., 2014 (Ascomycota) and emerald ash borer Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, 1888 (Coleoptera: Buprestidae).

AB  - The geographic distribution of phenotypic variation among closely related populations is a valuable source of information about the evolutionary processes that generate and maintain biodiversity. Leapfrog distributions, in which phenotypically similar populations are disjunctly distributed and separated by one or more phenotypically distinct populations, represent geographic replicates for the existence of a phenotype, and are therefore especially informative. These geographic patterns have mostly been studied from phylogenetic perspectives to understand how common ancestry and divergent evolution drive their formation. Other processes, such as gene flow between populations, have not received as much attention. Here we investigate the roles of divergence and gene flow between populations in the origin and maintenance of a leapfrog distribution in Phyllobates poison frogs. We found evidence for high levels of gene flow between neighboring populations but not over long distances, indicating that gene flow between populations exhibiting the central phenotype may have a homogenizing effect that maintains their similarity, and that introgression between “leapfroging” taxa has not played a prominent role as a driver of phenotypic diversity in Phyllobates. Although phylogenetic analyses suggest that the leapfrog distribution was formed through independent evolution of the peripheral (i.e. leapfrogging) populations, the elevated levels of gene flow between geographically close populations poise alternative scenarios, such as the history of phenotypic change becoming decoupled from genome-averaged patterns of divergence, which we cannot rule out. These results highlight the importance of incorporating gene flow between populations into the study of geographic variation in phenotypes, both as a driver of phenotypic diversity and as a confounding factor of phylogeographic inferences.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Severe insect declines make headlines, but they are rarely based on systematic monitoring outside of Europe. We estimate the rate of change in total butterfly abundance and the population trends for 81 species using 21 years of systematic monitoring in Ohio, USA. Total abundance is declining at 2% per year, resulting in a cumulative 33% reduction in butterfly abundance. Three times as many species have negative population trends compared to positive trends. The rate of total decline and the proportion of species in decline mirror those documented in three comparable long-term European monitoring programs. Multiple environmental changes such as climate change, habitat degradation, and agricultural practices may contribute to these declines in Ohio and shift the makeup of the butterfly community by benefiting some species over others. Our analysis of life-history traits associated with population trends shows an impact of climate change, as species with northern distributions and fewer annual generations declined more rapidly. However, even common and invasive species associated with human-dominated landscapes are declining, suggesting widespread environmental causes for these trends. Declines in common species, although they may not be close to extinction, will have an outsized impact on the ecosystem services provided by insects. These results from the most extensive, systematic insect monitoring program in North America demonstrate an ongoing defaunation in butterflies that on an annual scale might be imperceptible, but cumulatively has reduced butterfly numbers by a third over 20 years.

AB  - With frequent host shifts involving the colonization of new hosts across large geographical ranges, crop pests are good models for examining the mechanisms of rapid colonization. The microbial partners of pest insects may also be involved in or affected by colonization processes, which has been little studied so far. We investigated the demographic history of the rosy apple aphid, Dysaphis plantaginea, a major pest of the cultivated apple (Malus domestica) in Europe, North Africa and North America, as well as the diversity of its microbiota. We genotyped a comprehensive sample of 714 colonies from Europe, Morocco and the US using mitochondrial (CytB and CO1), bacterial (16s rRNA and TrnpB), and 30 microsatellite markers. We detected five populations spread across the US, Morocco, Western and Eastern Europe and Spain. Populations showed weak genetic differentiation and high genetic diversity, except the ones from Morocco and North America that are likely the result of recent colonization events. Coalescent-based inferences revealed high levels of gene flow among populations during the colonization but did not allow determining the sequence of colonization of Europe, North America and Morroco by D. plantaginea, likely because of the weak genetic differentiation and the occurrence of gene flow among populations. We found that D. plantaginea rarely hosts other endosymbiotic bacteria than its obligate nutritional symbiont Buchnera aphidicola. This suggests that secondary endosymbionts did not play an important role in the rapid spread of the rosy apple aphid. These findings have fundamental importance for understanding pest colonization processes and implications for sustainable pest control programs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors of this preprint declare that they have no financial conflict of interest with the content of this article.

AB  - Rapid environmental changes expected in the 21st century challenge the resilience of wildlands around the world. The western portion of the Lake Tahoe basin (LTW) in California is an important ecological and cultural hotspot that is at risk of degradation from current and future environmental pressures. Historical uses, fire suppression, and a changing climate have created forest landscape conditions at risk of drought stress, destructive fire, and loss of habitat diversity. We prospectively modeled forest landscape conditions for a period of 100 years to evaluate the efficacy of five unique management scenarios in achieving desired landscape conditions across the 23,600 hectares of LTW. Management scenarios ranged from no management other than fire suppression to applying treatments consistent with historical fire frequencies and extent (i.e., regular and broadscale biomass reduction). We developed a decision support tool to evaluate environmental and social outcomes within a single framework to provide a transparent set of costs and benefits; results illuminated underlying mechanisms of forest resilience and provided actionable guidance to decision makers. Sixteen attributes were assessed in the model after assigning weights to each, derived through a survey of stakeholder priorities, so that the contribution of each attribute to evaluations of scenario performance was influenced by the combined priorities of stakeholders. We found that removing forest biomass across the landscape, particularly when accomplished using extensive fire-based removal techniques, led to highly favorable conditions for environmental quality and promoting overall landscape resilience. Environmental conditions resulting from extensive fire-based biomass removal also had nominal variation over time, in contrast with strategies that had less extensive and/or used physical removal techniques, namely thinning. Our analysis provided a transparent approach to data assessment, considering the priorities of stakeholders, to provide insights into the complexities of maintaining optimal conditions and managing landscapes to promote ecosystem resilience in a changing world.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Madagascar is recognized both for its unparalleled biodiversity and the high level of threat suffered by this biodiversity, associated in particular with anthropogenic deforestation. Despite sustained efforts to fight poverty and curb deforestation, forest cover in Madagascar is rapidly decreasing. To try to explain why it is so difficult to stop deforestation in Madagascar, we analysed the recent deforestation process in Western Madagascar through satellite image analysis and field surveys. We show that deforestation has increased from less than 0.9%/yr on 2000–2010 to more than 2%/yr on 2010–2017. We identified two major causes of deforestation, which were not associated with subsistence agriculture: slash-and-burn agriculture for the cultivation of cash crops (maize and peanut), and uncontrolled fires to create open pasture. Maize production is mainly at the destination of the domestic market and is used in particular for livestock feeding. Peanut production has boomed since 2013 and more than half of it is now exported towards asiatic countries. The money earned by farmers is principally invested into zebu herd acquisition. Trade of agricultural commodities benefits several intermediaries, some of whom have political responsibilities thus creating conflicts of interest. On the other hand, agents from institutions in charge of the management of the protected areas have no means to enforce laws against deforestation. In the absence of an efficient strategy to stop deforestation, we predicted that 38-93% of the forest present in 2000 will have disappeared in 2050. Forest loss, apart from biodiversity loss and climate-change global issues, will be at the expense of local population. In order to stop deforestation, international aid should be used to improve local governance to enforce environmental laws and pressure should be put on trading companies to buy certified agricultural commodities that are not derived from deforestation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

TI  - Co-occurrence or dependence? Using spatial analyses to explore the interaction between palms and triatomines (Chagas disease insect vectors)
AU  - Calderón, Johan M.
AU  - González, Camila
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Background Triatomine kissing bugs are responsible for the vectorial transmission of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, etiological agent of Chagas disease, a zoonosis affecting 10 million people and with 25 million at risk of infection. Triatomines are associated with particular habitats that offer shelter and food. Several triatomine species of the Rhodnius genus have close association with palm crowns, where bugs can obtain blood from the associated fauna. The Rhodnius - palm interaction has been reported in several places of Central and South America. However, the association in the distributions of Rhodnius species and palms has not been quantitatively determined.Methodology/Principal Findings Broad distributions of eight Rhodnius species and 16 palm species with Rhodnius-infestation reports were estimated using Ecological Niche Models. Rhodnius species distributions in their total range were compared to their distributions in areas with palms. Rhodnius species presence was found to be higher in areas with palms. However, that tendency notoriously depended on palm species. Rhodnius species presence increased several times in areas with particular palm species. Moreover, a possible relationship was found between Rhodnius and palm species richness, indicating the Amazon region as the convergent region where several Rhodnius and palm species intersected. Finally, palm distribution was evaluated as predictor of Rhodnius species distributions, but their inclusion in the distributions models did not improve their performance.Conclusions/Significance The distributions of some Rhodnius and palm species showed a high spatial association, which can be based on species interaction or niche similarity. Based on distribution convergence, the Amazon region appear to be the origin of the Rhodnius-palm association. The direct relationship between palms and Rhodnius species richness could be based on the habitat heterogeneity offered by different palm species. Despite spatial association, palm presence would not be a relevant predictor of Rhodnius species distributions in comparison to other environmental variables. Inclusion of other input data as hosts’ distribution could help to increase model predictability.Author summary The infestation of palms with Rhodnius genus kissing bugs (Chagas disease vectors) is important from the public health perspective, since insects living in palms can infest nearby houses. The migration of these bugs to households could threaten vector control programs since reinfestation of treated dwellings can occur. Association between Rhodnius and palms species distributions has been previously suggested but never quantitatively determined. The strong association between one palm species and one Rhodnius species can be used as a factor to predict the presence of Rhodnius bugs in definite areas. In this study, we estimated by models the distributions of eight Rhodnius species and 18 Rhodnius-infested palm species. Rhodnius distributions models showed a biased presence toward areas with certain palm species. That specific association was very strong in some cases; however, the presence of associated palm species was used in Rhodnius distributions models, but that did not improve the predictability of the models. Palm presence appear to be not essential for the Rhodnius current distribution because they could inhabit other habitats; but that association could be relevant to the Rhodnius evolutionary and biogeographic history.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Aerial insectivores show worldwide population declines coinciding with shifts in agricultural practices. Increasing reliance on certain agricultural practices is thought to have led to an overall reduction in insect abundance that negatively affects aerial insectivore fitness. The relationship between prey availability and the fitness of insectivores may thus vary with the extent of agricultural intensity. It is therefore imperative to quantify the strength and direction of these associations. Here we used data from an 11-year study monitoring the breeding of Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) and the availability of Diptera (their main prey) across a gradient of agricultural intensification in southern Québec, Canada. This gradient was characterized by a shift in agricultural production, whereby landscapes composed of forage and pastures represented less agro-intensive landscapes and those focusing on large-scale arable row crop monocultures, such as corn (Zea mays) or soybean (Glycine max) that are innately associated with significant mechanization and agro-chemical inputs, represented more agro-intensive landscapes. We evaluated the landscape characteristics affecting prey availability, and how this relationship influences the fledging success, duration of the nestling period, fledgling body mass, and wing length as these variables are known to influence the population dynamics of this species. Diptera availability was greatest within predominately forested landscapes, while within landscapes dominated by agriculture, it was marginally greater in less agro-intensive areas. Of the measured fitness and body condition proxies, both fledging success and nestling body mass were positively related to prey availability. The impact of prey availability varied across the agricultural gradient as fledging success improved with increasing prey levels within forage landscapes yet declined in more agro-intensive landscapes. Finally, after accounting for prey availability, fledging success was lowest, nestling periods were the longest, and wing length of fledglings were shortest within more agro-intensive landscapes. Our results highlight the interacting roles that aerial insect availability and agricultural intensification have on the fitness of aerial insectivores, and by extension how food availability may interact with other aspects of breeding habitats to influence the population dynamics of predators.Open Research Data are not yet provided (option 4) as they are being used for other research projects. We affirm that data will be permanently archived if the paper is accepted for publication on the Dryad repository.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - As phylogenomics focuses on comprehensive taxon sampling at the species and population/subspecies levels, incorporating genomic data from historical specimens has become increasingly common. While historical samples can fill critical gaps in our understanding of the evolutionary history of diverse groups, they also introduce additional sources of phylogenomic uncertainty, making it difficult to discern novel evolutionary relationships from artifacts caused by sample quality issues. These problems highlight the need for improved strategies to disentangle artifactual patterns from true biological signal as historical specimens become more prevalent in phylogenomic datasets. Here, we tested the limits of historical specimen-driven phylogenomics to resolve subspecies-level relationships within a highly polytypic family, the New World quails (Odontophoridae), using thousands of ultraconserved elements (UCEs). We found that relationships at and above the species-level were well-resolved and highly supported across all analyses, with the exception of discordant relationships within the two most polytypic genera which included many historical specimens. We examined the causes of discordance and found that inferring phylogenies from subsets of taxa resolved the disagreements, suggesting that analyzing subclades can help remove artifactual causes of discordance in datasets that include historical samples. At the subspecies-level, we found well-resolved geographic structure within the two most polytypic genera, including the most polytypic species in this family, Northern Bobwhites (Colinus virginianus), demonstrating that variable sites within UCEs are capable of resolving phylogenetic structure below the species level. Our results highlight the importance of complete taxonomic sampling for resolving relationships among polytypic species, often through the inclusion of historical specimens, and we propose an integrative strategy for understanding and addressing the uncertainty that historical samples sometimes introduce to phylogenetic analyses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Adaptive radiation of fishes was long thought to be possible only in lacustrine environments. Recently, several studies have shown that also riverine and stream environments provide the ecological opportunity for adaptive radiation. In this study, we report on a riverine adaptive radiation of six ecomorphs of cyprinid hillstream fishes of the genus Garra in a river located in the Ethiopian Highlands in East Africa. Garra are predominantly highly specialized algae-scrapers with a wide distribution ranging from Southeastern Asia to Western Africa. However, adaptive phenotypic diversification in mouth type, sucking disc morphology, gut length and body shape have been found among these new species in a single Ethiopian river. Moreover, we found two novel phenotypes of Garra (‘thick-lipped’ and ‘predatory’) that were not described before in this species-rich genus (&gt;160 species). Mitochondrial and genome-wide data suggest monophyletic, intra-basin evolution of Garra phenotypic diversity with signatures of gene flow from other local populations. Although sympatric ecomorphs are genetically distinct and can be considered to being young species as suggested by genome-wide SNP data, mtDNA was unable to identify any genetic structure suggesting a recent and rapid speciation event. Furthermore, we found evidence for a hybrid origin of the novel ‘thick-lipped’ phenotype, as being the result of the hybridization of two other sympatrically occurring species. Here we highlight how, driven by ecological opportunity, an ancestral trophically highly specialized lineage is likely to have rapidly adaptively radiated in a riverine environment, and that this radiation was promoted by the evolution of novel feeding strategies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - European Apis mellifera and Asian Apis cerana honeybees, are essential crop pollinators. Microbiome studies can provide complex information on health and fitness of these insects in relation to environmental changes, and plant availability. Amplicon sequencing of variable regions of 16S rRNA and internally transcribed spacers (ITSs) allow identification of the metabiome. These methods provide a tool for monitoring otherwise uncultured microbes isolated from the gut of the honeybees. They also help monitor the composition of the gut fungi and, intriguingly, pollens collected by the insect. Here, we present data from amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA and ITS2 regions from honeybees collected at various time points from anthropogenic landforms as urban areas in Poland, UK, Spain, Greece, and Thailand. We have analysed microbial composition of honeybee intestine as well as fungi and pollens. We conclude that differences between samples were mainly influenced by the bacteria, plant pollens and fungi, respectively. Moreover, honeybees feeding on a honeydew diet, mainly based on sugars, were more prone to fungal pathogens (Nosema ceranae) and neogregarines. Finally, the period when honeybees switch to the winter generation (longer-lived forager honeybees) is the most sensitive to diet perturbations and hence pathogens attack, for the whole beekeeping season. It is possible that evolutionary adaptation of bees fails to benefit them in the modern anthropomorphised environment.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Lanthanomelissa is a controversial taxonomic group of bees that was treated as subgenus of Chalepogenus or an independent genus. All of its species are endemic to the south-eastern grasslands of South America, an endangered and still poorly known environment. We aimed to understand the origin of this group of bees in time and space as well as the influence of Quaternary climatic fluctuations on its current distribution and possible link to the history of the Southern Grasslands. We inferred phylogenetic relationships of Lanthanomelissa species using 37 terminals and 3430 nucleotides of three mitochondrial and two nuclear markers and estimated divergence times and ancestral geographic range. We performed an ensemble with the algorithms SVM, Maxent, and Random Forest in a dataset of 192 georeferenced occurrence points using 19 WorldClim bioclimatic variables to analyse species distribution during the current and two past climatic scenarios (LIG, ∼120 kya and LGM, ∼21 kya). The results support the monophyly of the genus and taxonomic changes including the species Lanthanomelissa parva n. comb. on Lanthanomelissa, and the treatment of the goeldianus group of Chalepogenus as the genus Lanthanella. The genus originated at the Oligocene-Miocene border in the Chacoan-Pampean region, and the glacial-interglacial models indicated expansion in Last Glacial Maximum and retraction in Last Interglacial. Expansion and retraction of Lanthanomelissa distribution in the last glacial-interglacial indicated grasslands distributional shifts during periods of climate cooling and warming. The diversification of Lanthanomelissa supported the estimated expansion of southern grasslands in South America concurrently with the origin of Cerrado during the late Miocene. Their origin was approximately synchronized with their exclusive floral host, Sisyrinchium (Iridaceae).

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity enables an immediate response to changing conditions, but for most species, evolutionary change through adaptation will be more important for long-term survival. Warming climate and increasing desertification urges the identification of genes involved in heat-and dehydration-tolerance to better inform and target biodiversity conservation efforts. Comparisons among extant desert adapted species can highlight parallel or convergent patterns of genome evolution through the identification of shared signatures of selection. We generate chromosome-level genome assembly for the canyon mouse (Peromyscus crinitus) and test for signature of parallel evolution by comparing signatures of selective sweeps across population-level genomic resequencing data from another desert specialist deer mouse (P. eremicus) and a widely-distributed habitat generalist (P. maniculatus), that may locally adapted to arid conditions. We identify few shared candidate loci involved in desert adaptation and do not find support for a shared pattern of parallel evolution. Instead, we hypothesize divergent molecular mechanisms of desert adaptation among deer mice, potentially tied to species-specific historical demography, which may limit or enhance adaptation. We identify a number of candidate loci experiencing selective sweeps in the P. crinitus genome that are implicated in osmoregulation (Trypsin, Prostasin) and metabolic regulation (Kallikrein, eIF2-alpha kinase GCN2, APPL1/2), which may be important to accommodating hot and dry environmental conditions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Changes in land-use and the associated shifts in environmental conditions can have large effects on the transmission and emergence of disease. Mosquito-borne disease are particularly sensitive to these changes because mosquito growth, reproduction, survival and susceptibility to infection are all thermally sensitive traits, and land use change dramatically alters local microclimate. Predicting disease transmission under environmental change is increasingly critical for targeting mosquito-borne disease control and for identifying hotspots of disease emergence. Mechanistic models offer a powerful tool for improving these predications. However, these approaches are limited by the quality and scale of temperature data and the thermal response curves that underlie predictions. Here, we used fine-scale temperature monitoring and a combination of empirical, laboratory and temperature-dependent estimates to estimate the vectorial capacity of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes across a tropical forest – oil palm plantation conversion gradient in Malaysian Borneo. We found that fine-scale differences in temperature between logged forest and oil palm plantation sites were not sufficient to produce differences in temperature-dependent trait estimates using published thermal performance curves. However, when measured under field conditions a key parameter, adult abundance, differed significantly between land-use types, resulting in estimates of vectorial capacity that were 1.5 times higher in plantations than in forests. The prediction that oil palm plantations would support mosquito populations with higher vectorial capacity was robust to uncertainties in our adult survival estimates. These results provide a mechanistic basis for understanding the effects of forest conversion on mosquito-borne disease risk, and a framework for interpreting emergent relationships between land-use and disease transmission. As rising demand for palm oil products drives continued expansion of plantations, these findings have important implications for conservation, land management and public health policy at the global scale.AUTHOR SUMMARY The large scale modification of landscapes by humans has contributed to the rise of emerging and re-emerging mosquito-borne diseases. While the association between athropogenic land-use change and these shifts in disease risk are frequently observed, our understanding of exactly how land-use change mechanistically alters disease risk remains unclear. Changes in local environmental conditions (e.g. temperature) may play an important role, due to the effects on mosquito life-history, but are rarely measured at scales relevant these small-bodied ectotherms. Here we measure the impact of tropical forest conversion to oil palm plantation on each of the components that determine the potential for mosquitoes to transmit pathogens (vectorial capacity). By combining fine-scale temperature data from the field, published temperature responses of mosquitoes and field data on adult mosquito populations, we show that land-use change from forest to plantation can be expected to increase vectorial capacity by 150%. Our results highlight the need to advance field research into fundamental mosquito ecology, and to more critically evaluate the increased risk of Aedes-borne disease in dynamic working landscapes against the benefits of economic development.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation increases the isolation of natural populations resulting in reduced genetic variability and increased species extinction risk. Behavioral innovation through learning, i.e., the expression of a new learned behavior in a novel context, can help animals colonize new suitable and increasingly fragmented habitats. It has remained unclear, however, how reduced genetic variability affects learning for colonizing more or less suitable habitats. Here, we show that inbreeding in a subsocial invertebrate, the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, reduces novel host plant colonization and reproductive fitness. When provided with the possibility to learn from previous experience with a host plant species, outbred mites showed aversive learning ability, but inbred mites did not adapt their behavior. We further found a putative general cost of learning in both inbred and outbred mites. Our results reveal that inbreeding affects the learning component of behavioral innovation for host plant colonization.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Due to massive energetic investments in woody support structures, trees are subject to unique physiological, mechanical, and ecological pressures not experienced by herbaceous plants. When considering trait relationships across the entire plant kingdom, plant trait frameworks typically must omit traits unique to large woody species, thereby limiting our understanding of how these distinct ecological pressures shape trait relationships in trees. Here, by considering 18 functional traits—reflecting leaf economics, wood structure, tree size, reproduction, and below-ground allocation—we quantify the major axes of variation governing trait expression of trees worldwide. We show that trait variation within and across angiosperms and gymnosperms is captured by two independent processes: one reflecting tree size and competition for light, the other reflecting leaf photosynthetic capacity and nutrient economies. By exploring multidimensional relationships across clusters of traits, we further identify a representative set of seven traits which captures the majority of variation in form and function in trees: maximum tree height, stem conduit diameter, specific leaf area, seed mass, bark thickness, root depth, and wood density. Collectively, this work informs future trait-based research into the functional biogeography of trees, and contributes to our fundamental understanding of the ecological and evolutionary controls on forest biodiversity and productivity worldwide.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Mangrove forests are one of the most bio-diverse and productive wetland environments on earth. However, these unique tropical forest environments that occupy coastal areas are among the most threatened habitats globally. Approximately one-third of the world’s mangrove forests in tropical and subtropical coastlines have been lost to logging, conversion of land for agriculture and mariculture, and degradation due to general pollution over the past 50 years. The large population of mangroves occupying the Turneffe Atoll area in Belize face growing anthropogenic threats such as permanent clearing of land for housing and infrastructural development as well as pollution and natural factors (climate change). Despite these threats, mangroves have high resilience due to their fast rates of microbial decomposition and nutrient flux, large storage of nutrients below-ground, numerous feedbacks, keystone species redundancy and self-design, and highly efficient biotic controls. Given the few formal studies done to evaluate mangrove resilience at Turneffe Atoll, the purpose of this study was to evaluate mangrove resilience and nursery functions in the Turneffe Atoll Marine Reserve. Mangrove fish abundance, forest structure, and prop root length was assessed by means of visual census and point centred quarter method (PCQM) for 11 sites that span across conservation and general use zones. This study found that resilient mangroves (lower vulnerability ranks, higher standing biomass, and higher fish biomass and abundance) exist in conservation and general use zones and warrant the need for improved mangrove conservation measures. Some conservation measures include: greater reduction of non-climate stressors, establishment of more mangrove conservation areas, and implementation of more outreach and educational programmes.

AB  - Trees are of vital importance for ecosystem functioning and services at local to global scales, yet we still lack a detailed overview of the global patterns of tree diversity and the underlying drivers, particularly the imprint of paleoclimate. Here, we present the high-resolution (110 km) worldwide mapping of tree species richness, functional and phylogenetic diversities based on ∼7 million quality-assessed occurrences for 46,752 tree species (80.5% of the estimated total number of tree species), and subsequent assessments of the influence of paleo-climate legacies on these patterns. All three tree diversity dimensions exhibited the expected latitudinal decline. Contemporary climate emerged as the strongest driver of all diversity patterns, with Pleistocene and deeper-time (&gt;107 years) paleoclimate as important co-determinants, and, notably, with past cold and drought stress being linked to reduced current diversity. These findings demonstrate that tree diversity is affected by paleoclimate millions of years back in time and highlight the potential for tree diversity losses from future climate change.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Artificial devices are increasingly used in conservation measures to mitigate the disappearance of natural habitats. However, few studies have demonstrated their benefits for the target species, and they may pose a risk of creating ecological traps. This occurs when lower individual fitness is found in artificial habitats that are more attractive than their natural equivalents. In this study, we tested the ecological trap hypothesis on a dense population of European rollers Coracias garrulus breeding in both natural cavities and nest-boxes. Our initial hypothesis was that the more stressful microclimatic conditions of nest-boxes would lead to reduced fitness of rollers, thus creating an ecological trap. The results showed that nest-boxes were preferred over natural cavities. Despite significantly more extreme microclimatic conditions in nest-boxes, we found similar breeding parameters between artificial and natural nest types. Our results also suggest that rollers selected the nest-boxes which best buffered the temperature, thus avoiding potential ecological traps. Overall our results lead to the conclusion that nest-boxes do not create ecological traps for rollers in this study site. However, other species may be more sensitive to microclimatic variations or less able to avoid the least favourable nest-boxes. These findings could help to inform the placement of nest-boxes in order to reduce extreme temperatures and variation in humidity rates. Future studies could compare nest types for other fitness parameters, such as juvenile body condition or survival. We also recommend the ecological trap hypothesis as a useful framework to evaluate the outcomes of artificial devices used for conservation.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Accurate, rapid, and comprehensive biodiversity assessments are critical for investigating ecological processes and supporting conservation efforts. Environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys show promise as a way to effectively characterize fine-scale patterns of community composition, but most studies to date have evaluated its effectiveness in single habitats and for conspicuous taxonomic groups in temperate ecosystems. We tested whether a single PCR survey of eDNA in seawater using a broad metazoan primer could identify differences in community composition between five adjacent habitats at 19 sites across a tropical Caribbean bay in Panama. We paired this effort with visual fish surveys to compare methods for a conspicuous taxonomic group. eDNA revealed a tremendous diversity of animals (8,586 operational taxonomic units), including many small taxa that would be undetected in traditional in situ surveys. Fish comprised only 0.07% of the taxa detected by a broad COI primer, yet included 43 species not observed in the visual survey. eDNA revealed significant differences in fish and invertebrate community composition across adjacent habitats and areas of the bay driven in part by taxa known to be habitat-specialists or tolerant to wave action. Our results demonstrate the ability of broad eDNA surveys to identify biodiversity patterns in the ocean.

AB  - Once restricted to northern China and Mongolia, the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) now enjoys a worldwide distribution due to the evolution of commensalism with humans. In contrast to black rats and the house mouse, which have tracked the regional and global development of human agricultural settlements, brown rats do not appear in the European historical record until the 1500s, suggesting their range expansion was a response to relatively recent increases in global trade and modern sea-faring. We inferred the global phylogeography of brown rats using 32k SNPs to reconstruct invasion routes from estimates of population divergence and admixture. Globally, we detected 13 evolutionary clusters within five expansion routes. One cluster arose following a southward expansion into Southeast Asia. Three additional clusters arose from two independent eastward expansions: one expansion from Russia to the Aleutian Archipelago, and a second to western North America. Rapid westward expansion resulted in the colonization of Europe from which subsequent colonization of Africa, the Americas, and Australasia occurred, and multiple evolutionary clusters were detected. An astonishing degree of fine-grained clustering found both between and within our sampling sites underscored the extent to which urban heterogeneity can shape the genetic structure of commensal rodents. Surprisingly, few individuals were recent migrants despite continual global transport, suggesting that recruitment into established populations is limited. Understanding the global population structure of R. norvegicus offers novel perspectives on the forces driving the spread of zoonotic disease, and yields greater capacity to develop targeted rat eradication programs.

AB  - Soil microbes are essential to the continued productivity of sustainably-managed agroecosystems. In shade coffee plantations, the relationship between soil microbial composition, soil nutrient availability, and coffee productivity have been demonstrated, but the effect of management on the composition of the soil microbial communities remains relatively unexplored. To further understand how management modulates the soil microbiome, we surveyed the soil fungal and bacterial communities, as well as soil chemistry and canopy composition in a Nicaraguan coffee cooperative, across 19 individual farms. Using amplicon sequencing, we found that management (organic or conventional), stand age, and previous land use strongly affected the soil microbiome, albeit in different ways. Bacterial communities were most strongly associated with soil chemistry, while fungal communities were more strongly associated with the composition of the canopy and historical land use of the coffee plantation. Notably, both fungal and bacterial richness decreased with stand age. In addition to revealing the first in-depth characterization of the soil microbiome in coffee plantations in Nicaragua, our results highlight how fungal and bacterial communities are simultaneously modulated by long-term land use legacies (i.e., an agricultural plot’s previous land use) and short-term press disturbance (i.e., farm age).One-sentence-summary The composition of soil fungal and bacteria communities in shade coffee plantations depend on the combination of the farm’s management type, its previous land use, and the coffee plants’ stand age, but are differently influenced by each.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

TI  - GIFT – A Global Inventory of Floras and Traits for macroecology and biogeography

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - To understand how traits and evolutionary history shape the geographic distribution of plant life on Earth, we need to integrate high-quality and global-scale distribution data with functional and phylogenetic information. Large-scale distribution data for plants are, however, often restricted to either certain taxonomic groups or geographic regions. For example, range maps only exist for a small subset of all plant species and digitally available point-occurrence information is strongly biased both geographically and taxonomically. An alternative, currently rarely used resource for macroecological and botanical research are regional Floras and checklists, which contain highly curated information about the species composition of a clearly defined area, and which together virtually cover the entire global land surface. Here we report on our recent efforts to mobilize this information for macroecological and biogeographical analyses in the GIFT database, the Global Inventory of Floras and Traits. GIFT integrates plant distributions, functional traits, phylogenetic information, and region-level geographic, environmental and socioeconomic data. GIFT currently holds species lists for 2,893 regions across the whole globe including ~315,000 taxonomically standardized species names (i.e. c. 80% of all known land plant species) and ~3 million species-by-region occurrences. In addition, GIFT contains information about the floristic status (native, endemic, alien and naturalized) and takes advantage of the wealth of trait information in the regional Floras, complemented by data from global trait databases. Based on a hierarchical and taxonomical derivation scheme, GIFT holds information for 83 functional traits and more than 2.3 million trait-by-species combinations and achieves unprecedented coverage in categorical traits such as woodiness (~233,000 spp.) or growth form (~213,000 spp.). Here we present the structure, content and automated workflows of GIFT and a corresponding web-interface (http://gift.uni-goettingen.de) as proof of concept for the feasibility and potential of mobilizing aggregated biodiversity data for global macroecological and biogeographical research.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation plays a major role in the reduction of genetic diversity among wildlife populations. The African savannah elephant population of the Ruaha-Rungwa and Katavi-Rukwa ecosystems in south-western Tanzania, comprises one of the world’s largest remaining elephant populations, but is increasingly threatened by loss of connectivity and poaching for ivory. We investigate whether there are incipient signs of genetic isolation (loss of heterozygosity) within the younger cohort as a result of habitat loss between the two ecosystems. To investigate the genetic structure of populations, we compared the genotypes for 11 microsatellite loci in the western (n = 81 individuals from Katavi-Rukwa), central (n = 36 individuals from Lukwati and Piti), and eastern populations (n = 193, individuals from Ruaha-Rungwa). We found evidence of significant genetic differentiation among the three populations, but the levels were low, suggesting recent divergence. Furthermore, we identified weak isolation by distance, suggesting higher gene flow among nearer individuals with samples within 50km of each other being more genetically similar to one another than beyond. Although sample sizes were small, a further analysis of genetic differences across populations and in separate age classes revealed evidence of increasing genetic structure among younger age classes across the landscape. In a long-lived species with overlapping generations, it takes a long time to develop genetic substructure even when there are substantial obstacles to migration. Thus, in these recently fragmented populations, inbreeding (and the loss of heterozygosity) may be less of an immediate concern than demography (the loss of adults due to illegal hunting).

AB  - Outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases are trained by local biotic and abiotic factors, with host declines occurring when conditions favour the pathogen. Extinction of the Tanzanian Kihansi spray toad (Nectophrynoides asperginis) in 2004 was contemporaneous with the construction of a dam, implicating habitat modification in the loss of this species. However, high burdens of a globally emerging infection, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) were synchronously observed implicating infectious disease in this toads extinction. Here, by shotgun sequencing skin DNA from archived toad mortalities and assembling chytrid mitogenomes, we prove this outbreak was caused by the BdCAPE lineage and not the panzootic lineage BdGPL that is widely associated with global amphibian extinctions. Molecular dating showed an invasion of BdCAPE across Southern Africa overlapping with the timing of the extinction event. However, post-outbreak surveillance of conspecific species inhabiting this mountainous region showed widespread infection by BdCAPE yet no signs of amphibian ill-health or species decline. Our findings show that despite efforts to mitigate the environmental impact caused by dams construction, invasion of the pathogen ultimately led to the loss of the Kihansi spray toad; a synergism between emerging infectious disease and environmental change that likely heralds wider negative impacts on biodiversity in the Anthropocene.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Coral reefs are facing a constant barrage of human impacts, including eutrophication, overharvesting and climate change. However, research and management are just beginning to depart from a single-dominant-stressor paradigm and a holistic ecosystem-based understanding of these systems is still in its infancy. We expand on a well-known theoretical model to motivate an integrated multi-stressor framework for coral reefs by incorporating empirical evidence of multi-stressor impacts (overfishing, eutrophication and climate-driven mortality) as well as general ecological and theoretical concepts. We show that: i) the geometry of a simple, empirically-motivated model suggests nutrients and harvesting can operate similarly in driving shifts from coral- to algae-dominated reefs; ii) these impacts increase nonlinearly when acting concurrently, resulting in clear context-dependent management implications; and iii) this same geometry suggests climate-driven coral mortality (temperature-stress, cyclonic storms) can drive the presence of long transients and climate-driven alternate states, even in moderately-impacted ecosystems. These results imply that reefs that appear to be in a “safe space” may in fact be in danger of being pushed into a degraded algae-dominated state as storms and bleaching events are increasing in frequency and magnitude. Altogether, we find that responses in benthic composition as “signatures of change” to multi-stressors allows us to develop a predictive multi-stressor framework for coral reefs. In line with this theory, we detail empirical evidence from Barbados that highlights the context-dependent nature of coral reefs in a changing world. Our results present novel and generalizable insights into the functioning of coral reefs, that draw from classic theoretical and ecological concepts such as keystone predation theory, ecological succession and life history theory, as well as the emerging fields of long transients and early warning signals. By bridging coral reef ecology and general ecological concepts, we can better understand ecosystem functioning and resilience in these important yet highly threatened systems.Open Research Statement: Data used in this manuscript are already published and publicly available.

AB  - The spatial structure of genomic and phenotypic variation across populations reflects historical and demographic processes as well as evolution via natural selection. Characterizing such variation can provide an important perspective for understanding the evolutionary consequences of changing climate and for guiding ecological restoration. While evidence for local adaptation has been traditionally evaluated using phenotypic data, modern methods for generating and analyzing landscape genomic data can directly quantify local adaptation by associating allelic variation with environmental variation. Here, we analyze both genomic and phenotypic variation of rubber rabbitbrush (Ericameria nauseosa), a foundational shrub species of western North America. To quantify landscape genomic structure and provide perspective on patterns of local adaptation, we generated reduced representation sequencing data for 17 wild populations (222 individuals; 38,615 loci) spanning a range of environmental conditions. Population genetic analyses illustrated pronounced landscape genomic structure jointly shaped by geography and environment. Genetic-environment association (GEA) analyses using both redundancy analysis (RDA) and a machine-learning approach (Gradient Forest) indicated environmental variables (precipitation seasonality, slope, aspect, elevation, and annual precipitation) influenced spatial genomic structure, and were correlated with allele frequency shifts indicative of local adaptation at a consistent set of genomic regions. We compared our GEA based inference of local adaptation with phenotypic data collected by growing seeds from each population in a greenhouse common garden. Population differentiation in seed weight, emergence, and seedling traits was associated with environmental variables (e.g., precipitation seasonality) that were also implicated in GEA analyses, suggesting complementary conclusions about the drivers of local adaptation across different methods and data sources. Our results provide a baseline understanding of spatial genomic structure for E. nauseosa across the western Great Basin and illustrate the utility of GEA analyses for detecting the environmental causes and genetic signatures of local adaptation in a widely distributed plant species of restoration significance.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Animal movement can impact human-wildlife conflict through a variety of features: increased movement can lead to greater chance of encounter, remaining still can lead to greater or lesser detection, and activity can modulate their impact on humans. Here we assess the movement and space use of the highly venomous and medically important Malayan krait (Bungarus candidus) on a suburban university campus. We radio- tracked 14 kraits for an average of 114 days (min: 19, max: 218), with an average of 106 fixes (min: 21, max: 229). We assessed movement pathways and activity with dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement models, evaluated patterns of revisitation to identify site fidelity, and determined whether individuals selected for particular land-use types with Integrated Step Selection Functions. Most individuals displayed some level of attraction to buildings (n = 10) and natural areas (n = 12); we identified a similar unambiguous pattern of attraction to buildings and natural areas at the population level (of our sample). Snakes remained in shelter sites for long periods of time (max = 94 days) and revisited sites on average every 15.45 days. Over 50% of fixes were within human settlements and 37.1% were associated with buildings. We found generally seasonal patterns of activity, with higher activity in wet seasons (when classes are typically in session on campus), and lower activity in the hot season (when there are a number of short breaks causing students to leave campus). These results show frequent proximity between Malayan kraits and humans at Suranaree University of Technology, Thailand; thereby, suggesting a near constant potential for human- wildlife conflict. Despite the fact that no snakebites from this species occurred at the university during our study period, substantial education and awareness training should be considered to raise awareness to ensure continued coexistence on campus.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AU  - Comeault, Aaron A.

T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Changes in temperature associated with climate change can alter species’ distributions, drive adaptive evolution, and, in some cases, cause extinction. Research has tended to focus on the direct effects of temperature, but changes in temperature can also have indirect effects on populations and species. Here we test whether temperature can indirectly affect the fitness of Drosophila santomea and D. yakuba by altering interspecific competitive outcomes. We show that, when raised in isolation, both D. santomea and D. yakuba show maximal performance at temperatures near 22°C. However, when raised together, D. santomea outcompetes D. yakuba at a lower temperature (18°C), while D. yakuba outcompetes D. santomea at a higher temperature (25°C). We then use a ‘coexistence’ experiment to show that D. santomea is rapidly (within 8 generations) extirpated when maintained with D. yakuba at 25°C. By contrast, D. santomea remains as (or more) abundant than D. yakuba over the course of ~10 generations when maintained at 18°C. Our results provide an example of how the thermal environment can indirectly affect interspecific competitive outcomes and suggest that changes in the competitive advantage of species can lead to some species becoming more prone to extinction by competitive exclusion.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - The evolutionary origins of mimicry in the Easter Egg weevil, Pachyrhynchus, have fascinated researchers since first noted more than a century ago by Alfred Russel Wallace. Müllerian mimicry, or mimicry in which two or more distasteful species look similar, is widespread throughout the animal kingdom. Given the varied but discrete color patterns in Pachyrhynchus, this genus presents one of the best opportunities to study the evolution of both perfect and imperfect mimicry. We analyzed more than 10,000 UCE loci using a novel partitioning strategy to resolve the relationships of closely related species in the genus. Our results indicate that many of the mimetic color patterns observed in sympatric species are due to convergent evolution. We suggest that this convergence is driven by frequency-dependent selection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Globally increasing levels of artificial light at night (ALAN) are associated with shifts in circadian rhythms of behaviour in many wild species. However, it is still unclear whether changes in behavioural timing are underlined by parallel shifts in the molecular clock, and whether such internal shifts may differ between different tissues and physiological pathways, which could highlight circadian disruption. We tackled these questions in a comprehensive study that integrated behavioural, gene expression and metabolomic analyses. We exposed captive male great tits (Parus major) to three ALAN intensities or to dark nights, recorded their activity rhythms and obtained mid-day and midnight samples of brain, liver, spleen and blood. ALAN advanced wake-up time, and this shift was paralleled by an advance in the expression of the clock gene BMAL1 in all tissues, suggesting close links of brain and peripheral clock gene expression with activity rhythms. However, several metabolic and immune genes were desynchronised the shifted BMAL1 expression, suggesting circadian disruption of behaviour and physiology. This result was reinforced by untargeted metabolomic profiling, which showed that only 9.7% of the 755 analysed metabolites followed the behavioural shift. We suggest circadian as a key mediator of the health impacts of ALAN on wild animals.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Assessing the relative importance of geographical and environmental factors to the spatial distribution of genetic variation can provide information about the processes that maintain genetic variation in natural populations. With a globally wide but very restricted habitat distribution, mangrove trees are a useful model for studies aiming to understand the contributions of these factors. Mangroves occur along the continent–ocean interface of tropical and subtropical latitudes, regions considered inhospitable to many other types of plants. Here, we used landscape genomics approaches to investigate the relative contributions of geographical and environmental variables to the genetic variation of two black mangrove species, Avicennia schaueriana and Avicennia germinans, along the South American coast. Using single nucleotide polymorphisms, our results revealed an important role of ocean currents and geographical distance in the gene flow of A. schaueriana and an isolation-by-environment pattern in the organization of the genetic diversity of A. germinans. Additionally, for A. germinans, we observed significant correlations between genetic variation with evidence of selection and the influence of precipitation regimens, solar radiation and temperature patterns. These discoveries expand our knowledge about the evolution of mangrove trees and provide important information to predict future responses of coastal species to the expected global changes during this century.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Malaria cases in Latin America reached ~1 million in 2017 and 2018, with 53% and 51% reported from Venezuela, respectively. In this study, we characterized the spatiotemporal dynamics of malaria transmission between 2007-2017 in southern Venezuela, the main endemic area of the country. We found that disease transmission was focal and more prevalent in the southeast of southern Venezuela where two persistent hotspots of Plasmodium vivax (76%) and P. falciparum (18%) linked to deforestation for illegal gold mining accounted for ~60% of the country-wide number of cases. Incidence has increased nearly tenfold in the last decade, showing an explosive epidemic growth due to a significant lack of disease control. We suggest that a source-sink pattern of Plasmodium sp. dispersal account for the re-emergence and progression of malaria transmission in the last 4 years across the country due to the internal migration of infected people to and from the hotspots and other malaria-prone ecosystems. We observe a similar pattern explaining the spillover of cases across international borders affecting neighboring countries. This study provides baseline epidemiological data and guidance for malaria control to further assess the dynamics of cross-border malaria, the role of asymptomatic carriers, drug-resistant evolution, and innovative control efforts in the Latin America region.

AB  - Seagrasses are marine angiosperms that potentially provide habitat for crabs, shrimps and fish. However, these types of data are lacking for the seagrass species (Zostera muelleri/rimurēhia) that inhabit intertidal estuaries on the South Island of New Zealand.Abundances of crabs, shrimps and fish were therefore quantified from 361 non-destructive seine tows done in seagrass beds and bare mudflats in Duvauchelle bay and two sites in the Avon-Heathcote/Ihutai estuary between October 2019 and February 2020.A total of 2549 crabs, 5824 shrimps and 1149 fish (75% were juvenile flounders) were identified and counted in the seine-net and immediately released back in healthy condition to the exact location from where they were caught.Only few seagrass leaves were caught in the net and these leaves may have been previously uprooted drift fragments. The instant catch-and-release methodology therefore leaves, literally, nothing but a footprint.More fish taxa, including two species of pipefish, were found in seagrass beds in Duvauchelle bay than in the Avon-Heathcote estuary. Fish (minus juvenile flounders) were also more abundant in these seagrass beds. Furthermore, juvenile flounders and shrimps were more abundant in Duvauchelle bay compared to the Avon-Heathcote estuary, but were found in similar abundances in seagrass beds and on bare flats.It is possible that more fish were found in Duvauchelle seagrass beds because these beds have adjacent deeper areas, and may have high connectivity to seagrass beds in nearby bays. This hypothesis should be tested by sampling more seagrass beds in different types of estuaries and bays.By contrast, crabs were more abundant in the Avon-Heathcote estuary, where spider crabs were most abundant in the seagrass beds, but other crabs were found in similar abundances in seagrass beds and bare habitat. We hypothesize that crab abundances were higher in the Avon-Heathcote estuary because of lower fish predation pressure and/or larger populations of prey like mollusc and polychaetes.Our results suggests that (a) superficially similar Zostera beds in relatively close proximity can provide very different habitat values for fish and crustaceans, (b) seagrass beds with higher diversity and abundances of fish may be prioritized in conservation and management (assuming other important ecosystem functions are similar between beds), and (c) that pipefish may be useful indicator organisms, representing healthy, extensive, dense and connected seagrass beds.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Illegal capture and trade of wild birds has long been a threat to biodiversity. Translocation—the release of individuals from one location into another—is a useful conservation tool in the management of species. However, both health (such as different pathogens) and adaptive (such as local adaptation), differences among populations must be taken into account, as both can impact the recipient population negatively. Here, we provide health and genetic information to support release planning for two of the most trafficked Brazilian wild bird species (Paroaria coronata and Saltator similis). We focused on two fundamental questions: Are there significant differences in pathogen load between wild and captive populations? Is there significant genetic structure among populations? In total, 223 free-living birds were captured, sampled, and released at the same site. Devices and live decoys characteristics were top factors influencing captures. We tested blood, feces, and oropharyngeal swabs from free-ranging (n=101) and confiscated (n=92) birds for Newcastle disease virus, Salmonella spp., and Mycoplasma gallisepticum. Genetic structure among populations was investigated using mtDNA in a subsample of these birds. We found no evidence for Newcastle disease virus and Salmonella spp. in seized and free-living birds from both species. However, seized P. coronata and S. similis may be potential sources of M. gallisepticum. We found significant but low genetic structure among populations occurring in different Biomes (ΦCT=0.26 for P. coronata; ΦCT=0.13 for S. similis) and no significant structure among populations occurring in the Pampa Biome. These results suggest that while it may be important to screen seized birds for avian pathogens, genetic structure among populations seems to be of lesser concern when planning the release of seized songbirds in the wild.

AB  - Permanent grassland (PG) is an important agricultural land use for the delivery of multiple ecosystem services (ES), including carbon sequestration, water quality protection, food production, habitat provision, and cultural activities. However, PG environments are threatened by sub-optimal management, cultivation, and abandonment that are influenced by context, land manager’s attitudes and societal demand for ES. Therefore, the perceptions and attitudes of key decision-makers (farmers) and other stakeholders (non-farmers, including citizens and consumers of the products of permanent grasslands, and ES) need to be understood to ensure the sustainability of PGs and the ES they provide. A systematic review of the literature identified 135 scholarly articles. Application of thematic analysis, allowed the organization, and synthesis of current research related to (different) stakeholder attitudes, and how these influence PG management and the delivery of ES. The results suggest that different stakeholders hold different views towards permanent grassland, with farmers in particular having to balance economic with other (potentially conflicting) drivers. The types of knowledge held by different groups of stakeholders, access to sources of information, as well as the influence of knowledge on behaviour; and environmental values (for example in relation to aesthetics or conservation of biodiversity) explained why certain motivations for attitudes and behaviours are held. A major gap, however, was identified in relation to PG as opposed to other types of landscape.

AB  - Recurring outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) severely damage healthy corals in the Western Pacific Ocean. To determine the source of outbreaking COTS larvae and their dispersal routes across the Western Pacific, complete mitochondrial genomes were sequenced from 243 individuals collected in 11 reef regions. Our results indicate that Pacific COTS comprise two major clades, an East-Central Pacific clade (ECP-C) and a Pan-Pacific clade (PP-C). The ECP-C consists of COTS from French Polynesia (FP), Fiji, Vanuatu and the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), and does not appear prone to outbreaks. In contrast, the PP-C, which repeatedly spawns outbreaks, is a large clade comprising COTS from FP, Fiji, Vanuatu, GBR, Papua New Guinea, Vietnam, the Philippines, Japan, Micronesia, and the Marshall Islands. Given the nature of Pacific Ocean currents, the vast area encompassing FP, Fiji, Vanuatu, and the GBR likely supplies larvae for repeated outbreaks, exacerbated by anthropogenic environmental changes, such as eutrophication.

AB  - Loss of natural landscapes surrounding major conservation areas compromise their future and threaten long-term conservation. We evaluate the effectiveness of fully and lesser protected areas within Katavi-Rukwa and Ruaha-Rungwa ecosystems in south-western Tanzania to protecting natural landscapes within their boundaries over the past four decades. Using a time series of Landsat satellite imageries of September 1972, July 1990 and September 2015, we assess the extent to which natural habitat has been lost within and around these areas mainly through anthropogenic activities. We also test the viability of the remaining natural habitat to provide connectivity between the two ecosystems. Our analysis reveals that while fully protected areas remained intact over the past four decades, lesser protected areas lost a combined total area of about 5,984 km2 during that period which is about 17.5% of habitat available in 1972. We also find that about 3,380 km2 of natural habitat is still available for connectivity between the two ecosystems through Piti East and Rungwa South Open Areas. We recommend relevant authorities to establish conservation friendly village land use plans in all villages surrounding and between the two ecosystems to ensure long-term conservation of these ecosystems.

AB  - Identifying the key vector and host species driving transmission is notoriously difficult for vector-borne zoonoses, but critical for disease control. Here, we present a general approach for quantifying the role hosts and vectors play in transmission that integrates species’ physiological competence with their ecological traits. We apply this model to the medically important arbovirus Ross River virus (RRV), in Brisbane, Australia. We found that vertebrate species with high physiological competence weren’t the most important for community transmission. Instead, we estimated that humans (previously overlooked as epidemiologically important hosts) potentially play an important role in RRV transmission, in part, because highly competent vectors readily feed on them and are highly abundant. By contrast, vectors with high physiological competence were also important for community transmission. Finally, we uncovered two potential transmission cycles: an enzootic cycle involving birds and an urban cycle involving humans. This modelling approach has direct application to other zoonotic arboviruses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

AB  - Mangrove expansion monopolizes estuarine landscapes by diminishing habitat diversity and hence biodiversity. Physical landcover types, including mangrove vegetation, influence polychaete and avifauna habitat uses. The connections between the physical to biota-associated landscapes warrant investigation. We determine how to best describe the landscape in a mangrove-vegetated wetland according to the physical, polychaete and bird domains and identify what physical attributes would affect the biota-associated landscapes. Differences among the physical and biota-associated landscapes were evaluated using multivariate ordination analyses. Six physical landcover types were aligned along elevation, inundation and sedimentary gradients. The polychaete-associated landscape was structured by three landcover types, mainly mangroves and tidal flats with intermediate and high inundation. Deposit-feeding spionid and nereid, carnivorous goniadid and suspension-feeding sabellid polychaetes depended on the different landcover types. Shorebirds occurred distinctively in tidal flats with large, open surface areas. Egrets characterized tidal flats and mangroves, and foliage and ground gleaners characterized mangroves. Open tidal flats are crucial to polychaetes, which are the main prey of shorebirds and are also important to egret foraging. Our results suggest that effective management strategies for conserving these migratory birds require the maintenance of open tidal flats in the landscape.

AB  - Here we explore how the chemical composition of particulate matter (PM) and meteorological conditions combine in shaping the air microbiome in a heavily inhabited industrial urban settlement. During the observation time, the air microbiome was highly dynamic, fluctuating between different compositional states, likely resulting from the aerosolization of different microbiomes emission sources. This dynamic process depends on the combination of local meteorological parameters and particle emission sources, which may affect the prevalent aerosolized microbiomes. In particular, we showed that, in the investigated area, industrial emissions and winds blowing from the inlands combine with an airborne microbiome that includes faecal microbiomes components, suggesting multiple citizens’ exposure to both chemicals and microorganisms of faecal origin, as related to landscape exploitation and population density. In conclusion, our findings support the need to include monitoring of the air microbiome compositional structure as a relevant factor for the final assessment of local air quality.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.

TI  - Changes in mangrove tree mortality, forest canopy, and aboveground biomass accumulation rates following the 2017 hurricane season in Puerto Rico and the role of urbanization
AU  - Branoff, Benjamin L.
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Mangrove ecosystem responses to tropical cyclones have been well documented over the last half a century, resulting in repeated measures of tree mortality, aboveground biomass reduction, and recovery by species, size, and geomorphology. However, no studies have investigated the role of urbanization in mangrove hurricane resistance and resilience, despite increasing urbanization of tropical shorelines. This study gauges the initial response and short-term recovery of Puerto Rico’s mangroves along well defined and quantified urban gradients following the 2017 hurricane season. Survival probability of tagged trees decreased with time, and the mean mortality across all sites was 22% after eleven months. Mean canopy closure loss was 51% one month after the hurricanes, and closure rates also decreased with time following the storms. Aboveground biomass accumulation decreased by 3.5 kg yr-1 per tree, corresponding to a reduction of 4.5 Mg ha-1 yr-1 at the stand level. One year later, the mangroves have recovered to 72% canopy closure and to nearly 60% of their pre-storm growth rates. No connection to urbanization could be detected in the measured dynamics. Instead, species, size and geomorphology were found to play a role. Larger trees suffered 25% more mortality than smaller size classes, and Laguncularia racemosa suffered 11% less mortality than other species. Hydro-geomorphology was also found to play a role, with forests in tidally restricted canals experiencing more canopy loss but faster recovery than open embayment systems. These findings suggest size, species, and geomorphology are important in mangrove resistance and resilience to tropical storms, and that urbanization does not play a role. Managing mangrove ecosystems for optimal shoreline protection will depend upon knowing which forests are at greatest risk in a future of increasing urbanization.

TI  - Double trouble: having two hosts reduces infection prevalence in vectored trypanosomatids
AU  - Hawra, Al-Ghafli
AU  - Seth, M. Barribeau
T2  - bioRxiv
AB  - Trypanosomatids are a diverse family of protozoan parasites, some of which cause devastating human and livestock diseases. There are two distinct infection life-cycles in trypanosomatids; some species complete their entire life-cycle in a single host (monoxenous) while others infect two hosts (dixenous). Dixenous trypanosomatids are mostly vectored by insects, and the human trypanosomatid diseases are caused mainly by vectored parasites. While infection prevalence has been described for subsets of hosts and trypanosomatids, little is known about whether monoxenous and dixenous trypanosomatids differ in infection prevalence. Here, we use meta-analyses to synthesise all published evidence of trypanosomatid infection prevalence for the last two decades, encompassing 931 unique host-trypansomatid systems. In examining 581 studies that describe infection prevalence, we find, strikingly, that monoxenous species are two-fold more prevalent than dixenous species across all hosts. We also find that dixenous trypanosomatids have significantly lower infection prevalence in insects than their non-insect hosts. Within monoxenous trypanosomatids, genera infecting bees are most prevalent and infection prevalence does not vary between wild and managed bees. To our knowledge, these results reveal for the first time, a fundamental difference in infection prevalence according to host specificity where vectored species suffer from lower infection prevalence as a result of a ‘jack of all trades, master of none’ style trade-off between the vector and subsequent hosts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.
