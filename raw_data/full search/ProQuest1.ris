T1  - Detecting nestedness in city parks for urban biodiversity conservation
AN  - 2748911119
AB  - Urbanization has been a global phenomenon producing great environmental and ecological challenges including species composition shifts in urban areas. To evaluate the interaction networks of the inhabitant metacommunities in urban parks, we applied the nestedness analysis using ecological survey data of birds, reptiles, frogs, and butterflies among 16 parks in Taipei City of Taiwan and identified critical environmental factors for biodiversity conservation. Results found significant nestedness of the metacommunities among these parks, which indicated strong interaction networks and the importance of urban parks for sustaining these metacommunities. In addition, various types of land use had different effects on the species incidence of birds, reptiles, frogs, and butterflies. It demonstrates that landscape design should consider the taxonomic differences in the development of conservation guidelines. Results also showed that the area of parks and the area of woodlot in the park were critical elements for the nested structure. Nonetheless, abundant bird generalists were found to be highly related to the area of buildings within parks, distance to forests, rivers, and the neighbouring parks. Moreover, exotic species were found to affect the interaction networks of native species. However, based on the current information, we cannot confirm the actual effects of the exotic species on the native assemblages. Reptiles and frogs appeared to be more easily threatened by land development and habitat fragmentation due to their lower vagility. In this regard, we suggest that conservation action should focus on preserving green space with large areas and constructing green corridors, creating crucial elements, and increasing the vertical complexity in the parks for species with various vagilities. We believe these strategies can help reduce the impact of urbanization to retain healthy interactions and connections of metacommunities among habitats for effective biodiversity conservation in urban areas.

T1  - ‘Tidy’ and ‘messy’ management alters natural enemy communities and pest control in urban agroecosystems
AN  - 2716914143
AB  - Agroecosystem management influences ecological interactions that underpin ecosystem services. In human-centered systems, people’s values and preferences influence management decisions. For example, aesthetic preferences for ‘tidy’ agroecosystems may remove vegetation complexity with potential negative impacts on beneficial associated biodiversity and ecosystem function. This may produce trade-offs in aesthetic- versus production-based management for ecosystem service provision. Yet, it is unclear how such preferences influence the ecology of small-scale urban agroecosystems, where aesthetic preferences for ‘tidiness’ are prominent among some gardener demographics. We used urban community gardens as a model system to experimentally test how aesthetic preferences for a ‘tidy garden’ versus a ‘messy garden’ influence insect pests, natural enemies, and pest control services. We manipulated gardens by mimicking a popular ‘tidy’ management practice–woodchip mulching–on the one hand, and simulating ‘messy’ gardens by adding ‘weedy’ plants to pathways on the other hand. Then, we measured for differences in natural enemy biodiversity (abundance, richness, community composition), and sentinel pest removal as a result of the tidy/messy manipulation. In addition, we measured vegetation and ground cover features of the garden system as measures of practices already in place. The tidy/messy manipulation did not significantly alter natural enemy or herbivore abundance within garden plots. The manipulation did, however, produce different compositions of natural enemy communities before and after the manipulation. Furthermore, the manipulation did affect short term gains and losses in predation services: the messy manipulation immediately lowered aphid pest removal compared to the tidy manipulation, while mulch already present in the system lowered Lepidoptera egg removal. Aesthetic preferences for ‘tidy’ green spaces often dominate urban landscapes. Yet, in urban food production systems, such aesthetic values and management preferences may create a fundamental tension in the provision of ecosystem services that support sustainable urban agriculture. Though human preferences may be hard to change, we suggest that gardeners allow some ‘messiness’ in their garden plots as a “lazy gardener” approach may promote particular natural enemy assemblages and may have no downsides to natural predation services.

T1  - A multi-scale, multi-species approach highlights the importance of urban greenspace and pond design for amphibian communities
AN  - 2648327710
AB  - Urbanisation threatens species through habitat loss, isolation and fragmentation. Greenspace in urban landscapes often provides connectivity and habitat for wetland-dependent species. Accessible greenspace measures the combined effects of movement barriers (e.g., roads) and the total amount of greenspace on populations. I determined whether accessible greenspace was a better predictor of amphibian occupancy at ponds than the total amount of greenspace, and at what spatial scale. I also assessed the relative importance of habitat variables at the local pond-scale. Frog surveys were conducted at 65 ponds distributed along an urban–rural gradient over two breeding seasons in the greater Melbourne region, Australia. Accessible greenspace was mapped around ponds at varying spatial scales (250 m – 2000 m) using potential barriers to amphibian movement. The best-ranked multi-species occupancy model included the proportion of total greenspace within a 1000-m radius of a pond and four local-scale covariates (presence of mosquitofish, pond permanence, vertical pond walls and water conductivity). There was no support for models containing accessible greenspace. There was a positive relationship between the probability of community and species-level occupancy and total greenspace within 1000 m of a pond. There was a negative relationship between mean community occupancy and the presence of a vertical pond wall at a site. There was no apparent effect of barriers on occupancy, indicating that urban areas may be more permeable for movement by some species than predicted. Individual species responses demonstrated that management actions are required at fine and broad spatial scales to benefit amphibian communities in urban landscapes.

T1  - Assessment of dispersal and population structure of Norway rats (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) in a seaport setting
AN  - 2648327085
AB  - Seaports are introduction hotspots for invasive alien species (IAS). This is especially true for rodents, which have accompanied humans around the globe since the earliest days of ocean-going voyages. The rapid spread of IAS soon after arrival in a new environment is facilitated by further human-mediated transport or landscape features, like roads. By measuring genetic diversity and structure to investigate dispersal pathways, we gained insight into the transport, spread and establishment stages of a biological invasion, leveraging the most common rodent species (R. norvegicus) in this setting. We characterized the genetic structure of three Norway rat populations along a busy industrial road used by trucks to access the Port area in Paranaguá city (Brazil). A total of 71 rats were genotyped using 11 microsatellite markers. The results revealed a pattern of gene flow contrary to the expected stepping-stone model along the linear transect, with the two furthest apart populations being clustered together. We hypothesize that the observed outcome is explained by natural dispersal along the corridor being lower than human-mediated transport. The sampled area furthest from the port is a gas station frequented by trucks which are considered the most likely mode of transportation. In terms of management strategies, we suggest more emphasis should be put on cargo surveillance to lower the risk of Norway rat dispersal, not only for biosecurity, but also for sanitary reasons, as this port is a major grain trading point.

T1  - Loggerhead Shrike Detectability and Occurrence in Coastal South Carolina Urban Areas
AN  - 2695015697
AB  - Grassland birds, such as the loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus), are threatened by extensive land-use change, including urbanization. Loggerhead shrikes have been declining since the early 1900s and are rare or extirpated in portions of their former range. Obtaining reliable population estimates of loggerhead shrikes is important to identify demographic trends and ensure conservation decisions are based on an accurate assessment of their current status. Imperfect detection, or the inability to detect every shrike during a survey, can result in biased population estimates. Estimating detection probability is labor-intensive and requires assumptions that are difficult to satisfy in most field studies. Understanding a species' detectability before beginning research is thus ideal.	In chapter one, I calculated the detection rates of long-term resident loggerhead shrikes along a highway corridor dominated by commercial and industrial development in Horry County, South Carolina. Using a generalized linear mixed model, I evaluated factors that could affect detection probability. All 47 shrikes included in the study were color-banded and monitored about twice per month year-round, from January 2019 through December 2021, allowing observers to determine occupancy and sex and track the status of each bird. Collectively, observers conducted 2,208 qualifying surveys on occupied territories. The best-fitting models showed that all predictor variables, including observer identity, season, sex, year, and the interaction between sex and season, affected detectability. The average detection rates for males and females had overlapping 95% confidence intervals, as did the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. Loggerhead shrikes had an average detection rate of 0.58 (range = 0.28–0.75, SD = 0.10) and were detectable year-round, with an average detection rate of 0.67 (SD = 0.17) during the breeding season, 0.56 (SD = 0.17) during winter, and 0.51 (SD = 0.16) during the molting season. The breeding season was the only season where the 95% confidence intervals for male and female detection rates did not overlap, with males having a detection rate of 0.70 (SD = 0.17) and females 0.60 (SD = 0.19). Females likely had a lower detection rate during the breeding season because they were unavailable for detection while incubating. Observers had detection rates ranging from 0.47 to 0.68 (SD = 0.08), suggesting variation among observers could affect population estimates. The results of chapter one can be used to improve the accuracy of population estimates by providing correction factors to account for the imperfect detection of urban shrikes. The correction factors can be used to identify the appropriate number of repeat surveys, increasing the efficiency of survey protocols and decreasing the costs of demographic studies. In chapter two, I identified habitat characteristics associated with loggerhead shrike occurrence along urban gradients in Charleston, Florence, Georgetown, and Horry counties, South Carolina. I surveyed 300 2.25-ha sites with impervious surface levels ranging from 3.2 to 96.3%. Using a generalized linear model, I assessed how impervious surface (%), highway density (m/ha), other road density (m/ha), total road density (m/ha), canopy cover (%), and powerline density (m/ha) are related to loggerhead shrike occurrence. Because loggerhead shrikes have been documented responding to habitat characteristics at multiple spatial scales, I measured predictor variables at the 2.25-ha, 20.25-ha, and 1-km scales.

T1  - Evolution Analysis of Ecological Networks Based on Spatial Distribution Data of Land Use Types Monitored by Remote Sensing in Wuhan Urban Agglomeration, China, from 2000 to 2020
AN  - 2674395500
AB  - Construction and protection of ecological networks (ENs) is considered to be an effective means to curb habitat fragmentation and strengthen landscape connectivity. In this study, a complete evaluation framework of ENs based on “quality–function–structure” was proposed to support the formulation of protection strategies for ENs. First, we built the ENs of Wuhan urban agglomeration (WUA) from 2000 to 2020 based on the advantages of circuit theory and remote sensing data of land use monitoring. The results showed that land development activities are an important driving force for the temporal and spatial evolution of global ENs. Forest fragmentation, transitional urban expansion, and agricultural reclamation were important inducements for the shrinkage of ecological sources. They may also increase the resistance of species migration, which will lead to qualitative change and even fracture of ecological corridors. Second, circuit theory, centrality index, and complex network theory were applied to evaluate the quality defects, functional connectivity, and topology characteristics of ENs in WUA, respectively, from 2000 to 2020. The results showed that the antagonism between ecological corridors and land development activities led to ecological quality defects (ecological barriers and pinchpoints). Different land development models had differential effects on centrality indexes. Moreover, the main trunk in the northern Dabie Mountains and the southern Mufu mountains was developed, while the secondary trunks were abundant in the middle of WUA. Finally, we proposed protection strategies for ENs based on the coupling of the “quality–function–structure” of WUA in 2020. It is suggested that all ecological sources must be included in nature reserves to prevent natural or manmade erosion. The key areas to be repaired were determined through the quality evaluation of ecological corridors. The priority of construction and protection of ecological corridors was determined by coupling two topological structures and functions. We argue that specific protection strategies and directions can be determined according to the construction objectives of local ENs.

T1  - Human Disturbance on High Andean Forests in Colombia: Spatio-temporal Dynamics and Vegetation Analysis of Forests Fragments around Bogotá, and Potential Effects of Climate Change on Treeline Species Distribution
AN  - 2620982332
AB  - This research presents a multi-scalar work on the effects of human disturbance on high Andean forests in Colombia. It focuses on the analysis of vegetation composition and structure and on the dynamics of forest cover change and connectivity through time in selected localities around Bogotá. Additionally, a distribution model exercise is carried out to further the understanding of the environmental constraints driving the present distribution of a distinctive Andean treeline species and to examine its response to climate change in the future.High Andean forests are a unique and highly biodiverse ecosystem, located at high elevations in one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots, the Tropical Andes. Unfortunately, these forests are extremely fragmented and particularly vulnerable to climate change. Despite the fact that they provide essential ecosystem services to neighboring high Andean cities, such as the capital of Colombia, Bogotá, overall, high Andean forests have been poorly studied. Their fragility and their great value in terms of environmental services, together with their outstanding diversity, make them ecosystems with high priority for conservation. Nevertheless, especially around Bogotá, the vegetation studies carried out often have been rather circumscribed, rarely incorporating more complex parameters such as landscape fragmentation and anthropic disturbance metrics nor assessing functional and phylogenetic diversity attributes and ecosystem services. Also, there is a lack of studies that consider multiple vegetation strata at once and that address long-term changes in the extent and structure of high Andean forests, pairing plot-based work with forest cover change analysis. Lastly, few efforts have been made so far to model the response to climate change of high Andean forests and their species. Investigating these aspects could provide meaningful insights into species’ responses to anthropic influences and community assembly mechanisms, broadening our understanding of high Andean forests and strengthening strategies to conserve them.The aim of the present study is to explore the relationship between human disturbance and the condition of high Andean forest in the surroundings of Bogotá, the growing capital city of Colombia. Therefore, three parallel approaches were developed and implemented. On one hand, permanent plots establishment and plot-based fieldwork was carried out in several localities in the surroundings of Bogotá. Here, tree layer and understory vegetation were assessed and analyzed in terms of their taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity, but also as to their structure and above-ground biomass production. A broad array of environmental factors and anthropic disturbance-related indicators was compiled and subsequently used to characterize the tree layer and understory plant communities using a cluster analysis in combination with ordination techniques (Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling and partial Redundancy Analysis). Finally, environmental and disturbance predictors were related to tree and understory diversity metrics and above-ground biomass by means of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). As a result, a noticeable effect of anthropic related predictors on both tree and understory layer community composition and also a direct negative effect on tree layer diversity and above-ground biomass production have been documented.Alternate abstract:Die vorliegende Arbeit ist eine multiskalare Studie über die Auswirkungen anthropogener Störung auf hochandine Wälder in Kolumbien. Ihr Schwerpunkt liegt auf der Analyse der Vegetationszusammensetzung und -struktur sowie auf der Dynamik der Waldbedeckungs-veränderung und -konnektivität in ausgewählten Orten im Umland von Bogotá. Darüber hinaus werden die Ergebnisse einer Verbreitungsmodellierung vorgestellt, die durchgeführt wurde, um zu zeigen, welche Umweltfaktoren die derzeitige Verbreitung einer im andinen Raum für Baumgrenzen typischen Baumart beeinflussen, und um die Folgen durch den Klimawandel für diese Art zu untersuchen.Hochandine Wälder sind einzigartige Ökosysteme mit einer immensen biologischen Vielfalt, die in hohen Lagen der tropischen Anden vorkommen, einem der Biodiversitäts-Hotspots des Planeten. Leider sind diese Wälder extrem fragmentiert und besonders anfällig für Veränderungen durch den Klimawandel. Obwohl hochandine Wälder für umliegende Städte, wie der kolumbianischen Hauptstadt Bogotá, eine große Anzahl von ökosystemischen Dienstleistungen zur Verfügung stellen, wurden sie bisher nur unzureichend untersucht. Ihre Fragilität und ihre große Bedeutung hinsichtlich ökosystemischer Dienstleistungen sowie ihre herausragende Vielfalt machen sie zu Ökosystemen mit hoher Priorität für den Naturschutz. Insbesondere in der Umgebung von Bogotá wurden Vegetationsstudien jedoch bisher nur sehr punktuell durchgeführt und berücksichtigten weder komplexere Parameter wie Landschaftsfragmentierung und anthropische Störungsmetriken, noch bezogen sie funktionelle und phylogenetische Diversitätsattribute und Ökosystemleistungen mit ein. Es fehlten auch Studien, die mehrere Vegetationsstrata gleichzeitig berücksichtigten, sich mit langfristigen Veränderungen der Fragmentgröße und Vegetationsstruktur von hochandinen Wäldern befassten und welche Plot-basierte Feldaufnahmen mit Analysen zur Veränderung der Waldbedeckung kombinierten. Letztendlich wurden bisher kaum Anstrengungen unternommen, um die Reaktion der hochandinen Wälder und ihrer Pflanzenarten auf den Klimawandel zu modellieren. Die Untersuchung dieser Aspekte lieferte jedoch wichtige Einblicke in die Reaktionen der hier vorkommenden Pflanzenarten auf anthropische Einflüsse und in Mechanismen der Bildung hier ansässiger Pflanzengemeinschaften, was insgesamt zu einem tieferen Verständnis der hochandinen Wälder führen und Strategien zu deren Erhaltung stärken würde.Ziel der vorliegenden Studie ist es, den Zusammenhang zwischen menschlicher Störung und dem Zustand des hochandinen Waldes in der Umgebung von Bogotá, der wachsenden Hauptstadt Kolumbiens, zu untersuchen. Daher wurden drei parallele Forschungsansätze entwickelt und durchgeführt. Einerseits wurden in mehreren Lokalitäten in der Umgebung von Bogotá permanente Plots etabliert und Plot-basierte Vegetationsaufnahmen durchgeführt. Auf diese Weise wurden Baum- und Krautschichtvegetation hinsichtlich ihrer taxonomischen, funktionellen und phylogenetischen Vielfalt, aber auch hinsichtlich ihrer Struktur und oberirdischen Biomasseproduktion bewertet und analysiert. Dazu wurde hier eine große Anzahl von Umweltfaktoren und Indikatoren für anthropische Störungen zusammengestellt und anschließend verwendet, um die Baum- und Krautschichtgemeinschaften mithilfe einer Clusteranalyse in Kombination mit Ordinationstechniken (Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling und partial Redundancy Analysis) zu charakterisieren. Schließlich wurden Umwelt- und Störungsprädiktoren mithilfe von Generalisierten Linearen Modellen (GLMs) mit Baum- und Krautschicht-Diversitätsmetriken und ihrer oberirdischen Biomasseproduktion in Beziehung gesetzt. Als Ergebnis wurde ein starker Effekt anthropischer Prädiktoren auf die Zusammensetzung der Baum- und Krautschichtgemeinschaften sowie ein direkter negativer Effekt auf die Diversität der Baumschicht und die oberirdische Biomasseproduktion nachgewiesen.Des Weiteren wurde eine gründliche Analyse von Luftbildern zu den im Zuge der ersten Studie untersuchten Lokalitäten durchgeführt, welche den Zeitraum zwischen den 1940er und den frühen 2000er Jahren abdeckte, um Einblick in die Geschichte der Waldfragmentierung in der Region zu gewähren.

T1  - Wildlife Crossing Over Route 101 and the Benefits and Challenges it Presents
AN  - 2583938288
AB  - Biodiversity across the world is in decline due to population increases as well as urban development. Subsequently, fragmentations of the landscape and habitat loss are occurring. Globally, only twenty-one biodiversity hotspots remain, and nowhere is the risk more severe than in Southern California. In countering these threats, it has become necessary to connect all available open lands in Southern California to create a network for wildlife movement. Such an interconnected set of reserves will allow natural ecological processes to continue and thrive, as they have for centuries. Thus, researchers in the field identified the Santa Monica – Sierra Madre Connection as the highest priority linkages to conserve, which would provide miles of roaming ground to a wide variety of animals, ranging from shrews to mountain lions. Mammals, especially mountain lions, require a large area for hunting and to thrive genetically. However, this once-contiguous mountain range stretching from Santa Monica to Sierra Madre was severed in the early 1970s by the construction of the US-101 Freeway, dividing the habitat range into isolated habitat fragments and severely restricting movement for many wildlife species, including mountain lions, bobcats, gray foxes, coyotes, and mule deer, between the two mountain ranges. For mountain lions in particular, this restriction has led to increased inbreeding, territorial fighting, and very low genetic diversity. Research conducted by the National Park Service since 2002 has demonstrated that because of a fragmented landscape, mountain lions could face extinction in the Santa Monica Mountains within fifty years, with a median of fifteen years.Therefore, researchers analyzed several locations and investigated probable alternatives and recommended the development of a vegetated bridge over US-101, near Liberty Canyon Road, in the City of Agoura Hills, which would both provide the best location in the region for improving connectivity and serve the broadest range of species.Once built, this bridge would be the largest wildlife crossing of its kind in the world and the first to attempt a large-scale intervention for wildlife in an urban area with over twenty million people—and over a roadway carrying over three hundred thousand vehicles per day. This project will set a model worldwide for urban wildlife conservation and help inform future efforts. It has renewed the urgency to keep our wildlife from going extinct because of urban development and demonstrates that animals and humans can coexist.

T1  - If You Feed Them, They Will Come: How the Availability of Food and Cover Within a Zoo Enclosure Increases the Likelihood of Free-Living Birds Within
AN  - 2572716146
AB  - Recently, the role of the modern day zoo has shifted away from ‘Ark’ style conservation towards more in-situ conservation and education. In-situ conservation often focuses upon exotic species and actions taken to conserve these species require extensive funding. A relatively unexplored and less costly form of conservation for zoos to become involved in is the promotion of free-living bird species within zoo grounds. However, within the peer reviewed literature there are few studies which describe free-living species across zoos and only one study (on free-living corvids) attempts to attribute factors within a zoo to the distribution of free-living species. The current study investigates factors affecting free-living bird abundances across multiple zoos. Over a period of seven months, four zoos were studied with 10 enclosures from each zoo being randomly selected for survey. Utilising point counts at an enclosure level, interactions of free-living bird species were recorded. Results highlight both cover within enclosures and the availability of subsidised feeding as significant factors in influencing free-living bird presence within. Further, results demonstrate that factors affecting bird presence and abundance are species specific, with access to subsidised food within an enclosure being significant for both house sparrows (Passer domesticus) and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), but not for the robin (Erithacus rubecula). While the study presented is limited by sample size and survey effort, a novel approach in relating free-living bird presence to enclosure design is described, allowing for future studies to fully explore factors influencing free-living species distributions across zoo grounds. Utilising results from this study, zoos can begin to actively promote native bird conservation and further develop biodiversity action plans designed to encourage native species conservation within zoo grounds.

T1  - Forest Structure Shapes Tropical Terrestrial and Arboreal Mesomammal Communities Under Moderate Disturbance
AN  - 2562266960
AB  - Tropical biodiversity is threatened globally by anthropogenic disturbances, particularly forest degradation and overhunting. Where large mammals have been extirpated, smaller-bodied “mesomammals” may play an important ecological role (e.g., as seed-dispersers). However, mesomammals are routinely understudied as they tend to be rare, cryptic, and nocturnal. Tropical tree-dwelling (arboreal and semi-arboreal) mesomammals are especially vulnerable to forest conversion, particularly when reliant on old growth forest structures. Understanding species- and community-level responses of terrestrial and arboreal mesomammals to changes in forest structure and human activity is crucial for informing management decisions in protected areas where resources are limited. We deployed 20 arboreal and 75 terrestrial camera traps throughout Nam Cat Tien National Park, southern Vietnam. The study objectives of the first chapter were to 1) identify long-term changes in terrestrial mesomammal richness and 2) evaluate the effects of forest structure and anthropogenic disturbance on an 18-species mesomammal community using community occupancy models. The objectives of the second chapter were to 1) evaluate the utility of arboreal camera traps for surveying nine arboreal and four semi-arboreal tropical mesomammals, 2) model the effects of forest structure and anthropogenic disturbance on detection and occurrence of arboreal mesomammals using generalized linear mixed models and single-season occupancy models, and 3) estimate arboreality of semi-arboreal species using multi-scale occupancy models. We found that terrestrial mesomammal site occupancy was driven largely by the interaction between distance to seasonally inundated grassland and absolute forest cover (basal area per hectare). We found no negative effects of anthropogenic factors at the community-level. However, we did find that four disturbance-tolerant small carnivores have been extirpated since the 1990s and continued human presence in the park suggests that hunting and snaring remains an acute threat to native mesomammals. We also found that canopy connectivity and other mature forest characteristics were important across the arboreal community. The effect of tree and focal limb characteristics on species detection was most likely explained by physiological adaptations and tree use behavior. Mean occupancy was underestimated for most semi-arboreal species when only one method was used. Multi-method occupancy designs may thus improve estimates of species distribution and habitat use, which are important for guiding management and conservation decisions.

T1  - Modeling the trade-offs between urban development and ecological process based on landscape multi-functionality and regional ecological networks
AN  - 2445292649
AB  - The process of urbanization and urban land use conversion inevitably disturbs the structure and function of ecosystems and their capacity to provide ecosystem services. Integrating ecosystem services into effective policies and planning at the regional scale to achieve sustainable urban development is still a challenge. The goal of this research is to optimize spatial patterns of urban development by assessing and comparing multiple trade-off scenarios between ecological processes and urban expansion, incorporating planning and design into spatially explicit methods, and integrating ecosystem services into decision-making procedures. We develop a conceptual framework for regional urban-ecological sustainability with six steps: pattern recognition, landscape process, problem diagnosis, integrated ecological network, urbanization simulation, and decision-support. We apply this framework to a case in which planning and design have followed the rational-comprehensive approach. Results demonstrate that landscape multi-functionality and regional ecological networks are significantly improved using our integrated approach to planning and design, because it provides vital information for regional planning to cope with the urgent need for ecological protection and urban development. By comparing urban growth under three scenarios, we found that the trade-off scenario based on ecological conservation and restoration (medium security level) resolved conflict more effectively, which restricted urban expansion on land of high ecological importance by constructing regional ecological networks. In addition, using field survey and species distribution model approaches, we design plant community types with complementary tree, shrub, and herb species as part of the decision-making procedure, which can restore zonal vegetation and the hydrological cycle in rugged mountain regions. The research concludes that regional urban-ecological sustainability based on scientific assessment, planning, and design provides a rational basis for sustainable urban development and landscape management.

T1  - Effects of habitat fragment size and isolation on the density and genetics of urban red-backed salamanders (<i>Plethodon cinereus</i>)
AN  - 2421244241
AB  - Urban expansion is creating environmental stressors through land use change, habitat fragmentation, and habitat loss. These stressors, along with a host of others, are driving precipitous declines in vertebrate taxa around the world. Amphibians, often requiring a narrow range of environmental conditions, can be especially susceptible to the stressors of environmental change. Despite habitat loss and degradation, some amphibian species continue to persist in altered urban landscapes. The red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) is one such- species and in this study, we assess how habitat patch size affects population density and genetic diversity of salamander populations in and around an urban center in Ohio, United States. Further, we examined patterns of genetic differentiation and landscape connectivity to understand gene flow between populations and tested for historic demographic bottleneck effects. Populations were sampled from 9 urban forest patches ranging in size from less than 1 ha to approximately 250 ha. There was no apparent effect of contiguous habitat patch size on salamander density nor genetic diversity, but we did observe significant genetic differentiation between 97% of pairwise population comparisons. The differentiation observed was not a result of overland distance or effective distance due to landscape resistance. There was evidence of historic bottlenecks at every site. These results suggest that density is driven by within-patch heterogeneity and that genetic diversity is affected by drivers other than patch size or contemporary population density. Our study demonstrates that red-backed salamanders can persist in wooded, urban parks, but that genetic diversity remains susceptible to demographic changes.

T1  - Effects of low-density urbanization on genetic structure in the Song Sparrow
AN  - 2412532752
AB  - Urbanization fragments landscapes and can impede the movement of organisms through their environment, which can decrease population connectivity. Reduction in connectivity influences gene flow and allele frequencies, and can lead to a reduction in genetic diversity and the fixation of certain alleles, with potential negative effects for populations. Previous studies have detected effects of urbanization on genetic diversity and structure in terrestrial animals living in landscapes that vary in their degree of urbanization, even over very short distances. We investigated the effects of low-intensity urbanization on genetic diversity and genetic structure in Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia). We captured 208 Song Sparrows at seven sites along a gradient of urbanization in and around Blacksburg, VA, USA, then genotyped them using a panel of fifteen polymorphic microsatellite loci. We found that genetic diversity was comparable among the seven study sites, and there was no evidence of genetic structuring among sites. These findings suggest that over a gradient of urbanization characterized by low density urban development, Song Sparrows likely exist in a single panmictic population.

T1  - Combining genetic and demographic monitoring better informs conservation of an endangered urban snake
AN  - 2398585065
AB  - Conversion and fragmentation of wildlife habitat often leads to smaller and isolated populations and can reduce a species’ ability to disperse across the landscape. As a consequence, genetic drift can quickly lower genetic variation and increase vulnerability to extirpation. For species of conservation concern, quantification of population size and connectivity can clarify the influence of genetic drift in local populations and provides important information for conservation management and recovery strategies. Here, we used genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and capture-mark-recapture methods to evaluate the genetic diversity and demography within seven focal sites of the endangered San Francisco gartersnake (Thamnophis sirtalis tetrataenia), a species affected by alteration and isolation of wetland habitats throughout its distribution. The primary goals were to determine the population structure and degree of genetic isolation among T. s. tetrataenia populations and estimate effective size and population abundance within sites to better understand the present and future importance of genetic drift. We also used temporally sampled datasets to examine the magnitude of genetic change over time. We found moderate population genetic structure throughout the San Francisco Peninsula that partitions sites into northern and southern regional clusters. Point estimates of both effective size and population abundance were generally small (≤ 100) for a majority of the sites, and estimates were particularly low in the northern populations. Genetic analyses of temporal datasets indicated an increase in genetic differentiation, especially for the most geographically isolated sites, and decreased genetic diversity over time in at least one site (Pacifica). Our results suggest that drift-mediated processes as a function of small population size and reduced connectivity from neighboring populations may decrease diversity and increase differentiation. Improving genetic diversity and connectivity among T. s. tetrataenia populations could promote persistence of this endangered snake.

T1  - Resilience and Sensitivity to Changing Environments in North American River Otters (<em>Lontra canadensis</em>)
AN  - 2488594143
AB  - The North American river otter is a semiaquatic carnivore that occupies freshwater habitats across most of North America, and is a conservation symbol across most of its range. It is used as an indicator species, a keystone species, an umbrella species, and an example of conservation success. The broad distribution of river otters suggests a broad range of habitat tolerances, but they appear to be highly sensitive to anthropogenic habitat alterations. This apparently conflicting robustness across habitat types and sensitivity to habitat change has baffled researchers for decades. Using morphometric, modeling, and synthetic approaches I explored how otters relate to their environment on a broad scale to gain a better understanding of the conditions to which they are robust, the conditions to which they are sensitive, and the mechanisms by which they adapt to varying environments. Using Maximum Entropy species distribution models I determined that river otter distributions are not strongly affected by climate or macro-environmental variables. Using geometric morphometric methods to examine how cranial shape varies across geographic and ecological space, I determined that morphological variation which may affect feeding and locomotion occurs more intensely at local than broad scales, indicating local morphological adaptation is not strong in this species. Finally, a review of the phylogeography and ecology of river otters and related species indicated that this species evolved from a low-speciation lineage that tends to produce species that can occupy a wide variety of environments without undergoing evolutionary change. Overall I determined that river otters do indeed have a broad ecological niche, and do not respond strongly to climatic or environmental differences or changes across their habitats through altering their distributions or locally adapting. Evidence suggests that river otters may respond strongly to anthropogenic alterations of their habitats because anthropogenically-induced habitat alterations tend to have strong consequences for aquatic food chains, and otters may be more reliant on robust food webs than they are on other aspects of their habitats. These findings have implications for how we think of otter conservation and the conservation of species and ecosystems that are strongly affected by otter presence, as well as what otters indicate about their habitat quality. Additionally, these results may shed light on the ecologies of other mustelid carnivores.In the first chapter of my dissertation I conducted a review of the phylogenetics and biogeography of North and South American river otters to investigate how geography and environmental change have driven river otter evolution in the Americas, and how this informs the ecology of the modern species. I focused first on reviewing the biogeography and evolutionary history of Lontra and Pteronura, and then on the modern ecology, threats, and conservations status of each of the four modern species of Lontra and the single extant species of Pteronura. I chose to review these species because they overlap in geographic and environmental space, and because their shared history provides means for an evolutionarily-grounded examination of relative rarity, specialization, and level of conservation concern. I found that speciation between American otters primarily occurs allopatrically, and there is little functional differentiation in response to allopatric speciation, though they do appear to have the ability to adapt in response to extreme conditions when necessary. Additionally, allopatric speciation primarily occurs in response to changes in waterway connectivity, which is also responsible for changes in population connectivity within the modern species. Most otters have less specific habitat requirements than previously thought, as all species of Lontra persist across a wide variety of climates and semi-aquatic environments, and most of them do so without exhibiting a strong evolutionary response. All American river otters exhibit a strong sensitivity to anthropogenic habitat destruction, though several of them have also shown some ability to coexist with humans. Evidence from this study provides strong indication that this has to do with how human activities near waterways affect food webs, and more generally that on closer examination many habitat components previously thought to be requirements for otters may be better interpreted as indicators of food availability.In the second chapter of my dissertation I use species distribution modeling to examine river otter associations with climate and environment across their range to explore their apparently conflicting robustness to habitat change and sensitivity to human presence. Specifically, I examined the climate and landcover variables that constrain the geographic distribution of otters. I obtained otter occurrences from GBIF and BISON biodiversity databases, climate variables from BIOCLIM, and environmental layers from NASA’s SEDAC program. I built Maximum Entropy species distribution models at 80 and 150 km spatial thinning and varying numbers of background points. The combined model at 80 km spatial thinning and default number of background points produced the highest quality models. Six climatic and landcover variables explained over 10% of otter distributions each: open shrubland, net primary productivity, urban/built, water, annual mean temperature, and precipitation of coldest quarter. Of these variables I determined that water, annual mean temperature, and precipitation of coldest quarter likely have biological significance. However, the predicted range map generated by these models do not match river otter distributions generated by the IUCN and NatureServe. This is likely due to incomplete occurrence data because of low reporting in parts of the species range. I conclude based on these data that river otters have broad climatic and habitat tolerances (as there are six weakly predictive variables as opposed to 1–2 strongly controlling variables) and that local habitat factors, such as intact-ness of riverine food webs, may have greater impact on otter distributions than broad regional variables. Additionally, I call for improved monitoring and reporting of this and other broadly-distributed species to ensure we can adequately track their habitat requirements and conservation status.In the third chapter of my dissertation I use geometric morphometrics to explore the role of cranial morphological variation in otter persistence across the array of otter habitats. I address two research questions: 1. Is there morphological variation and structure in river otters across subspecies? 2. Is morphological variation in river otters best explained by a pattern of isolation by distance or isolation by ecology? I obtained 100 river otter crania from across the species range from museums. I 3-D scanned them using a Geomagic 3-D scanner and landmarked them using the IDAV Landmark program. To answer Q1 I conducted discriminant function analyses Procrustes ANOVAs and a Principal Components Analysis. None of these tests revealed strong morphological patterning, indicating there is not morphological differentiation across subspecies in cranial shape. T address Q2 I conducted Mantel tests and a Multiple Matrix Regression with Randomization (MMRR) on the relationship between morphological distance and geographic, climatic, and environmental distance. Both the Mantel test and the MMRR results indicated no significant relationship between morphological distance and climatic or environmental distance in otter crania. Both indicated a weak but negative relationship between morphological distance and geographic distance, indicating morphological variation is greater at short geographic distances and lower at broad geographic distances. I conclude that there is significant cranial variation between individuals, but little definable structure in this variation. The weak but significant (and potentially complex) relationship between geographic and morphological distance indicates the possibility that diversifying selection across smaller spatial scales may be more important than differentiation across broader populations, possibly indicating individual specialization within a generalist population.

T1  - Comparative Population Genomics of Native (<em>Sundamys Muelleri</em>) and Invasive (<em>Rattus Rattus</em>) Rodents Along an Urbanization Gradient in Borneo
AN  - 2449177031
AB  - Urbanization continues to be one of the most significant processes of global change modifying the environment rapidly and permanently. With increases in infrastructure and human settlement, natural areas become fragmented, and small populations in these patches become more vulnerable to genetic drift and are unable to disperse due to barriers to gene flow. Often these pervasive alterations to the environment result in the introduction of exotic species that can thrive in urban habitats with anthropogenically made available resources. Both native and nonnative wildlife that inhabit cities and nearby non-urban areas serve as ideal models to show how populations are evolving in response to developmental pressures. While native rodents in urban areas exhibit patterns of low genetic diversity and genetic connectivity, populations of invasive rodents reveal high connectivity and gene flow. Studying the evolutionary implications of this ecological change, particularly in understudied regions of rapid development like in biodiverse rich areas of Southeast Asia, will be vital to understand the variation of species responses to urbanization. In this study, I explored genetic diversity, structure, and connectivity of populations of the native Müller's giant Sunda rat (Sundamys muelleri) and invasive black rat (Rattus rattus) across an urbanization gradient on the island on Borneo. Sundamys muelleri exhibited decreased genetic diversity in urban areas and was differentiated from rural and suburban locations. Populations of S. muelleri also displayed low genetic connectivity with urbanization posing a potential barrier to gene flow. Rattus rattus exhibited decreased genetic diversity in rural areas and a clinal genetic structure across the urbanization gradient. Populations of R. rattus also displayed high genetic connectivity, but development likely still prevents dispersal opportunities. This research provides useful information on how urbanization evolutionarily affects these two species of rodents (a native and invasive) and how development impacts population structure and connectivity. This information will provide useful for the conservation of endemic species in Borneo, to better understand the population genetics of these vector species and inform pest management across the urbanization gradient.

T1  - Process Oriented Infrastructure for Climate-Driven Forest Migration Through Cities
AN  - 2440362827
AB  - Global climate change is expected to shift the geographical distribution of tree species worldwide. Increasing empirical evidence has emerged showing that many tree species are already moving toward higher latitudes to track suitable climatic conditions. Yet, such movement cannot guarantee their survival, especially if the accessibility of suitable climates is highly constrained by species dispersal capabilities and human-created barriers. In order to assist forest migration, many efforts have been made to translocate tree species from their native ranges to locations where the climate is projected to be suitable in the future (known as assisted migration). However, there are concerns that such translocations may not be successful and may lead to unpredictable adverse consequences. This is because uncertainties in species’ distribution projections could cause a risk of moving species too far or not far enough. Within this context, this study develops a process-oriented approach to map and design urban landscapes to facilitate forest migration under climate change. The focus lies on the connectivity of urban landscapes for effective seed dispersal. Since the migration of trees is a continuing process that does not rely on their future distributions, a process-oriented approach could avoid projections of species’ future distributions and thus might be more feasible and manageable, as well as more robust to future climate change, than the current “goal-oriented” strategy of assisted migration. This study is guided by the following three research questions: (1) Why should we consider cities in the process of forest migration and what roles can urban landscapes play in the process? (2) How can forest trees migrate through urban areas, and more specifically, how can urban landscapes, as seed sources or stepping stones, contribute to the process? (3) How to design urban green infrastructure to facilitate forest migration and, more specifically, to promote seed dispersal and species’ range expansion across urban areas? A three-phase research methodology, which includes a transdisciplinary literature review, a mapping-based approach and a research-by-design methodology, is proposed to answer each of the three research questions, respectively. The Greater Manchester area, which is one of the most urbanised regions in the UK, is selected as a case study site. Eurasian jays, Eurasian siskins, and coal tits are selected as the main seed dispersal agents in the study area. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of urban landscapes to facilitate climatedriven forest migration through cities. By collecting and integrating knowledge and II information from multiple disciplines, this study suggests that cities could provide suitable climatic (urban heat islands) and environmental conditions for the persistence of outlier populations at higher latitudes than their native ranges, thereby shortening or even eliminating migration lags in tree species. The proposed process-oriented approach maps potential migration flows between urban woodlands in Greater Manchester, from the perspective of seed dispersal. Furthermore, by testing different afforestation strategies, this study reveals that the processes of forest migration at a metropolitan scale can be facilitated by creating small, distributed but functional-connected green spaces at site scales. The process-oriented approach can be used by designers to re-visualise urban landscapes as a series of interconnected flow channels, which in turn allows for a more piecemeal form of landscape design to improve urban green infrastructure for climate adaptation. Moreover, this study will encourage researchers who currently work in climate-driven species migration to consider taking advantage of urban landscapes and will promote the cooperation between biologists, foresters, designers, and managers in urban planting to cope with the rapidly changing climate.

T1  - Genetic Connectivity of Stream Salamanders in Urban, Suburban, and Rural Habitats
AN  - 2417056922
AB  - Ongoing human population growth and increased urban development around the world is inflicting new pressures and challenges for wildlife living within areas affected by urbanization. Habitat alteration can have severe consequences for native species that remain in previously undisturbed areas. Urban development has shown to reduce abundance and density of populations and create barriers to gene flow for stream salamanders in urban areas. Although they are still relatively common and abundant through the Northeast, Northern two-lined salamander (Eurycea bislineata) populations are declining in urban habitats including in New York City. In this study, I explored genetic structure of E. bislineata across an urban, suburban and rural habitat to better understand how urbanization is affecting genetic connectivity between headwater streams. Next, I investigated what environmental and/or urban features influence gene flow patterns in E. bislineata across these same three habitats using landscape genetic methods. Lastly, I used environmental DNA monitoring with metabarcoding techniques to explore stream salamander presence on an urban-to-rural gradient and to investigate overall vertebrate species richness differences to further understand how urban development may be affecting biodiversity in urban aquatic ecosystems.E. bislineata within the urban habitat had greater genetic structure, yet exhibited comparable genetic diversity levels to individuals in the suburban and rural habitat. A mixture of terrestrial variables influence gene flow in the urban habitat, percent canopy cover is most influential for gene flow in the suburban habitat, and variation in aquatic variables affects gene flow patterns for rural stream salamanders. Urbanization factors were identified as the second most important features affecting genetic variation for salamanders in the suburban and urban habitats. Finally, using eDNA from stream water, I found that E. bislineata is present in streams across a gradient of urban development, while another common stream salamander species, Desmognathus fuscus was only detected in more non-urban habitats. With this method, I also detected differences in species composition in urban versus non-urban habitats, mostly due to more non-native species eDNA detected in more urbanized streams. This dissertation provides further understanding of how urbanization affects the evolution of a native amphibian species and how urban development affects stream salamander distribution in the NYC metropolitan area. This information will inform conservation efforts and urban planning in cities that want to promote longevity of populations of this indicator species in our urban ecosystems.

T1  - Ungulates in the city: light pollution and open habitats predict the probability of roe deer occurring in an urban environment
AN  - 2188084050
AB  - Although large and medium-sized herbivorous mammals avoid urbanized areas, they have recently begun to colonize towns and cities. In general, ungulates continue to avoid the centres of urban areas, and utilize mainly their thinly built-up outskirts. While extension of urban development is preventing ungulates from penetrating the urban landscape, the influence of noise and light pollution on the occurrence of mammalian herbivores is still poorly understood. Hence, we investigated the hypothesis that habitat availability shapes the distribution of roe deer Capreolus capreolus and artificial lightening discourages them from penetrating the urban landscape. Roe deer was recorded on 37% of randomly selected sample plots (N = 60) located within the city of Kraków (S Poland). The occupied plots contained significantly more open habitats, woodland patches were larger in them, but proximity to rivers, and noise and light pollution were significantly lower. The logistic regression model revealed that an increasing area of open habitats was positively correlated with the probability of roe deer occurring. However, the artificial lighting at night was negatively correlated with the probability of the species occurring: the negative effect of light pollution was mitigated by the greater area of open habitats. Our study highlights the very considerable potential of light pollution as a predictor of the occurrence of large mammals in the urban landscape. We argue that urbanization and the related artificial lighting at night may be a factor preventing ungulates from penetrating potentially suitable habitats in urban areas.

T1  - Avian Communities and Ecoacoustics in a Tropical Human-Modified Landscape
AN  - 2440353937
AB  - Large areas of the tropics have been cleared of forest and converted to agriculture. The consequent human-modified landscapes (HMLs) comprise a heterogenous mix of habitats; forest fragments and riparian strips are embedded in a matrix of cattle pasture, non-native timber plantations, and urban centres. These habitat changes can have dramatic consequences for wildlife, leading to range shifts and extirpations. In turn, this can influence the integrity of ecosystem services such as frugivory and seed dispersal. Understanding how habitat conversion affects natural ecosystems is critical to inform conservation interventions, but requires long-term biodiversity monitoring and detailed knowledge of species-level responses to HMLs. The research presented in this thesis was conducted in the Emparador HML, in central Republic of Panama. In Chapter 2, we show that the regional avian community is shaped by extent of forest cover across the landscape, and to a lesser degree, extent of forest fragmentation and distance to core forest. Effects of forest cover and fragmentation were examined at local (10 ha) and landscape (500 ha) scales. Species-level responses to these factors varied widely; while abundance of many species increased with greater local-scale forest cover, greater landscape-scale forest cover was often associated with declines. Generalist species that readily persist in HMLs still responded positively to local-scale forest cover, suggesting that even smaller forest fragments in these landscapes are important for maintaining diverse avian assemblages. Critically, we found that species’ responses were not associated with particular traits such as dietary composition or forest dependence, highlighting that species may often exhibit idiosyncratic responses to landscape structure. Chapters 3 and 4 address the wider issue of long-term monitoring, and the potential for data collection over large spatiotemporal scales using remote audio recorders. Ecoacoustics, the study of environmental sound is a relatively new discipline, and as such there is still considerable uncertainty surrounding best-practice for collecting and processing recordings. One of the most straightforward means of utilising audio recordings for environmental monitoring is via acoustic indices. These are objective measures of sound based on features such as pitch and amplitude. To date, attempts to use these indices have been hindered by inconsistent or inappropriate methodologies. In Chapter 3, we determine how many recordings are required to comprehensively capture a soundscape, the acoustic energy of a location. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there are habitat-specific patterns in acoustic indices values, suggesting that these indices reflect differences in vegetation structure and wildlife. We develop this further in Chapter 4, where we show that avian species richness and abundance are clearly linked to patterns in acoustic indices values. Critically, these patterns were coherent among habitat types emphasising their potential for monitoring. Acoustic indices sensitive to the frequencies occupied by bird song have the greatest potential for monitoring an avian community. The results from these two chapters suggest that acoustic indices can be effective tools for monitoring biodiversity, with values reflecting consistent differences across habitats, and among avian assemblages. Audio recordings are a source of permanent, verifiable evidence that can be collected at much greater spatiotemporal scales than traditional biodiversity monitoring data. As the use of audio recorders grows, it is important to compare their efficacy with standard methods of data collection. In Chapter 5, we contrast data derived from audio recordings with that gathered using standard point count methods, and consider whether recorders are a feasible means of surveying antbirds (Thamnophilidae), a disturbance-sensitive avian taxon. Both approaches revealed species’ responses to landscape structure, with qualitatively similar patterns in response to forest cover and vegetation quality. We show that common species can be readily monitored using audio recorders, with greater levels of detectability compared with point counts. However, rarer species were more likely to be detected using point counts. The work presented in this thesis helps to explain the patterns seen in avian responses to Neotropical HMLs. In particular we emphasise the importance of forest cover for maintaining bird assemblages in these landscapes. We demonstrate the utility of audio recorders for data collection, and highlight their potential for future biodiversity monitoring. In the face of human population growth, and ongoing habitat disturbance and agricultural intensification, conservation efforts are essential to avoid widespread species extinctions and ecosystem collapse. Interventions must take place in HMLs, to bolster ecosystem services, provide buffer zones for protected areas, and improve connectivity in the wider landscape.

T1  - The Influence of Flow Variation on Community Composition in Streams and Rivers
AN  - 2384212217
AB  - Global change has severely impacted the flow regimes of river systems across the globe, and the species inhabiting those systems now find themselves adapted to hydrographs that no longer exist. This includes many of the flow regimes in California, as streams are experiencing an altered precipitation cycle and a system of dams, culverts, and wastewater treatment plants that have transformed rivers that were once naturally flowing into occasionally concrete-lined channels. In the following chapters, I report the results of several studies aimed at understanding the relationship between flow variability and the persistence of ecological communities in river systems, particularly diatoms and benthic macroinvertebrates. In chapter one, I utilize a set of high-elevation experimental stream channels to subject the stream benthic community to a gradient of drought treatments. In this study, I found that pool habitat serves as a better refuge to benthic macroinvertebrates than riffles, contingent on the presence of hyporheic flow. Additionally, perennial flow–adapted communities appear to resist flow reduction, up to the point when surface flow is lost. My second chapter examines the relationship between benthic macroinvertebrate community composition and flow regimes, spatial connectivity, and environmental variables at large spatial scales and long temporal scales. I found that spatial processes, such as drainage density and upstream area, and flow metrics, such as flow variability and zero-flow days, best explain temporal beta diversity in macroinvertebrate communities at the multi-catchment scale. Chapter three explores the impact of urban flow disturbance, in the form of effluent discharge from wastewater treatment plants and storm runoff, on benthic diatom and macroinvertebrate communities through space and time. I found that macroinvertebrates in such systems are resistant to flow perturbations, compositionally reflected in a relatively disturbance-tolerant community, while the diatoms reflected fast-paced resilience strategies. While erratic flow shutdowns from wastewater treatment plants result in losses of taxa and lower densities of individuals, large storm events further compound flow regime disturbance in the urban stream system. Overall in this dissertation, I demonstrate that flow disturbance is a strong predictor of benthic freshwater communities, and that determining the extent of hydrological disturbance at the correct timescale is critical to the conservation of freshwater biodiversity.

T1  - Spatial Population Genomics and Landscape Ecology of Urban Brown Rats (<em>Rattus norvegicus</em>)
AN  - 2301475448
AB  - Spatial patterns of genetic variation provide a lens into the ecological and evolutionary responses of wildlife populations to landscape heterogeneity, though our understanding of urban landscapes remains limited. Further, it remains unclear whether species exhibit parallel responses to independent landscapes. Commensal rodents are widely distributed within cities and around the world, offering a useful model for understanding the influence of cities on gene flow, genetic drift, and habitat distribution. Here I study the population genetics and landscape ecology of brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) in four urban landscapes, New York City (NYC), New Orleans (NOL), Salvador (SAL), Vancouver (VAN), using genome-wide SNPs to understand the influence of urban landscapes on eco-evolutionary processes governing their distribution and functional connectivity.Rat populations in each city exhibited significant genetic discontinuities that coincide with landscape features, despite widespread isolation-by-distance processes. Genetic variation in NYC and SAL rats was clinal, but I identified genetic clusters separated by areas with lower genetic diversity and reduced migration. Rats in NOL and SAL exhibited stark genetic structure that coincided with a canal and major roadways, respectively. I identified spatially restricted dispersal in all populations leading to parallel decays in spatial autocorrelation with increased distance. Habitat suitability modeling revealed a consistent response of rat distribution to human population density, income, and building characteristics. Landscape genetic modeling indicated that models incorporating features of the built physical environment consistently predict gene flow processes, though unique landscape effects were identified in each city, particularly at local spatial scales. Further, I found that habitat suitability and genetic connectivity were uncoupled (i.e., driven by different factors) and habitat is rarely the best predictor of gene flow for urban rats. My results demonstrate the utility of multi-landscape studies in identifying generalized trends across populations, with implications for the management of invasive pest populations. Ultimately, this dissertation improves our understanding of the influence of urban landscapes on neutral evolutionary processes in widely distributed species and the ecology of commensal rodents.

T1  - Multicriteria Evaluation of Transport Plan for High-Speed Rail: An Application to Beijing-Xiongan
AN  - 2230236856
AB  - Beijing has an enormous transportation challenge: to relieve the extreme congestion that has arisen, largely due to overpopulation. To meet this challenge, the city administration has decided to extend its territory; a new city will be planned and built. This new city, Xiongan, will reduce the burden on the capital. A new high-speed railway (HSR) line is designed to transport millions of people every day within less than an hour. This study applies the potential of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and multicriteria methods, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE II), to determine the best alternative of transportation for the new high-speed railway line between Beijing and Xiongan, comparing different ones. The methodology consists of two stages. In the first stage remote sensing datasets such as ASTER DEM and LANDSAT images and GIS software such as ERDAS IMAGINE and ArcGIS have been used to determine settlement distribution, station location, elevation model, slope percentage, vegetation percentage, and route alignment for a new high-speed railway line for better understanding of its spatial distribution pattern over the study area. The second phase of the study focusing on assessing the various alternatives of transportation has been determined, and three approaches to choosing the best alternative have been introduced. In the paper we examine criteria associated with travel and economic criteria: travel time, the number of train stops, public satisfaction with transport, the number of seats per day, connectivity, operating costs, profit, and the payback period. Six alternatives of transportation have been studied. The stops in Guan and stations in the metro’s rings have been investigated. In the second stage, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and PROMETHEE II methods have been used to select the best alternative. The first approach uses only criteria related to the trip, as the criterion to choose the best alternative is the maximum of the net outranking flows by PROMETHEE II method; the second approach applies two independent criteria: the ratio of normalized operating costs and the normalized net outranking flows, and the ratio of the normalized payback period and the normalized net outranking flows; the third approach includes all defined criteria, and the criterion of choosing the best alternative is the maximum of net outranking flows as calculated by the PROMETHEE II method. The approaches have been analyzed with the purpose of comparing the results. The result indicates that it is expedient to have a station in Guan, which will increase the connection and connectivity among the cities while providing fast mobility options for a large number of inhabitants of Guan city. Furthermore, the result from Remote Sensing and GIS analysis demonstrates that the proposed high-speed railway line will be environmentally sustainable and is economically/socially feasible and that it will certainly attract current and future passengers because of their needs.

T1  - The Impact of Infrastructure on Habitat Connectivity for Wildlife
AN  - 2206628453
AB  - Wildlife need connected habitats to move across the landscape to meet foraging needs, reproduce and establish new territories. Increasingly, habitat areas are lost due to conversion to alternative uses such as agriculture or urban development and being carved into pieces by roads and other transportation infrastructure. Roads are considered a major contributor to habitat fragmentation particularly as they are long, linear features prevalent throughout the landscape. The potential barriers species encounter and interact with on the landscape, such as roads or fences, could be permeable to some species and a near complete barrier to others. This creates a challenge when conservation professionals work on methods to plan for enhancing and preserving connectivity across the landscape.    While roads can present weak to complete barriers to wildlife, depending on the animal and traffic volume, mitigations such as under-crossings and green bridges on highways at least partially increase the permeability of the landscape to some of these species. The few studies evaluating the effectiveness of these structures for at least three years typically focused on a single species. Here, we monitored the crossing structure under Boeckman Road, in Wilsonville Oregon, for wildlife activity across summer seasons for ten years, since construction of the road and subsequent opening to traffic. This long-term multi-species dataset, which includes monitoring when the road was closed to traffic has provided a unique opportunity. Wildlife activity was collected using sand track pads monitored during summer seasons from 2009 to 2018. Wildlife activity showed a significant community level response from year to year and species-specific responses to year, vegetation change, disturbance, detection area, and previous experimental additions of artificial light. Black-tailed deer showed a significant negative association with disturbance, i.e. the presence of traffic and construction activity. Average annual detections of coyote, bullfrog, cottontail rabbit, and eastern gray squirrel demonstrate a dramatic but not significant response to the road closure period. In addition, it appears that the transition between species with preferences for lower canopy cover, and those preferring greater canopy cover, co-occurs with the road closure period, particularly in 2013. This is also the year that invasive plant management activities (mowing and spraying) stopped. Long-term studies such as this one can help researchers and managers design monitoring programs to best account for variable responses over time by documenting changes in use and working to identify covariates and interactive effects that may be driving those changes. Managers working on projects where vegetation disturbance or restoration is being conducted next to crossing structures may decide to delay monitoring until vegetation communities and/or habituation responses have had time to stabilize, avoiding erroneous conclusions about structure use.    Roads create barriers to animal movement through collisions and habitat fragmentation. Investigators have attempted to use traffic volume, the number of vehicles passing a point on a road segment, to predict effects to wildlife populations approximately linearly and along taxonomic lines; however, taxonomic groupings cannot provide sound predictions because closely related species often respond differently. We assess the role of wildlife behavioral responses to traffic volume as a tool to predict barrier effects from vehicle-caused mortality and avoidance, to provide an early warning system that recognizes traffic volume as a trigger for mitigation, and to better interpret roadkill data. We propose four categories of behavioral response based on the perceived danger to traffic: Nonresponders, Pausers, Speeders, and Avoiders. Nonresponders attempt to cross highways regardless of traffic volume. Pausers stop in the face of danger so have a low probability of successful crossing when traffic volume increases. Hence, highway barrier effects are primarily due to mortality for Nonresponders and Pausers at high traffic volumes. Speeders run away from danger but are unable to do so successfully as traffic volume increases. At moderate to high volume, Speeders are repelled by traffic danger. Avoiders face lower mortality than other categories because they begin to avoid traffic at relatively low traffic volumes. Hence, avoidance causes barrier effects more than mortality for Speeders and Avoiders even at relatively moderate traffic volumes. By considering a species’ risk-avoidance response to traffic, managers can make more appropriate and timely decisions to mitigate effects before populations decline or become locally extinct.    Barriers to animal movement can isolate populations, impacting their genetic diversity, susceptibility to disease, and access to resources. Barriers to movement may be caused by artificial light, but few studies have experimentally investigated the effects of artificial light on movement for a suite of terrestrial vertebrates. Therefore, we studied the effect of ecological light pollution on animal usage of a bridge under-road passage structure. (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.)

T1  - Functional connectivity in urban landscapes promoted by <i>Ramphastos toco</i> (Toco Toucan) and its implications for policy making
AN  - 2081904388
AB  - The scarcity of green areas in urban landscapes hinders connectivity among sites reducing the flux of organisms and seed dispersal. Ramphastos toco is an effective plant disperser in tropical landscapes, playing an important role in conserving plant connectivity. In this study we combined two methods of landscape connectivity analysis, in a way not yet explored, to assess the potential contribution of Ramphastos toco to enhancing connectivity among urban vegetation patches. We used spatial modeling techniques to evaluate least cost routes, or those that facilitate bird movement through green urban areas, in Belo Horizonte, a city in Southeast Brazil. We also assessed the relative importance of forest patches for conserving both bird and seed dispersal fluxes using the integral index of connectivity. The resulting least cost route of greater accessibility for the species included in its course an important forest patch under environmental licensing for the construction of a residential condominium. The number of green urban areas covered by forest, of highest habitat quality for the species, summed to 155 patches. Of this total only 5.2% were relevant for regional connectivity, while the four most important patches are targeted by the city’s expansion plans. Ramphastos toco is an effective connector for tropical green urban areas given its adaptability, wide range of movement and seed dispersal effectiveness. We emphasize the need for incorporating ecological knowledge and the prioritization of green areas into city planning, since current expansion projects jeopardize forest patches that are crucial to the functional connectivity of the urban landscape.

T1  - Potential distribution of coyotes (<i>Canis latrans</i>), Virginia opossums (<i>Didelphis virginiana</i>), striped skunks (<i>Mephitis mephitis</i>), and raccoons (<i>Procyon lotor</i>) in the Chicago Metropolitan Area
AN  - 2061233623
AB  - Large-scale distribution models are effective predictors of habitat suitability and connectivity across broad landscapes and are useful management tools, though few large-scale species distribution models exist for medium-sized predators in urban landscapes. We modeled the potential distribution of 4 medium-sized predators in a 17,361-km2 portion of the Chicago Metropolitan Area. We applied a maximum entropy algorithm model (MaxEnt) using presence-only data collected via remote cameras from 54 Lake County, Illinois, forest preserves during August–October 2008–2012. Environmental data layers used to model distributions were distances to forest, grassland, barren land, crops, wetlands, developed open space, developed low intensity, developed high intensity, water, primary roads, secondary roads, and tertiary roads. Coyotes (Canis latrans) had the greatest area of potential distribution followed by opossums (Didelphis virginiana), striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), and raccoons (Procyon lotor). Models for all species had high AUC values (0.90–0.94) indicating strong predictive performance. More than 50% of the study area was predicted to be within the distributional limit for each focal species. Distance to forest was the most important contributory predictor for all species modeled (82% - 96%) and higher probability of presence for all 4 species was indicated closer to forest and further from tertiary roads. However, coyotes and raccoons were predicted to prefer habitat closer to highly-developed areas. Our research indicates medium-sized predators are highly synanthropic and able to persist within the Chicago Metropolitan Area given adequate availability of non-urban land cover, particularly forest, and ample green space linking forest patches within highly-developed areas.

T1  - Mapping Individual Tree Species and Vitality along Urban Road Corridors with LiDAR and Imaging Sensors: Point Density versus View Perspective
AN  - 2126868056
AB  - To meet a growing demand for accurate high-fidelity vegetation cover mapping in urban areas toward biodiversity conservation and assessing the impact of climate change, this paper proposes a complete approach to species and vitality classification at single tree level by synergistic use of multimodality 3D remote sensing data. So far, airborne laser scanning system(ALS or airborne LiDAR) has shown promising results in tree cover mapping for urban areas. This paper analyzes the potential of mobile laser scanning system/mobile mapping system (MLS/MMS)-based methods for recognition of urban plant species and characterization of growth conditions using ultra-dense LiDAR point clouds and provides an objective comparison with the ALS-based methods. Firstly, to solve the extremely intensive computational burden caused by the classification of ultra-dense MLS data, a new method for the semantic labeling of LiDAR data in the urban road environment is developed based on combining a conditional random field (CRF) for the context-based classification of 3D point clouds with shape priors. These priors encode geometric primitives found in the scene through sample consensus segmentation. Then, single trees are segmented from the labelled tree points using the 3D graph cuts algorithm. Multinomial logistic regression classifiers are used to determine the fine deciduous urban tree species of conversation concern and their growth vitality. Finally, the weight-of-evidence (WofE) based decision fusion method is applied to combine the probability outputs of classification results from the MLS and ALS data. The experiment results obtained in city road corridors demonstrated that point cloud data acquired from the airborne platform achieved even slightly better results in terms of tree detection rate, tree species and vitality classification accuracy, although the tree vitality distribution in the test site is less balanced compared to the species distribution. When combined with MLS data, overall accuracies of 78% and 74% for tree species and vitality classification can be achieved, which has improved by 5.7% and 4.64% respectively compared to the usage of airborne data only.

T1  - Spatial and genetic distribution of a north American termite, <i>Reticulitermes flavipes</i>, across the landscape of Paris
AN  - 2015677408
AB  - Urbanization often negatively impacts biological diversity. Some organisms, however, have traits that are preadapted to urban environments and thus may thrive. Reticulitermes flavipes is one such organism. Indigenous to the Eastern US, it has been introduced into multiple countries. In France, R. flavipes causes major damage to buildings. Although Paris is one of the country’s most infested cities, the factors determining R. flavipes’ distribution and propagation are poorly understood. Using data on termite occurrence, termite genetics, and environmental variables, our study aims to identify factors that explain the distribution and spread of R. flavipes within Paris. First, we explored the association between several environmental variables and the termite’s distribution pattern in Paris; since 2000, a total of 2106 infestations have been recorded. Second, we inferred termite population and colony genetic structure at 66 sample locations using 9 microsatellite loci. Third, we used least-cost models and partial Mantel tests to study the effects of environmental variables on the termite’s population genetic structure. Our analyses revealed that building-related variables were significantly associated with termite infestations and could thus help explain the termite’s spatial distribution pattern. Furthermore, railway networks also explain termite propagation and genetic patterns. Additionally, we found that the termite’s spread is likely driven by budding dispersal, which may be constrained by buildings and roads. Even if budding dispersal could facilitate R. flavipes’ spread in urban areas, it cannot explain the termite’s distribution in Paris all on its own. Indeed, termite propagation seems to be significantly driven by anthropogenic activities.

T1  - What shapes plant and animal diversity on urban golf courses?
AN  - 1993689650
AB  - Recent concern over increasing loss of biodiversity has prompted considerable interest in the role of urban green spaces as reservoirs of local biodiversity. This study assessed the diversity of three indicator taxa - plants, ants and birds - on golf courses spanning a wide range of environmental variation in terms of climate, elevation, course age, size and connectivity to native woodland. Species richness and community composition was further compared between contrasting on-course habitat types that reflect different management intensities. We identified a set of taxon-specific environmental correlates indicating an intricate interplay of landscape- and local-scale variables that affect local species diversity. Our results show that floristic diversity is positively associated with the amount of rainfall, whereas ant and bird diversity are related to local-scale factors, particularly the number of trees and the size of water features on a site. The amount of on-course native habitat was a strong predictor of plant and ant diversity and was also associated with the number of unique species at the site level; this reinforces the value of remnant habitat patches as local biodiversity reservoirs that represent mini hot-spots in an otherwise species-poor urban landscape. Community composition for all three taxa differed markedly between non-playing and playing areas, with boundary and remnant habitats generally having more diverse, species-rich communities. Our results suggest that local floral and faunal biodiversity on urban golf courses can be enhanced by creating woody non-playing areas and, especially, by preserving, restoring or expanding remnant habitats.

T1  - Eco-Evolutionary Implications of Environmental Change Across Heterogeneous Landscapes
AN  - 2637957201
AB  - Species use a variety of mechanisms to adapt to environmental change. These range from spatially tracking optimal environments, to phenotypically plastic responses and evolutionary adaptation. Due to increases in anthropogenic influence on environments, characteristics of change such as their duration and magnitude are undergoing fundamental shifts away from the natural disturbance regimes that shaped species’ evolution. This dissertation uses empirical data and simulation models to examine the ecological and evolutionary consequences of environmental change across real, heterogeneous landscapes for multiple species, with an emphasis on anthropogenic changes. I used landscape genetics to evaluate the effects of urbanization on two native amphibian species, spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) and wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus). Population isolation was positively associated with local urbanization and lessened genetic diversity for both species. Resistance surface modelling revealed connectivity was diminished by developed land cover, light roads, interstates, and topography for both species, plus secondary roads and rivers for wood frogs, highlighting the influence of anthropogenic landscape features relative to natural features. Further study of a subset of wood frog populations revealed adaptive evolution associated with urban environments. I identified a set of 37 loci with the capacity to correctly reassign individuals into rural or urban populations with 87.5 and 93.8% accuracy, respectively. I developed an agent-based model to examine how gene flow, rates of change, and strength of landscape spatial and temporal autocorrelation influence abundance outcomes for species experiencing an environmental shift. Analysis of 36 environmental scenarios suggests that environmental variation, which is an emergent property of landscape autocorrelation, is negatively associated with the magnitude and duration of abundance declines following environmental change. Higher levels of gene flow lessened this effect, particularly in abrupt change scenarios, although gradual changes also resulted in demographic costs. Lastly, I used an investigation of an emerging disease in American lobsters (Homarus americanus) to study within-generation responses to environmental pressures. Using whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing I identified eight differentially expressed unigenes associated with the disease and seven related to environmental differences. Collectively, my dissertation provides numerous examples of how anthropogenically induced environmental change can direct ecological and evolutionary processes.

T1  - Multi-Scalar Drivers of Native Bee Community Composition and Population Genetic Structure in Human-Altered Landscapes
AN  - 2468723947
AB  - One of the most well-documented ecological impacts of human-caused landscape change is the fragmentation of natural habitats by human infrastructure, with potential implications for 1) community composition, and 2) species-level gene flow patterns. By including quantifiable measurements of local habitat composition, regional land-use, and the composition of the landscape matrix in ecological studies, we can better understand how multi-scalar environmental factors drive changes in wildlife community composition and dispersal processes, and infer subsequent consequences for ecosystem functions and services across human-altered landscapes. Pollination is a critical ecosystem service driven in part by wildlife community composition and dispersal processes, but despite the importance of bee pollination for ecosystem function, very little is known about how land-use drives native bee community composition and their population gene-flow patterns. This research addresses this literature gap by investigating native bee communities (Chapter 1) and native bee gene flow (Chapter 2) across heterogeneous human-altered landscapes in Texas, and proposes methods for expanding conservation genetic research of pollinators using curated bee specimens (Chapter 3).In Chapter 1, we conducted an extensive survey of bee communities across two urban landscape gradients in Austin and Dallas, Texas, USA comparing communities within agricultural and native grassland habitat types. In Chapter 2, we investigate the genetic structure and gene flow patterns of the native eastern carpenter bee, Xylocopa virginica across a 450 km corridor spanning multiple land-uses in Texas. In Chapter 3, we test the effects of sampling and curation methods on next-generation sequencing of three widespread North American native bee species. Our results indicate that the composition of regional land-use differentially impacts bee abundance and diversity depending on local habitat management and between bee functional groups, and that contemporary land-use as well as regional and fine-scale geographic distance influence the gene flow patterns of a large wood-nesting bee. Lastly, we find that sampling and storage method influence sequence assembly quality, and that curated and trapped specimens can be successfully utilized for next-generation sequencing research.

T1  - Assessing the Effects of Habitat Restoration on Shrubland Specialists: Case Study on the New England Cottontail and Shrubland Birds
AN  - 2117273111
AB  - Loss and fragmentation of shrubland habitat in the northeastern United States due to succession, suppression of natural disturbance regimes, and development (Cronon 1983, Litvaitis 1993) have resulted in declines of populations of shrubland specialist species, including the New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) and shrubland birds (Litvaitis et al. 2006, Schlossberg & King 2007). The New England cottontail’s range has declined by over 86% (Litvaitis et al. 2006, Fenderson et al. 2014, Brubaker et al. 2014) and remaining populations are small and exhibit fine-scale structure, limited dispersal, and loss of metapopulation function (Fenderson 2011, 2014, Cheeseman 2017, Chapter 1). In the Northeast, declining species of shrubland birds outnumber increasing species three to one (Schlossberg & King 2007). In response to these losses, active management is ongoing to maintain and create shrubland habitat on the landscape to restore populations of specialists dependent on this habitat type. Given the extensive investments and collaboration focused on restoring shrubland habitats in New England, research is needed to monitor the effects of habitat creation on populations of shrubland specialists. Understanding how shrubland specialists are responding to ongoing habitat creation will inform additional restoration strategies in an adaptive management context, an iterative process of incorporating new information into management practices and learning from previous management outcomes.    Shrubland habitat creation and management in New England is largely focused on restoring habitat for the New England cottontail, with the idea that other species will also benefit. The New England cottontail is a highly threatened shrubland obligate requiring multiple patches of shrubland habitat within a short dispersal distance to support viable metapopulations long-term. Much of this management has been initiated by the New England Cottontail Conservation Initiative in response to the cottontail’s nine-year candidate listing status under the Endangered Species Act, and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Keystone Initiative. Conservation efforts implemented for the New England cottontail have included the development of a range-wide inter-agency conservation strategy, designation of focal habitat restoration areas and habitat acreage and cottontail population recovery goals, engagement with private organizations and landowners to create shrubland habitat, implementation of a range-wide cottontail occupancy monitoring protocol, and public outreach and education (Fuller & Tur 2012). Habitat management underway incorporates techniques to set back forest succession, including harvesting trees, cutting and mowing to promote shrub regrowth, planting to improve old field habitat, and controlled burning on fire-maintained habitats like pitch pine-scrub oak. Landscape-level conservation design has been initiated to identify best parcels in terms of vegetation type and patch size that can be targeted for restoration (Tash & Litvaitis 2007, Fuller et al. 2011).    Knowing how other species respond to widespread habitat management for cottontails is important to understand the full impacts and benefits of currently implemented management and to inform future management strategies. Given the resources invested in restoring shrubland habitat for cottontail populations, and the potential for other shrubland specialist species to benefit from this restoration, designating the New England cottontail a representative species could benefit strategic management for multiple species by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Representative species designations are a tool for strategic management to provide the greatest benefit for the most species with available resources. Research is needed to identify which additional species would benefit most from restoration to create habitat for cottontails. I investigated shrubland specialist birds as a suite of species that could benefit from habitat management for cottontails, given declining population trends for shrubland birds and their high conservation need in the Northeast.    In this thesis, I investigated the effects of habitat restoration on shrubland specialists in three case studies focused on New England cottontails and shrubland birds.    In Chapter 1, I used genetic tools to assess the population structure, genetic diversity, effective population size, and census population size of an isolated New England cottontail population in an urban landscape in Londonderry, New Hampshire. I documented attributes of small populations that pose conservation challenges, including limited dispersal and loss of metapopulation function (Chandler et al. 2015), low genetic diversity, high relatedness (Brook et al. 2002, O’Grady et al. 2006), skewed sex ratios (Tella 2001, Clout et al. 2002), and stochastic decline on isolated patches (Stacey & Taper 1992). I used a resistance surface approach to highlight areas of potential connectivity in the landscape, including powerlines, a shrub wetland, and rail corridor. I parameterized a spatially explicit individual-based simulation model that serves as a proof-of-concept for future work to compare the outcomes of alternate restoration scenarios on cottontail population size, genetic diversity, connectivity, and ability to persist in fragmented landscapes given best-case restoration scenarios.

T1  - Using Population Genetics to Examine White-Tailed Deer (<i> Odocoileus virginianus</i>) Connectivity across Multiple Spatial Scales: Influences of Proximity, Landscape, and History
AN  - 2116223509
AB  - Understanding the degree to which population connectivity is influenced by social structure, movement patterns, and management actions is important for development and evaluation of the impact of wildlife management strategies on wild game populations. I used population genetic tools to examine genetic diversity and spatial genetic structure of an abundant, highly vagile habitat generalist game species, the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus ). I used both microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA sequences to explore the roles of proximity, landscape, and population history on genetic connectivity of deer at local, statewide, and regional spatial scales. At local scales, I evaluated the effects of spatial proximity on levels of connectivity between urban and adjacent rural deer populations. I found high levels of genetic similarity, suggesting that localized management to control densities of urban deer populations may be complicated by recolonization due to movement of deer from rural into urban areas. I examined the effects of differences in population history and management on levels of connectivity to understand potential for disease spread between a captive and adjacent wild deer population. I found high levels genetic similarity that could be attributed to numerous mechanisms, and therefore could not make any definitive inferences regarding the captive facility as a source of infection for wild deer. At a statewide level, I evaluated the influence of landscape factors on deer spatial genetic structure across Iowa, and found weak genetic structure related to landscape factors, indicating that Iowa deer are part of a single continuous population across the state with few limitations on movement and potential for disease spread. At a range-wide scale, I found an impact of historical deer management on broad scale population connectivity of deer across their North American range. Specifically, translocation efforts led to higher levels of diversity and increased genetic similarity between geographically distant deer populations compared to naturally restored populations. My results suggest that, despite their high vagility and habitat generalist nature, social structure, landscape characteristics, and management history all impact genetic structure of white-tailed deer populations at multiple spatial scales.

T1  - Temporally stable and distinct fish assemblages between stream and earthen stormwater drain reaches in an urban watershed
AN  - 1941897260
AB  - Streams and rivers have essential roles in landscape connectivity; however, urban watersheds are frequently modified to drain stormwater from urban areas. To determine whether an earthen stormwater drain in an urban landscape provides fish habitat temporally, we compared the fish assemblage among three reaches of a contiguous urbanized watershed in Kanata, Ontario, Canada. Watts Creek is connected to an earthen municipal surface stormwater drain (herein Kizell Drain), before discharging into the Ottawa River. We delineated transects in three reaches of the system, in Watts, in the Drain, and below their confluence (Main) and assessed the fish community using single-pass electrofishing repeated across eight months covering all seasons. Fish community composition was compared among reaches using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and permutated multivariate analyses of variance (perMANOVA). Sign association tests identified indicator species driving assemblage patterns among reaches. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to assess the influence of physical characteristics of the transects on fish assemblage structure. Finally, fish assemblage measures were separated by month and temporal comparisons of fish assemblage were performed with NMDS and perMANOVA. Over the year, fish assemblages were distinct among the three reaches, and appear to be significantly influenced by temperature, undercut banks, and riparian vegetation type. Biotic homogenization in the Drain can be attributed to degraded physical features associated with channel modification in stormwater drains. Despite management and jurisdictional differences between streams and stormwater drains, evidence that earthen stormwater drains can maintain fish assemblages temporally demonstrates their biological potential and need to be considered as interconnected fish habitat elements within the overall watershed.

T1  - Population genetics, community of parasites, and resistance to rodenticides in an urban brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) population
AN  - 1936800776
AB  - Brown rats are one of the most widespread urban species worldwide. Despite the nuisances they induce and their potential role as a zoonotic reservoir, knowledge on urban rat populations remains scarce. The main purpose of this study was to characterize an urban brown rat population from Chanteraines park (Hauts-de-Seine, France), with regards to haematology, population genetics, immunogenic diversity, resistance to anticoagulant rodenticides, and community of parasites. Haematological parameters were measured. Population genetics was investigated using 13 unlinked microsatellite loci. Immunogenic diversity was assessed for Mhc-Drb. Frequency of the Y139F mutation (conferring resistance to rodenticides) and two linked microsatellites were studied, concurrently with the presence of anticoagulant residues in the liver. Combination of microscopy and molecular methods were used to investigate the occurrence of 25 parasites. Statistical approaches were used to explore multiple parasite relationships and model parasite occurrence. Eighty-six rats were caught. The first haematological data for a wild urban R. norvegicus population was reported. Genetic results suggested high genetic diversity and connectivity between Chanteraines rats and surrounding population(s). We found a high prevalence (55.8%) of the mutation Y139F and presence of rodenticide residues in 47.7% of the sampled individuals. The parasite species richness was high (16). Seven potential zoonotic pathogens were identified, together with a surprisingly high diversity of Leptospira species (4). Chanteraines rat population is not closed, allowing gene flow and making eradication programs challenging, particularly because rodenticide resistance is highly prevalent. Parasitological results showed that co-infection is more a rule than an exception. Furthermore, the presence of several potential zoonotic pathogens, of which four Leptospira species, in this urban rat population raised its role in the maintenance and spread of these pathogens. Our findings should stimulate future discussions about the development of a long-term rat-control management program in Chanteraines urban park.

T1  - Spatial mismatch analysis among hotspots of alien plant species, road and railway networks in Germany and Austria
AN  - 1931247335
AB  - Road and railway networks are pervasive elements of all environments, which have expanded intensively over the last century in all European countries. These transportation infrastructures have major impacts on the surrounding landscape, representing a threat to biodiversity. Roadsides and railways may function as corridors for dispersal of alien species in fragmented landscapes. However, only few studies have explored the spread of invasive species in relationship to transport network at large spatial scales. We performed a spatial mismatch analysis, based on a spatially explicit correlation test, to investigate whether alien plant species hotspots in Germany and Austria correspond to areas of high density of roads and railways. We tested this independently of the effects of dominant environments in each spatial unit, in order to focus just on the correlation between occurrence of alien species and density of linear transportation infrastructures. We found a significant spatial association between alien plant species hotspots distribution and roads and railways density in both countries. As expected, anthropogenic landscapes, such as urban areas, harbored more alien plant species, followed by water bodies. However, our findings suggested that the distribution of neobiota is strongest correlated to road/railways density than to land use composition. This study provides new evidence, from a transnational scale, that alien plants can use roadsides and rail networks as colonization corridors. Furthermore, our approach contributes to the understanding on alien plant species distribution at large spatial scale by the combination with spatial modeling procedures.

T1  - Connectivity of public urban grasslands: implications for grassland conservation and restoration in cities
AN  - 1882887710
AB  - An important limitation of studies on the ecological value of urban habitats is the question of habitat connectivity. While connectivity allows spread and genetic exchange of species, isolation can lead to the extinction of populations through inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity. However, while practitioners already start improving urban habitat patches by means of restoration, issues of connectivity have not been taken in account although being crucial for a self-sustaining habitat network. In our study, we evaluate the connectivity of public urban grasslands such as lawns, grasslands in residential areas, playgrounds or parks in the city of Münster, Germany. Employing a graph theory approach, which uses a map (graph) of habitat patches to calculate functional connectivity measures using patch area size and patch connectivity, we studied four groups of different plant dispersal distances (2 m, 20 m, 44 m and 100 m). This approach can be recommended for planning issues due to the output of different indicator values and comparably low data demands. Our results show for the first time, that connectivity of urban grasslands is extremely low for species of short-distance dispersal but slightly increases for long-distance dispersal. Except two larger conglomerations of well-connected patches, urban grasslands were found to be mostly sparsely connected. Thus, future research should focus on options to improve connectivity and to prioritize patches for ecological improvement. The graph theory approach turned out to be a useful tool to analyse urban habitat connectivity but also to illustrate results obtained.

T1  - Status and Conservation of the Grass Snake in Jersey
AN  - 2164566508
AB  - Global biodiversity losses are being driven by anthropogenic pressures; the most pervasive of which is habitat loss resulting in fragmentation and population isolation. These issues are prevalent throughout Europe due to high intensity agriculture and increasing human population densities. Limitations imposed by resources and the secretive lifestyles of many species hinder the ability of conservationists to undertake status assessments and identify conservation actions. This thesis investigates the threats to an isolated population of grass snakes Natrix helvetica on the island of Jersey, providing recommendations for conservation management and recovery, whilst testing the suitability of tools for monitoring cryptic species. Grass snakes were historically widespread throughout Jersey; however, anthropogenic influences have restricted their distribution to the west and southwest. Furthermore, recent monitoring efforts have detected few individuals and their status is unknown.Intensive surveys to locate individuals combined with occupancy and N-mixture (abundance) models identified continued occupancy of semi-natural sites in the island's west and southwest, but also highlighted poor detectability of the species unless utilising a large survey effort. Therefore, a large amount of effort is required to determine absence of snakes, and declines in the population cannot be detected with reasonable power. Occupancy models were more reliable than N-mixture models, particularly due to the risks of closure violation when estimating abundance. Nonetheless, N-mixture models estimated an abundance of 48 snakes (95% CI: 23?1279) across the study sites. Radio-tracking also provided evidence for low detection rates. Additionally snakes demonstrated small ranges (mean: 2.48 ha ± 3.54 SD), site fidelity, preferences for ranges close to paths and compost heaps, but avoided crossing roads. Snakes were positively associated with structurally complex habitats including rough grassland, dense scrub and gorse at multiple spatial scales, but negatively with open and wooded habitats.Species distribution modelling indicated similar habitat preferences to radio-tracking and poor suitability of agricultural habitats. Areas close to amphibian prey populations were also suitable whereas those with high road densities were not. A fifth of Jersey contained priority conservation areas, however almost 90% of these areas do not receive statutory protection. Those in the west and southwest should be prioritised for protection due to their proximity to extant subpopulations. Mitochondrial genes identified the population to belong to a western lineage of grass snakes Natrix helvetica helvetica, with a probable natural colonisation prior to separation from northwest France. Within Jersey, microsatellite markers identified three subpopulations, with significant differentiation between snakes in the south and west. This coincides with a dense urban area, through which connectivity needs improvement.The Jersey grass snake population can be classified as regionally Vulnerable (D2) under IUCN guidelines. The study illustrates how nature reserves are important for maintaining isolated subpopulations and the potential avenues by which statutory protection, sympathetic management practices and efforts to improve inter-reserve connectivity can contribute to conservation objectives.

T1  - Dispersal Effects on Species Distribution and Diversity across Multiple Scales in the Southern Appalachian Mixed Mesophytic Flora
AN  - 2006934348
AB  - Seed and spore dispersal play important roles in the spatial distribution of plant species and communities. Though dispersal processes are often thought to be more important at larger spatial scales, the distribution patterns of species and plant communities even at small scales can be determined, at least in part, by dispersal. I studied the influence of dispersal in southern Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests by categorizing species by dispersal morphology and by using spatial pattern and habitat connectivity as predictors of species distribution and community composition. All vascular plant species were recorded at three nested sample scales (10000, 1000, and 100 m2), on plots with varying levels of habitat connectivity across the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Models predicting species distributions generally had higher predictive power when incorporating spatial pattern and connectivity, particularly at small scales. Despite wide variation in performance, models of locally dispersing species (species without adaptations to dispersal by wind or vertebrates) were most frequently improved by the addition of spatial predictors. Patterns in plant communities were also compared among dispersal categories, and though it was shown that species without dispersal adaptations were less likely to co-occur, this was more likely to be caused by differences in frequency across dispersal categories than by dispersal limitation per se. Spatial pattern, distance, and connectivity were significant predictors of non-random patterns of species turnover at all scales and were stronger among dispersal-limited species groups. Species with limited dispersal were also less frequent at all three sampling scales than those with adaptations for vertebrate dispersal and had smaller geographic ranges than either wind- or vertebrate-dispersed species. Species with no dispersal adaptations were overrepresented among southern Appalachian endemics and lineages endemic to North America, whereas species dispersed by vertebrates were overrepresented among Tertiary disjunct lineages, and species dispersed by spores were cosmopolitan. Relationships among dispersal and biogeographic affinity reflect the evolutionary history of the mixed mesophytic flora owing to adaptation of dispersal mechanisms to regional environmental conditions, the relative ages of lineages, and the effect of dispersal mechanism on the distributions of plants across time and space.

T1  - The Effects of Urbanization on Riparian Forest Plant Communities in the Research Triangle Area of North Carolina
AN  - 1951780112
AB  - Ongoing urban development is having profound impacts on ecosystems worldwide, by reducing the amount and connectivity of natural habitat and changing the local environmental conditions. Despite the ubiquity and the continued growth of urban areas, the effects of urban development on the diversity and composition of plant communities remain poorly understood. In this dissertation, I address this issue by investigating the effects of urban development on patches of remnant riparian forest in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina. To do this, I used a rural-to-urban gradient approach, comparing the plant species and environmental conditions of sites surrounded by different amounts of urban development. I first explored the effects of different “filters” created by urban development on plant biodiversity using structural equation modeling. In this, I tested the predictions of an established conceptual framework and developed a general model that could be used to compare the effects of urbanization on plant biodiversity across cities. I then examined changes in plant species’ functional traits along the rural-to-urban gradient and compared the species and traits found at these sites to high-quality riparian plant communities that represent potential targets for restoration. I found that plant traits change somewhat predictably along an urbanization gradient, particularly with regard to species’ seed dispersal modes, but that traits may not be as useful for predicting which species will establish in urban restoration efforts. Finally, I assessed the ability of environmental variables and spatial variables describing habitat connectivity to explain variation in plant species composition across sites. I found that species with limited dispersal ability showed the strongest signal of dispersal limitation across sites, and that urban development between sites appears to reduce connectivity for these species. This dissertation provides insight into the ways that urban development is altering riparian forests in the Research Triangle, which may have important impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. My results have implications for land management, restoration, and urban planning in this landscape.

T1  - The Influence of Land Use and Habitat Fragmentation on Landscape Connectivity
AN  - 1925000206
AB  - The built environment, especially roads, urban and suburban development, can reduce the ability for wildlife to move across landscapes. Maintaining landscape connectivity has become a central theme in ecology and conservation, as corridors of intact habitat help maintain ecosystem functionality and, in the face of climate change, may provide migration paths for species. However, the influence of the built environment on connectivity is rarely quantified using empirical data informed by species detection, movement, or genetic structure. Rather, structural connectivity, as opposed to functional connectivity, is estimated using land cover alone. Structural connectivity estimates offer a simple and potentially powerful approach with fewer data requirements for wildlife corridor planning; however, models of structural connectivity are rarely if ever evaluated with empirical species data, limiting our understanding of their reliability and utility. This dissertation fills this gap by investigating the influence of human land use and habitat fragmentation on landscape connectivity using a suite of quantitative modeling approaches and mammals as the focal species, including cross comparisons among these approaches. Specifically, three methods that vary in levels of biological information are used to evaluate how well structural connectivity models perform for individual species, as well as their relationship to functional connectivity.   To begin with, the utility of a structural connectivity model based on the distribution and intensity of land use is evaluated by comparing model predictions to observed land use by a generalist carnivore, the puma (Puma concolor). Findings from this study indicate that generic landscape permeability models can be used with confidence as a guide when prioritizing habitat corridors for biodiversity conservation across fragmented landscapes. Next, the utility of structural connectivity models is further evaluated by examining how the inclusion of specific human land use variables affects model accuracy in a species distribution model for gray fox ( Urocyon cinereoargenteus). Findings from this study indicate that species distribution models generated in human-dominated landscapes have higher accuracy when informed by indices of land use. Finally, a combination of spatial and genetic methods is used to evaluate the influence of roads on the functional connectivity for a small mammal, California ground squirrels (Otospermophilus beecheyi). Findings from this study indicate that a combined spatial and genetic approach can be used to identify locations where roads act as barriers.    Given the importance of habitat fragmentation, there is a pressing need to rapidly develop and utilize connectivity assessment methods in conservation planning. Research findings presented here have already impacted mammal conservation planning and management in California in the following specific ways. The structural connectivity model was used to identify priority habitat linkages for inclusion in the Conservation Blueprint for Santa Cruz County, and the combined genetic and spatial approach was used by the Santa Clara County Open Space Authority, CA to identify corridors and restore connectivity in an area with an existing road network. Beyond these regional impacts, future conservation planning worldwide can benefit from using readily available data collected by citizen scientists as input in predictive mapping to increase the sample size and spatial coverage for species distribution modeling.

T1  - Lichen Conservation in Eastern North America: Population Genomics, Climate Change, and Translocations
AN  - 1898765123
AB  - Conservation biology is a scientific discipline that draws on methods from diverse fields to address specific conservation concerns and inform conservation actions. This field is overwhelmingly focused on charismatic animals and vascular plants, often ignoring other diverse and ecologically important groups. This trend is slowly changing in some ways; for example, increasing number of fungal species are being added to the IUCN Red-List. However, a strong taxonomic bias still exists. Here I contribute four research chapters to further the conservation of lichens, one group of frequently overlooked organisms. I address specific conservation concerns in eastern North America using modern methods. The results of these studies provide insight into lichen conservation in each situation, implications for the broader ecosystems within the study regions, and advancement of methods for the study of lichen conservation and biology.   The first research chapter (Chapter 2) is a population genomics study based on whole genome shotgun sequencing of Cetradonia linearis, an endangered, lichenized fungus. These data were used to 1) assemble and annotate a reference genome, 2) characterize the mating system, 3) test for isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by environment (IBE), and 4) investigate the biogeographic history of the species. Approximately 70% of the genome (19.5 Mb) was assembled. Using this assembly, only a single mating type was located, suggesting the species could be unisexual. There was strong evidence for both low rates of recombination and for Isolation by Distance, but no evidence for Isolation by Environment. The hypothesis that C. linearis  had a larger range during the last glacial maximum, especially in the southern portion of its current extent, was supported by Hindcast species distribution models and the spatial distribution of genetic diversity. Given the findings here, it is recommended that C. linearis remain protected by the U.S. Endangered Species Act and listed as Vulnerable on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red-List.   The third chapter is an estimation of the impacts of climate change on high-elevation, endemic lichens in the southern Appalachians, a global diversity hotspot for many groups, including lichens. Extensive field surveys in the high elevations of the region were carried out to accurately document the current distributions of eight narrowly endemic species. These data were compared with herbarium records, and species distribution modeling was used to predict how much climatically suitable area will remain within, and north of, the current range of the target species at multiple time points and climate change scenarios. Fieldwork showed that target species ranged from extremely rare to locally abundant and models predicted average losses of suitable area within the current distribution of species ranging from 93.8 to 99.7%. The results indicate that climate change poses a significant threat to high-elevation lichens, and illustrates the application of current modeling techniques for rare, montane species.   In the fourth chapter, a dataset of >13,000 occurrence records for lichens in the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain (MACP) of eastern North America was used to model distributions of 193 species. The resulting models were used to quantify the amount of each species’ distribution that is occupied by unsuitable land use types, along with the potential area that will be lost to sea-level rise (SLR). These analyses showed that species have likely already lost an average of 32% of their distributional area to development and agriculture, and are predicted to lose an average of 12.4 and 33.7% of their distributional area with one foot (∼0.3 m) and six feet (∼1.8 m) of SLR, respectively. Functional and taxonomic groups were compared to identify specific effects of SLR. Species reproducing with symbiotic propagules were found to have significantly larger distributions than species that reproduce sexually with fungal spores alone, and the sexually reproducing species were predicted to lose greater distributional area to SLR. Cladonia species occupy significantly less area in the MACP than Parmotrema species and were predicted to lose more of their distributions to SLR. Patterns of total species diversity showed that the area with the highest diversity is the Dare Peninsula in North Carolina, which was also predicted to lose the most land area to SLR. The workflow established here is flexible and applicable to estimating SLR impacts worldwide and can provide essential insights for local conservation planning.    The fifth chapter describes the results of three experiments conducted to test new and established methods for lichen transplantation. First, small fragments of Graphis sterlingiana, Hypotrachyna virginica , and Lepraria lanata were placed on medical gauze attached to each of the species’ most common substrate to test the feasibility of transplanting narrowly endemic species. Second, burlap, cheesecloth, medical gauze, and a plastic air filter were directly compared for their use as artificial transplant substrates with Lepraria finkii as the test lichen. Third, transplants of Usnea angulata were established to test its amenability to transplantation via hanging fragments on monofilament. The first two experiments were established on Roan Mountain, North Carolina and the third experiment at Highlands Biological Station, North Carolina. In the first two experiments medical gauze did not withstand local weather conditions and nearly all pieces fell from the trees within 6 months. The plastic air filter and burlap performed best as artificial substrates for transplants, with a 100% and 80% success rate, respectively. Cheesecloth remained attached to the trees, but only 20% of lichen fragments remained attached to the substrate after one year. In the third experiment U. angulata  grew 3.5 ± 1.4 cm in 5 months, exceeding previously reported growth rates for this species. These results advance methods for conservation-focused lichen transplants, and expand established methods to a new region and new species.

T1  - Green Roofs and Urban Biodiversity: Their Role as Invertebrate Habitat and the Effect of Design on Beetle Community
AN  - 1811448434
AB  - With over half the world’s population now living in cities, urban areas represent one of earth’s few ecosystems that are increasing in extent, and are sites of altered biogeochemical cycles, habitat fragmentation, and changes in biodiversity. However, urban green spaces, including green roofs, can also provide important pools of biodiversity and contribute to regional gamma diversity, while novel species assemblages can enhance some ecosystem services. Green roofs may also mitigate species loss in urban areas and have been shown to support a surprising diversity of invertebrates, including rare and endangered species. In the first part of this study I reviewed the literature on urban invertebrate communities and diversity to better understand the role of green roofs in providing habitat in the context of the larger urban mosaic. My review concluded that, while other factors such as surrounding land use and connectivity are also important to specific invertebrate taxa, local habitat variables contribute substantially to the structure and diversity of urban invertebrate communities. The importance of local habitat variables in urban green spaces and strong support for the habitat complexity hypothesis in a number of other ecosystems has led to proposals that “biodiverse” roofs—those intentionally designed with varied substrate depth, greater plant diversity, or added elements such as logs or stones—would support greater invertebrate diversity, but there is currently limited peer reviewed data to support this. In order to address the habitat complexity hypothesis in the context of green roofs, in the second part of this study I surveyed three roofs designed primarily for stormwater management, three biodiverse roofs, and five ground-level green spaces, from March until September of 2014 in the Portland metropolitan area. Beetles (Coleoptera) were sampled bi-weekly as representatives of total species diversity. Biodiverse roofs had greater richness, abundance, and diversity of beetle species compared to stormwater roofs, but were not more diverse than ground sites. Both biodiverse roofs and ground sites had approximately 20% native beetle species while stormwater roofs had only 5%. Functional diversity was also higher on biodiverse roofs with an average of seven trophic groups represented, while stormwater roofs averaged only three. Ground sites, biodiverse roofs, and stormwater roofs each grouped distinctively in terms of beetle community composition and biodiverse roof communities were found to be positively correlated with roof age, percent plant cover, average plant height, and plant species richness. These results support the findings of previous studies on the importance of local variables in structuring urban invertebrate communities and suggest that biodiverse design can reliably increase greenroof diversity, with the caution that they remain no replacement for ground level conservation.

T1  - Data to Decision in a Dynamic Ocean: Robust Species Distribution Models and Spatial Decision Frameworks
AN  - 1793408459
AB  - In this dissertation, I build robust species distribution models in two case study areas, US Atlantic (Best et al. 2012) and British Columbia (Best et al. 2015), predicting presence and abundance respectively, from scientific surveys. These models are then applied to novel decision frameworks for preemptively suggesting optimal placement of human activities in space and time to minimize ecological impacts: siting for offshore wind energy development, and routing ships to minimize risk of striking whales. Both decision frameworks relate the tradeoff between conservation risk and industry profit with synchronized variable and map views as online spatial decision support systems.   For siting offshore wind energy development (OWED) in the U.S. Atlantic (chapter 4), bird density maps are combined across species with weights of OWED sensitivity to collision and displacement and 10 km2 sites are compared against OWED profitability based on average annual wind speed at 90m hub heights and distance to transmission grid. A spatial decision support system enables toggling between the map and tradeoff plot views by site. A selected site can be inspected for sensitivity to a cetaceans throughout the year, so as to capture months of the year which minimize episodic impacts of pre-operational activities such as seismic airgun surveying and pile driving.    Routing ships to avoid whale strikes (chapter 5) can be similarly viewed as a tradeoff, but is a different problem spatially. A cumulative cost surface is generated from density surface maps and conservation status of cetaceans, before applying as a resistance surface to calculate least-cost routes between start and end locations, i.e. ports and entrance locations to study areas. Varying a multiplier to the cost surface enables calculation of multiple routes with different costs to conservation of cetaceans versus cost to transportation industry, measured as distance. Similar to the siting chapter, a spatial decisions support system enables toggling between the map and tradeoff plot view of proposed routes. The user can also input arbitrary start and end locations to calculate the tradeoff on the fly.   Essential to the input of these decision frameworks are distributions of the species. The two preceding chapters comprise species distribution models from two case study areas, U.S. Atlantic (chapter 2) and British Columbia (chapter 3), predicting presence and density, respectively. Although density is preferred to estimate potential biological removal, per Marine Mammal Protection Act requirements in the U.S., all the necessary parameters, especially distance and angle of observation, are less readily available across publicly mined datasets.   In the case of predicting cetacean presence in the U.S. Atlantic (chapter 2), I extracted datasets from the online OBIS-SEAMAP geo-database, and integrated scientific surveys conducted by ship (n=36) and aircraft (n=16), weighting a Generalized Additive Model by minutes surveyed within space-time grid cells to harmonize effort between the two survey platforms. For each of 16 cetacean species guilds, I predicted the probability of occurrence from static environmental variables and time-varying conditions. To generate maps of presence vs. absence, Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves were used to define the optimal threshold that minimizes false positive and false negative error rates. I integrated model outputs, including tables and plots, into an online spatial decision support system, allowing for easy navigation of models by taxon, region, season, and data provider.   For predicting cetacean density within the inner waters of British Columbia (chapter 3), I calculated density from systematic, line-transect marine mammal surveys over multiple years and seasons (summer 2004, 2005, 2008, and spring/autumn 2007) conducted by Raincoast Conservation Foundation. Abundance estimates were calculated using two different methods: Conventional Distance Sampling (CDS) and Density Surface Modelling (DSM). CDS generates a single density estimate for each stratum, whereas DSM explicitly models spatial variation and offers potential for greater precision by incorporating environmental predictors. Although DSM yields a more relevant product for the purposes of marine spatial planning, CDS has proven to be useful in cases where there are fewer observations available for seasonal and inter-annual comparison, particularly for the scarcely observed elephant seal. Abundance estimates are provided on a stratum-specific basis. Steller sea lions and harbour seals are further differentiated by ‘hauled out’ and ‘in water’. This information offers the opportunity to assess the risks posed to marine mammals by existing and emerging threats.   Starting with marine animal observations at specific coordinates and times, I combine these data with environmental data, often satellite derived, to produce seascape predictions generalizable in space and time. These habitat-based models enable prediction of encounter rates and, in the case of density surface models, abundance that can then be applied to management scenarios. Specific human activities, OWED and shipping, are then compared within a tradeoff decision support framework, enabling interchangeable map and tradeoff plot views. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

T1  - Ecology of coyotes (<i>Canis latrans</i>) in the greater Detroit area of southeastern Michigan
AN  - 1790625849
AB  - Coyote distribution and habitat use, diet and foraging behavior, and space use patterns were investigated in the greater Detroit area of southeastern Michigan. We found evidence of coyotes on 24 of 30 (80%) suburban and 7 of 11 (64%) urban plots. Overall fifty-eight percent of coyote evidence was found within edge habitats, with den sites and tracks the only types of evidence found strictly in interior habitats. Land cover around evidence points included more wooded land cover than expected in suburban areas, suggesting the importance of tree cover for coyote occupancy, and more open space and wooded land cover than expected in urban areas, highlighting their avoidance of heavily populated areas. Coyote diet was assessed through identification of remains of food items recovered in coyote scat. White-tailed deer, eastern cottontail rabbit, and small rodents were the most consumed prey in both urban and suburban areas. Coyote consumption of white-tailed deer biomass was 7.2% greater than expected in suburban areas and 10.0% less than expected in urban areas and the difference was significant (P < 0.004). More white-tailed deer, raccoon, and woodchuck biomass was consumed compared to other studies, likely due to high use of road-kill. In suburban areas, coyote selection for road-killed white-tailed deer was positive regardless of white-tailed deer or rabbit abundance. Coyotes in urban areas used a foraging strategy that incorporated both prey selection and switching, with no strong discernable pattern. Radio-telemetry technology was used to gather relocations of coyotes for analysis of home range and cores areas frequented by coyotes. Smaller home ranges were made up of greater proportions of urban land than natural land cover, although there was variation. Core areas were dominated by relatively large patches of natural land cover and had greater connectivity compared to home range areas. Radio-telemetry data suggested that coyotes were selective in their use of space, avoiding urban land in favor of natural land cover.

T1  - Urban Power Line Corridors as Novel Habitats for Grassland and Alien Plant Species in South-Western Finland
AN  - 1732948152
AB  - Regularly managed electric power line corridors may provide habitats for both early-successional grassland plant species and disturbance-dependent alien plant species. These habitats are especially important in urban areas, where they can help conserve native grassland species and communities in urban greenspace. However, they can also provide further footholds for potentially invasive alien species that already characterize urban areas. In order to implement power line corridors into urban conservation, it is important to understand which environmental conditions in the corridors favor grassland species and which alien species. Likewise it is important to know whether similar environmental factors in the corridors control the species composition of the two groups. We conducted a vegetation study in a 43 kilometer long urban power line corridor network in south-western Finland, and used generalized linear models and distance-based redundancy analysis to determine which environmental factors best predict the occurrence and composition of grassland and alien plant species in the corridors. The results imply that old corridors on dry soils and steep slopes characterized by a history as open areas and pastures are especially suitable for grassland species. Corridors suitable for alien species, in turn, are characterized by productive soils and abundant light and are surrounded by a dense urban fabric. Factors controlling species composition in the two groups are somewhat correlated, with the most important factors including light abundance, soil moisture, soil calcium concentration and soil productivity. The results have implications for grassland conservation and invasive alien species control in urban areas.

T1  - Genetic diversity of a tropical rainforest understory bird in an urban fragmented landscape
AN  - 1729371809; 2015-43463-012
AB  - Analyzing the genetic diversity of a population can be useful in identifying some of the silent effects of habitat fragmentation. We examined and compared 4 mitochondrial loci of the near threatened Short-tailed Babbler (
Pellorneum 
malaccense), a rainforest understory bird, between a highly fragmented population in Singapore and populations from elsewhere in the Sundaic region. We found that the fragmented Singaporean population is genetically impoverished, with < 20% of the intrapopulation genetic diversity present in a comparable sample from Borneo within intact forest. Differences in haplotype diversity among Singaporean sites of occurrence suggest that there may be extremely poor genetic diversity and connectivity among Singaporean subpopulations. These findings highlight the importance of connectivity in maintaining population genetic diversity in urban tropical forest patches. Our results also corroborate previous findings that there are 3 deeply diverged lineages of Short-tailed Babbler across the Sundaic region.

T1  - Poor ecological quality of urban ponds in northern England: causes and consequences
AN  - 1680398035
AB  - The value of ponds in urban areas historically has been overlooked. While some recent studies have described considerable biodiversity in urban areas, it is unclear as to how far this extends to different urban habitats. The aims of this study were to determine the condition of 21 urban ponds in Bradford (northern England) and to quantify the connectivity of wetlands in the district. The study showed that macroinvertebrate and plant biodiversity was substantially lower than would be expected based on pristine reference sites. Of the 21 ponds surveyed, 15 were found to be classified as having very poor ecological quality, with 5 being classed as poor and just 1 was classed as moderate. The number of aquatic plant species found in the ponds ranged from 0 to 6 and the number of macroinvertebrate families found ranged from 4 to 13. It was suspected that the aquatic plant diversity was low due to management techniques such as the removal of emergent vegetation. The average distance to a wetland was found to be higher in urban areas (533 m) compared to rural areas (448 m) although this difference was small, which indicates that the low diversity found in urban ponds is likely due to habitat variables.

T1  - Asian Elephants in China: Estimating Population Size and Evaluating Habitat Suitability
AN  - 1681913945
AB  - We monitored the last remaining Asian elephant populations in China over the past decade. Using DNA tools and repeat genotyping, we estimated the population sizes from 654 dung samples collected from various areas. Combined with morphological individual identifications from over 6,300 elephant photographs taken in the wild, we estimated that the total Asian elephant population size in China is between 221 and 245. Population genetic structure and diversity were examined using a 556-bp fragment of mitochondrial DNA, and 24 unique haplotypes were detected from DNA analysis of 178 individuals. A phylogenetic analysis revealed two highly divergent clades of Asian elephants, α and β, present in Chinese populations. Four populations (Mengla, Shangyong, Mengyang, and Pu’Er) carried mtDNA from the α clade, and only one population (Nangunhe) carried mtDNA belonging to the β clade. Moreover, high genetic divergence was observed between the Nangunhe population and the other four populations; however, genetic diversity among the five populations was low, possibly due to limited gene flow because of habitat fragmentation. The expansion of rubber plantations, crop cultivation, and villages along rivers and roads had caused extensive degradation of natural forest in these areas. This had resulted in the loss and fragmentation of elephant habitats and had formed artificial barriers that inhibited elephant migration. Using Geographic Information System, Global Positioning System, and Remote Sensing technology, we found that the area occupied by rubber plantations, tea farms, and urban settlements had dramatically increased over the past 40 years, resulting in the loss and fragmentation of elephant habitats and forming artificial barriers that inhibit elephant migration. The restoration of ecological corridors to facilitate gene exchange among isolated elephant populations and the establishment of cross-boundary protected areas between China and Laos to secure their natural habitats are critical for the survival of Asian elephants in this region.

T1  - Nest Suitability, Fine-Scale Population Structure and Male-Mediated Dispersal of a Solitary Ground Nesting Bee in an Urban Landscape
AN  - 1679402330
AB  - Bees are the primary pollinators of flowering plants in almost all ecosystems. Worldwide declines in bee populations have raised awareness about the importance of their ecological role in maintaining ecosystem functioning. The naturally strong philopatric behavior that some bee species show can be detrimental to population viability through increased probability of inbreeding. Furthermore, bee populations found in human-altered landscapes, such as urban areas, can experience lower levels of gene flow and effective population sizes, increasing potential for inbreeding depression in wild bee populations. In this study, we investigated the fine-scale population structure of the solitary bee Colletes inaequalis in an urbanized landscape. First, we developed a predictive spatial model to detect suitable nesting habitat for this ground nesting bee and to inform our field search for nests. We genotyped 18 microsatellites in 548 female individuals collected from nest aggregations throughout the study area. Genetic relatedness estimates revealed that genetic similarity among individuals was slightly greater within nest aggregations than among randomly chosen individuals. However, genetic structure among nest aggregations was low (Nei’s GST = 0.011). Reconstruction of parental genotypes revealed greater genetic relatedness among females than among males within nest aggregations, suggesting male-mediated dispersal as a potentially important mechanism of population connectivity and inbreeding avoidance. Size of nesting patch was positively correlated with effective population size, but not with other estimators of genetic diversity. We detected a positive trend between geographic distance and genetic differentiation between nest aggregations. Our landscape genetic models suggest that increased urbanization is likely associated with higher levels of inbreeding. Overall, these findings emphasize the importance of density and distribution of suitable nesting patches for enhancing bee population abundance and connectivity in human dominated habitats and highlights the critical contribution of landscape genetic studies for enhanced conservation and management of native pollinators.

T1  - Effect of Landscape Pattern on Insect Species Density within Urban Green Spaces in Beijing, China
AN  - 1664930475
AB  - Urban green space is an important refuge of biodiversity in urban areas. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the relationship between the landscape pattern of green spaces and biodiversity to mitigate the negative effects of urbanization. In this study, we collected insects from 45 green patches in Beijing during July 2012 using suction sampling. The green patches were dominated by managed lawns, mixed with scattered trees and shrubs. We examined the effects of landscape pattern on insect species density using hierarchical partitioning analysis and partial least squares regression. The results of the hierarchical partitioning analysis indicated that five explanatory variables, i.e., patch area (with 19.9% independent effects), connectivity (13.9%), distance to nearest patch (13.8%), diversity for patch types (11.0%), and patch shape (8.3%), significantly contributed to insect species density. With the partial least squares regression model, we found species density was negatively related to patch area, shape, connectivity, diversity for patch types and proportion of impervious surface at the significance level of p < 0.05 and positively related to proportion of vegetated land. Regression tree analysis further showed that the highest species density was found in green patches with an area <500 m2. Our results indicated that improvement in habitat quality, such as patch area and connectivity that are typically thought to be important for conservation, did not actually increase species density. However, increasing compactness (low-edge) of patch shape and landscape composition did have the expected effect. Therefore, it is recommended that the composition of the surrounding landscape should be considered simultaneously with planned improvements in local habitat quality.

T1  - The Relationship Between Species Diversity and Genetic Diversity in a Fragmented Forest System: A Case Study of <em>Carex leptonervia</em> in the Montérégie, Québec
AN  - 2508515451
AB  - The fragmentation of native temperate forests is a defining issue of rural and urban development in southern Québec. From a forest plant perspective, as natural forest habitat is reduced and subdivided into smaller, more isolated patches, environmental conditions are altered, population size is decreased, and species dispersal may be interrupted. Thus, fragmentation may cause reduced species and genetic diversity in plant systems. Traditionally, ecological and population genetic studies have assessed the impacts of fragmentation on the two measures of diversity separately. In this thesis, we consider both fundamental aspects of biodiversity in a fragmented system. We chose to compare the genetic diversity (GD) of Carex letponervia with species diversity (SD) at two levels: study site and community level. Study site SD measurements approximate the diversity of all plant species growing in a forest, and community SD measurements describe the diversity of plant species growing with C. leptonervia. In chapter 2 of this thesis we describe the development of seven simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers we developed for C. leptonervia. In chapter 3 we describe our overall goal of relating landscape structure, genetic diversity, and species diversity. We hypothesize that site area, connectivity, and environment will similarly impact SD of C. leptonervia communities and GD of C. leptonervia and that SD and GD are positively correlated.
To address this, we assessed overall plant species richness in 20 forest patches ranging from six to over 2000 hectares. Within each forest, we also measured species diversity of the plant community associated with C. leptonervia by centering seven 4 m² quadrats on focal C. leptonervia plants. Thirty individuals of C. leptonervia, including one from each of the focal quadrats, were sampled at each site to assess genetic diversity. Genetic diversity was characterized using six of the SSR loci that we developed in chapter 2. We found that species richness (SR) at the forest patch level shows a strong positive trend with patch area, but not with connectivity among patches. We found that at the point-community level, high SR related to high values of SR at the overall site and that Shannon diversity was positively correlated to community extent. We found no evidence that soil characteristics (pH and percent organic matter) impact values of point-community diversity. To assess patterns in genetic diversity, we ran tests of isolation-by-distance, Nei's GST, and a Bayesian clustering analysis. These results all show that C. leptonervia has low population structure and that there is gene flow throughout the Montérégie. To test for a species diversity-genetic diversity correlation (SGDC), we conducted Pearson correlation tests between all GD measures and SD measures (site and point-communities). We found that gene diversity exhibited a positive significant correlation to species richness at the site level but was not significantly correlated to the diversity of C. leptonervia point-communities. These results indicate that processes important at the level of site are also important in maintaining GD. We conclude that for an ecologically flexible and well-dispersed species, it is likely that the point-community diversity as estimated by quadrat sampling underestimates the actual diversity of species co-existing with C. leptonervia, and that the diversity of site may provide a more accurate approximation. We conclude that the parallel process driving the correlation is likely study site area. Surprisingly, we found that landscape connectivity was not an important determinant of SD or GD. In conclusion, we propose that linking population genetics and community ecology can further an understanding of natural systems and also that isolated forests are important in maintaining diversity in the Montérégie.Alternate abstract:Les milieux forestiers tempérés du sud du Québec sont de plus en plus fragmentés  et isolés les uns des autres. Les conditions environnementales sont grandement altérées, la taille des populations est réduite et la migration et dispersion des espèces sont perturbées et même parfois interrompues. La fragmentation des forêts réduit donc la diversité des espèces et la diversité génétique. Cette thèse combine ces deux aspects fondamentaux de la biodiversité puisque les études antérieures les ont analysés séparément. L'espèce focale utilisée pour étudier la diversité génétique fût Carex leptonervia et ce, sur deux échelles : à l'échelle des lots boisés isolés ainsi qu'à l'échelle des communautés immédiates de nos plantes focales.
Le chapitre 2 explique les sept marqueurs de séquences répétées (SSR) développés pour Carex leptonervia. Ils proviennent d'un ensemble de loci identifiés du génome de Carex lupulina, de séquences SSR développées pour Carex scoparia et de séquences développées dans notre laboratoire pour Carex limosa. Nous avons observé que 15% des loci utilisés pour les analyses de populations pour HWE étaient instables. De plus, nous avons identifié deux loci liés de façon significative à travers toutes les populations.
Le chapitre 3 définit nos objectifs généraux quant à la compréhension des facteurs qui lient la structure du paysage, la diversité génétique, la diversité des espèces et énonce les questions qui suivent. Selon les perspectives de génétique des populations et de macroécologie, les processus sont-ils similaires en comparant les modèles récurrents de diversité dans une région donnée? Quelles sont les relations entre la diversité génétique et la diversité des espèces dans ce système? Pour adresser ces questions, nous avons recensés le nombre d'espèces végétales dans 20 milieux forestiers de dimensions variant entre six et deux milles hectares. Dans chaque lot boisé, nous avons recensé la diversité de la communauté directement associée au Carex leptonervia  en définissant un quadrat de 4 mètres carrés autour des plants. Trente individus, dont sept plantes focales, furent échantillonnés à chaque site afin de quantifier la diversité génétique de chaque site. Celle-ci  fut caractérisée en utilisant six loci SSR développés au chapitre 2.
Nos résultats révèlent que la richesse des espèces d'un lot est liée de façon significative à sa dimension et non pas à sa connectivité avec les sites boisés avoisinant. Dans les communautés immédiates des plantes focales, la richesse des espèces (SR) est proportionnelle à celle des lots. L'indice de diversité Shannon (SHAN) est quant à lui relié au niveau de dispersement des C. leptonervia à travers leur site.
Les caractéristiques du sol telles que le pH et le pourcentage de matière organique n'ont pas influencés de manière significative la diversité des communautés immédiates. Nous avons procédé aux tests suivant pour déterminer la redondance de la diversité génétique : isolation-by-distance, Nei's GST et Bayesian clustering analysis. Le Carex leptonervia est vastement dispersé à travers la Montérégie et ne semble pas avoir de structure de population bien définie.
Nous avons effectué un test de corrélation Pearson avec chaque variables de diversité (HE, HO et AR pour la diversité génétique; SR Site, SR Quadrat et SHAN quadrat pour la diversité des espèces) pour trouver la corrélation entre la diversité génétique et la diversité des espèces. La diversité génétique (HE) est positivement reliée à la diversité des espèces (SR) au niveau des sites mais non au niveau des communautés immédiates des plantes focales. Ces résultats indiquent que les processus majeurs à l'échelle des sites sont aussi importants au maintien de la diversité génétique.
Considérant que le C. leptonervia est une espèce écologiquement flexible et bien répandue à travers le territoire, nous concluons que l'échelle du site est plus représentative que l'échelle des communautés directement associées aux plants pour analyser la diversité des espèces d'une communauté donnée. Selon nos analyses, cette corrélation est principalement influencée par la superficie du site. En conclusion, nous proposons de combiner la génétique des populations et l'écologie des communautés afin d'améliorer notre compréhension des systèmes naturels et des forêts isolées afin de préserver la diversité montérégienne.

T1  - The impact of riparian habitat quality on the activity of british bats in lowland river systems, and its relevance to conservation management
AN  - 1827870110
AB  - Rivers and their associated floodplains are natural wildlife corridors used by a wide range of animal species. Most British rivers in both rural and urban areas have been significantly affected as a result of drainage, flood defence structures, urban development and direct habitat loss. This has, in some cases, fragmented the river corridor and affected the structure and function of the riparian zone. As landscape-scale conservation schemes aim to restore the ecology of rivers, I consider what affect the quality of the riparian zone (an area where the river channel, bank and flood plain interact) has on the foraging and activity of important riparian users, British bats, and assess their relevance as bioindicators of ecosystem health. A matched pairs design was used to test the effect of 'undisturbed' (high quality) and 'disturbed' (lower quality) riparian zones based on riparian width, habitat complexity, connectivity, and surrounding land use, on bat activity. In general, wider and more complex riparian zones did not show sign ificantly more bat activity overall, though exhibited significantly greater foraging activity expressed by the number of feeding buzzes recorded. However, species-specific responses showed that Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Myotis spp. (probably mainly Myotis daubentonil) were influenced by the quality of the riparian zone more so than known habitat generalists, such as P. pipistrellus. Small differences in the complexity and width of the riparian zone positively affected the foraging and activity of P. pygmaeus, whereas the presence of wider stands of wet woodland positively affected the foraging and activity of Myotis spp. Broader landscape features and the availability of insect prey also affected the activity of two sympatric species, P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus. Both species were positively associated with the presence of urban habitat within a 2 km radius of survey sites and aquatic invertebrates, and showed niche differences related to known dietary preferences. The association with invertebrate abundance may make Pipistrellus bats potential bioindicators of riverine health. Pipistrellus bats select riverine habitats that are associated with urban areas, which may indicate a dependency on rivers in urbanised areas. The composition of the riparian zone and floodplain habitat affects the foraging and activity of riparian specialist British bats and should be considered when designing landscape-scale conservation schemes that include British rivers.

T1  - Small mammal communities and functional connectivity in the Lower Rio Grande Valley: A landscape perspective
AN  - 1821391432
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are major threats to global biodiversity, negatively affecting all major taxonomic groups. To mitigate these effects, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages three refuges in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of southern Texas with 1 goal of serving as a wildlife corridor connecting the Gulf coast with Falcon Reservoir. Since its creation in 1979, the LRGV National Wildlife Refuge (LRGVNWR) has grown to include 146 individual tracts, totaling about 44,500 ha primarily along the Rio Grande. The refuge offers the ability to conduct research in an increasingly common landscape pattern, a mosaic composed of native/restored habitat fragmented by agricultural and urbanized land use.    My study first examined how aspects of the habitat and landscape influenced small mammal diversity in LRGV refuge tracts. I live-trapped small mammals in 14 refuge tracts and calculated standard diversity indices from the resulting captures. Of 5,115 total captures, 49.7% were white-footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus) and hispid cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus ), representing 2 of 4 species statistically shown to prefer edge habitat. Although this demonstrated refuge lands were dominated by edge-adapted species, comparison to previous studies from within the refuge revealed a decrease in magnitude of their domination. Canonical redundancy analysis identified the amount of habitat available within 500 m of capture sites and average vegetation density within 150 m as important landscape features contributing to occurrence of small mammal species. These results demonstrated that the refuges in the LRGV are achieving their main goals to restore and maintain habitat.    Secondly, I examined effects of agricultural and urban fragmentation on genetic diversity and structure in populations of P. leucopus from 5 refuge tracts in the LRGV. Low nucleotide diversity combined with high haplotype diversity indicated a time of low effective population size of white-footed mice followed by recent population expansion. Localized population structuring suggested that P. leucopus was unable to effectively disperse through areas dominated by urbanization, while agricultural matrix offered no resistance. These results highlight the importance of preferentially acquiring and restoring land in areas dominated by an agricultural matrix to protect small mammal species from future urban encroachment.

T1  - An integrated approach to enhancing ecological connectivity and accessibility in urban areas: a case study of sheffield, uk
AN  - 1807095279
AB  - Recently, increasing environmental threats to the functioning of landscape and biodiversity have heightened the need for developing new approaches to nature conservation. Green and ecological networks have been developed as an attempt to maintain the functioning of landscapes, promote the sustainable use and conservation of nature, support the movement of species and increase people's use and enjoyment of the nature (Bennett and Wit, 2001; Bennett and Mulongoy, 2006; Lawton et al., 2010). These can be achieved by the identification and selection of the main features of ecological and green networks based on ecological and / or social functions we intend them to fulfil as well as the determination of objective conservation measures. The main purpose of this research is to focus on critically examining different ways of defining green and ecological networks and their functionality for biodiversity and people in the case of Sheffield, which were derived from different theoretical and professional perspectives (planning and ecology), and to explore the potential for different approaches to define ecological / green networks. Due to its multidisciplinary nature, this thesis uses a mixed research methodology, based on different methods of data collection and analysis. This research commences with the analysis of existing green and ecological network approaches, namely the Green Network (Sheffield City Council) and the Living Don (Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust). In order to analyse these approaches, policy document analysis, semi-structured interviews and ArcGIS spatial analyses were conducted to understand the rationale, aims and the spatial structure of current networks in the case of Sheffield. For the identification of criteria to develop alternative routes of connectivity, ArcGIS and FRAGSTATS were used. After generating land cover and land use maps at a very fine scale (2m raster resolution) and with different levels of detail, the alternative connectivity routes, for both biodiversity and people, were identified on the basis of two connectivity measures. The first set of spatial analyses took into account structural connectivity of landscape components as the main criteria, to develop potential routes using ArcGIS and FRAGSTATS in combination. On the other hand, based on functional connectivity, the second set of alternative connectivity routes were developed using a least-cost corridor approach in ArcGIS. For the delineation of alternative connectivity routes for biodiversity, 10 species were selected from 3 different taxon groups (birds, mammals and reptiles); and for people, the alternative routes from residential buildings to (a) green and open spaces, (b) public buildings and (c) industrial / commercial units were used considering the effects of physical / legal accessibility and slope. Then, existing approaches and derived alternative routes of connectivity were compared and contrasted to each other in ArcGIS, to analyse the relationship between their structural properties and the urban morphologies in which they occur, with a view to predicting the implications for ecological connectivity and use by members of the public. The Sheffield City Council and the Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust aim at maintaining and enhancing ecological connectivity for the benefit of wildlife as well as supporting public enjoyment and movement, and both of their network approaches benefit from the linear connectivity formed around the main rivers, streams and valleys. However, it was found that there are significant differences in the representation, spatial coverage and arrangement of the Green Network and the Living Don based on the methods and the site selection criteria used for developing green and ecological networks. Regarding the structural connectivity routes for biodiversity and people, significant differences were found in the spatial extent and arrangement of alternative routes. On the other hand, functional connectivity routes for biodiversity showed both similarities and differences in their spatial extents and arrangements according to selected species' habitat requirements and movement behaviours across the landscape. Similarly, functional connectivity routes for people changed as I used different destinations and parameters. The overall results of this research provide further support for the conceptual premise that the definition of green and ecological networks is highly dependent on the methodology, ecological and / or social functions that are considered, and also criteria for the inclusion of different habitats or land uses within the network.

T1  - Multiscale remote sensing analysis to monitor riparian and upland semiarid vegetation
AN  - 1682266093
AB  - The health of natural vegetation communities is of concern due to observed changes in the climatic-hydrological regime and land cover changes particularly in arid and semiarid regions. Monitoring vegetation at multi temporal and spatial scales can be the most informative approach for detecting change and inferring causal agents of change and remediation strategies. Riparian communities are tightly linked to annual stream hydrology, ground water elevations and sediment transport. These processes are subject to varying magnitudes of disturbance overtime and are candidates for multi-scale monitoring.     My first research objective focused on the response of vegetation in the Upper San Pedro River, Arizona, to reduced base flows and climate change. I addressed the correlation between riparian vegetation and hydro-climate variables during the last three decades in one of the remaining undammed rivers in the southwestern U.S. Its riparian forest is threatened by the diminishing base flows, attributed by different studies either to increases in evapotranspiration (ET) due to conversion of grasslands to mesquite shrublands in the adjacent uplands, or to increased regional groundwater pumping to serve growing populations in surrounding urban areas and or to some interactions of those causes. Landsat 5 imagery was acquired for pre- monsoon period, when riparian trees had leafed out but before the arrival of summer monsoon rains in July. The result has showed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values from both Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) had significant decreases which positively correlated to river flows, which decreased over the study period, and negatively correlated with air temperatures, which have increased by about 1.4°C from 1904 to the present. The predictions from other studies that decreased river flows could negatively impact the riparian forest were supported by this study. The pre-monsoon Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI) average values in the adjacent uplands also decreased over thirty years and were correlated with the previous year's annual precipitation. Hence an increase in ET in the uplands did not appear to be responsible for the decrease in river flows in this study, leaving increased regional groundwater pumping as a feasible alternative explanation for decreased flows and deterioration of the riparian forest.     The second research objective was to develop a new method of classification using very high-resolution aerial photo to map riparian vegetation at the species level in the Colorado River Ecosystem, Grand Canyon area, Arizona. Ground surveys have showed an obvious trend in which non-native saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) has replaced native vegetation over time. Our goal was to develop a quantitative mapping procedure to detect changes in vegetation as the ecosystem continues to respond to hydrological and climate changes. Vegetation mapping for the Colorado River Ecosystem needed an updated database map of the area covered by riparian vegetation and an indicator of species composition in the river corridor. The objective of this research was to generate a new riparian vegetation map at species level using a supervised image classification technique for the purpose of patch and landscape change detection. A new classification approach using multispectral images allowed us to successfully identify and map riparian species coverage the over whole Colorado River Ecosystem, Grand Canyon area. The new map was an improvement over the initial 2002 map since it reduced fragmentation from mixed riparian vegetation areas. The most dominant tree species in the study areas is saltcedar (Tamarix spp.). The overall accuracy is 93.48% and the kappa coefficient is 0.88. The reference initial inventory map was created using 2002 images to compare and detect changes through 2009.   The third objective of my research focused on using multiplatform of remote sensing and ground calibration to estimate the effects of vegetation, land use patterns and water cycles. Climate change, hydrological and human uses are also leading to riparian, upland, grassland and crop vegetation changes at a variety of temporal and spatial scales, particularly in the arid and semi arid ecosystems, which are more sensitive to changes in water availability than humid ecosystems. The objectives of these studies from the last three articles were to evaluate the effect of water balance on vegetation indices in different plant communities based on relevant spatial and temporal scales. The new methodology of estimating water requirements using remote sensing data and ground calibration with flux tower data has been successfully tested at a variety sites, a sparse desert shrub environment as well as mixed riparian and cropland systems and upland vegetation in the arid and semi-arid regions. The main finding form these studies is that vegetation-index methods have to be calibrated with ground data for each new ecosystem but once calibrated they can accurately scale ET over wide areas and long time spans.

T1  - Combined Use of Systematic Conservation Planning, Species Distribution Modelling, and Connectivity Analysis Reveals Severe Conservation Gaps in a Megadiverse Country (Peru)
AN  - 1632813341
AB  - Conservation planning is crucial for megadiverse countries where biodiversity is coupled with incomplete reserve systems and limited resources to invest in conservation. Using Peru as an example of a megadiverse country, we asked whether the national system of protected areas satisfies biodiversity conservation needs. Further, to complement the existing reserve system, we identified and prioritized potential conservation areas using a combination of species distribution modeling, conservation planning and connectivity analysis. Based on a set of 2,869 species, including mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, butterflies, and plants, we used species distribution models to represent species' geographic ranges to reduce the effect of biased sampling and partial knowledge about species' distributions. A site-selection algorithm then searched for efficient and complementary proposals, based on the above distributions, for a more representative system of protection. Finally, we incorporated connectivity among areas in an innovative post-hoc analysis to prioritize those areas maximizing connectivity within the system. Our results highlight severe conservation gaps in the Coastal and Andean regions, and we propose several areas, which are not currently covered by the existing network of protected areas. Our approach helps to find areas that contribute to creating a more representative, connected and efficient network.

T1  - A Viable Population of the European Red Squirrel in an Urban Park
AN  - 1553532849
AB  - Whether urban parks can maintain viable and self-sustaining populations over the long term is questionable. In highly urbanized landscapes, urban parks could play a role in biodiversity conservation by providing habitat and resources to native species. However, populations inhabiting urban parks are usually small and isolated, leading to increased demographic stochasticity and genetic drift, with expected negative consequences on their viability. Here, we investigated a European red squirrel population located in an urban park close to Paris, France (Parc de Sceaux; 184 ha) to assess its viability. Using mitochondrial D-loop sequences and 13 microsatellite loci, we showed that the population presented high levels of genetic variation and no evidence of inbreeding. The size of the population was estimated at 100–120 individuals based on the comparison of two census techniques, Distance Sampling and Capture-Mark-Recapture. The estimated heterozygosity level and population size were integrated in a Population Viability Analysis to project the likelihood of the population's persistence over time. Results indicate that the red squirrel population of this urban park can be viable on the long term (i.e. 20 years) for a range of realistic demographic parameters (juvenile survival at least >40%) and immigration rates (at least one immigration event every two years). This study highlights that urban parks can be potential suitable refuges for the red squirrel, a locally threatened species across western European countries, provided that ecological corridors are maintained.

T1  - Visibility from Roads Predict the Distribution of Invasive Fishes in Agricultural Ponds
AN  - 1535246382
AB  - Propagule pressure and habitat characteristics are important factors used to predict the distribution of invasive alien species. For species exhibiting strong propagule pressure because of human-mediated introduction of species, indicators of introduction potential must represent the behavioral characteristics of humans. This study examined 64 agricultural ponds to assess the visibility of ponds from surrounding roads and its value as a surrogate of propagule pressure to explain the presence and absence of two invasive fish species. A three-dimensional viewshed analysis using a geographic information system quantified the visual exposure of respective ponds to humans. Binary classification trees were developed as a function of their visibility from roads, as well as five environmental factors: river density, connectivity with upstream dam reservoirs, pond area, chlorophyll a concentration, and pond drainage. Traditional indicators of human-mediated introduction (road density and proportion of urban land-use area) were alternatively included for comparison instead of visual exposure. The presence of Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) was predicted by the ponds' higher visibility from roads and pond connection with upstream dam reservoirs. Results suggest that fish stocking into ponds and their dispersal from upstream sources facilitated species establishment. Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) distribution was constrained by chlorophyll a concentration, suggesting their lower adaptability to various environments than that of Bluegill. Based on misclassifications from classification trees for Bluegill, pond visual exposure to roads showed greater predictive capability than traditional indicators of human-mediated introduction. Pond visibility is an effective predictor of invasive species distribution. Its wider use might improve management and mitigate further invasion. The visual exposure of recipient ecosystems to humans is important for many invasive species that spread with frequent instances of human-mediated introduction.

T1  - Ecology of mesopredators within an urban area in east Texas
AN  - 1664100185
AB  - As urbanization is increasingly becoming more commonplace across the country, the effect of urban landscape features on wildlife species is becoming more important. Unlike large predators, mesopredators are expanding their geographic range and are readily adapting to living in and around urbanized areas. Even though urban mesopredator research has steadily been growing over the last 45 years, the majority of this has taken place in large metropolitan areas in the Midwest, Pacific and Northeastern regions. Research in the southeastern US, especially Texas and within small, urbanized areas is surprisingly lacking. In eastern Texas, mesopredators commonly found in urban areas include coyotes (Canis latrans), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), bobcats ( Lynx rufus), Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), raccoons (Procyon lotor) and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis). As more natural habitats are developed, it is important to identify variables likely to influence the density, occurrence and detectability of these species in order to establish sound management strategies to mitigate potential human-wildlife interactions. A mark-recapture study was conducted to: 1) Determine if density, occurrence and detectability of coyotes, red foxes, gray foxes, bobcats, raccoons, Virginia opossums and striped skunks vary in predictable ways in response to urban landscape features, and 2) identify hot spots of high potential human-mesopredator contact.   I utilized motion-activated cameras during summer 2013 and winter 2014 to determine how coyotes, bobcats, and red and gray fox respond to urban landscape features in the city of Nacogdoches and immediately surrounding areas. The mesocarnivore community in the study area was affected by a variety of urban landscape features and their presence, density, and detectability shifted seasonally, but was similar to studies conducted in larger urban areas in North America. Coyote and bobcat presence and detectability both differed seasonally and were primarily associated with natural cover. Gray fox presence was affected by low density of buildings, whereas red fox densities increased as distance to buildings and distance to urban edge decreased. Low density residential zones adjacent to large forested patches such as the southeastern and northeastern extremes of the study area may have the greatest potential for human contact with coyotes, bobcats, red and gray foxes.   For raccoons, Virginia opossums and striped skunks I conducted a live mark-recapture study during late August – early September 2013 and early – late January 2014 in both suburban (summer 1.76 km2; winter 1.23 km2) and urban (winter 1.37 km2) areas within the city of Nacogdoches, Texas. Densities of raccoons within urban habitat ranged from 7.0 – 59.0 / km2, (  x¯ = 18.8 ± 6.4 / km2), which is consistent with previous research, whereas I report the first density estimate of opossums in an urbanized area during the summer (4.8 ± 1.9 / km2) and winter (13.1 ± 7.5 / km2). At the urban site, raccoon density, presence and hot spots were tied to areas of greater road density with small forested patches and subsequent greater human presence whereas opossum occurrence and hot spots were tied to close proximity to water. At the suburban site, presence and detectability of opossums and raccoons was associated with proximity to water and near small forested patches.   This research indicates that the mesopredator community does in fact vary in their density and occurrence within the city of Nacogdoches. Nacogdoches has one of the greatest densities (x¯ = 227 ± 0.46 ind/km2) of coyotes reported in the literature in both urban and nonurban areas. Densities of red fox (1.19 ind/km2), bobcats (x¯ = 0.57 ± 0.32 ind/km2) and raccoons (x¯ = 18.8 ± 6.4 / km2), were consistent with values reported for urban populations, while I also report the first population densities of Virginia opossum (4.8 – 13.1 ind/km 2) and gray fox (x¯ = 0.36 ± 0.19 ind/km 2) living within a small urban area.   The ability to see how the densities of certain species changes throughout the landscape will help biologists, city officials and wildlife managers make important decisions regarding educating the public and reducing human – mesopredator contact and zoonotic disease transmission. The remarkable variability of these species to urban landscape features is a testament to their remarkable and seamless adaptability. However, I see the need to preserve or construct wildlife corridors within and/or on the edges of urbanized areas to facilitate the movements of mesopredators away from residential areas and possible human interaction. Although I provide new insights in the urban ecology to all of the focal species, there is still a lot to be learned in urban areas such as gray fox and opossum urban ecology.

T1  - Critical Effects of Urbanization on a Charismatic Carnivore: Genetic Change, Disease and Toxicant Exposure, and Disease Susceptibility in Bobcat Populations in an Urban, Fragmented Landscape
AN  - 1548325831
AB  - Urbanization has profound ecological impacts that reach beyond city boundaries. Obvious ecological consequences of urbanization include habitat loss and fragmentation. Anthropogenic barriers reduce habitat connectivity, impede gene flow between populations and accelerate the loss of genetic diversity in populations due to drift. Urbanization may have also cryptic consequences such as the effects of human-introduced toxicants on wildlife populations. Toxicants are a leading cause of population decline for a variety of animal species worldwide and may directly threaten animal populations by causing direct mortalities, or indirectly through sublethal, chronic effects such as reproductive impairment, decreased immune competence, and increased disease susceptibility or emergence. If population-level impacts occur as a result of toxicant exposure, genetic consequences may also accompany reduced population sizes and connectivity. These include inbreeding depression that may increase the probability of population extinction and the loss of adaptive potential that reduces the ability of populations to respond to novel selection regimes. Overall, urbanization presents wildlife with many novel stressors to which they must adapt or perish. Urbanization is increasing at an unprecedented pace; understanding both the obvious and the cryptic threats to wild animal populations persisting near urban areas will be vital to promoting conservation and the maintenance of global biodiversity.    To address the consequences of urbanization on wildlife populations, I focused on a well-studied population of bobcats (Lynx rufus) living in and around Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (SMMNRA). This region comprises a collection of protected park areas near downtown Los Angeles. Bobcats inhabiting SMMNRA have been monitored by National Park Service (NPS) biologists since 1996. Within a localized region of SMMNRA, the NPS has demonstrated that a major freeway (US-101) acts not only as a barrier to movement for bobcat and coyote (Canis latrans) populations, but potentially also as a social barrier. Further, from 2002-2005, a notoedric mange epizootic associated with secondary anticoagulant rat poison exposure was the greatest source of mortality for bobcats. During this period, the annual survival rate for radio-collared animals fell by > 50% and in 2003 the mange mortality rate reached a high of 51%. Long-term samples were collected from this population from 1996-2012, allowing the rare opportunity to make direct comparisons before, during, and after the population decline.   Using these data as a foundation, my research focused on three main objectives. First, I characterized neutral and adaptively relevant genetic diversity in bobcat populations across SMMNRA in both fragmented urban and protected natural areas. Second, I examined anticoagulant rodenticide exposure in bobcats across southern California, contrasting seasonal, demographic and spatial risk factors in both natural and urbanized areas. Third, I characterized physiological and immunological parameters in bobcats across SMMNRA to evaluate the effects of disease and toxicant exposure on bobcat health in an urban, fragmented landscape.   I found that two freeways are significant barriers to gene flow. Further, the 3-year disease epizootic, associated with secondary anticoagulant rodenticide exposure, caused a population bottleneck that led to significant genetic differentiation pre- and post-disease populations that was greater than that between populations separated by major freeways for > 60 years. However, balancing selection acted on immune-linked loci during the epizootic, maintaining variation at functional regions. With respect to anticoagulant rodenticide exposure, I detected high prevalence of exposure (89%, liver; 39%, blood) and found that for individuals with paired liver and blood data (N = 64), 92% were exposed most frequently to greater than or equal to 3 compounds. Prevalence and the amounts of contaminants were associated with human activities that included commercial, residential, and agricultural development. I found a strong association between AR exposure to greater than and equal to 0.25 ppm or greater than and equal to 2 compounds and an ectoparasitic disease, notoedric mange. Finally, I observed that AR exposure has both immune stimulatory and suppressive effects that may explain increased bobcat susceptibility to notoedric mange as a result of chronic exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides. Bobcats exposed to ARs had elevated lymphocyte, and specifically B cell counts, and decreased percentages of neutrophils. Overall, these data highlight that even for free-ranging animals that are considered relatively adaptable to urbanization, habitat fragmentation and toxicant exposure can have profound population level effects that threaten the long-term stability of wildlife populations in an increasingly urbanized landscape.

T1  - Genetic and Morphological Variation of Butterflies in Relict Habitats
AN  - 2700377060
AB  - Habitat fragmentation and loss are leading threats to global biodiversity and can alter patterns of dispersal, population dynamics, and genetics with implications for long-term species persistence. Most habitat fragmentation research has focused on recently fragmented species that historically occupied interconnected habitat patches. We know comparatively little about how naturally fragmented species may respond to habitat loss. For these species, local habitat patch quality may influence the dynamics and genetics of populations more than the structure of the surrounding landscape (e.g., degree of isolation of suitable habitat). I examined aspects of the ecology and evolution of populations inhabiting fragmented landscapes, using two butterfly species representing relict populations that are 1) recently fragmented by anthropogenic activities (Mormon metalmark, Apodemia mormo), and 2) naturally fragmented (bog copper, Lycaena epixanthe). I assessed patterns of genetic (amplified fragment length polymorphism, AFLP) and flight-related morphological variation, and their relationship to measures of surrounding landscape structure and local habitat quality.Population genetic analysis of the anthropogenically fragmented Mormon metalmark revealed a high degree of spatial genetic structure, indicating limited gene flow, despite a small geographic scale (<20 km). Management of this endangered population should focus on increasing connectivity among the most isolated sub-populations and through urban areas. For the naturally fragmented bog copper, genetic diversity was explained by variables related to patch quality rather than landscape structure. Movement ability in the bog copper (inferred by flight morphology) appeared to depend on both local habitat conditions and the surrounding landscape. Also, using an AFLP-based genome scan approach, I identified signatures of selection in the bog copper associated with fine-scale landscape heterogeneity.My work on the bog copper highlights the importance of considering the effects of local habitat conditions, in addition to habitat isolation, for conservation of fragmented populations.My work on the bog copper highlights the importance of considering the effects of local habitat conditions, in addition to habitat isolation, for conservation of fragmented populations.

T1  - Assessing the ecological significance of linkage and connectivity for avian populations in urban areas
AN  - 1512394267
AB  - As urbanisation continues to fragment and degrade habitats there is a need to ensure that cities are managed to sustain ecosystem function and high biodiversity. Ecological theories suggest that areas with higher levels of functional connectivity sustain a more diverse avian population. By identifying the key habitat features that dictate the distribution and abundance of avian populations it is possible to inform planning policy to maximise biodiversity. Bird species presence and abundance across an urban gradient in Birmingham (UK) was surveyed at 70 sites over three sampling periods (between 2009 and 2010), in combination with a tree survey and digital analysis of land use. Functional connectivity was shown to increase the abundance of bird species and to ameliorate the impacts of urban development. Bird species were found to vary with their associations with vegetation structure and a proxy for invertebrate productivity. There was clear evidence for increasing native tree species in the urban matrix to support more bird species. Ringing data collected between 2008 and 2011 were used to examine bird movements through the city and the influence of habitat factors such as connectivity and built space in the matrix. Bird movements between ringing sites demonstrated the permeability of the city and the importance of connectivity in the landscape. This work showed that the composition of the matrix influences bird occupancy and turnover of sites. The novel findings presented in this thesis on the influence of the urban landscape on urban avian ecology should make an important contribution to urban conservation methods.

T1  - Patterns and Processes of Genetic Diversity in the Endangered San Joaquin Kit Fox
AN  - 1492740292
AB  - Survival of the endangered San Joaquin kit fox (SJKF; Vulpes macrotis mutica) is challenged by reduced and fragmented habitat resulting from anthropogenic land uses in the Central Valley of California. Because the SJKF is adapted to arid landscapes and utilizes large home ranges to prey on kangaroo rats, genetic techniques are very useful to study these elusive animals. We used annual noninvasive genetic surveys from 2009 to 2011 to document the kit foxes on the Topaz Solar Farms (TSF) in San Luis Obispo Co., California, prior to the construction of the solar facility. We identified 45 individuals from 351 fresh scat samples and found kit foxes predominantly used the annual grasslands and rarely used agricultural lands. Second, we conducted 3 years of systematic transect surveys for scat throughout the Ciervo-Panoche area. We identified 93 kit foxes, with half of the individuals carrying a mtDNA haplotype with a 16bp deletion that had not been previously identified. Next, we used 795 scat and tissue samples collected over a period of 20 years to ascertain landscape level patterns of connectivity and population dynamics of kit foxes in the San Joaquin Valley. We found 3 geographically and genetically distinct groups that are highly disconnected and have undergone a 76% reduction from their estimated historic population size. Finally, we used pyrosequencing to characterize three major histocompatibility (MHC) genes that have been shown to play a role in immunity. We selected a subset of individuals from two relatively stable natural environments and compared their patterns of MHC variation to kit foxes adapted to the urban environment in Bakersfield, CA. Every gene (DQA, DQB, and DRB) was polygenic with varying degrees of polymorphism, although DRB alleles translated into a greater number of unique antigen binding sites, and thus greater immune system diversity. Urban and wild populations had similar allelic diversity, and each carried unique alleles. Each of these studies resulted from long-term collaborative efforts from a team of researchers that are working closely with federal, state and private agencies responsible for the protection of the endangered SJKF. The results of our research on patterns of genetic diversity and connectivity are already playing an important role in the design of SJKF conservation and management plans.

T1  - Temporal, Spatial, and Environmental Influences on the Demographics and Harvest Vulnerability of American Black Bears (<i>Ursus americanus </i>) in Urban Habitats in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia
AN  - 1491167809
AB  - To date, no research studies in the eastern United States have addressed the spatial ecology of black bears (Ursus americanus) in urban and suburban habitats, and there is limited information regarding black bear space use, habitat selection, and harvest vulnerability. I assessed the harvest vulnerability, home range size, and spatial ecology of black bears in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia in collaboration with the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife, Pennsylvania Game Commission, and the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources. The major objectives of my study were to identify and quantitatively assess: (1) if black bears shift home ranges seasonally with respect to urban/suburban habitats; (2) harvest vulnerability and cause-specific mortality of black bears in urban/suburban habitats; (3) if black bears captured as result of nuisance complaints are transient or reside in urban/suburban habitats; (4) habitat characteristics of movement corridors utilized by black bears in urban/suburban habitats; and (5) if corridors likely to be used by black bears accessing urban/suburban environments can be predicted by habitat modeling.    Over the course of the study (2010-2012), agency employees trapped, handled, and fit 119 bears with GPS-GSM collars. Individual study areas in each state were centered around West Milford, Stillwater/Branchville, and Vernon, NJ; Johnstown, Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, and State College, PA; Beckley, Charleston, and Morgantown, WV. A total of 57,816 bear locations were recorded in New Jersey, 114,451 locations were recorded in Pennsylvania, and 33,217 in West Virginia.    Black bears shifted spatial distribution on the landscape in response to resource availability, and consequently I expected bears in urban areas to shift their home ranges seasonally in urban environments. On average, bears were most often found near city limits (<5 km). Home range centers of male bears were twice as far from city limits as female bears (2.31 km vs. 0.91 km, respectively). Bear home range size did not differ among seasons, but did differ between sexes (male home ranges were 5.6 times larger than female bears) and among study areas. Bears did not shift their home ranges closer to urban areas during times of food shortage (spring or late fall). Urban bears lived near town and were resident to the edge of the urban area, but this distance varied with the study area in which they resided. As a result, managers seeking to understand where potential bear conflicts may occur should focus their efforts on the edge of urban and suburban areas (known as the exurban areas) in the Mid-Atlantic Region.    Regulated harvests have reduced mortality and allowed black bear populations to increase throughout the eastern United States over the past 30 years. This rapid and dramatic recovery in population size has led to increased human-bear interactions in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Harvest vulnerability of black bears is dependent on a variety of factors and therefore difficult to estimate. I measured harvest vulnerability by generating maximum entropy (Maxent) models of bear occurrence during the prehunting period and hunting season for each study area. I used Maxent to generate models of bear occurrence. In all but one study area, black bear occurrence was 5-75% less in the hunting season than in the prehunting period. Bear occurrence decreased from prehunting period to hunting season in both public hunting lands and urban areas. Bear occurrence probability shifted from public hunting areas to the periphery of the public hunting areas between the prehunting period and hunting season. Annual harvest rates of urban bears were highest in Pennsylvania (20.2%) and lower in New Jersey (5.9%) and West Virginia (17.3%). Despite the short timeframe (3 years) of my study, regulated hunting was effective in killing urban black bears Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Hunters in Pennsylvania harvested a similar proportion of urban bears to the long-term harvest rate of all bears in the state (20.2% vs. 20.0%, respectively). Probability of urban bear occurrence shifted from public hunting areas during the prehunting period to private lands on the periphery of urban areas during the hunting season. Average overall mortality rates of urban bears were highest in Pennsylvania (28.1%) and lower in West Virginia (17.5%) and New Jersey (15.1%). Despite the short timeframe of the study, regulated hunting was effective in killing a high number of urban black bears in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, when all mortality sources were taken into account.     Black bear populations have increased nationwide over the past 4 decades due to reduction in direct mortality. Bear population sizes have increased over time and as a result, human-bear conflicts have increased. I sought to determine whether nuisance bears in urban/suburban areas are residents to the area or transient. I predicted that the majority of bears found in urban/suburban areas form resident populations on the urban perimeter, rather than transient individuals that leave the core forests and enter the urban areas periodically. There was considerable support for my prediction that bear populations in urban areas are resident and spend much of their time on the city's edge. Black bears used private lands on the periphery of urban areas. I posit that this may have been because these areas likely had abundant food and provided reduced risk of disturbance (e.g., hunting, human disturbance).     Given the recent explosive increase in urban bear populations, managers are charged to determine which areas of urban/suburban centers are likely to be used by bears. It is unknown whether black bears use travel corridors within urban/suburban matrix to travel between habitat patches. There exists a paucity of information on how black bears use urban and suburban habitats. We used boosted regression trees to create two predictive models of bear occurrence in urban and suburban habitats for (1) New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and (2) West Virginia. We separated West Virginia from New Jersey and Pennsylvania in the modeling process because West Virginia's topography is more rugged and the population density of people was the lowest of all three states. We randomly selected a subset of 40,000 bear locations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, as well as, 30,000 bear locations in West Virginia from the full database of locations. We generated 40,000 random points within the study areas in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and 30,000 random points within the study areas of West Virginia. We built three models (1) for New Jersey and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, PA, (2) State College and Johnstown, PA, and (3) West Virginia. We found that probability of bear occurrence was highest in New Jersey and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre study areas when bears were: (1) <1 km from edge forest, (2) <7.5 km from the nearest road, (3) <7.5 km from the nearest urban area, (4) land use/ land cover was forested, (5) <12 km from public land, and (6) NDVI < 0.3. We found that probability of bear occurrence was highest in Johnstown and State College study areas when bears were: (1) <1 km from edge forest, (2) <1 km from the nearest road, (3) <7 km from the nearest urban area, and (4) <7 km from public land. The highest probability of bear occurrence in West Virginia occurred when (1) NDVI was >0.6, (2) distance to public land was >22.0 km, (3) distance to urban areas was between 1-5 km, (3) topographic position index was >100 (steep, rugged terrain), (4) land use land cover was forested or "other", (5) distance to roads was >1.4 km, and (6) distance to core forest was >1.5 km. We found no support for our prediction that urban bears use corridors. Bears spent nearly 95% of their time on the edge of city limits and <5% of their time within city limits. We found no evidence that habitat quality on the edge of city limits was lower than that of "non-urban" bear habitat. There is likely not a physiological need for bears to traverse urban areas when they can remain in habitats where they would encounter less human disturbance. I found no support for my prediction that bears use corridors. Bears spent nearly 95% of their time on the edge of city limits and <5% of their time within city limits. I had no evidence that habitat quality on the edge of city limits was lower than that of non-urban bear habitat. There likely was no physiological need for bears to traverse urban areas because urban habitat patches are often safe from human disturbance and therefore, they did not use corridors. The final predictive model of the probability of bear occurrence will assist managers by identifying areas where urban bears are most likely to live and areas that require direct management actions.

T1  - Beyond drawing the line: A study of the edge structure Boston's Emerald Necklace
AN  - 1412675131
AB  - Landscapes are mosaics of patches and corridors which are formed by hills, different soils types, vegetation patchiness, natural disturbances and human activities. As humans have developed, the patches and corridors have become fragmented and edges have been created. These edges become the critical points of interaction for wildlife with their surroundings. This is especially true in urban areas where development has created harsh edge environments.      \This study investigates the edge structure of Olmsted's Emerald Necklace to understand how edges can be designed to create habitat for wildlife in urban areas. The Emerald Necklace is located in Boston, MA and was designed in the 1800s by Frederick Law Olmsted. The Necklace is the first designed greenway and has been used as a model by many cities throughout the country. As such, the Emerald Necklace can be studied to gain insight into how the edges of an urban greenway can be designed to augment animal diversity in urban areas. The goal of the study is to provide design recommendations that can be used as a guide by landscape architects to maintain current urban greenways and to plan future ones.     The study's major findings suggest that plant and animal species vary along the park as per the original design. Additional findings show that there is no separation of spaces for people and animals along the Necklace which can lead to habitat disturbance. In addition eight design recommendations are suggested to improve the current conditions of the Emerald Necklace. Moreover the recommendations are not site specific and can be applied to other existing and future urban greenways. These include protecting existing habitat, using native plants and eradicating invasive species. The results and findings are discussed in further detail. Overall the Emerald Necklace is ecologically healthy and provides functions for both people and animals.

T1  - Phylogeography of Quercus variabilis Based on Chloroplast DNA Sequence in East Asia: Multiple Glacial Refugia and Mainland-Migrated Island Populations
AN  - 1970283080
AB  - The biogeographical relationships between far-separated populations, in particular, those in the mainland and islands, remain unclear for widespread species in eastern Asia where the current distribution of plants was greatly influenced by the Quaternary climate. Deciduous Oriental oak (Quercus variabilis) is one of the most widely distributed species in eastern Asia. In this study, leaf material of 528 Q. variabilis trees from 50 populations across the whole distribution (Mainland China, Korea Peninsular as well as Japan, Zhoushan and Taiwan Islands) was collected, and three cpDNA intergenic spacer fragments were sequenced using universal primers. A total of 26 haplotypes were detected, and it showed a weak phylogeographical structure in eastern Asia populations at species level, however, in the central-eastern region of Mainland China, the populations had more haplotypes than those in other regions, with a significant phylogeographical structure (NST = 0.751> GST = 0.690, P<0.05). Q. variabilis displayed high interpopulation and low intrapopulation genetic diversity across the distribution range. Both unimodal mismatch distribution and significant negative Fu’s FS indicated a demographic expansion of Q. variabilis populations in East Asia. A fossil calibrated phylogenetic tree showed a rapid speciation during Pleistocene, with a population augment occurred in Middle Pleistocene. Both diversity patterns and ecological niche modelling indicated there could be multiple glacial refugia and possible bottleneck or founder effects occurred in the southern Japan. We dated major spatial expansion of Q. variabilis population in eastern Asia to the last glacial cycle(s), a period with sea-level fluctuations and land bridges in East China Sea as possible dispersal corridors. This study showed that geographical heterogeneity combined with climate and sea-level changes have shaped the genetic structure of this wide-ranging tree species in East Asia.

T1  - Land Cover and Rainfall Interact to Shape Waterbird Community Composition
AN  - 1324600191
AB  - Human land cover can degrade estuaries directly through habitat loss and fragmentation or indirectly through nutrient inputs that reduce water quality. Strong precipitation events are occurring more frequently, causing greater hydrological connectivity between watersheds and estuaries. Nutrient enrichment and dissolved oxygen depletion that occur following these events are known to limit populations of benthic macroinvertebrates and commercially harvested species, but the consequences for top consumers such as birds remain largely unknown. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) and structural equation modeling (SEM) to understand how land cover and annual variation in rainfall interact to shape waterbird community composition in Chesapeake Bay, USA. The MDS ordination indicated that urban subestuaries shifted from a mixed generalist-specialist community in 2002, a year of severe drought, to generalist-dominated community in 2003, of year of high rainfall. The SEM revealed that this change was concurrent with a sixfold increase in nitrate-N concentration in subestuaries. In the drought year of 2002, waterbird community composition depended only on the direct effect of urban development in watersheds. In the wet year of 2003, community composition depended both on this direct effect and on indirect effects associated with high nitrate-N inputs to northern parts of the Bay, particularly in urban subestuaries. Our findings suggest that increased runoff during periods of high rainfall can depress water quality enough to alter the composition of estuarine waterbird communities, and that this effect is compounded in subestuaries dominated by urban development. Estuarine restoration programs often chart progress by monitoring stressors and indicators, but rarely assess multivariate relationships among them. Estuarine management planning could be improved by tracking the structure of relationships among land cover, water quality, and waterbirds. Unraveling these complex relationships may help managers identify and mitigate ecological thresholds that occur with increasing human land cover.

T1  - The effect of fragmentation on the threatened plant community Coastal Moonah Woodland in Victoria, Australia
AN  - 1012762464
AB  - Coastal vegetation is under increasing pressure with the expansion of urban developments, tourism, population and changing climates. This study sought to examine the effects of fragmentation on the threatened plant community, Coastal Moonah Woodland, in southern Victoria, Australia. We examined the effects on community composition of surrounding land use (urban, rural, native vegetation), remnant size and environmental attributes at three spatial scales. At larger scales, geographic and environmental attributes, such as annual rainfall and temperature, were important drivers of community composition. At finer scales, remnant size, disturbance, weed invasion, connectivity, and immediate surrounding land use impacted more on community composition. At these scales, increasing native vegetation cover in the landscape, remnant connectivity and size positively influenced community composition. If coastal development continues at the current rate, all but a few remnants of this community will be surrounded by the urban landscape. Thus, planning for the integration of these remnants in the urban landscape through long-term management plans and community involvement is essential for the survival of these remnants.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Vegetation composition and structure of woody plant communities along urban interstate corridors in Louisville, KY, U.S.A.
AN  - 1012762437
AB  - Urban forests adjacent to interstate corridors are understudied ecosystems across cities. Despite their small area, these forests may be strategically located to provide large ecosystem services due to their ability to act as a barrier against air pollutants and noise as well as to provide flood control. The woody vegetation composition and structure of forests adjacent to urban interstates is an important determinant of their ability to provide these services. However, these forest communities may be particularly susceptible to the introduction of exotic invasive species via the interstate and the surrounding city that can potentially alter current and future forest composition. The purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of native and exotic woody vegetation and tree regeneration in forests along three interstate corridors in Louisville, KY, and to determine potential factors (e.g., traffic density) that are correlated with patterns in the woody vegetation community. We found the most important determinants of vegetation composition along these interstate corridors were the distance from the city center and the presence of an exotic invasive shrub, Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii). Compared with forested plots within 10 km of the city center, plots further from the city center had 81% lower stem density of Amur honeysuckle, 96% higher tree seedling regeneration, and 51% greater woody plant species richness. The primarily native species composition of adult trees in forests alongside urban interstates in Louisville and the regeneration of native tree species provide optimism that these forests can maintain native species while experiencing multiple impacts from the interstate as well as from the surrounding city, emphasizing their important potential for maintaining natural forest functions across the urban landscape.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Degree of Landscape Fragmentation Influences Genetic Isolation among Populations of a Gliding Mammal
AN  - 1309934860
AB  - Forests and woodlands are under continuing pressure from urban and agricultural development. Tree-dependent mammals that rarely venture to the ground are likely to be highly sensitive to forest fragmentation. The Australian squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) provides an excellent case study to examine genetic (functional) connectivity among populations. It has an extensive range that occurs in a wide band along the east coast. However, its forest and woodland habitat has become greatly reduced in area and is severely fragmented within the southern inland part of the species' range, where it is recognised as threatened. Within central and northern coastal regions, habitat is much more intact and we thus hypothesise that genetic connectivity will be greater in this region than in the south. To test this we employed microsatellite analysis in a molecular population biology approach. Most sampling locations in the highly modified south showed signatures of genetic isolation. In contrast, a high level of genetic connectivity was inferred among most sampled populations in the more intact habitat of the coastal region, with samples collected 1400 km apart having similar genetic cluster membership. Nonetheless, some coastal populations associated with urbanisation and agriculture are genetically isolated, suggesting the historic pattern observed in the south is emerging on the coast. Our study demonstrates that massive landscape changes following European settlement have had substantial impacts on levels of connectivity among squirrel glider populations, as predicted on the basis of the species' ecology. This suggests that landscape planning and management in the south should be focused on restoring habitat connectivity where feasible, while along the coast, existing habitat connectivity must be maintained and recent losses restored. Molecular population biology approaches provide a ready means for identifying fragmentation effects on a species at multiple scales. Such studies are required to examine the generality of our findings for other tree-dependent species.

T1  - Urban areas may serve as habitat and corridors for dry-adapted, heat tolerant species; an example from ants
AN  - 862429691
AB  - We collected ants from six urban and one forest land-use types in Raleigh, NC to examine the effects of urbanization on species richness and assemblage composition. Since urban areas are warmer (i.e., heat island effect) we also tested if cities were inhabited by species from warmer/drier environments. Species richness was lower in industrial areas relative to other urban and natural environments. There are two distinct ant assemblages; 1) areas with thick canopy cover, and 2) more disturbed open urban areas. Native ant assemblages in open environments have more southwestern (i.e., warmer/drier) distributions than forest assemblages. High native species richness suggests that urban environments may allow species to persist that are disappearing from natural habitat fragments. The subset of species adapted to warmer/drier environments indicates that urban areas may facilitate the movement of some species. This suggests that urban adapted ants may be particularly successful at tracking future climate change. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Riparian corridor vegetation structure and soil function along urban, suburban, and rural streams in Louisville, KY, USA
AN  - 896908476
AB  - Stream riparian zones are ecotones between terrestrial and aquatic environments. Studying these areas in urban environments is important since they lie adjacent to stream water supplies. I conducted a study of riparian woody and groundcover vegetation along urban, suburban, and rural streams (land-use designations based on % impervious surface) to assess how cities are affecting plant community structure. I also studied riparian soil gas flux (carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) in relation to water table depth and groundwater nutrient concentrations spanning a 10-month period (January to October, 2008). I found distinct woody and groundcover communities associated with proportion of impervious surface surrounding the research sites. These communities differed regarding diversity and proportion of native, exotic, and wetland species distributions. The most urban communities generally had lower species richness, more exotic species, and fewer wetland species when compared to rural areas. Urban areas also exhibited the highest streambanks and lowest water tables. Carbon dioxide gas flux rates were higher in urban areas, but methane and nitrous oxide fluxes did not respond uniformly to site differences as classified by proportion of impervious surface. Methane and nitrous oxide differences, in addition to seasonal variability, were more greatly affected by local site level differences in substrate and nutrient ratios as well as soil moisture.

T1  - Urban forestry -- Linking naturalness and amenity: The case of Ljubljana, Slovenia
AN  - 881467481; 2011-111519
AB  - Urban forestry tries to connect the concept of forest ecosystem with the idea of nature preservation as well as with social needs of urban society, often living close to such a natural environment, thus being a part of it. The ability to connect the human need for the natural environment with life support system of persistent forest ecosystem should become an important contributing factor of urban forestry for well-being of urban society. In the range of 1 km walking distance around the city of Ljubljana and within urban areas of the city, forests comprise more than one quarter of the area. The most prevalent in the area are patches of forest fragments, estimated to have a shallow depth of the inner environment. The concept of urban forests in the Ljubljana Green System as a backbone of a green network has been confirmed especially by the two largest forest patches of Golovec and Roznik, indented as a part of forest matrix up to the city centre. Based on the analysis of the continuum of these forests, it was possible to assume that in the past, more than three quarters of forest grounds were meant for no other land use. In the other quarter of the city and its Green System, forests were more significantly reduced in the past, given the fact that we can estimate its continuum only for one half of today's area. On a detailed level, it is recommended for the urban forests to contain a significant percentage of trees and other species that would naturally appear on the sites of the area. Whereas on a landscape level, it is not enough to address only such species, but also temporal stability of forest patches, corridors or even forest matrix in urban areas and its urban-rural gradient into suburban areas.

T1  - The influence of landscape on genetic structure of a threatened reptile: The eastern massasauga rattlesnake
AN  - 1005626131
AB  - Understanding the impacts of both natural and anthropogenic landscape features on genetic diversity, population structure and connectivity has important implications for conservation of species living in fragmented environments. Here, I combine population genetic data, detailed land cover information, and computer simulations to explore how landscape shapes genetic structure across two regional populations of the threatened eastern massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus) in Ontario, Canada: one along the eastern shores of Georgian Bay and the other largely confined to the northern half of the Bruce Peninsula.    First I used spatial Bayesian assignment to quantify the genetic population structure within each regional population. I found marked subpopulation structure within eastern Georgian Bay with differentiation of island and mainland snakes, a north-south split within the mainland coinciding with the town of Parry Sound, and evidence of further subdivision within the cluster of snakes north of Parry Sound. In contrast I found no population subdivision within the mainland of the Bruce Peninsula, but genetic distinction of mainland and island snakes.    Next, I identified the landscape features that shape spatial genetic structure within regional populations. In eastern Georgian Bay I found local variation in the effect of landscape on populations. North of Parry Sound I found no effect of landscape on inter-individual genetic differentiation, but a strong pattern of isolation-by-distance. In contrast I found that both open water and roads restrict gene flow of snakes south of Parry Sound. I found no evidence of isolation-by-distance or that landscape shape genetic structure within the Bruce Peninsula.   Finally I used individual-based, spatially explicit simulations to identify the lag-time associated with the detection of contemporary landscape feature effects on genetic structure of massasaugas, and explore the consequences of using spatially correlated land cover elements in landscape genetic analyses. I found that the genetic consequences of roads could be detected within 2-12 generations when population sizes were small or juvenile dispersal was low. However, I also found that roads could be spuriously identified as impediments to gene flow when spatially correlated features such as water are included in genetic models.

T1  - Plant migration along freeways in and around an arid urban area: Phoenix, Arizona
AN  - 822478949
AB  - General ecological thought pertaining to plant biology, conservation, and urban areas has rested on two potentially contradictory underlying assumptions. The first is that non-native plants can spread easily from human developments to "pristine" areas. The second is that native plants cannot disperse through developed areas. Both assume anthropogenic changes to ecosystems create conditions that favor non-native plants and hinder native species. However, it is just as likely that anthropogenic alterations of habitats will favor certain groups of plant species with similar functional traits, whether native or not.    Migration of plants can be divided into the following stages: dispersal, germination, establishment, reproduction and spread. Functional traits of species determine which are most successful at each of the stages of invasion or range enlargement. I studied the traits that allow both native and non-native plant species to disperse into freeway corridors, germinate, establish, reproduce, and then disperse along those corridors in Phoenix, Arizona. Field methods included seed bank sample collection and germination, vegetation surveys, and seed trapping. I also evaluated concentrations of plant-available nitrate as a result of localized nitrogen deposition. While many plant species found on the roadsides are either landscape varieties or typical weedy species, some uncommon native species and unexpected non-native species were also encountered. Maintenance regimes greatly influence the amount of vegetative cover and species composition along roadsides. Understanding which traits permit success at various stages of the invasion process indicates whether it is native, non-native, or species with particular traits that are likely to move through the city and establish in the desert.    In a related case study conducted in Victoria, Australia, transportation professionals and ecologists were surveyed regarding preferences for roadside landscape design. Roadside design and maintenance projects are typically influenced by different groups of transportation professionals at various stages in a linear project cycle. Landscape architects and design professionals have distinct preferences and priorities compared to other transportation professionals and trained ecologists. The case study reveals the need for collaboration throughout the stages of design, construction and maintenance in order to efficiently manage roadsides for multiple priorities.

T1  - An integrated assessment of disturbed plant communities near the future Mackenzie Valley pipeline route, Northwest Territories, Canada
AN  - 749232810
AB  - The impact of natural resource extraction, and subsequent transportation to market, is hypothesized to have consequences on the plant community structure of the western Canadian Arctic. The Mackenzie Valley gas pipeline project will create new transportation and disturbance corridors and it is expected that this will facilitate the movement of introduced species northward. As a part of the IPY-GAPS project, an assessment of plant community composition among different types of disturbance was conducted within the vicinity of four communities in the Northwest Territories (Fort Simpson, Fort Good Hope, Norman Wells, and Inuvik) from June – August 2008. Results indicate that the prevalence of introduced species was significantly higher in close proximity to roads, urban centres, and existing pipelines. These disturbance types had greater richness and cover of introduced species than seismic lines. The highest proportion of introduced species was found in Fort Simpson, especially along transportation corridors. The percent cover and occurrence of introduced species were found to be significantly higher along transects within 1-5 m from these roads compared to 10-20 m away. A community consultation survey was also completed on the perceptions of community members held toward the idea of invasive alien species (IAS), their willingness to participate in monitoring programs for IAS, and what role they wanted the government to play in monitoring IAS. The results of the survey suggested that people were willing to report the presence of an IAS, but would not use a website to submit that information. Furthermore, the concept of using an incentive to gather support and increase participation in a monitoring program was seen as unnecessary due to the participants' inherent connection to the land. The results of these studies suggest that future expansion of disturbances, such as roads, pipelines, and enlarged urban areas may increase the prevalence and number of introduced species within northern communities and that managing these impacts will require the development of a community based action plan geared towards the social and cultural background of each affected community.

T1  - Factors affecting the diversity and abundance of roadside invertebrates and plants in urban areas
AN  - 1779539129
AB  - With increasing human populations and a rise in people migrating to urban areas there will be a corresponding rise in urbanisation across the globe. Urban green spaces are therefore becoming increasingly important for biodiversity as reserves and movement corridors. This thesis aimed to understand the impacts of traffic and environmental related factors on the ability of green space to be wildlife reserves using the town of Bracknell, Berkshire, UK, as a model urban area. Concentrations of NO2 declined with distance from the road but urban green spaces showed many exceedances of NO2 and NOx critical levels. There were decreases in soil moisture and total C and N at the road edge but increases in soil pH, C:N, titanium, chromium, nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium and lead. Some protection of urban green spaces from the road could be achieved with the use of tree shelterbelts. It was found that roads had a significant affect on plant communities; with more bare ground, moss, herbs and stress-tolerator species and less grass and competitive species near to the road edge. These changes are related to differences in the environmental conditions at the roadside. Carabid species richness, abundance and diversity and invertebrate abundance and plant diversity were all higher at the road edge than the site centres, indicating that these groups are able to take advantage of the road edge habitat. Overall, sites with decreased mowing had more invertebrates and the bioindicators carabids and woodlice. Reducing mowing frequency therefore provides a simple method to improve urban green spaces for biodiversity. Furthermore, older and larger sites had greater biodiversity. This thesis has demonstrated that environmental and traffic related factors have significant effects on urban biodiversity. There are methods which could be employed, however, to lessen these impacts to allow urban green space to act as effective wildlife reserves.

T1  - Alien and native plants of urban river corridors: a study of riparian plant propagule dynamics along the river brent, greater london
AN  - 1771283703
AB  - This thesis investigates the dynamics of alien and native plant propagules in relation to the standing vegetation of the urban riparian corridor of the River Brent, London and also experimental results regarding the effectiveness of physical management of Impatiens glandulifera, one of the most common riparian alien invasive species in the United Kingdom. The study has shown that viable plant propagules are well-distributed within the top 10 cm of urban riparian soils, with no significant difference in propagule abundance or species richness between 0-5 and 5-10 cm layers or with distance (0-1, 1-2, 2-3 m) from the low flow channel. Urban riparian propagule banks are as species rich as those in more rural situations, but they contain a greater proportion of alien species (>20%). Soil propagule abundance was greater in the autumn than in the spring but species richness varied little. The propagule bank species composition varied seasonally, more unique alien species being recorded in the spring than in the autumn. Using artificial turf traps placed within the riparian zone, the deposition of fluvial sediment and viable propagules was investigated. Significant correlations between sediment weight and propagule abundance and richness indicated the important role of hydrochory in delivering viable propagules to the riparian zone, particularly during winter. Lower sediment weight and propagule species richness of summer samples and weaker correlation between sediment weight and propagule abundance and richness indicated the importance of local seed-rain in summer. Comparison of species composition of the propagule bank and standing vegetation demonstrated little relationship between the two, with far greater abundance of alien species in the propagule bank, the majority of which were not found in the local vegetation. The propagule bank also contained more species with long-lived persistent seeds, than was observed in the standing vegetation. Impatiens glandulifera was the most frequently occurring species in the standing vegetation, while Buddleja davidii was the most frequently occurring species in the propagule bank. Investigating experimental plots, the study found a strong negative relationship between percent cover of Impatiens glandulifera and of other species. Experimental pruning and removal of Impatiens glandulifera at six-week intervals over two years had a marked positive effect upon vegetation species richness and the percent cover of other species, particularly on heavily invaded plots, with removal showing a stronger effect than pruning

T1  - Butterfly conservation in fragmented landscapes
AN  - 304962999
AB  - Human activities disturb and fragment many natural areas, thereby altering the way in which species interact with their landscape. In natural settings, species often evolved to disperse through areas unsuitable for habitation, but in a world dominated by human-modified landscapes, species face novel features that may disrupt their movement, increasing the isolation of populations. Consequently, there is a pressing need to understand if animals can persist in small natural areas separated by agricultural or urban development. The way in which species respond to fragmentation will inform if conservation actions are necessary to protect a species and what strategies might mitigate the consequences of fragmentation. My dissertation addresses these conservation problems using two studies of butterflies in fragmented landscapes.    First, I used a novel synthesis of behavioral, mark-recapture, and population genetic studies to identify the effects of urban fragmentation on a rare butterfly. I present the synthesis in the context of a butterfly endemic to barrier islands in North Carolina, Atrytonopsis new species 1. Atrytonopsis  sp1 occupies sand dune habitat, which in this region has largely been converted to residential and commercial development. Many studies rely on a single method to measure movement, but combining methods may help elucidate the effects of natural or anthropogenic fragmentation. To test edge permeability, I conducted butterfly releases at four edge types: sand dune - beach, sand dune - maritime forest/shrub, sand dune - urbanization, and beach - ocean. I then used mark-recapture to compare Atrytonopsis sp1 movement rates in continuous sand dune habitat and between habitat patches separated by urban areas. Finally, I conducted a range-wide population genetic study to assess if there was significant population structure across the range of  Atrytonopsis sp1, and to determine how the structure was partitioned relative to natural barriers and urbanization. All three studies independently indicate that natural features, not urbanization, are barriers to Atrytonopsis sp1 movement. Analyzed separately, each study would point to the same general conclusion, but could result in different conservation recommendations. Both linear corridors and stepping-stones are conservation strategies that can increase connectivity of fragmented landscapes. For stepping stones to work, however, Atrytonopsis sp1 must be willing to enter the matrix, successfully find new habitat, and integrate its genes into the new population. The edge behavior studies indicate that  Atrytonopsis sp1 will fly into urban areas, and the mark-recapture studies confirm that it can successfully disperse over short distances. The population genetic studies indicate that longer distances of urbanization are not intrinsically barriers to movement. Consequently, I recommend conservation strategies that focus on preserving stepping stones, rather than on habitat corridors.    In a separate study, I examined the effects of habitat fragmentation on tropical butterfly communities. Habitat fragmentation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, but its effects may be obscured by the ways in which different species respond to fragmentation. One reason that species display varying responses to fragmentation may be that variability itself is an effect of fragmentation. I tested whether forest fragmentation causes long-term hyperdynamism in butterfly communities, a taxon that naturally displays large variations in species richness and community composition. Using an 11-year dataset from an experimentally fragmented landscape in the central Amazon, I evaluated the effect of fragmentation on changes in species richness and community composition through time. Butterfly species richness did not differ between fragmented forest and intact forest. However, spatial and temporal patterns of butterfly species richness in fragmented forests were significantly more variable than in intact forest. Fragmented forest had a significantly lower proportion of understory shade species and a significantly higher proportion of edge species. I conclude that fragmentation fundamentally alters the natural dynamics of butterfly communities.

T1  - Matrix effects on individual and community-level responses of birds to forest fragmentation in Jamaica
AN  - 304921903
AB  - Land cover between habitat patches (“matrix”) can impact species persistence in fragmented landscapes by altering resource availability, edge effects, or inter-patch movement. This thesis examines how the matrix affects the Neotropical bird community in central Jamaica in landscapes where forest is embedded in three human-dominated matrix types (agriculture, peri-urban development, and bauxite mining) and one natural “matrix” (continuous forest).    First, I examine whether richness, community composition, and abundances of resident birds differ in ∼ 100 forest patches within the four matrix types, and relate species responses to traits influencing dispersal, resource acquisition, and/or population growth. Agricultural landscapes were found to retain avian diversity and community assemblages most similar to intact forest relative to peri-urban and bauxite landscapes. Traits related to resource acquisition best predicted species responses, indicating that resource limitation driven by the matrix may be a primary factor driving bird responses to fragmentation.    Next, I determine the relative influence of patch area, isolation, vegetation structure, and matrix type on the occupancy dynamics of resident insectivorous birds. Within-patch vegetation and matrix type were the most important determinants of colonization and extinction, but the effects of patch area, isolation, and vegetation on occupancy dynamics were matrix- and species-dependent. Across the community, the matrix influenced extinction probabilities more than colonization, indicating that extinction processes likely drive population dynamics.    Finally, I examine the relative permeability of peri-urban, bauxite, and forested landscapes on the movement of the migrant American Redstart ( Setophaga ruticilla) and the resident Jamaican Tody (Todus todus) by experimentally translocating > 140 birds 0.6–4 km from their territories across landscape treatments. Redstarts returned with greater success and faster speed than Todies. Return success was not impacted by landscape treatment, but both species returned more rapidly in forest relative to bauxite matrix, with return times intermediate in a peri-urban matrix. These findings indicate that bird mobility in fragmented landscapes is mediated by the landscape matrix.    This research is among few empirical studies to discern the impacts of different matrix types on species patterns and processes. These results inform theory on fragmentation as well as bird conservation in an understudied system.

T1  - Environmental granularity, rivers and climate history as shaping factors for species' distribution and diversity patterns
AN  - 304916460
AB  - Several mechanisms are involved in shaping species' distributions, such as abiotic parameters of climate and substrate; biotic interactions with competitors, predators, and mutualists; and geographic considerations that constrain dispersal. Janzen, in 1967, proposed that mountain passes are effectively higher in the Tropics than in temperate areas in terms of their effectiveness in limiting dispersal, creating greater opportunity for isolation of populations, and differentiation into new species. Here, I analyze quantitatively predictions derived from Janzen's theory via 1000 virtual species across South America covering all major environments on the continent, taking into account effects of environmental contiguity and connectivity, effects of seasonality, and presence of known biogeographic barriers (rivers, principally). Virtual species' distributions were obtained by calculating Euclidean distances in ecological space to 1000 seed points, and applying different thresholds of ecological similarity within which the species is allowed to disperse into adjacent pixels. Distributional areas were measured taking into account only mean environmental similarity across the year, and considering the effects of seasonality and known geographic barriers. The results illuminate the situation: distributional areas are smaller in temperate areas when only mean similarity is considered (contra Janzen), but the pattern reverses when seasonality and barriers are considered, confirming and clarifying Janzen's ideas regarding generation of greater biological diversity in tropical areas as compared with temperate areas.    Keywords: landscape subdivision, species' distributions, biogeography, virtual species

T1  - Spatial movements and ecology of mountain lions in southern Arizona
AN  - 304826958
AB  - Managing wildlife in urban areas is increasingly necessary for wildlife conservation. Large carnivores like mountain lions ( Puma concolor) present a particular challenge to managers because of public safety and the polarizing emotional reactions to human-lion encounters. Intensive development and conversion of large open spaces to small properties and subdivisions has caused increased habitat loss, fragmentation and encroachment. Preserving movement corridors for access to habitat patches is important in maintaining landscape connectivity to ensure viable populations adjacent to urban areas. Because mountain lion habitat is often adjacent to urbanization in Arizona and lions traverse large landscapes, mountain lions are ideal models to examine how human alteration of habitats influences their life history characteristics and ability to adapt to a variety of environments. The objective of this study was to examine the ecology and spatial movements of mountain lions surrounding urban areas. We studied habitat selection, urban use by mountain lions, spatial movements and overlap, genetic relatedness, feline disease, and ectoparasites of mountain lions in southern Arizona.

T1  - <b>Arthropods in Linear Elements</b> : Occurence, Behaviour and Conservation Management
AN  - 2564454577
AB  - Intensification of agriculture and urbanisation have caused large‐scale destruction and fragmentation of natural and semi‐natural areas in the Netherlands, with a considerable loss of biodiversity. As a consequence, the conservation of the biodiversity in the remaining small landscape elements has become increasingly urgent. This thesis presents the results of our study of arthropods in (mainly) roadside verges. The diversity of species proved to be considerable, with several rare and threatened, as well as many specialised species. These arthropod assemblages should be taken into account during the management of roadside verges. Our research aimed at a better understanding of the distribution and ecology of these species, which enables us to recommend appropriate measures for their conservation. Roadside verges are often covered by grassland vegetation and need to be mown in order to retain a high biodiversity. We studied ground beetles, weevils, ants and epigeic spiders in experimental plots with five different mowing regimes: no mowing; mowing once a year in autumn with or without removal of the cuttings; mowing twice a year, in early summer and autumn, with and without removal of the cuttings. Plots were located on three different verges which represented a plant productivity gradient, ranging from low‐productive, through medium‐productive to high‐productive grassland. The different mowing regimes had hardly any effect on the biodiversity at the low‐productive site, whereas at the medium‐productive and high‐productive sites, mowing twice a year with removal of the cuttings resulted in the highest arthropod species‐richness and abundance. A second experiment carried out on the medium‐productive verge showed that mowing twice a year with removal of the cuttings also gave the highest values for flower richness, flower diversity and abundance of flower‐visiting insects. Therefore such verges also had the highest number of visits to flowers by insects. On low‐productive verges, yearly mowing is not necessary. However, to ensure a high diversity of arthropods on medium‐productive to high‐ productive grassland verges, a regime of mowing twice a year with removal of cuttings is recommended for the largest part of the verge. Small patches of vegetation should be left intact to provide a refuge for arthropods in the period just after mowing when their resources are otherwise almost absent. This type of rotational management will probably improve their chance of survival.  Sandy verges can be important to xerophilic and thermophilic arthropods. These species are in decline due to the fragmentation and decreasing quality of heathland nature reserves. In the past, habitats for these species were numerous in the roadside verges in the Veluwe area. However, now vegetation succession is causing them to disappear and restoration management is urgently needed. We sampled arthropods in patches of grey hair‐grass (Corynephorus canescens) vegetation on the verges, and found that there were fewer stenotopic ground beetles and spiders than in similar vegetation patches in nature reserves. This seems attributable to differences in ‘habitat quality’, namely a denser cover of grass in the verges, as well as more herbaceous plants and tree seedlings. Moreover, any suitable vegetation patches are smaller. In addition, we sampled ground‐dwelling and flying ground beetles in open sandy roadside verges and newly‐created linear forest clearings. The occurrence of teneral individuals and flightless species indicate that verges may function as ‘habitat corridors’. In the forest clearings, teneral individuals were rare, but flying beetles were very abundant: more than twice as many individuals were caught here than in nature reserves and on roadside verges. This indicates that the clearings are used particularly by dispersing ground beetles, and thus function mainly as ‘movement corridors’. To make conditions more suitable for xerophilic and thermophilic species in roadside verges, we recommend restoring nutrient‐poor zones and recreating pioneer conditions. Subsequently, a regular management of selectively removing encroaching vegetation should be installed. If this is done over large distances, roadside verges can act as habitat corridors. Linear clearings in forests, situated between separate heathland habitat areas can help species bridge short distances between them. In this way, ecological networks can be created in highly fragmented heathland landscapes. Being relatively straight and narrow, roadside verges have an enormous distance of edge biotopes. We therefore studied edge effects on insect species to obtain more insight into how a verge functions as a habitat. We looked at the effects of the border between the vegetation and asphalt of the road on the direction of movement of two ground beetle species. The road appeared to be a barrier for these species and its presence caused movement patterns parallel to the asphalt. In another study, the number of flying ground beetles increased in linear forest clearings, probably because they are directed by forest edges when dispersing. Both studies provide extra evidence that roadside verges may act as ecological corridors. In addition, we found that flying ants used forest edges to find each other for mating, while their nests were located elsewhere. All these results indicate a substantial effect of edges on insect behaviour and their occurrence. This knowledge can be applied in conservation management. Roadside verges are distinctive biotopes with anthropogenic disturbances and edge effects that may negatively influence arthropods. However, as roads are an inherent, inevitable part of the densely populated Netherlands landscape, we choose here to emphasise the positive aspects of these linear habitats. Our investigations show that arthropod communities of high conservation interest occur in roadside verges, that verges can be used to create ecological networks, that abrupt biotope edges in verges act as a guide for dispersing insects and are sometimes favoured as a mating site, and that a regular applied mowing scheme provides valuable conditions for arthropods of hay‐meadows.

T1  - Ecological network planning method and case study : a case study in chongming island, china
AN  - 1874934600
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorAlong with the process of urbanization, the development of natural and the reconstruction strengthen the changes in the city pattern. Habitat fragmentation and habitat loss are widely recognized as major threats to biodiversity & extinction on a global scale. The main reason is it may cause the reduction of the number of species and mortality and reduce species possibility of reproduction in other habitat. As a result of fragmentation, landscape plaques become smaller and smaller, more isolated and boundary, more or less is surrounded by unfavorable matrix. Through the ecological corridor to connect the habitat island, especially larger habitat, can reduce even eliminate the landscape fragmentation impacts on biodiversity. So constructing ecological networks and connecting the patches of spatial distribution is the effective way to protect wildlife. Existing ecology network planning methods more attention of nodes, connection and plants, these methods in solving problems in a single problem are very useful. However, these methods are less likely to find a regional scale of ecological network planning method. In this paper, integrated the research advanced experience both at home and abroad to put forward a comprehensive ecological network planning method. The major steps for ecological networks construction discussed in this paper are: (1) habitat resources assessment; (2) wildlife assessment; (3) Node chooses; (4) network analysis; (5) cost analysis; (6) least-cost analysis. The construction of ecological networks is discussed in this paper mainly adopts the method of gravity model, the resistance model and least cost model.(1) In the gravity model by the method of evaluating the gravitational attraction of each node degree solved the problems of the importance of the corridor and which nodes are connected. (2) In the resistance model through analysis of the actual path through the landscape in each land use to determine each landuse's resistance value, resolve the problem of the relative resistance it is difficulted to determine. (3) At the least cost model the first two model analysis results is used to find a minimum cost between the nodes, resolve the spatial location of the corridor it is difficult to determine and reduce the problem of building cost. The advantages of this method is (1) gives the quantitative method of selecting the node; (2) gives the quantitative method of assessment importance of the corridor;(3) gives the quantitative method of assessment importance of the network connectivity; (4) gives the quantitative method of Corridor construction; (5) maximize the use of existing green space, wetlands resources,which can lower construction costs. Based on this method, this paper chooses Chongming Island as the case study. Chongming Island located in the northeast of Shanghai, water clean and flat and with a good ecological environment. The eastern part of the beach is the red-crowned cranes, swans and other rare habitats of migratory birds. Chongming Island, the geographical environment is very suitable for plant growth, but also there have been many large wild animals, however, since the last half century, as population growth, urban construction, and gradually changed the structure of natural ecosystems, landscape fragmentation serious. The main habitat types in Chongming Island including urban, agricultural land, plantation land, wetlands. Large-scale green patch mainly located in the eastern, western and Dongping National Forest Park. These habitats uneven distributed, separated by matrix between the green patch. The lack of contact is not conducive to the proliferation and the protection of animals. Therefore, this paper chooses two kinds of resource: Woodland and wetland, to construct ecological network system with different form corridor. The research result indicates that this method is effective. For the ecological and strategic resources can be fully utilize, more than 50% of the green corridor in the planning is existing resources, construction cost is low feasible, the cost of the construction is low and feasible. The innovation of this article is:(1) extract the advantages of Gravity model, Resistance model, Least cost model and uantify the ecological networks construction Methods;(2)With GIS, given the spatial location of corridor; (3)Maximize use of existing green space, wetland resources, to reduce the cost of building. The inadequacies of this paper is the only goal is to protect the animals. The future combination of cultural, aesthetic, human demand for open space to study the network

T1  - The persistence of prairie dogs within urban habitat islands in the Colorado Front Range
AN  - 304861499
AB  - I investigated the ecology of black-tailed prairie dogs in fragmented urban habitat in the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area. My study area consisted of 387 habitat fragments, 54 of which were colonized by prairie dogs. These fragments were highly isolated and surrounded by roads and development, and my studies represent the first studies of prairie dogs in highly urban environments.    I evaluate the interactions between urban prairie dogs and vegetation and find that prairie dogs in urban areas tend to be present on sites with high grass coverage, though the grass layer is reduced in the immediate vicinity of the colonies. Prairie dogs interact with vegetation similarly in urban areas and natural habitat, providing evidence that the ecological role of prairie dogs as keystone species may be partly retained in human-dominated landscapes.    I provide the first study using mark-resight methodology to evaluate the local population density of prairie dogs, and find it more accurate than traditional methods of burrow counts or visual indices. I observed extremely high densities for prairie dogs in urban settings, probably because of a fence effect where animals are restricted to available habitat due to the difficulty of dispersal in an urban environment.    I compare connectivity metrics to determine which have the best predictive power for the occurrence of colonies in this area, and find that complex methods incorporating area of patches and cost-weighted distance surfaces perform best. In general, inclusion of biological information improves the ability of metrics to predict wildlife distribution. This study provides a rare opportunity to compare the performance of connectivity metrics using empirical data on wildlife distribution and will be of benefit to future spatial and landscape analyses.    Finally, I evaluate a series of landscape and local variables to determine which have the most importance to the distribution of prairie dogs across our study system. Fragment area and local variables such as litter coverage have the most explanatory power, but all tested metrics had importance to prairie dog occurrence. My results can be used to target potential habitat for prairie dog conservation and to inform future research on wildlife in urban areas.

T1  - Relationships between spatial configuration of tropical forest patches and diversity of woody plants and soil millipedes in northeastern Puerto Rico
AN  - 304984667
AB  - A primary goal of landscape ecology is to reveal the relationships between ecological processes and landscape patterns. Landscape patterns may control the ecological processes that shape species diversity and composition. However, there are few studies about how the species diversity of plants and soil millipedes vary with different parameters of landscape structure, especially in tropical habitats. Moreover, there is very little information about the effects of landscape variables on soil biota, such as millipedes, and the relationships between millipede diversity and plant diversity is poorly known, even though millipedes play an essential role in litter decomposition and plant nutrient cycling. Woody plants and soil millipedes were sampled systematically from 12 forest patches (24-34 years old), surrounded by a matrix of mixed urban use and pasture, in northeastern Puerto Rico. Patch spatial characteristics were obtained from aerial color photographs from year 2000 that were digitized into a GIS package. Woody plant species diversity and composition were related mostly to the forest patch attributes such as area and shape, while soil millipede species diversity and composition were related to the forest patch surroundings (e.g. vegetation corridors, patch isolation, and amount of forest in the matrix). Thus, soil millipede and plant species diversity and composition responded to different aspects of the landscape structure, probably due to their different operational scales (e.g. mode of dispersal, habitat discrimination). The species composition of both groups of organisms correlated with the distance to the Luquillo Experimental Forest, and there was more similarity in woody plant and millipede species composition among more closely spaced forest patches. A linear regression analysis showed that there was no correlation between species diversity of woody plants and soil millipedes in each forest patch. There was also no relationship between the species composition of woody plants and soil millipedes in a patch; indicating that soil millipedes are not specialist feeders on woody plant leaf litter. These findings show the importance of considering spatial relationships on a landscape scale when developing biodiversity theories and for the conservation and management of species diversity as well as land use planning, especially in areas of urban development.

T1  - The ecological factors governing the persistence of butterflies in urban areas.
AN  - 301643733
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that availability of high quality habitat rather than habitat connectivity or species mobility was the limiting factor in the distribution of grassland butterflies, but were mostly undertaken on specialist species in rural areas.  Consequently, this project tests the hypothesis that the quality of available habitat is more important that patch size or connectivity to the persistence of four grassland butterfly species in the West Midlands conurbation.
  Two of the study species are widespread (Polyommatus icarus and Coenonympha pamphilus) whilst two have a more restricted distribution (Erynnis tages and Callophrys rubi).  However, unlike species with very specific requirements, all are polyphagous and can tolerate a wide range of conditions, making habitat quality different to quantify.  Several means of assessing habitat quality were developed and tested.  A detailed vegetation quadrant sampling method had the best predictive abilities for patch occupancy and summarised the habitat preferences within the urban context.  A model based upon habitat quality and connectivity was devised, with the ability to rank each patch according to potential suitability for each species.
  For all four species, habitat quality accounted significantly for the greatest variance in distribution.  Connectivity had only a small effect whilst patch area had almost none.  This suggests that conservation efforts should be centred upon preserving and improving habitat quality.

T1  - A Modeling Approach to Wildlife Corridor Creation: An Assessment Using ArcGIS and the San Joaquin Kit Fox in San Luis Obispo County, California, USA Project
AN  - 2691814117
AB  - This study is a presentation of a corridor methodology and a proposed wildlife corridor between the Carrizo Plain and Camp Roberts in San Luis Obispo County, California, USA, using the federally and state listed San Joaquin Kit Fox as an umbrella species for corridor delineation. Since the Kit Fox has such a wide range, it is thought that many other federally and state listed species will be protected. Historic evidence has shown Kit Fox migration between these two core habitat areas. To keep the areas from becoming isolated patches of habitat, which inhibits genetic diversity and ultimately species survival, a corridor was proposed. ArcGIS was utilized to assess the viability and location of a potential wildlife corridor. Functions such as weighted overlays and neighborhoods were used to score and therefore indicate the best habitat area, the location of the corridor, highest development pressure areas, and priority sites for conservation. Further, a discussion on conservation tools is included to set up a “toolbox" for protecting the corridor.Using the two ArcGIS algebraic functions, a corridor location in the eastern portion of the County was identified, which splits in two and reconstitutes in the northern part of the county. Upon corridor identification, development pressure was analyzed by the use of a weighted overlay and revealed high development pressure along the route 46 highway, which bisects the proposed wildlife corridor. Priority areas were determined by overlaying habitat values with development pressure values to determine the best habitat areas under the greatest development pressure. Those areas within the identified corridor under the highest development pressure were considered high priority sites. Conclusions were that antiquated subdivisions located directly in the path of the corridor need further study to determine their ultimate effect on the corridor; 46 highway is a high development area and those areas of the corridor which are crossed by 46 are in need of immediate attention for conservation; ground-truthing needs to be done to verify findings; and that a combination of conservation tools will be needed to effectively protect the wildlife corridor identified.

T1  - Ecological resilience in urban ecosystems: Linking urban patterns to human and ecological functions
AN  - 758398490
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Collaborative Landscape-Scale Ecological Research: Emerging Trends in Urban and Regional Ecology              Urban ecosystems evolve over time and space as the outcome of dynamic interactions between socio-economic and biophysical processes operating over multiple scales. The ecological resilience of urban ecosystems--the degree to which they tolerate alteration before reorganizing around a new set of structures and processes--is influenced by these interactions. In cities and urbanizing areas fragmentation of natural habitats, simplification and homogenization of species composition, disruption of hydrological systems, and alteration of energy flow and nutrient cycling reduce cross-scale resilience, leaving systems increasingly vulnerable to shifts in system control and structure. Because varied urban development patterns affect the amount and interspersion of built and natural land cover, as well as the human demands on ecosystems differently, we argue that alternative urban patterns (i.e., urban form, land use distribution, and connectivity) generate varied effects on ecosystem dynamics and their ecological resilience. We build on urban economics, landscape ecology, population dynamics, and complex system science to propose a conceptual model and a set of hypotheses that explicitly link urban pattern to human and ecosystem functions in urban ecosystems. Drawing on preliminary results from an empirical study of the relationships between urban pattern and bird and aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity in the Puget Sound region, we propose that resilience in urban ecosystems is a function of the patterns of human activities and natural habitats that control and are controlled by both socio-economic and biophysical processes operating at various scales. We discuss the implications of this conceptual model for urban planning and design.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Landscape ecological analysis and assessment in an urbanising environment: Forest birds as biodiversity indicators
AN  - 305053489
AB  - To achieve a sustainable development, impacts on biodiversity of urbanisation, infrastructure, land use changes and other developments must be considered on a landscape and regional scale. Landscape ecology can provide a conceptual framework for the assessment of consequences of long-term development processes like urbanisation on biodiversity on a landscape scale, and for evaluating the impacts of alternative planning scenarios. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of habitat quality, quantity and connectivity on forest bird diversity in an urban-rural gradient. The purpose of the analyses was to develop knowledge and methods for integrating biodiversity issues in planning and assessments in an urbanising environment, on landscape and regional scales.    The study area was situated in and around Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, covering the city centre, suburbs and peri-urban areas. Data on breeding forest birds were collected through bird censuses in an urban-suburban gradient. In order to embrace also the peri-urban areas for a more complete urban-rural gradient, data on two fragmentation-sensitive forest grouse species were obtained through a questionnaire to hunters in the whole study area. Response variables in the analyses were forest bird species richness and diversity, relative species richness and occurrence of single sensitive species like selected sedentary forest birds, including the forest grouse species, and red list species. Habitat quality, quantity and connectivity were analysed using available data on abiotic conditions, including urban disturbances, and vegetation in geographical information systems. In addition, a field study on vegetation structure and composition was performed in a subset of the smaller sample sites. Relationships between the response variables and habitat quality, quantity and connectivity were explored using multivariate statistics. Further, for some models, spatial dependencies were quantified and accounted for. When habitat models were retrieved, they were used for spatial predictions of habitat suitability. They were also applied on future planning scenarios in order to predict and assess the impacts on sensitive species.    In the urban-rural gradient, the forest structure and composition changed, so that in more urban areas, coniferous forest on rich soils, wet forests and wetlands became less abundant and more scattered.

T1  - Botanical processes in urban derelict spaces
AN  - 1774248530
AB  - This thesis set out to investigate the processes that determine the richness and composition of plant communities on derelict land in the West Midlands. Experimental work included vegetation surveys, soil seed bank investigation, field mapping and seed rain trapping methods. Interpretation of the data involved a range of approaches including vegetation classification and ordination, comparative analysis of plant functional attributes and the development of regression models incorporating landscape and habitat variables. Derelict habitats were identified as holding a diverse array of communities at the early stages of succession which are poorly represented by current vegetation classifications, functional diversity is however much lower in pioneer communities. The majority of these species employing the expected strategies of early succession notably high reproductive capacity and seeds which are small, highly dispersive and form persistent seed banks. Dense seed banks were typically formed on sites and were dominated by a small set of consistently occurring species. Changes in seed bank density and composition were consistent with time represented both by the chronosequence of sites and increasing soil depth. Little evidence was found to suggest that diversity or species composition is linked to site connectivity related to either patch density or the presence of linear features. These findings have considerable implications for application of principles of metapopulation and island biogeography principles to urban conservation. In particular the trend for planners to designate urban wildlife corridors is questioned as being probably of no benefit to native diversity and indeed these features are identified as being instead potentially significant pathways for invasive alien species. The most important factors influencing the composition of sites were seen to be those linked closely with past and present human activity. Particularly significant are the nature of dereliction substrates and haphazard disturbances such as fire and tipping which influence vegetation succession temporally and spatially.

T1  - Impacts of land use on the riparian forest along the Assiniboine River
AN  - 305495876
AB  - Extensive landscape modification from surrounding land use has led to the decline of riparian forests across North America. An urban-rural gradient was used to assess the impact of land use on riparian forests along the Assiniboine River. Above ground flora and seed bank were examined and species- and guild-level indicators of disturbance identified. Twenty-five sites were categorized according to land use, and included urban, suburban, high intensity rural, low intensity rural, and relatively high quality reference forests. Changes in herbaceous, shrub, and tree species composition and diversity were related to landscape level measures of disturbance that included the proportion of surrounding land use, forest patch size, connectivity, and area:perimeter ratio.    These results suggest that landscape measures of disturbance, and related changes in environment, may be confidently used to assess the impacts of land use along urban-rural gradients. Opportunistic and vulnerable species, and their associated guilds can be used as effective indicators of disturbance and forest integrity and be used to select and monitor forests for further protection or active management.

T1  - Biodiversity and population persistence of carabid beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) in fragmented urban habitats.. (BL: DXN068471)
AN  - 301551548
AB  - Carabid surveys were first conducted at a wide range of sites.  Three habitats were then selected for further study (derelict sites, wetlands and woodlands), representing a spectrum of disturbed to more stable habitats.  Sites were located across the rural-urban gradient, and at varying distances from potential corridors.  At each site carabids were sampled using pitfall and hand search, and various measures of the habitat and surrounding landscape structure were taken.  A study of the genetics of two species from urban woodlands was also conducted. 
  The findings indicate that urban derelict and wetland habitats are particularly important for carabid conservation at the local scale, containing rich assemblages and some nationally scarce species.  Grasslands, which dominate urban green space, are relatively depauperate.
  A clear urbanisation effect was observed in woodlands and, to a lesser extent, in urban wetlands.  This was typified by a decline in the representation of large-bodied non-flying species and stenotopic wetland species, and an increase in more eurytopic species.  No effect was observed at derelict sites.  However, the main factors affecting the assemblages related to differences in habitat.  Derelict and wetland assemblages  were strongly related to the vegetation, and woodland assemblages to the degree of site disturbance.  The great majority of carabid species are not affected by the degree of habitat fragmentation in the city, showing no benefits from wildlife corridors.  The few that were sensitive tend to be large-bodied non-flying species, most of which are generalists.
  These findings have considerable implications for the application metapopulation and island biogeography theories to urban conservation.  Other findings provide important insights on how site selection and management of urban habitat fragments can be optimised to maximise the number and interest of carabid species finding refuge in cities.

T1  - Ecological studies of the green space in xiaolan toww,zhongshan city
TT  - 中山市小榄镇城镇绿地生态研究：绿地调查、评价与规划
AN  - 1024944086
AB  - This thesis studies the composition of planting species, function and distribution of green space in Xiaolan Town, Zhongshan City. The eco-system of Xiaolan green land is planned by applying relative theories of urban ecology and landscape ecology.Xiaolan Town covers a large variety of garden plants including 105 families and 433 species. Public green land per capita is 5.02m2, and the coverage of greening 33.3%. In the urban area, there are 4 parks occupying 27.6 hm2, which are completely equipped with entertainment facilities and several plots of street green space of 4.35hm2. Street greening begins to take shape. The new urban areas are densely dotted with green trees, which consist of arbors, shrubs and grass. However, the street of the old urban area is narrow and its greenery is simply composed of single layer arbors. The new urban area, Jinju Garden, whose green land accounts for over 30% of the area, possesses central garden and courtyard green belt while the old urban area, Xinyong Road residential area, is densely populated and is crowded with houses with hardly any green land. Some green belts attached to units such as Today Group, Guli Corporation, Yongda Company, Xiaolan Middle School and the local government are well done with greening. Conversely, some schools and factories attach little importance to greening and even have no green land. The nursery in this town covering 8000 hm2 is one of the biggest bases for flower culturing in China, and seedlings are sold all over the country. In general, garden plants in Xiaolan town are abundant and varied, most of which are nursery and flower farmland. Varieties and richness of plants in parks are ranked the second. In contrast, there are much fewer street trees. Efflorescent arbors are widely cultivated in parks, having strong decorating effects. In addition, flowering shrubberies and colorful shrubberies are also effectively planted in parks and streets. Nevertheless, perpendicular greening is seldom used, and species of lianas need to be further researched into.As far as the aesthetic function is concerned, People's Park and Longshan Park are rich in landscape types with great aesthetic effects. The street in old urban areas is narrow with busy traffic with the concentration of CO2 relatively higher, 323.1ppm, while the street in new urban areas is wide with light traffic so that CO2 concentration is lower, only 312.0ppm. As far as concentration of air negative-ion and bacteria are concerned, there is no significant difference between new and old urban areas. On the average, air negative-ion is 224/cm3, the amount of bacteria 2453/m3 and Ci 0.17. Air is slightly polluted.At the bus station, the negative-ion is as low as 92/cm3 and Ci 0.03, which is below 0.09. The amount of bacteria is 2461/m3 and air is seriously polluted.On an average, in the urban area of Xiaolai town the concentration of CO2 amount of bacteria is 1784/m3, air negative-ion 1057/cm3 and air quality index (Ci) 1.12. The environmental air is the cleanest and of good quality in the whole town. As to the ecological function, there are abundant and various garden plants in parks and streets, while relatively fewer and monotonous in schools, residential areas and green land attached to some units. In a word, the coverage rate of green land is low in Xiaolan Town, and the present distribution of green space is out of proportion. According to the climate conditions of Xiaolan town, with the road planning and the urban planning considered, the eco-system of Xiaolan green land is planned to be a pattern of Ring-Net Type, One Line, One Center, One Belt and Two Loops by applying relative theories of urban ecology and landscaping ecology and sticking to the principle of priority to ecology. A linear corridor of Shengping East-Xingning Road is to be constructed from northeast to southwest oblique direction. In the meantime, the urban central park, with the Gym Center centered, is to be built. Moreover, the river green belt is to be expanded along the long dike, the eastern dike and the southern dike. The outside and inside green ring belts are also to be reconstructed. Finally, a suburb ecological shelter belt , which will be connected with the nursery culturing base in the south of the town and developed into a net of southeastern ecological shelter belt in Xiaolan town, is to be built at the windward direction of the town, which is situated at the south of Dongsheng street. The eco-system of the ring-net green space is relatively stable, which makes the serials of landscapes continuous and accessible, thus, Xiaolan town is to be surrounded with green and the ecological environment will be excellent. In accordance with the present distribution of green space and urban planning in this town, some measures have been proposed, which can increase green land areas and percentage of green coverage, and make green land areas bring about maximum ecological benefit as well.Alternate abstract:本文主要研究了中山市小榄镇城镇绿地的植物种类组成、绿地的功能及分布。运用城市生态学与景观生态学相结合的方法，对小榄镇城镇绿地做出规划。中山市小榄镇城镇绿地有植物105科433种，植物种类丰富。人均公共绿地面积为5.02m2，绿化覆盖率为33.3％。建成区有公园4个，游憩设施齐全，占地27.6hm2。街头绿地多处，占地4.35 hm2。道路绿化初具规模，新城区道路绿树成荫，为乔、灌、草复合结构，景观效果优美；旧城区街道狭窄，道路绿化为乔木单层结构。新城区居住区──金菊花园有中心花园、庭院绿地，环境优美，绿地率在30％以上；旧城区居住区──新永路民居，人口密集，建筑拥挤，绿地率几乎为0。在单位附属绿地中，今日集团、固力集团、永大胶粘、小榄中学、镇政府等单位，绿化较好，部分学校、工厂对绿化不重视，没有绿地。苗圃区生产绿地占地8000亩，是全国最大的花木生产基地之一，苗木销往全国各地。总体来讲，小榄镇绿地植物丰富多彩，苗圃与花木场植物种类最多，其次是公园，行道树植物种类最少。开花乔木在公园绿地中应用较多，美化效果显著。灌木种类中花灌木和色叶灌木的应用也很广泛，在公园和新城区街道常见。垂直绿化应用较少，藤本植物的种类尚需进一步挖掘。在美学功能方面，人民公园与龙山公园景观类型丰富，美学效果优良。在环境功能方面，公园绿地中CO2浓度最低，为304.6ppm；公园绿地中空气负离子浓度最高，于人民公园雒水岐小瀑布跌水处可达5760个／cm3，空气质量指数Ci值远远超过1，平均为7.69；空气含菌量为561个／m3，为环境空气最清洁区。镇郊及苗圃区域CO2浓度分别为310.4ppm和309.8ppm，处于公园和街道之间。苗圃区Ci值为0.52，处于0.5－0.69之间，空气含菌量为603个／m3，环境空气属于清洁区。旧城区新永路民居人口密集，建筑拥挤，CO2浓度高达327.6ppm；新城区金菊花园居住小区建筑布局合理，房前屋后留有较大面积的绿地，CO2浓度较低，为306.7ppm，仅次于公园绿地。新永路民居Ci值为0.29，环境空气质量刚好达到污染临界值；金菊花园Ci值为0.65，处于0.5－0.69之间，空气含菌量为574个／m3，仅次于公园绿地的空气含菌量，环境空气属于中等清洁区。旧城区街道街道狭窄，车流量大，CO2浓度普遍较高，为323.1ppm；新城区街道道路宽广，车流量较小，CO2浓度较低，为312.0ppm；新、旧城区街道的空气负离子浓度和含菌量相差不大，负离子平均为224个／cm3，含菌量平均为2453/m3个，Ci值为0.17，环境空气质量属于较轻污染区。小榄车站广场空气负离子浓度最低，只有92个／cm2，Ci值为0.03，处于0.09以下，空气含菌量为2461个／m3，属于较重污染区。小榄镇城区总体CO2浓度平均为313.4ppm，空气含菌量平均为1784个／m3，空气负离子浓度平均为1057个／cm3，空气质量指数Ci值平均为1.12，环境空气属于最清洁区，空气质量优良。在生态功能方面，公园及街头绿地植物种类丰富，多样性水平较高，学校、居住区、其它单位附属绿地植物种类较少，多样性水平较低。小榄镇城区绿地较少，且分布不均匀，结合其道路规划及城镇建设规划，运用城市生态学和景观生态学的相关理论，坚持生态优先的原则，兼顾景观效果，规划小榄镇城区绿地生态系统为一个"一线、一中心、一带、两环"的环网式结构。于城区东北至西南方向斜串联布局"升平东－兴宁路"线状廊道；以体育中心为中心兴建小榄镇城区中心公园；沿长堤－东堤－南堤改造河涌绿化，建设带状河涌廊道；建设外环和内环两条绿色环状廊道。并于城区上风方向──东生路南侧构建镇郊生态防护林，逐步与位于城区南向的苗圃生产绿地相联结，构成小榄镇城区东南方向的生态防护林网。环网式结构绿地生态系统具有相对的稳定性，使各组景观具有相对的连续性和良好的可达性，使小榄镇处于绿色环绕之中，生态环境优良。结合小榄镇的绿地分布现状及城镇建设规划，对增加城区绿地面积、提高绿化覆盖率和发挥绿地最大生态效益提出具体措施。

T1  - Studies on urban bird communities in Hangzhou
TT  - 杭州城市鸟类群落研究
AN  - 1024700733
AB  - Studies on bird community patterns and processes in Hangzhou heterogeneous urban landscape habitats (urban woodlots, street tree strips, western mountain, ecotone and wetlands etc.) were carried out during 1997 ~ 1999. The main results are as follows:1. 150 species were recorded.Based on sensitivities to urbanization and edge, and distributing in how many kinds of habitat, they were divided into 12 urban landscape habitat distributional guilds.2. The distributions of birds over urban woodlots were nonrandom. There was imperfect nested subset pattern in community assemblages. The heterogeneity between woodlots was the cause of the departure from perfect nested subset pattern.3.The species-area relationships of woodlot bird communities were the results of action of multi-factors, which included: the effect of different sample size (under the same sample size, the small woodlots have higher species density than large one), the habitat diversity (the diversity of tree species was the uppermost influencing factor), disturbance factors, species factors and the effect of different research scales etc.4. There were substantial turnover and distinct seasonal changes in woodlot bird communities. The overall stability of woodlot bird community was low. 5. Street tree strips had extensive ecological functions, they served birds not only as the roosting and feeding sites, but also the corridor of movement.6. The characteristics of distributions of bird communities from the edges of the city zone to the forest interior were misty. Species number, diversity and abundance had a great fluctuation along the linear space. They were correlated with the random distributions of heterogeneous features in western mountain.7. Edge effect could result in not only increasing of diversity, but also decreasing of diversity, it depended on the characteristics of the edge. Edge effect was transformable in time.8. With urban expansion, rare and interior species, waterbirds and insectivore declined. Meanwhile,some species showed limited adaptation to urbanization.9. Landscape habitats were correlative in space, and the factors influencing communities usually be at different scales. The diversity at definite scale correlated nearly with the heterogeneity at a definite scale.10. Urban bird community in Hangzhou was cognized as a landscape metacommunity. It possessed three characteristics: 1)  The habitat was landscape habitat composed of multi-patches; 2) All local communities were correlative and interdependent; 3) There were individual flows between local communities.Alternate abstract:1997 ~ 1999年间，在杭州市区，对异质的城市景观栖息地（园林、行道树带、西部山区、边界区和湿地等）鸟类群落的格局及成因进行了研究和分析，主要结果如下：1．在杭州市区共观察到鸟类150种，根据物种对城市化的适应性、对边界的反应和栖息地类型分布型，将150种鸟类分为12个城市景观栖息地分布集团。2．鸟类在园林中的分布是非随机的，群落的组成存在不完全的子集套格局。园林栖息地间的异质性是组成格局偏离完全套式结构的原因。3．园林单次调查的鸟类物种数（S）、园林全年总物种数（Sy）与园林面积的最佳回归拟合方程分别为：S = 2.7432A0.3846         Sy = 10.6574A0.3669  
岛屿群落的物种—面积关系在大多数情况下是多因素综合作用的结果，其中包括取样面积效应（排除了取样面积效应之后，小园林具有更高的物种密度。）、栖息地结构的多样性（其中树种多样性是最主要的影响因子）、干扰因素、物种因素和研究尺度等几个方面。4．园林鸟类群落存在明显的季节变化，在总体上稳定性较低。群落组成、物种数和总数量的平均月变异幅度在30 ~ 40%之间。群落的稳定性与园林的栖息地结构密切相关。栖息地异质性越高，群落的稳定性越低。5．城市行道树带在鸟类城市景观栖息地中具有取食地、夜宿地和行走廊道等多方面的生态功能。6．西部山区鸟类群落沿城市边界至腹地的分布存在着较大的动荡性。这与异质性结构（如溪流、空斑、人行道、海拔高度等）在山区内部的随机分布密切相关。7．城市边界对西部山区鸟类群落的影响是双重的，这也说明，边缘效应具有双重性，既可表现为边界区物种多样性的提高，也可表现为物种多样性的降低，这依赖于边缘栖息地的特性，而且边缘效应是随时间变化的效应。8. 随着城市的向外扩展，栖息地结构发生一系列的变化，鸟类群落也随之产生一系列的动态变化。边界区具有较大的物种数、物种多样性和个体数量。9. 偶见种类、水鸟和食虫鸟类随城市扩展种类和数量减少的趋势比较明显。部分鸟类也对城市化产生了一定的适应性。10．景观栖息地在空间上是互相关联的，因而群落的影响因子是多尺度的。不同尺度的多样性和不同尺度的异质性相关密切。11．园林（特别是大中型园林）、水荡、滩涂、西部山区和大型水域是维持杭州市区鸟类群落的多样性较为重要的栖息地类型。12．杭州城市鸟类群落是一个景观集合群落，它具有以下特点：1）栖息地是一个由多斑块组成的景观栖息地。2）各局部群落之间存在着互相关联、互相依持的关系。3）局部群落之间存在着较大流通性。

T1  - Forest pattern, surface fire regimes, and climatic change in the Sierra Nevada, California
AN  - 304452125
AB  - A forest gap model was used to investigate how surface fires can create spatial pattern and to examine the consequences of that pattern on the spread of subsequent fires. These questions were examined in light of past fire suppression, current management options, and future climatic change. The model simulates forest characteristics, fuel loads and fire intensity within a forest stand with a spatial resolution of 0.02 ha.    The spatial heterogeneity of species composition increased under a simulated fire regime relative to simulations without fire. Although simulated surface fires altered the structure of the spatial heterogeneity of basal area within a forest stand, analysis of spatial autocorrelation did not detect a fire-generated pattern. Crown fires may exert a self-organizing influence on landscape pattern, but results from this model suggest that surface fires may not.    Simulations demonstrated that connectivity of burnable area was inversely related to fire frequency and generally increased with elevation. Certain conditions of fuel moisture and fuel bed bulk density outweighed these relationships. Nonlinear thresholds in connectivity occurred across the elevation gradient as a result of gradients in fuel loads and fuel bed bulk density simulated by the model.    Potential effects of climatic change on forest structure, composition and the fire regime were investigated. The effects of climatic change on forest structure and composition were site-specific. Fire frequency responded directly to climate's influence on fuel moisture, while fire extent was affected by changes that occurred in either forest structure or species composition. The influence of species composition on fuel bed bulk density was particularly important. Future fires in the Sierra Nevada could be both more frequent and of greater spatial extent if climate model predictions prove true.    The effects of fire suppression and current management options for restoring pre-suppression forest conditions were evaluated. Simulation results suggest that forest structure, species composition, and spatial autocorrelation structure may be restored quickly after 100 years of fire suppression if disturbances are reintroduced that cause significant tree mortality.

T1  - Demographic and genetic response of woodland amphibians to landscape change in southern Connecticut
AN  - 304251005
AB  - A critical question in conservation biology concerns how changes in land-use patterns affect the persistence of plant and animal populations and the distribution of genetic variation within them. This dissertation focused on woodland amphibians occupying forested habitats arrayed along an urban-rural gradient in southern Connecticut for examining these issues. My objectives were: (1) to identify determinants of the structure of the forest mosaic, the arena within which demographic and genetic processes in woodland amphibians operated; (2) to examine whether amphibian dispersal occurred randomly with respect to several prominent, natural and anthropogenic features of the landscape; (3) to determine thresholds of sensitivity to habitat fragmentation for different species of woodland amphibians; and (4) to test several hypotheses about microevolution in amphibian populations subjected to induced subdivision.    Distinct trends in the structure and dynamics of forested lands, and hence the habitats available to woodland amphibians, occurred along a spatially continuous urban-rural gradient. Primary determinants of forest occurrence in 1990 included slope and drainage attributes of underlying soils, proximity to transportation corridors and urban centers, and historical 'common land' designations. Amphibian movements, measured from captures in strategically placed pit-fall traps, were generally facilitated by stream beds, hindered by roads, and variously affected by ecotones between forested lands and open lands. Notably, the most dispersive species with bi-phasic life cycles (Rana sylvatica and Notophthalmus viridescens) were the least tolerant of habitat fragmentation, whereas the least dispersive species with direct development (Plethodon cinereus) was the most tolerant. Tolerances to habitat fragmentation could be largely predicted with a spatially explicit population model. Genetic differentiation, measured with molecular genetic markers and morph frequencies in the redback salamander (Plethodon cinereus), was greater among fragmented subpopulations than among contiguous subpopulations. Among fragmented populations, differentiation was greater among those lacking historical forest connections than among those retaining such connections. Furthermore, genetic divergence was correlated with geographic distance in a population occupying continuous forest, whereas no such pattern was evident in a population occupying fragmented forests. Notably, overall levels of genetic diversity appeared to be affected little by population fragmentation.
