AB  - When complete, the project will provide: * Enhanced pedestrian safety and comfort * Improved mobility options, including transit and cycling * A design that reflects its identity of the surrounding communities * Green, friendly streets through naturalized boulevards, trees, and site furnishings * Making 37 Street and 17 Avenue S.W. a destination that will support existing and new local businesses * Improved connections to park spaces and amenities 42 Avenue S.E. Complete Streets 42 Avenue S.E. is a unique and developing industrial area in southeast Calgary, connected to a diversity of businesses and services such as green spaces, the Calgary Food Bank, local transit hubs, industrial parks, and more than 10 craft breweries in a 7 kilometer (km) (4.3 mile) stretch.

The project has led to 10 (and counting) recently developed and proposed private development projects along the corridor that include a mix of commercial, office, and residential units and public-owned, free-to-park garages with more than 1,700 spaces.

The project included an expansion of the existing Monon Greenway from a 10-foot-wide (3 meter) asphalt path to a new 145-foot-wide (44.2 meter), fully interactive right of way that includes dedicated trails for pedestrians and bicycles, gathering spaces, lighting and landscaping, green infrastructure for storm-water collection, detention and water quality, traffic-calmed roadways and raised intersections, and on-street parking.

Project goals, designed to improve traffic flow and safety for all users along the roadway, include: * Adding sidewalks for school children and other pedestrians walking between neighborhoods, the shopping center, the church and future greenways * Installing bike lanes for cyclists * Meeting sight distance requirements at each side street * Reducing travel speeds for through traffic along the corridor to minimize angle crashes and vehicles running off the road The project provides roundabouts at the intersection of Dynasty Drive and Electra Drive, as well as at the intersection of Wyatt's Pond Lane and Reedy Creek School.

T1  - Static and dynamic methods in social network analysis reveal the association patterns of desert-dwelling giraffe
AN  - 2682436875; 2022-58183-001
AB  - Patterns of association in animal societies vary through space and time. Understanding such variation is key to predicting inter- and intra-population variation across factors as diverse as gene flow, disease transmission, and resilience to climate change. Here, we use 3.5 years of observational data, coupled with static and dynamic methods in social network analysis, to investigate patterns of social association in wild giraffe in the northern Namib Desert, Namibia (a habitat of extreme aridity for the species). Our static analyses reveal similar robust nested social communities, but less distinct community structures, than those found in giraffe populations inhabiting less arid environments. Furthermore, results of our dynamic social network analyses show increased social connectivity in this population during the morning and hot-dry season. These temporal patterns align with patterns of thermoregulatory and sociosexual behaviour in this population. However, they differ from temporal patterns of connectivity revealed in populations in less arid environments. Combined, results of both our static and temporal analyses suggest that while the major characteristics of giraffe society persist through space and time, there is substantial variation in the strength of patterns of social connectivity both within and between populations at multiple spatiotemporal resolutions.

 (Source: journal abstract) Impact statementAnimal social networks are inherently dynamic. Patterns of connectivity can be shaped by both social factors and habitat variation across space and time. We reveal that a population of uniquely desert-dwelling giraffe maintains a robust, albeit weaker, community structure in a habitat at the extreme edge of its natural range. We also reveal variation in intra-population temporal patterns of connectivity at both daily and seasonal resolutions. Combined, these results suggest that while the major characteristics of giraffe society persist across habitats and through time, the strength of patterns of social connectivity markedly varies in line with habitat factors both within and between populations.

T1  - Lockdowns Showed the Promise of Cities with Fewer Cars
AN  - 2638768535
AB  - During COVID's first wave, the streets of New York and other major cities became eerily empty. Mournful sirens replaced the usual bustle and din. But urban dwellers also heard something new: an abundance of birdsong. During walks outside the only safe respite beyond their apartments they breathed cleaner air. Lockdowns had meant fewer cars on the roads, and the effects were unmissable. Levels of nitrogen dioxide a by-product of fossil fuels burned in cars and in electricity generation-were 30 percent lower along the 1-95 corridor from Washington, D.C., to Boston in March 2020 compared with previous years.

T1  - <b>Armazón Hidroecológico de Hualpén</b>: Conservación de las Funciones Hídricas de la Cuenca del Humedal de Lenga en un Contexto de Expansión Urbana Sobre el Delta del Río Bío-Bío
TT  - Hualpén Hydroecological Framework: Conservation of the Water Functions of the Lenga Wetland Basin in a Context of Urban Expansion on the Bío-Bío River Delta
AN  - 2734699276
AB  - El área metropolitana del Gran Concepción se emplaza sobre las planicies sedimentarias que conforman el delta del río Bío-Bío, de altísima riqueza en términos de materia orgánica del suelo. Este factor converge con la intrusión marina y los constantes flujos hídricos subterráneos provenientes del río para sustentar los ecosistemas conocidos como humedales, hoy amenazados por el crecimiento urbano. Ellos, que funcionan como una sola gran red hídrica, heredera de los vestigiales cauces pasados del Bío-Bío, se encuentran en distintas condiciones de degradación, dependiendo principalmente de su cercanía a la ciudad. El segundo más grande de ellos, el humedal del estuario de Lenga se encuentra dentro del Santuario de la Naturaleza Península de Hualpén, a 3 kilómetros de la ciudad homónima. Esto tiende a generar una falsa sensación de seguridad en lo que a sus condiciones se refiere, pues si bien efectivamente se encuentra alejado de la acción directa de la urbe, está bajo una enorme presión ecológica desde un punto de vista hidrológico.El humedal de Lenga depende de la suma de las aguas lluvias al infiltrarse y de los drenajes provenientes del río. Esto implica que si bien existe una superficie precisa de humedal -la laguna-, su superficie funcional se extiende, por los procesos y sistemas ecológicos que lo sustentan, a toda el área dentro su cuenca recolectora. Es ahí donde se evidencian las principales problemáticas: la ciudad de Hualpén ha crecido sobre la superficie de la cuenca, ocupando el 14% de ella. Esto afecta tanto a la recarga aportada por las aguas lluvias al impermeabilizar los suelos y deteniendo la infiltración, como a los drenajes que vienen del río al interrumpir los flujos que corren por los paleocanales producto de la compactación de los suelos, lo que amenaza seriamente al humedal y que habría llevado a su desaparición temporal durante los primeros meses de 2021 (figura 1), lo que se suma a la amenaza que representa su cercanía a industrias contaminantes.La presente tesis y proyecto de arquitectura del paisaje apunta a establecer una nueva manera de urbanizar aquellas planicies amenazadas dentro de la cuenca recolectora del humedal en el sector conocido como Peñuelas, de forma sensible y coherente con los sistemas hidroecológicos mencionados anteriormente, considerando que las probabilidades de que la ciudad crezca hacia el sector son muy altas.Así, se propone la creación de un armazón hidroecológico, una red de corredores de infiltración cuyo trazado se origina en la lectura de las capas que configuran las trazas del agua y los procesos geológiccos que le dieron origen, que asegure en el futuro tanto la infiltración de las aguas como los flujos superficiales y subterráneos que corren por esta superficie intermedia entre el humedal de Lenga y el río Bío-Bío.El proyecto contempla finalmente un parque urbano que cumpla las funciones de activar y articular esta nueva zona urbana y costera, proteger un sistema lineal de humedales de menor escala y la vegetación asociada, así como acercar a la población de Hualpén a estos ecosistemas, otorgándole importantes beneficios y cumpliendo un rol de visibilización, educación y configuración de un imaginario clave para su sustento en el tiempo. De cierta forma, ambas maneras de proyectar, tanto a nivel de plan maestro como de parque urbano, lo hacen a partir de un diseño del vacío, permitiendo una apertura al cambio programático a través del tiempo y por lo tanto asegurando una sustentabilidad ecológica, económica y social.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Hide full disclaimerThe Greater Concepción metropolitan area is located on the sedimentary plains that make up the Bío-Bío river delta, which is extremely rich in terms of soil organic matter. This factor converges with marine intrusion and the constant underground water flows from the river to sustain the ecosystems known as wetlands, today threatened by urban growth. They, which function as a single large water network, heir to the vestigial past channels of the Bío-Bío, are in different conditions of degradation, depending mainly on their proximity to the city. The second largest of them, the Lenga estuary wetland, is located within the Hualpén Peninsula Nature Sanctuary, 3 kilometers from the city of the same name. This tends to generate a false sense of security in terms of its conditions, because although it is indeed far from the direct action of the city, it is under enormous ecological pressure from a hydrological point of view.The Lenga wetland depends on the sum of rainwater infiltrating and drainage from the river. This implies that although there is a precise wetland surface -the lagoon-, its functional surface extends, due to the ecological processes and systems that sustain it, to the entire area within its collecting basin. It is there where the main problems are evident: the city of Hualpén has grown on the surface of the basin, occupying 14% of it. This affects both the recharge provided by rainwater by waterproofing the soil and stopping infiltration, and the drainage that comes from the river by interrupting the flows that run through the paleochannels as a result of soil compaction, which seriously threatens the wetland and that would have led to its temporary disappearance during the first months of 2021 (figure 1), which adds to the threat posed by its proximity to polluting industries.This thesis and landscape architecture project aims to establish a new way of urbanizing those threatened plains within the collecting basin of the wetland in the sector known as Peñuelas, in a sensitive and coherent way with the aforementioned hydroecological systems, considering that the probabilities for the city to grow towards the sector are very high.Thus, the creation of a hydroecological framework is proposed, a network of infiltration corridors whose layout originates from the reading of the layers that make up the traces of water and the geological processes that gave rise to it, which ensures in the future both infiltration of the waters such as the superficial and underground flows that run through this intermediate surface between the Lenga wetland and the Bío-Bío river.The project finally contemplates an urban park that fulfills the functions of activating and articulating this new urban and coastal area, protecting a linear system of smaller-scale wetlands and associated vegetation, as well as bringing the population of Hualpén closer to these ecosystems, granting them important benefits and fulfilling a role of visibility, education and configuration of a key imaginary for their livelihood over time. In a certain way, both ways of designing, both at the level of the master plan and the urban park, do so based on a design of the void, allowing an opening to programmatic change over time and therefore ensuring ecological, economical sustainability. And social.

T1  - Land-Water Interstices: Soft Strategies for Red Hook’s Coastal Resilience
AN  - 2731208519
AB  - Coastal areas are contested zones; they are attractive for real estate development, they are exposed to the risk of rising waters, and are critical habitats for many avian, aquatic and land-based species. Loss of these wetlands through sea level rise could pose a threat to coastal economies and water quality. Re-naturalizing a river’s beds and banks and then replacing them with vegetation results in restoring biodiversity, which in turn helps in mitigating floods.Land-Water Interstices argues that a coastal community is resilient only if neighborhoods, buildings and infrastructure can withstand and recover from potential flooding, rising water and other climate occurrences. The research adopts a multidimensional approach to solving the challenge of coastal resilience by combining principles of urban design, landscape and sustainable design, flood mitigation, climate adoption and placemaking.By re-naturalizing Buttermilk Channel and designing a wetland system that connects Red Hook and Governor’s Island, the project addresses the issue of flooding, rising sea waters and climate change. This system forms multiple islands (emerging and proposed) that can serve not only as a ‘sponge basin’, but also as a soft defense edge and can accommodate new ferry connections. These islands can be catalysts oriented towards connectivity and resiliency in the urban realm.

T1  - Effects of Human Disturbance on Riparian Wetland Landscape Pattern in a Coastal Region
AN  - 2728530492
AB  - The wetland ecosystem along a river in a coastal region has great significance in purifying water bodies, regulating climate, and providing habitat for animals and plants. Studying the effects of human disturbances on the landscape patterns of wetlands is of great significance to the protection and management of an ecosystem. This study used Guannan County and Guanyun County, two counties in China that are located on both banks of the Xinyi River as the study area. The spatiotemporal characteristics of the landscape pattern evolution of wetlands and their relationship with human interference from 2009 to 2020 were analyzed by the landscape dynamic rate, landscape conversion matrix, landscape indices, human disturbance index, and the quadratic regression equation. The results showed that: (1) Except for the increase in the area of beach and paddy fields, the area of other landscape types decreased; (2) the changes in wetlands were heterogeneous and showed different trends in different regions; (3) the boundary shape’s complexity and the landscape pattern’s fragmentation showed a decreasing–increasing trend and the connectivity and the diversity of the landscape decreased; and (4) the human disturbance index increased from 2009 to 2014 and then decreased from 2014 to 2020, declining outward from the places where towns and construction land aggregated. Moreover, there was an inverted U-type relationship with the landscape pattern indices. The findings provide direct, specific, and explicit information and theoretical guidance for the protection of wetlands along the river in the coastal region as well as for the restoration of wetland ecosystem function and the improvement of wetland biodiversity in relevant regions.

T1  - How Akron, Ohio is expanding economic opportunity by investing in neighborhood business districts
AN  - 2508227435
AB  - Over the past three years, we’ve worked closely with local community development corporations (CDCs) and merchants’ associations to address NBDs’ most pressing issues and cultivate a more business-friendly environment by: * Awarding over $2 million in façade improvement grants * Launching a small business competition to match entrepreneurs with vacant storefronts * Developing a design guide to help business and building owners achieve aesthetic continuity along the corridors * Producing a new streetscape improvement plan * Installing LED lights throughout the districts in our continued efforts to enhance public safety * Ramping up street resurfacing * Increasing the tree canopy We implemented these place-based investments alongside neighborhood leaders and organizations to ensure the community’s vision fully shaped the initiative.

In the Copley Road area, a historically Black commercial corridor, we launched the Maple Valley Community Pride Cleanup—a grassroots effort spanning 15 consecutive weeks in which volunteers removed over 1,600 pounds of litter, beautified the NBD and adjacent park, cleaned vacant lots and alleys, mowed lawns, trimmed hedges, pulled weeds, cleared overgrowth, added trash receptables, and significantly impacted the streetscape.

In 2021, we’ll repurpose two of our city-owned vacant lots into thriving public green space, rehabilitate a former Veterans of Foreign Wars hall into a vital access point for workforce referrals and city services, and continue our investments in signage, planters, street pole banners, and public art to confirm our belief that neighborhood beauty is a basic right.

T1  - A Bayesian multistate approach to evaluate movements of an invasive freshwater estuarine-opportunist
AN  - 2622782582
AB  - Coastal rivers and estuaries provide habitat and migratory corridors for freshwater estuarine-opportunists. We evaluated movement patterns of 61 blue catfish (Ictalurus furcatus) in the tidal York and Rappahannock rivers in Virginia, USA with acoustic telemetry from July 2015 to June 2016. To evaluate river-specific movements, we utilized a multistate Cormack–Jolly–Seber (CJS) model within a Bayesian framework to estimate probabilities of detection and transition (movement) among established salinity zones (i.e., tidal-fresh (0‰–0.5‰), oligohaline (>0.5‰–5‰), mesohaline (>5‰–18‰)). We considered flow as an environmental covariate. Despite high site fidelity in tidal-fresh zones, some individuals displayed movements into oligohaline and mesohaline habitats indicative of partial migration. Once downstream movement occurred, the probability of staying in the new salinity zone was higher than the probability of movements to other salinity zones. In the Rappahannock River only, movement upstream from mesohaline habitats was associated with below average flow. As flow increased, the probability of remaining in oligohaline and mesohaline zones increased. Our study shows blue catfish can move into downstream areas of tidal rivers with elevated salinities and that increased freshwater flow may allow them to remain in these habitats for extended durations.Alternate abstract:Les rivières littorales et estuaires fournissent des habitats et des corridors migratoires pour les espèces opportunistes estuariennes et d’eau douce. Nous avons évalué les motifs de déplacement de 61 poissons-chats bleus (Ictalurus furcatus) dans les cours tidaux des fleuves York et Rappahannock en Virginie (États-Unis), de juillet 2015 à juin 2016, à l’aide de la télémétrie acoustique. Afin d’évaluer les déplacements propres au fleuve, nous avons employé un modèle multi-états de Cormack–Jolly–Seber (CJS) dans un cadre bayésien pour estimer les probabilités de détection et de transition (déplacement) entre zones de salinité déterminée (c.-à-d., tidales-d’eau douce (0 ‰–0,5 ‰), oligohalines (>0,5 ‰–5 ‰), mésohalines (>5 ‰–18 ‰)). Le débit a été traité comme une covariable environnementale. Malgré une grande fidélité au site dans les zones tidales-d’eau douce, certains individus se déplaçaient vers des habitats oligohalins et mésohalins, témoignant d’une migration partielle. Une fois le déplacement vers l’aval effectué, la probabilité que les individus demeurent dans la nouvelle zone de salinité était plus élevée que la probabilité de déplacement vers d’autres zones de salinité. Seulement dans le fleuve Rappahannock, les déplacements vers l’amont à partir d’habitats mésohalins étaient associés à des débits sous la moyenne. Plus le débit était élevé, plus la probabilité que les individus demeurent dans des zones oligohalines et mésohalines était grande. L’étude démontre que les poissons-chats bleus peuvent se déplacer vers des secteurs du cours inférieur de rivières tidales de forte salinité et qu’un fort débit d’eau douce pourrait leur permettre de demeurer dans ces habitats pendant de longues périodes.

T1  - La Reconversión de Suelos Centrales Como Oportunidad de Equidad Urbana: Una Estrategia Metropolitana De Movilidad Sustentable Y Equipamiento Accesible: La Sustitución de Autopistas Urbanas por Corredores Públicos Multimodales
AN  - 2622777496
AB  - Ante la potente desigualdad socio-territorial que enfrenta Santiago, la infraestructura vial ha sido incapaz de equiparar el acceso a funciones urbanas esenciales, traduciéndose en autopistas que no solo revelan patrones de inequidad, sino que los acrecientan. El protagonismo del automóvil en el modelo de movilidad es evidente; así lo demuestra la cantidad de planes e inversiones destinados a la construcción de nuevas autopistas. De esta manera, al priorizar siempre el tránsito expedito del transporte privado, el modelo favorece una conectividad metropolitana, pero en detrimento de la calidad urbana de barrios. Por lo tanto, la periferia habitacional, el sector más vulnerable y segregado de la ciudad, debe sufrir las consecuencias de una infraestructura hermética que fragmenta y amenaza sus relaciones barriales.La investigación plantea que la manera de reconvertir barrios, detonar desarrollo urbano y generar equidad en la periferia es mediante una movilidad pública y sustentable capaz de revertir las desigualdades generadas por las autopistas. Para ello, detectando la cantidad de superficie ocupada por Vespucio y las vías a su interior, se abre la posibilidad de implementar una estrategia de movilidad en suelos de primer nivel. Así, la reconversión de suelos centrales surge como una oportunidad no solo de brindar accesibilidad, sino que también de proveer a barrios periféricos de espacio público, vivienda y equipamiento de calidad. La propuesta se aborda desde dos escalas: una estrategia metropolitana y su aplicación en una pieza urbana.Alternate abstract:Given the powerful socio-territorial inequality that Santiago faces, the road infrastructure has been unable to equalize access to essential urban functions, resulting in highways that not only reveal patterns of inequity, but also increase them. The leading role of the car in the mobility model is evident; This is demonstrated by the number of plans and investments destined for the construction of new highways. In this way, by always prioritizing the expeditious transit of private transport, the model favors metropolitan connectivity, but to the detriment of the urban quality of neighborhoods. Therefore, the residential periphery, the most vulnerable and segregated sector of the city, must suffer the consequences of a hermetic infrastructure that fragments and threatens its neighborhood relations.The research suggests that the way to reconvert neighborhoods, trigger urban development and generate equity in the periphery is through public and sustainable mobility capable of reversing the inequalities generated by highways. To do this, detecting the amount of surface area occupied by Vespucio and the roads inside it opens up the possibility of implementing a mobility strategy on top-tier land. Thus, the reconversion of central land arises as an opportunity not only to provide accessibility, but also to provide peripheral neighborhoods with public space, housing and quality equipment. The proposal is approached from two scales: a metropolitan strategy and its application in an urban piece.

T1  - Combining Tracking and Remote Sensing to Identify Critical Year-Round Site, Habitat Use and Migratory Connectivity of a Threatened Waterbird Species
AN  - 2584508129
AB  - We tracked 39 western flyway white-naped cranes (Antigone vipio) throughout multiple annual cycles from June 2017 to July 2020, using GSM-GPS loggers providing positions every 10-min to describe migration routes and key staging areas used between their Mongolian breeding and wintering areas in China’s Yangtze River Basin. The results demonstrated that white-naped cranes migrated an average of 2556 km (±187.9 SD) in autumn and 2673 km (±342.3) in spring. We identified 86 critical stopover sites that supported individuals for more than 14 days, within a 100–800 km wide migratory corridor. This study also confirmed that Luan River catchment is the most important staging region, where white-naped cranes spent 18% of the annual cycle (in both spring and autumn) each year. Throughout the annual cycle, 69% of the tracking locations were from outside of the currently protected areas, while none of the critical staging areas enjoyed any form of site protection. We see further future potential to combine avian tracking data and remote-sensing information throughout the annual range of the white-naped crane to restore it and other such species to a more favourable conservation status.

T1  - Improving Land Use Planning through the Evaluation of Ecosystem Services: One Case Study of Quyang County
AN  - 2569267727
AB  - Competition for land is increasing as demand for multiple land uses and ecosystem services rises. Land regulation of the principles of landscape ecology is necessary to develop more sustainable approaches to land use planning. The research evaluated the present land patterns and determined best practices for its regulation of Dongwang Township in Quyang County, located in the Taihang Mountain area of Hebei Province, China. The research used the landscape ecology theory to construct an index system for landscape pattern analysis based on the GIS and Fragstats 3.3 software. In this study, we examined the specific reasons that landscape ecology is superior to traditional methods in land consolidation planning and design, which is conducive to the comprehensive development of land ecological benefits. Landscape ecological planning can effectively reduce landscape fragmentation and improve intensive management. The result found that the descending order of the Shannon index was current landscape, landscape ecological planning, and traditional planning. Landscape ecological planning could protect the natural diversity than traditional planning. Landscape ecological planning enables the creation of long corridors, with higher densities and connectivity and lower average corridor widths than traditional planning. Besides, it can improve ecological service function values in the study area to varying degrees, thus discouraging residents from limiting themselves to grain production. This research has great potential to improve the visibility of ecosystem services in local land use planning and, thus, to improve the ecological functioning of future landscapes.

T1  - EECASC: an energy efficient communication approach in smart cities
AN  - 2111384970
AB  - The power consumption and connectivity of mobile nodes to the network are two essential issues in smart cities. In this paper, we have proposed a decentralized approach for mobility management of mobile nodes in smart cities. We propose a customized communication protocol compliant with 6LoWPAN along with the scheme that consumes less power regarding previous solutions. The proposed approach organizes static nodes as a tree for efficient routing, automatic addressing, and handling movement of mobile nodes. The proposed approach has a hybrid data transmission capability by proactively choosing multi-hop or single-hop routing to reduce power consumption of mobile nodes. It is evaluated based on different factors. The results show the superiority of the approach compared with the previous works. The promising analytical results manifest the higher performance (about 10% compared to the best scheme) of the proposed approach specifically in reducing the power consumption of mobile nodes.

T1  - Configuración De La Nueva Área Metropolitana De Quito: Usos Del Suelo y Escenarios Futuros Para La Planificación
TT  - Configuration of the New Metropolitan Area of Quito: Land Uses and Future Scenarios for Planning
AN  - 2516185279
AB  - Las áreas metropolitanas han experimentado un crecimiento exponencial en las últimas décadas, especialmente en los sectores periurbanos. La literatura ha descrito este proceso de "expansión urbana" como un fenómeno que está cambiando el paisaje por el incremento en el consumo del suelo, que a su vez ha originado un proceso de conurbación con los territorios y centros poblados aledaños, a modo de un crecimiento desbordado que ha llegado a sobrepasar los límites político-administrativos.
Esta investigación, que se encuentra dentro del marco del proyecto Fondecyt- ANID/Chile Nº 1180268 y la beca Senescyt-Ecuador, para estudios de Doctorado convocatoria 2015, toma como caso de estudio Quito y su área de expansión urbana, bajo la visión de dos componentes: lo urbano y sus dinámicas funcionales y la modelación de su crecimiento. Plantea una nueva configuración metropolitana: la movilidad entre asentamientos humanos localizados en diferentes circunscripciones territoriales que, a su vez, permiten la configuración de corredores urbanos y la integración del territorio.
También analiza los cambios de uso del suelo que se han producido en Quito y su área metropolitana en un período de 19 años, producto del crecimiento urbano, para lo cual utiliza herramientas y aplicaciones tecnológicas como los sistemas de información geográfica SIG, percepción remota y modelación. Además, y como componente principal, se determinan las fuerzas motrices impulsoras del crecimiento urbano, las demandas, restricciones y como principal entrada la consulta a los stakeholders, todo esto mediante el uso del modelo Dyna-CLUE para la creación de escenarios futuros al 2050. Estos escenarios de simulación urbana consideran una visión holística de las dinámicas de cambio de uso de suelo junto con las políticas de planificación; este caso de estudio anticipa cómo la expansión urbana consumirá áreas agrícolas y naturales, en un claro proceso de deterioro que en su mayoría es irreversible.
El nuevo enfoque propuesto en esta investigación, permite plantear recomendaciones que ayuden en la planificación de las ciudades y reorienten las políticas públicas para lograr ciudades más inclusivas, sustentables y resilientes.Alternate abstract:Metropolitan areas have experienced exponential growth in recent decades, especially in peri-urban sectors. The literature has described this process of "urban sprawl" as a phenomenon that is changing the landscape due to the increased land consumption, which in turn has led to a process of conurbation with the neighboring territories and populated centers; as a result, this growth surpasses the administrative-political boundaries.This study, carried out in the framework of the Fondecyt-ANID/Chile project No. 1180268 and Senescyt-Ecuador, studies for a Ph.D granted in 2015, takes Quito and its urban sprawl area as a case study that considers two components: the urban and its functional dynamics and modeling its growth. It proposes a new metropolitan configuration that contemplates mobility between human settlements located in different territorial constituencies and the same time allows the configuration of urban corridors and territorial integration.Furthermore, it analyzes the changes in land use that have occurred in Quito and its metropolitan area over 19 years as a consequence of urban growth, using technological tools and applications like geographic information systems. In addition, the driving forces behind urban growth, demands, restrictions and, as the main input stakeholder consultation. All this is determined through the use of the Dyna CLUE model for the creation of future scenarios projected to 2050. These urban simulation scenarios considerer a holistic view of the dynamics of land use change together with planning policies. This case study anticipates how urban expansion will consume agricultural and natural areas in an evident process of deterioration that is mostly irreversible.The new approach proposed in this research makes it possible to come up with recommendations intended to help in city planning and to reorient public policies to achieve more inclusive, sustainable and resilient cities.

T1  - The Relative Timing of Human Migration and Land-Cover and Land-Use Change — An Evaluation of Northern Taiwan from 1990 to 2015
AN  - 2489561350
AB  - Urban land expansion can be driven by and drive population growth, but determining cause-effect relationships of urban land expansion and population growth is challenging due to the temporal resolution of decadal censuses for most countries. The relative timing of urban land expansion and population change was explored based on a case study for north Taiwan from 1990 to 2015. Data on urban land expansion were derived from a dense time series of Landsat satellite imagery, and population change from annual population registers at the district level. A novel algorithm for identifying the starting time of urban expansion was developed and tested based on dense time series of Vegetation-Impervious-Soil (V-I-S) proportion maps derived from Landsat surface reflectance imagery. The time of urbanization estimated by logistic regression was determined from the Impervious cover time series. The identified location and estimated time for newly urbanized lands were generally accurate, with 80% of urban expansion estimated within ± 2.4 years.The random forest (RF) classification routine was applied to Landsat image inputs for detailed urban land-use classification. Input features were extracted from a 2015 Landsat image dataset, and the top 10 most contributing features for RF classifiers were the six spectral wavebands, gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) homogeneity of V-I-S, and Vegetation temporal variation. The Landsat image was tested with different input features, and the land-use maps derived from the top 10 features yielded the most accurate map. Areal extents of annual urban land uses (Residential, Employment, and Transportation corridor categories) were derived by applying a conditional statement based on the urbanization date of the urban expansion map and overlaying on the 2015 land-use map. The relative timing and general relationship between urban land-use and population dynamics was explored at the district level. Linear regression was run to understand the general relationship between population and land use. The relative timing between population growth and land-use change was estimated with lagged correlation. Residential land use and change was most related to population and change. Population growth occurred 2.5 years later than Residential land expansion based on the median time lag.

T1  - Mine Associations, Detection Methods, and Population Genetics of Townsend’s Big-Eared Bat (<em>Corynorhinus townsendii</em>) in Nevada
AN  - 2489313513
AB  - Due to habitat loss and disease, conservation efforts for Corynorhinus townsendii should be grounded in a deep understanding of this species’ habitat associations and population connectivity. I investigated associations between roost occupancy and mine roost characteristics and external environmental features. I found that no external mine features were associated with occupancy. On smaller spatial scales, proximity to water and habitat types were associated with occupancy. I tested the use of DNA barcoding to identify C. townsendii eDNA in roosts and found that this method is not viable. Finally, I assessed the population structure of C. townsendii in White Pine County, Nevada. I found significant genetic variance among roosts, with a percent variation that suggests some genetic mixing (P = 0.001, Ф = 0.252). It is important that no aggregation becomes isolated, as this will impede gene flow and could leave isolated groups more vulnerable to disturbance, disease, and genetic drift.

T1  - Predicting Suitable Habitat for the Critically Endangered Yellow-Tailed Woolly Monkey (<em>Lagothrix Flavicauda</em>) in Peru
AN  - 2458763977
AB  - The Tropical Andes Biodiversity Hotspot holds a remarkable amount of species at risk of extinction due to climate change and human activities. One of these species, the Critically Endangered yellow-tailed woolly monkey (Lagothrix flavicauda), has experienced alterations in its known geographical range, along with a recent sighting in the region Junín, 206 kilometers south of previous observations, calling for a re-evaluation of potential suitable habitat. In this thesis, I fit, evaluate, and apply predictions of a habitat suitability model within the country of Peru. I used a generalized linear modeling approach across various range constraints, incorporating bioclimatic variables, forest cover, distance to cities and elevation as predictor variables. Precipitation features most strongly influencing observations of species presence in my model and evaluation measures showed the elevation-constrained model accuracy to be around 95%. Habitat suitability maps illustrate novel areas of potentially suitable habitat in central Huánuco, Pasco, and limited areas in Junín. The newly discovered population was found to be in an area of low suitability, calling for further investigation of the species in this area. Areas of suitable habitat should be surveyed to decrease bias in occurrence data, increasing the accuracy of habitat modeling for this species. Surveying these areas may also reveal corridors of gene flow between these populations, and could facilitate landscape genetics studies to characterize the viability of this taxon. Better characterization of the true distribution of the species will provide information to conservation stakeholders in priority areas, helping to protect this species and associated threatened wildlife.

T1  - The Relative Timing of Human Migration and Land-Cover and Land-Use Change: An Evaluation of Northern Taiwan from 1990 to 2015
AN  - 2446968007
AB  - Urban land expansion can be driven by and drive population growth, but determining cause-effect relationships of urban land expansion and population growth is challenging due to the temporal resolution of decadal censuses for most countries. The relative timing of urban land expansion and population change was explored based on a case study for north Taiwan from 1990 to 2015. Data on urban land expansion were derived from a dense time series of Landsat satellite imagery, and population change from annual population registers at the district level.
A novel algorithm for identifying the starting time of urban expansion was developed and tested based on dense time series of Vegetation-Impervious-Soil (V-I-S) proportion maps derived from Landsat surface reflectance imagery. The time of urbanization estimated by logistic regression was determined from the Impervious cover time series. The identified location and estimated time for newly urbanized lands were generally accurate, with 80% of urban expansion estimated within ± 2.4 years.
The random forest (RF) classification routine was applied to Landsat image inputs for detailed urban land-use classification. Input features were extracted from a 2015 Landsat image dataset, and the top 10 most contributing features for RF classifiers were the six spectral wavebands, gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) homogeneity of V-I-S, and Vegetation temporal variation. The Landsat image was tested with different input features, and the land-use maps derived from the top 10 features yielded the most accurate map. Areal extents of annual urban land uses (Residential, Employment, and Transportation corridor categories) were derived by applying a conditional statement based on the urbanization date of the urban expansion map and overlaying on the 2015 land-use map. 
The relative timing and general relationship between urban land-use and population dynamics was explored at the district level. Linear regression was run to understand the general relationship between population and land use. The relative timing between population growth and land-use change was estimated with lagged correlation. Residential land use and change was most related to population and change. Population growth occurred 2.5 years later than Residential land expansion based on the median time lag.

T1  - Amphibian Communities Within a Coffee-Forest Matrix Outside the Protected Buffer of Celaque National Park, Honduras
AN  - 2408566277
AB  - The coffee agricultural industry is one of the largest worldwide and is growing in Honduras. Coffee plantations are putting pressure on forested lands and are one reason for the rise of deforestation in the tropics. Outside the protected border of Celaque National Park, Honduras, an increase in deforestation has been documented due to coffee agriculture creating a mixed matrix of coffee agriculture and forest fragments. Amphibian populations respond differently to land use change and the associated physical changes in the environment that comes with deforestation. In some cases, the edge effects along the coffee-forest matrix act as habitat for amphibian species and are a corridor for migration between forested fragments. In other cases, loss of amphibian diversity and species richness occurs. This study found the latter to be true, where both coffee and forest fragments demonstrated low levels of amphibian richness and diversity. While additional research and replication should be done to further study this system, initial analysis show that canopy cover, vegetation density, and microhabitat complexity may be important factors supporting more diverse amphibian communities and species sensitive to human disturbance. With coffee agriculture on the rise in the tropics, exploring these systems and the impacts on amphibian communities will be a necessary field of study for conservation biology.

T1  - How Street Features and Lighting Affect Neighborhood Walkability
AN  - 2607640287
AB  - Research has attempted to measure, evaluate, and improve the walkability of streets in neighborhoods. Such studies have found walkability and walking behavior associated with density, diversity, travel distance, design (connectivity and infrastructure), and destination accessibility (referred to as the 5Ds) at macro level and environmental aesthetics at micro (or street) level. Because most studies have been cross-sectional or correlational studies, it is worth doing controlled experiments to test effects of street features on walkability. This dissertation combines walking preference (intention to walk) and aesthetic preferences as a measure of perceived walkability in built environments. It aimed to 1) model the potential effects of selected street characteristics on perceived walkability; 2) find the effects of building styles that convey environmental meanings on perceived walkability; and 3) find effects of lighting modes and enclosure (or openness) on walkability after dark. In the long-term, the approach and findings can point to practical and low-cost measures to stimulate walking in various neighborhood.The dissertation included four studies (one correlational study and three experiments). The first two set up the later studies. A correlational study sought to identify salient groupings of visual properties of streets for walkability. Using t-tests and multivariate analyses, it identified five clusters of attributes that pedestrians perceived as similar to one another for walking choices, as well as the critical ones among those that one could easily manipulate. The remaining studies used 3D models in SketchUp and Vray to create virtual desk-top simulations of streets. The second study sought to identify meanings associated with five street types by building style or type (Tudor and Farm styles, Tudor and Colonial styles, Mediterranean and Saltbox styles, Multi-stories with Traditional styles, and Multi-stories with Modern styles). It had 147 respondents (107 women and 40 men) and used non-parametric analyses to test the perceived desirability, friendliness and social status of the streets. Respondents gave the most favorable scores to the streets with Tudor and Farm or Tudor and Colonial, and they gave the lowest scores to streets with multi-story houses.The two main studies used controlled experiments to test the effect of the physical attributes of streets on perceived walkability. The first experiment used the results from the second study to test the effects of building styles on perceived walkability during the day. It also tested three other attributes identified as salient in the first study: greenery, number of street elements and street enclosure (or openness) selected from the first study. This experiment had 236 participants (156 women, 78 men and 2 unknown). The mixed effect model of the four variables and perceived walkability in daylight found that greenery, traffic controls (signs and crosswalks), street furniture, the preferred building styles, and enclosure each had a positive effect on perceived walkability. The second experiment tested effects of lighting modes (overhead or peripheral, uniform or non-uniform) and enclosure on perceived walkability after dark. It had 186 participants (117 women, 68 men and 1 unknown). The mixed effect model and three ANOVAs found that uniform lighting and overhead lighting had positive effects alone and in combination on perceived walkability. Two logistic regressions analyzed the socio-demographical differences that women and older adults are more sensitive to street characteristics for walking during the daytime and after dark than did men and the younger.For planners, the finding of five cluster suggests that improving one feature in a cluster might achieve the similar effects to improving any of the others. The results from the experiments offer some practical steps communities can take to improve walkability. The addition of trees, better enclosure, traffic safety cues, and overhead and uniform lighting may well make streets more attractiveness for walking. Future research can test how well the verbal measures apply to on-site walkability and how well the findings apply to other kinds of manipulations, other kinds of streets, locations, and populations.

T1  - Implementation of IoT Networks Based on MQTT for Wildlife Monitoring System
AN  - 2352197014
AB  - Conference Title: 2019 IEEE International Conference on Internet of Things and Intelligence System (IoTaIS)Conference Start Date:  2019,  Nov.  5 Conference End Date:  2019,  Nov.  7 Conference Location: BALI, IndonesiaWith the widespread use of the Internet of Things (IoT), use cases in IoT have been considered for solving social problems in various fields such as agriculture, welfare, disaster prevention, and transportation infrastructure. Additionally, crop damage caused by animals is a common occurrence all over the world. An example of such damage is the damage to agricultural crops and threat to elderly people owing to animals in Hakusan city, Ishikawa prefecture, where the Hakusan campus of the authors' university is located. Presently, measures against damage caused by animals are being implemented by installing animal traps and cages; however, it is necessary to patrol the conditions of capture, thereby increasing human effort. To solve this problem, the authors considered a wildlife monitoring system to remotely manage a cage by using a sensor or camera with Internet connectivity. Assuming that a large number of IoT devices would be used in such a system, the authors visualize a high network load problem. Therefore, the authors aim to reduce the load on the IoT network. In this paper, the part of the wildlife-monitoring system that is concerned the evaluation and consideration of network using MQTT is described.

T1  - Novel Proposal for Prediction of CO<sub>2</sub> Course and Occupancy Recognition in Intelligent Buildings within IoT
AN  - 2335344259
AB  - Many direct and indirect methods, processes, and sensors available on the market today are used to monitor the occupancy of selected Intelligent Building (IB) premises and the living activities of IB residents. By recognizing the occupancy of individual spaces in IB, IB can be optimally automated in conjunction with energy savings. This article proposes a novel method of indirect occupancy monitoring using CO2, temperature, and relative humidity measured by means of standard operating measurements using the KNX (Konnex (standard EN 50090, ISO/IEC 14543)) technology to monitor laboratory room occupancy in an intelligent building within the Internet of Things (IoT). The article further describes the design and creation of a Software (SW) tool for ensuring connectivity of the KNX technology and the IoT IBM Watson platform in real-time for storing and visualization of the values measured using a Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol and data storage into a CouchDB type database. As part of the proposed occupancy determination method, the prediction of the course of CO2 concentration from the measured temperature and relative humidity values were performed using mathematical methods of Linear Regression, Neural Networks, and Random Tree (using IBM SPSS Modeler) with an accuracy higher than 90%. To increase the accuracy of the prediction, the application of suppression of additive noise from the CO2 signal predicted by CO2 using the Least mean squares (LMS) algorithm in adaptive filtering (AF) method was used within the newly designed method. In selected experiments, the prediction accuracy with LMS adaptive filtration was better than 95%.

T1  - Urban Alaskan Moose: An Analysis of Factors Associated with Moose-Vehicle Collisions
AN  - 2298207453
AB  - As human populations continue to grow and encroach into wildlife habitats, instances of human-wildlife conflict are on the rise. Increasing numbers of reported wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) provide tangible evidence of anthropogenic impacts on wildlife as well as increasing threats to human health and safety. Increasing WVCs are of particular concern, especially those involving large-bodied ungulates such as moose (Alces spp.), because of the increased risk of property damage, personal injuries, and human fatalities. Motorists directly involved in a WVC are at risk of injury or mortality, but other motorists are also put at risk due to road obstructions and traffic congestion associated with WVCs. Mitigating these impacts on motorists and wildlife requires investigation into the temporal and spatial factors leading to WVCs.In Alaska, most WVCs involve moose (Alces alces), a large bodied ungulate capable of threatening human life when involved in a collision. Each moose-vehicle collision (MVC) in Alaska is estimated to cost $33,000 in damages. With this analysis, I analyzed the plethora of factors contributing to moose and motorist occurrence on the road system and motorist detection based on a historical dataset of MVC reports throughout Alaska from 2000 to 2012 and a dataset of field-derived measurements at MVC locations within the Matanuska-Susitna Borough from 2016 to 2018. My first analysis focused on the daily and annual trends in MVC rates as compared to expected moose and human behavioral patterns with a focus on guiding mitigation strategies. Fifty percent of the MVCs reported between 2000 and 2012 occurred where the commuter rush hours overlapped with dusk and dawn in winter, and the artificial lighting differences between boroughs suggest a link between artificial lighting and reduced MVCs.To focus more specifically on roadside features contributing to MVC risk, I collected and analyzed local and regional scale land cover and road geometry data at reported MVC sites in an area with a rapidly growing human population. I compared these data to similar data collected at random locations near documented MVC sites and at locations where moose that were fitted with global-positioning system (GPS) transmitters crossed highways. I used generalized additive mixed models to delineate which of the variables impacted the risk of both moose road crossings and MVCs. Moose road crossings were influenced by approximations of spatial, seasonal, and daily moose density as well as the proportion of deciduous-coniferous and coniferous forest in the area and the number of possible corridor or land cover types surrounding the site. The best MVC risk model was described by expected seasonal and daily changes in moose density and local scale measurements, including the sinuosity of the road, the height of vegetation near the road, and the angle between the road surface and the roadside. Together this information should guide transportation and urban planners in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough to use roadside vegetation removal, seasonal speed reduction, improved lighting strategies, dynamic signage, or partnerships with mobile mapping services to reactively reduce MVCs and to focus future road planning in areas with lower moose abundance and build roads that increase visibility and detection distances in areas where moose are common.

T1  - Movement Patterns in the Southern Flying Squirrel (Glaucomys volans) in Urbanized and Rural Environments
AN  - 2234197386
AB  - As the human population continues to grow, urbanization and expansion continue into untouched areas causing fragmentation of forests. Fragmentation restructures a landscape and impacts a variety of flora and fauna, including small mammals. Fitness effects on small mammals caused by forest fragmentation is nuanced, but is negative overall. The New World flying squirrels (genus Glaucomys) in particular, with their direct link to forest trees for food, shelter, and travel, make a good model to understand the effects of fragmentation on forest mammals. This study examined the southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans) in urban and rural fragments in southwestern Illinois. Urban study sites were the three forest patches on the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) campus: Bluebell Woods, Sweet William Woods, and the Western Corridor. The rural study site is privately-owned land north of Edwardsville, IL (McCracken Woods). Squirrels were collared and tracked using radio-telemetry both nocturnally and diurnally. Nighttime tracking was done to establish home range sizes. Daytime tracking was used to determine nesting tree preference. It was predicted that (1) home range sizes will be greater for males than females, (2) trees selected for nesting will be predominantly hard mast trees and (3) of larger size (diameter), and (4) squirrel dispersal will be limited between patches. Home ranges were determined via two methods: 95% minimum convex polygon and 95% kernel estimator. A two-sample equal variance t-test was used to determine differences in male and female home range sizes. General comparisons for home range sizes were also done for site as well as in the context of other studies. Nesting tree preferences for hard mast vs. soft mast were tested via Fisher’s exact test.  Nesting tree diameter size preferences were tested via a Chi-Squared Goodness-of-Fit test. Gap crossing potential was determined via trigonometric calculations. Male squirrel home range sizes were not significantly different from female home range sizes. The minimum convex polygon (MCP) approach indicated squirrels on the SIUE campus had smaller home range sizes than those in McCracken Woods. The 95% kernel density estimator (KDE) indicated no difference among sites. Home ranges in the study were among the lowest described for both MCP and KDE. Low home range estimates may be due in part to some squirrels having a low number of observations (minimum = 5). Flying squirrels selected soft mast trees for nesting significantly more than expected. This preference may be due to greater cavity availability or food source seasonality. Tree size preferences were found to be significant in regard to medium and large trees (> 40 cm diameter) versus small trees (< 40 cm diameter). The finding of larger tree usage was consistent with most other studies. Finally, one male flying squirrel was found to cross between forest patches on the SIUE campus. This dispersal event involved crossing from the Western Corridor to Sweet William Woods through a gap bisected by a road. The most likely route was via a peninsula of trees that extended outward from the Western Corridor. This gap could have been crossed successfully through the air by flying squirrels with near average glide angles. Fire resistant tree plantings should occur to encourage successful crossing by more squirrels. Such a course of action will aid in reconnecting fragmented habitat patches for southern flying squirrels within the campus area. This study on movement patterns in southern flying squirrels in fragmented habitat can inform management practices throughout Illinois with potential benefits for other forest species.

T1  - Moving People for Tigers: Resettlement, Food Security and Landscape-Level Conservation in Central India
AN  - 2133041929
AB  - Resettlement of humans from protected areas conserves habitats for wildlife. However, impacts of resettlement on the well-being of resettled communities and on broader conservation goals at the landscape level have been poorly quantified until now due to inadequate documentation and baseline information. Recent documentation and advances in measurements of human well-being enable studies that examine the impacts of resettlement for both people and conservation.    In India, the current standardized resettlement policy by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) is explicit in its goal to create inviolate habitats for tigers within protected areas. More than 70% of the global tiger population lives in protected areas in India. The central Indian national parks hold approximately 40% of Indian tiger populations. Implementation of the NTCA policy provides an opportunity to study resettlement with relatively accurate records of where resettled households moved, a standardized monetary compensation and the potential for replication with large representative groups to study impacts in various landscapes across the country.    This dissertation focuses on resettlement in Kanha National Park in central India, one of the most well-known and oldest tiger reserves in the country. The Kanha National Park (KNP) landscape mirrors the realities of many people-park interactions in human-dominated areas with high percentages of indigenous human populations, historical forced displacements, and current resettlements that follow a standardized national policy. From a conservation point of view, connectivity between KNP and other protected areas across central India is crucial for genetically healthy tiger populations.    This dissertation consists of three analyses that combine data from field surveys and existing data sources to examine the impacts of resettlement on food security, landscape connectivity for wildlife, and human-wildlife conflict in the KNP landscape. In Chapter 1, I use household surveys to compare the food security and livelihood associations of resettled households compared to their non-resettled neighbors at new settlement locations. I show that resettled households have similar availability and access to foods as their non-resettled neighbors. Increases in off-farm income sources are associated with higher food access for all households. In Chapter 2, I explore the pattern of low food access in the KNP landscape using the five capitals model for sustainable development to illustrate significant associations between livelihood factors and household food access. Salaried stable incomes and kitchen garden diversity are significantly associated with higher food access. Financial capital dwarfs the contributions of social and natural capitals which have supplementary roles in times of financial stress.    In Chapter 3, I address resettlement impacts on habitat connectivity between protected areas and human-wildlife conflict that resettled households face after relocating outside the park. Resettled households are not disproportionately moving into corridors between protected areas, especially when compared to the manifold more non-resettled households already residing in these areas. Resettled households however are moving into areas of high human-wildlife conflict due to their continued proximity to KNP. Outcomes from Chapter 3 also confirm that steady incomes can alleviate forest use and lower human activities in forests reducing human-wildlife conflict. In human-dominated landscapes such as KNP, financial capital and the stability of household incomes can aid both food security, lower pressures on non-protected forests and potentially lower human-wildlife conflict.    The results counter assumptions that resettled communities continue to follow traditional natural resource reliant livelihoods. Local populations are not likely to engage in livelihoods that are heavily reliant on natural resources as rural populations become integrated into urban economies.  The results from this dissertation imply that managers in the KNP landscape can alleviate food security and aid landscape wide conservation goals by increasing off-farm salaried incomes. Finally, in India, there is a high potential for replication of this study around other protected areas, with nationally standardized resettlement in landscapes that vary geographically, ecologically and socially.

T1  - O Corredor Verde Fluvial do Leça: Uma Oportunidade para a Mobilidade no Concelho de Matosinhos
AN  - 2701132647
AB  - O rio Leça tem uma bacia hidrográfica de 307.600 hectares sendo uma das linhas de água mais importantes da Área Metropolitana do Porto (AMP). Atravessa os concelhos de Santo Tirso, Valongo, Maia e Matosinhos, tendo o seu vale ocupação milenar, pelo que é alvo de contínua transformação, refletindo-se na paisagem do vale do Leça, a cada momento, a expressão no território da sociedade.A mobilidade é um dos fatores que mais contribui para a qualidade de vida na cidade. A mobilidade sustentável é hoje entendida como crucial para a sustentação das dinâmicas sociais e económicas da vida urbana. É nesta perspetiva que se considera ser necessário criar uma estrutura intermodal que atenda às necessidades de uso diário da população, sem descurar o recreio e o turismo e que atenda à compatibilização das características multifuncionais das deslocações e ao carácter da paisagem fluvial antrópica do rio Leça.Nestes termos, considera-se ser necessário definir um percurso destinado a ciclistas e peões ao longo do vale do rio Leça no concelho de Matosinhos, no entendimento de que este percurso contribuirá para a mobilidade sustentável no município, e que integrará também a preservação das áreas com elevado valor ecológico, cultural e paisagístico. Pretende-se que o percurso ao longo do Leça contribua para o reforço da identidade deste curso de água.Neste sentido propõe-se a definição do Corredor Verde Fluvial do Leça que incluirá o percurso pedonal, ciclovia, margens do rio leça e interligações com a paisagem do vale e estruturas de mobilidade, numa proposta que visa consolidar as estratégias de mobilidade e de implementação de corredores verdes do concelho, promovendo-se a mobilidade sustentável e a Estrutura Ecológica Municipal.O programa a desenvolver para o Corredor Verde Fluvial do Leça atenderá à requalificação das margens do rio Leça atendendo à recuperação das funções ecológicas e à valorização do património histórico, cultural e natural presente na paisagem.Alternate abstract:The Leça river has a watershed of 307.600 hectares and is one of the most important watercourses of the Metropolitan Area of Porto (AMP - Área Metropolitana do Porto). The river flows across the municipalities of Santo Tirso, Valongo, Maia and Matosinhos having its valley a millenary occupation for which it is constantly being transformed, reflecting the valley’s landscape within the society’s territory in every moment.The mobility is one of the factors that most contributes for a quality of life in the city. Sustainable mobility is nowadays understood as being crucial for sustaining the social dynamics and economies of the urban life. Thus, it is important to consider the need of creating an intermodal structure that supports the daily needs of the population, without compromising the tourism and recreation, and that integrates the multifunctional aspects of the population movements and the anthropical fluvial landscape character of the Leça river.Accordingly, it is considered necessary to define a route for cyclists and pedestrians along the Leça river valley within the municipality of Matosinhos, considering that this route will contribute to a sustainable mobility in the municipality and that will also integrate the preservation of the areas with a high ecological, cultural and landscape value. It is intended that the route along Leça river contributes to the enhancement of the identity of this watercourse.Hence, the definition of the Leça Fluvial Green Corridor is materialized with the pedestrian route, bicyle path, river banks and the interconnections with the valley’s landscape and mobility structures in a proposal that seeks to reinforce the mobility strategies and the green corridors implementation within the municipality promoting a sustainable movability and the municipal’s ecological structure.The development of the Leça Fluvial Green Corridor program will meet the needs of requalification of the Leça river banks throughout the reestablishment of the ecological functions and the valorization of the historical, cultural and natural heritage present in the landscape.

T1  - Protected Area Networks in an Urbanizing Landscape: Spatial Characteristics and Land Acquisition Strategies
AN  - 2165827011
AB  - The selection of land parcels for preservation and protection (i.e. the designation of a “Protected Area”) is inherently a human social process engaging a complex suite of economic, political, and environmental factors. Since the 1960s, the U.S. federal government has encouraged local engagement in land conservation through new funding opportunities. Consequently, in some states a diverse collection of agencies, both public and private, have participated in the selection process. The following research examines whether diverse conservation organizations, sometimes acting with coordinated goals and sometimes acting independently, can collectively assemble a Protected Area network which aligns with some basic principles of biological conservation network design. The spatial patterns of one emerging Protected Forest (PF) network in the New Jersey Highlands are used a case study. This PF network consists of all forested habitat within the New Jersey Highlands Protected Areas. The primary finding are 1) although most large forest fragments have more than 80% of their land protected, medium and smaller-size fragments have less protection, 2) land cover change within 250 meters of PF boundaries is highly variable and has both increased and decreased aspects of landscape permeability along those boundaries for forest species, and 3) land acquisition since 2000 has been proactive, relative to the threat of urban development. Because PA networks should represent and sustain regional biodiversity and ecosystem function, these findings have implications for future PA management. The pattern of protection of large habitat remnants in this region is favorable for sustaining existing ecological communities and processes. The increase in landscape permeability along the boundaries of some Protected Forests is also favorable because this facilitates species movements among protected habitat patches. However, because land acquisition has been highly proactive, the greatest amount of protection has occurred in the northern part of the region where urban development pressure is lower. The resulting uneven geographic distribution in this regional conservation network indicates that sustaining ecological forest communities and processes across the southern portion of the New Jersey Highlands may pose a significant future challenge.

T1  - Biodiversity of Coastal Ecosystems: Exploring Spatial and Temporal Patterns in Intertidal Macroinvertebrate Communities of Sandy Beaches
AN  - 2133637219
AB  - Biodiversity plays a vital role in the function, stability, and resilience of ecosystems. Concern about biodiversity loss and the alteration of ecological communities has driven major efforts to catalog and monitor species in ecosystems across the globe and to quantify relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function. Evaluating responses of biodiversity and community structure to abiotic and biotic drivers, such as climate, disturbance, and species interactions requires comparisons across relevant spatial and temporal scales.    Located at the boundary between land and sea, coastal ecosystems and the biodiversity they support are subject to increasing threats from escalating anthropogenic and climatic impacts. Sandy beach ecosystems, which support unique macroinvertebrate communities and provide irreplaceable ecosystem functions (e.g. nutrient recycling and wildlife support), experience heavy human use and manipulations making them particularly vulnerable to urbanization and environmental change. For temperate sandy beaches the degree of vulnerability is expected to vary with major trophic guilds due to differences in functional, trophic, and life history traits, with greater impacts expected for wrack-associated than lower beach species. To gain insights on mechanisms influencing ecological communities and functioning, I explored questions concerning responses of biodiversity, community structure, and composition of sandy beach ecosystems to environmental and anthropogenic factors operating over a range of temporal and spatial scales for my dissertation research. To evaluate these questions, we conducted 60 intertidal macroinvertebrate surveys at 41 study beaches spanning > 1800 km of California coastline (~9 degrees of latitude) from 2009–2015. These were the first quantitative surveys ever conducted at many of these beaches.    In my first chapter, I addressed the important issue of comparing species richness across surveys conducted using different sampling methods by developing a calibration approach to adjust species richness for sampling effort. In my second chapter, I assessed the direction and magnitude of change in intertidal biodiversity over time by comparing values of species richness from surveys collected > 30 years apart (1970s and 2009–11) using the calibration from my first chapter. In my third chapter, I evaluated ecological impacts of coastal urbanization by comparing intertidal macroinvertebrate communities between urban beaches with intense maintenance regimes and reference beaches lacking such maintenance. In my final chapter, I evaluated spatial patterns in biodiversity, structure, and composition and the role of environmental factors in structuring intertidal macroinvertebrate communities of sandy beaches at different spatial scales.    Overall, findings from my dissertation suggest sandy beaches are more diverse and biogeographically complex than generally acknowledged and that central and southern California beaches may represent a global biodiversity hotspot for intertidal macroinvertebrates. The peak in intertidal species richness of sandy beach macroinvertebrates in temperate latitudes is not consistent with the well-known pattern of a negative trend in species richness with latitude reported for a wide range of ecosystems and taxa. My results highlight the importance of connectivity to donor ecosystems and the strong influence of subsidies on intertidal macroinvertebrate communities of sandy beaches, particularly that of drift macroalgae on wrack-associated species. The functional, trophic, and life history traits of wrack-associated macroinvertebrates, a major component of intertidal diversity (> 40% of species), make this guild disproportionately vulnerable to human and climatic impacts compared with lower beach species. Human impacts associated with urbanization (e.g. mechanized grooming, sediment fills) strongly degraded intertidal macroinvertebrate biodiversity, structure, and function and appeared to influence sandy beach communities more at local than regional spatial scales. Though local scale processes masked the influence regional and global scale processes at most study beaches, we observed biodiversity declines consistent with habitat loss from sea-level rise.

T1  - How multi-lane, one-way street design shapes neighbourhood life: collisions, crime and community
AN  - 1913883123
AB  - Global recognition of the need for more liveable and "complete" streets has allowed for increased funding to bicycle and pedestrian projects. That said, many streets in urban neighbourhoods remain unsafe. This study hypothesises that some of these issues related to safety issues are tied to multi-lane, one-way streets, which exist primarily in urban business districts and historic neighbourhoods, often occupied by poor and minority residents. There has been little research in this area to test how one-way street configurations relate to collisions, crime and community. To examine this, we use three principal strategies: (1) a cross-sectional citywide evaluation using descriptive and inferential statistics on all collisions occurring within a five-year period in a mid-sized city; (2) a focused assessment of traffic collision data, crime data, counts of trees, housing valuation data, foreclosure and vacant and abandoned structures on a 13-block street segment with both one- and two-way streets and (3) a qualitative broken windows assessment, using photography to evaluate signs of visual distress on one-way versus two-way segments. Our results show a higher incidence of collisions and injuries on multi-lane streets than on their two-way counterparts - for motorists, bikes and pedestrians. Our photographic assessment suggests that these street typologies contribute to degradation and erosion of community. Our results show that neighbourhoods with one-way multi-lane streets experience greater abandonment, lower housing values and slower increases in property values. This research supports expanded thinking about one- to two-way street conversion as a method to improve safety, connectivity, community and sustainability.

T1  - Detection of the spatiotemporal patterns of beetle-induced tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) defoliation along the Lower Rio Grande using Landsat TM images
AN  - 1945721661
AB  - The invasive Tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) has long been targeted for removal by land managers in the western United States. Biocontrol of the non-native tamarisk started in 2001 by introducing the tamarisk leaf beetle (Diorhabda spp.) to the riparian ecosystems. Since then, the beetles quickly established and substantial tamarisk defoliation was subsequently observed along river corridors in the western states. The ability to monitor and track the patterns of beetle-induced tamarisk defoliation across space and time is key to understand its impact on ecosystem functioning and processes. In the present study, spatiotemporal patterns of tamarisk defoliation caused by the subtropical tamarisk leaf beetle (D. sublineata) were successfully detected using a classification based method along the Lower Rio Grande in West Texas from 2009 to 2014. Our results indicated that the subtropical beetle species can sustain a dispersal rate of approximately 102 km yr-1 during the first year after release. Tamarisk abundance was the most important factor in directing beetle dispersal. We also found that the beetles preferred to forage within dense, connected tamarisk stands along wide sections of the riparian river corridors. These new findings of our study will help inform the land managers of the possible outcomes of tamarisk biocontrol to make effective management plans.

T1  - Sustainability for Planning Commissioners
AN  - 1896746275
AB  - SUSTAINABILITY IS A BROAD CONCEPT, The root "sustain" means "provide with nourishment, keep going" as defined by Webster, the United Nations' Bruntland Commission defines sustainability as "meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs," The concept of sustainability is a goal that can be applied at all scales of planning, from global to municipal jurisdictions and down to corridors and individual sites.There are many interpretations and applications of die term, but it should not be defined too narrowly. While sustainability of the natural environment is basic, the concept also includes social and economic components. For instance, a diversity of housing in proximity to daily needs or public transportation can have an impact housing opportunities and air quality. Similarly, a lack of diversity in the economic sector can have impacts on the tax base and employment opportunities.A variety of concepts and principles can be followed to achieve sustainability. Planners have smart growth, green infrastructure, complete reels, and transit-oriented design. Architects have LEED design, and landscape architects have the sustainable Sites initiative. Engineers apply strategies for carbon emission reduction, alternative energy systems. and low-impact design. Biologists have strategies for protection and enhancement of endangered habitats and biodiversity. There are also solutions relating to solid waste and hazardous materials.

T1  - Information on Emergent Insect Associated Tree Diseases Including Epidemiological Studies of Drippy Blight Disease of Oak and Thousand Cankers Disease of Walnut
AN  - 2016788874
AB  - Two emergent disease complexes called drippy blight and thousand cankers have become injurious to hardwood trees in communities across the urban corridor of Colorado. In order to better understand these disease complexes, studies were initiated to identify the causal agents, symptomology, and epidemiology of drippy blight disease as well as determine if multiple fungi were involved in thousand cankers disease.   Chapter I, published in the Journal of Arboriculture and Urban Forestry, provides information on the basic biology of drippy blight disease. This article explains the signs and symptoms of drippy blight, and shows that the bacterium Lonsdalea quercina subsp.  quercina is able to cause the disease. Finally, it was noted that a kermes scale insect was abundant on all diseased oaks, but its role as a vector is unknown. Overall, this research documents the microbe and insect causal agents in this disease complex. These findings are biologically significant as the isolated bacterium was able to produce disease on several species of sapling red oaks. This, taken into consideration with other diseases caused by Lonsdalea quercina, implies that this bacterium has the potential to become widespread.   Chapter II provides a detailed life history of Allokermes galliformis,  the insect causal agent in drippy blight disease. Management decisions to mitigate the effects of insect damage are largely based on an understanding of the life cycle. This research documents periods when A. galliformis  may be most exposed and vulnerable to controls and notes areas of the tree where it inflicts damage when feeding. Therefore, the information provided in this chapter can serve as a guide for more informed decisions when considering management of drippy blight-affected trees.   Chapter III considers what insects may be involved in the dissemination of Lonsdalea quercina subsp. quercina from oaks with symptoms of drippy blight disease. Although kermes scales are the most consistent and abundant insects found in association with drippy blight disease, other more mobile insects are frequently observed on diseased trees and it was hypothesized that these may play a role in spreading the bacterial pathogen within trees and to new trees. After testing insects collected on diseased oak trees for bacterial contamination, various insects were documented to carry the bacterium, providing insight into ways the disease may move in a population of susceptible hosts.   Chapter IV, published in Plant Disease, involves a tree disease characterized by an insect and fungal pathogen interaction, thousand cankers disease of walnut. This study investigates whether genetically distinct isolates of the fungal pathogen Geosmithia morbida vary in pathogenicity. Also examined was whether Fusarium solani, commonly found on diseased trees, may contribute to production of thousand cankers disease. A range of Geosmithia morbida isolates were tested alone and in combination with a Fusarium solani isolate to determine the relative contribution of each fungal pathogen to thousand cankers disease. Importantly, in Colorado Geosmithia morbida does not interact synergistically with F. solani.   Overall, this research is the first to describe the emergent disease complex drippy blight and provides information to better understand the bacterial and insect causal agents. Furthermore, the investigations of drippy blight of red oak and thousand cankers disease of walnut, improve our understanding of the epidemiology of woody plant diseases that involve both arthropod and pathogen partners.

T1  - Multiple Controls of Carbon and Nitrogen Processes in Freshwater Wetlands of the Mid-Atlantic United States with Implications for Ecosystem Restoration and Disturbance
AN  - 2015669941
AB  - Biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen and carbon supports the structure and functioning of all ecosystems and provides valued products and services essential to human well-being. Understanding the controls on these cycles and their interactions with ecological components at multiple scales predicts spatial patterns and response to environmental disturbance, guides management of these resources, and informs environmental policy. This dissertation synthesizes research conducted in three different freshwater wetlands to demonstrate interacting drivers of carbon and nitrogen processes that are important for understanding how ecosystems will respond to large anthropogenic modification.    The first two studies in freshwater mesocosms involved tests of the effects of macrophyte planting diversity on biomass production and on three nitrogen cycle processes. Empirical evidence and theory link plant diversity to greater ecosystem functioning. Thirty-four mesocosms were planted with four functionally-distinct macrophyte species across a richness gradient (1, 2, 3, or 4 species). The elevated aboveground biomass of communities in the most species-rich mixtures at the end of the first growing season was temporary, and monocultures of a single species on average produced greater aboveground biomass compared to the most species-rich mixtures by the end of the second growing season. The suppression of biomass production in the two perennials was attributed to a dominant annual found commonly in palustrine wetlands of northern Virginia and early successional vegetation communities. The second study evaluated whether plant richness, along with biomass and tissue N content, had positive effects on soil N processing—ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification—at the end of the second growing season. Greater species richness was related to greater net ammonification potential, but lower net nitrification potential and denitrification potential. By contrast, lower biomass and/or lower tissue N content, characteristics of the two annuals, had stimulatory effects on all three nitrogen processes.    The results of the first two studies inform the design of newly-planted restored wetlands and highlight the tradeoffs between managing for multiple ecosystem functions. This research adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that restored ecosystems may not maximize all ecosystem functions and demonstrates that establishing plant diversity in early-successional wetland plant communities may come at the expense of plant productivity and soil biogeochemical development. At the same time, the identification of mechanisms that inhibit these wetland functions suggests restoration designs for alleviating that inhibition ( e.g., spatial or temporal heterogeneity in hydrologic conditions) to best promote multiple functions in restored wetlands.    The third and fourth studies were investigations of the controls of denitrification in floodplains of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Largescale characteristics of floodplains, including hydrogeomorphic or landscape features ( i.e., climate, physiography, or ecosystem patterns), are of practical use for the prediction of denitrification due to emerging largescale datasets and because these characteristics may aggregate the effects of local vegetation or soil biogeochemical characteristics on denitrification. Results from the investigation of 18 nontidal floodplains indicated that the highest rates of denitrification are likely to be found in agricultural and urban watersheds with stream-floodplain hydrologic connectivity promoting sedimentation. All largescale predictors, including seasonal air temperature and channel width-to-depth ratio, explained between 43–57% of variation in the denitrification measurements and should be useful for prediction across the Chesapeake Bay watershed. In a study of TFFWs in Virginia, potential for denitrification and nitrate-limitation of denitrification were studied along two adjacent rivers that differed notably in concentrations and loads of nitrogen (Pamunkey River carries more nitrogen than the Mattaponi River). Patterns of denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) in TFFWs were found along a longitudinal gradient but not between rivers. DEA was greater in all tidal wetlands (three sites on each river) than nontidal forested wetlands (one site on each river). Further, DEA was positively related to soil organic matter, carbon, and nitrogen, and negatively related to bulk density in tidal hummocks, relationships which were all mediated by a longitudinal gradient with highest DEA rates at the lower tidal sites. Modification to hydrogeomorphic processes from accelerated sea level rise may alter these longitudinal gradients in TFFWs.    The results of the third and fourth studies inform currently poor understanding of denitrification patterns in floodplains at landscape and regional scales. The studies both demonstrate the existence of largescale predictable patterns in denitrification that have only rarely been demonstrated in the literature. The identification of these patterns alleviate uncertainty in the process given its highly variable nature, which has stymied attempts to confidently extrapolate denitrification rates from one floodplain to another. As such, the research findings on hotspots of the process guides the prioritization of nontidal floodplains for the purposes of restoration as well as predicts how nitrogen removal capabilities of TFFWs will change given quickening sea level rise.

T1  - Using Roadkill as a Lens to Understand Animal Movement and Mortality
AN  - 1943345576
AB  - This study took place within the Oak Openings Region, a biodiversity hotspot in northwestern Ohio. The Oak Openings was created during the Cenozoic period, a time where glaciers continuously moved across Ohio, creating valleys and riverbeds. When the Wisconsin glaciers melted back from Ohio around 14,000 years ago, waters were released into multiple lakes with sandy beaches. Overtime, these sandy beaches started to became dunes inundated by rainwater that could not drain past the clayey till and bedrock ground layer. Water that would stand between the clay layer and sandy dunes provided moisture to eventually support oak savanna habitat. Between the sand ridges, rainwater would saturate the land, which created open areas of wet prairie (Higgins, 2003; Grigore, 2004). The combination of oak savanna habitat and open wet prairie gave this region the name of "Oak Openings" (Grigore, 2004).   Today, the Oak Openings looks quite different as a result of the economic development and agricultural pursuits along the Toledo-Detroit corridor. This area is highly fragmented by roads, agricultural fields and urban/residential development. Roughly 45% of the Oak Openings Region contains urban and suburban development and roughly a quarter of the region has been converted to areas of agricultural production (Schetter and Root, 2011). However, there are still remnants of wild lands that exist west and south of the city of Toledo. This area is Ohio's largest single surficial sand covering which is 1-12 meters thick and consists of wet lowland and sand ridge terrain with elevations up to 210 meters above sea level. This region is approximately 8 kilometers wide and 32 kilometers long (Higgins, 2003; Figure 1) and contains oak savanna, oak woodland and wet prairie habitats on post glacial beach ridges and swales and covers 478 km2 (The Nature Conservancy, 2001; Grigore, 2004; Schetter and Root, 2011).   The Oak Openings Region contains one third of all of Ohio's endangered plant communities as well as many rare animals and early successional ecosystems. However, only about 10% of the Oak Openings Region is in protected areas (Abella et al., 2007). Early successional ecosystems in this area (e.g. oak savannas and prairies) were historically maintained by disturbances such as fire. Now, these disturbances are mimicked by management activities such as prescribed fires and thinning. In Ohio there are two preserves known as the Oak Openings Preserve and Maumee State Forest, which are the largest protected areas and support many different vertebrate populations and species. However, these two preserves are also highly fragmented by agricultural fields, roadways, railways, and trails that may limit animal movement and increase road mortality. Therefore, it is critical to better understand animal movement and road mortality in this area to promote viable populations, increase our knowledge of vertebrate movement and prevent the killing of vertebrate species by vehicle collisions.    This thesis has two foci, each as the topic of stand-alone chapters. The overarching goal is to predict animal movement and identify the features that may be managed to reduce road mortality, which is likely to be applicable to other reserves in human-dominated landscapes. The objective of the first chapter is to understand what factors influence animal movements and road mortality. Specifically, the first chapter examines how structural features of roads, environmental variables, spatial factors and land cover types can influence vertebrate movement (e.g. mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians) and road mortality on roads surrounding and within the Oak Openings Preserve and Maumee State Forest. Road surveys as well as visual surveys on trails within both protected areas were utilized to account for animal movement, dispersal and mortality.   The second chapter focuses on mammal movement patterns and road mortality on roads surrounding and within the Oak Openings Preserve and Maumee State Forest. Similar to chapter I, road and visual surveys along trails were utilized to understand mammal movement and mortality. Mammals were found as roadkill more than any other taxa, so it is important to specifically understand what factors influence these trends. Again, structural features of roads, environmental variables, spatial factors and land cover types were all analyzed to understand what influences mammal movement and mortality.

T1  - The Blackrock Yard: Reconsidering Transitional Landscapes of Infrastructure
AN  - 1928900403
AB  - The decline of industry has frequently lead to disinvestment into rail corridors in both the City of Buffalo and elsewhere throughout the United States and other First World countries. Rail companies and the industries they served historically used these rail corridors and immediately surrounding spaces, yet even after the decline of industry and disinvestment by rail companies, these spaces have continued to operate and function in ways unplanned for and largely uncontrolled by the official property owners and designers. After a large decline of rail use in these sites there were some initial overt and intentional and planned physical alterations, frequently including the physical demolition or removal of tracks, signals, switches, and storage units. Unplanned and undesigned alterations and occurrences, including natural (vegetation) regeneration, the proliferation of animal activity, and the increase in human activity, in the form of pedestrian, bicycle, and ATV travel throughout the site, can also be seen throughout many of these areas. Parts of the site are still active and facilitate active rail lines, but even where these “official” uses do not exist, there are well-maintained paths, and established and maintained trails, despite no grounds crew or maintenance staff. There are clearly defined spaces, despite there being no designer.   These corridors are undefined but not abandoned spaces that are described by Ignasi de Solà-Morales Rubió as terrain vague, and operate separately from the defined and structured urban form around them. Despite their unofficial status and lack of widespread acknowledgment or recognition, these spaces continue to serve an important role to neighborhood residents, plant, and wildlife. The popularity and observed but largely undocumented busyness in these corridors stands is partly supported by new zoning codes and piecemeal planning in the City of Buffalo, but runs contrary to the residential development and exclusiveness uses occurring elsewhere in the city. Intentionally tentative and subtle interventions are proposed in and around these sites, with a primary focus on the Black Rock Yard in the northwest section of Buffalo. These interventions include access control and filtering structures and strategies coupled with branding and wayfinding, as well as observation and gathering structures located within the site, acting to further legitimize and offer a more defined sense of belonging to a diversity of site users. Further research will study the inherent equity of access these sites offer, as well more closely tied integration strategies connecting this site to the surrounding neighborhoods.

T1  - Assessing the Impact of Asian Longhorned Beetle in Worcester, MA: Thermal Effects, Community Responses, and Future Vulnerability
AN  - 1928890752
AB  - Urban environments experience air, water, noise, and heat pollution as a consequence of their composition, structure, and function. These adverse environmental conditions, which have direct and indirect effects on human health and ecological stability, can be mitigated or partially offset by healthy and extensive urban forests. Additionally, urban trees provide a number of cultural, aesthetic, and property value benefits. However, to provide maximum ecosystem service benefits, an urban forest must be carefully planned and maintained, so that average tree lifespan is maximized and ecological vulnerability is minimized. Maximal urban forest resilience is best achieved via taxonomic and age-diversity, such that no one genus or age-cohort dominates. This diversity enhances overall urban forest resilience, which in turn facilitates maximum ecosystem service provision. The Asian Longhorned Beetle (ALB,  Anoplophora glabripennis) infestation in Worcester, MA represents a case example of taxonomic monoculture vulnerability, but also an excellent opportunity to reinvest and diversify the urban forest. As a result of the ALB infestation, which was first documented in 2008, approximately 35,000 host trees were removed from residential and public property, substantially reducing urban tree canopy coverage and uncovering impervious surfaces. Chapter two quantifies this Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) loss, and shows that in loss areas Land Surface Temperature (LST) increases range from 1 – 6° C. The research investigates multi-scale effects of this relationship, particularly in the hard-hit Burncoat and Greendale neighborhoods of Worcester, MA. In response to the large quantity of UTC loss suffered due to ALB, the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR), the City of Worcester, and the Worcester Tree Initiative (WTI) have together planted over 30,000 trees, primarily via tree giveaway programs to local residents. Chapter three assesses the effectiveness of this initiative in terms of juvenile tree mortality rates – a critical indicator of long-term urban forest success. Results indicate that tree stewardship variables such as renter proportion and number of trees planted per property are strong predictors of tree mortality. Tree species was shown to be strong predictor of mortality, with ornamental trees showing lower mortality rates than shade deciduous or conifers. Finally, Chapter four investigates the potential risk of further ALB infestation in the Worcester area, using a circuit theory dispersal model, which uses an analogy with electrical circuits to predict the dispersal of random-walkers across a heterogeneous landscape. The results indicate that impervious surfaces such as roads, sidewalks, and parking lots, as well as proximity to existing trees are facilitators of ALB movement. Circuit-based dispersal maps highlight the importance of narrow dispersal corridors connecting larger areas of potential dispersal. Dispersal potential was combined with ALB habitat suitability measured with Mahalanobis typicality, yielding a hybrid map of ALB infestation risk. These map products are valuable both as contributions to the understanding of invasive species movement in novel environments, and as tools for land managers attempting to eradicate ALB, such as the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. This dissertation investigates three elements of the ALB infestation of Worcester, providing a holistic explanation of the impacts, recovery, and vulnerability of Worcester’s urban forest.

T1  - Home Range of Rehabilitated Antillean Manatees in Belize and the Role of Benthic Vegetation in Visitation
AN  - 1927469330
AB  - Antillean manatees, Trichechus manatus manatus, are an endangered subspecies of the West Indian manatee, with fragmented populations throughout their range. Belize is thought to support the largest population of Antillean manatees (800 – 1,000 individuals). As coastal development and tourism increase, destruction of vital manatee habitat, including seagrass beds and mangroves, and watercraft collisions are also increasing. Chapter 2 focused on estimating the home range of two rehabilitated manatees in Belize, F1 and M1. The objectives were to (1) estimate home range of two rehabilitated and released manatees in Belize and identify areas frequently used by the manatees, and (2) identify differences in home range size and make inferences about potential causes for such differences. Kernel density estimators were used to calculate home ranges and core areas in R v3.2.5, using the adehabitat library. It was predicted that M1 would have larger home range and core area sizes, potentially attributed to mother calf bonding time in the wild. Post release 95% home range for F 1 was 49.51 km2 and 50% core area was 3.79 km 2. Post release 95% home range for M1 was 971.69 km 2 and 50% core area was 161.38 km2. Results of the range analysis and movements patterns show differences between both individuals for post release, but relatively similar movement patterns and home range for soft release, which could indicate bias in soft release movement based on care taker influence. The results of this study show that F1 made clear and repetitive movements within a cluster of habitats near where she was released, unlike M1 who only stayed in the Corozal Bay Wildlife Sanctuary (CBWS) for about a week, after which he traveled down the coast to Belize City and The Drowned Cayes. Studies have shown that males tend to show less site fidelity and travel further distances. This study reflects similar results. However, as time in the wild progresses, behavior and movement patterns could change. Future studies should focus on tracking individuals for as long as possible during post release to observe changes.   The objective of the second study was to infer relationships between movement patterns of the M1 and the vegetation in those areas. A quadrat was used to estimate percent cover and species richness along a 10 m transect. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed significant differences among Places, Primary Corridors, Secondary Corridors, and No Visit sites, with regards to percent cover of T. testudinum (P= 0.002) and combined cover of seagrasses (P= 0.019). Spearman’s correlation coefficients between visit number and the independent variables show a positive correlation. After applying a Bonferroni correction and adjusting the calculated P-values, only three of the comparisons were significant: visit with T. testudinum  (P< 0.001), visit with combined seagrasses (P= 0.006), and visit with combined cover for all species (P= 0.042). This study demonstrates that more highly used areas were positively correlated with T. testudinum,  the combined cover of T. testudinum and  H. wrightii, and the combined cover of all species. Future management strategies, as well as research, should focus on identifying and protecting critical habitats of manatees in Belize.

T1  - The Viability of Conservation Subdivisions as Habitat for Urban Carnivores in North Central Texas Suburbs
AN  - 1920065211
AB  - The purpose of this research is to examine perceptions of conservation subdivisions as habitat for urban carnivores in North Central Texas suburbs. This research was conducted through the University of Texas at Arlington; Landscape Architecture Program. The literature review examines the history of conservation subdivisions and their use within North Central Texas as well as their application as an ecological solution to present-day threats to biodiversity with a focus on mammalian apex carnivores. It further explores their use as habitat in the context of urban patches and corridors. Additionally, the practice of bioregionalism was reviewed in contrast to current political boundaries governing North Central Texas cities as related to conservation subdivisions. This study targets conservation subdivisions located within the North Central Texas Councils of Government (NCTCOG), the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) metropolitan statistical area of North Texas. The subdivision ecoregions represented include Cross Timbers and Blackland Prairies.   The study employs qualitative research methods to gain insight into participant perceptions. Phone interviews were compiled from 14 Interview subjects chosen for their professional work related to or knowledge of conservation subdivisions or urban ecology in the study area. All respondents consented to be named and are considered experts in their field. Findings were attained through a process of rigorous coding methods and domain analysis.   As the profession of landscape architecture increases its reach and influence in our natural and built world, it is important to gain awareness of urban development in various contexts. In the context of conservation subdivisions in North Central Texas suburbs, this research furthers public and professional knowledge concerning urban wildlife habitat for urban carnivores and its implications towards conservation efforts overall.   These data support the view that conservation subdivisions are, in part, a viable solution as a conservation tool and are perceived as viable habitat for urban carnivores in the study area. However, further community education and research are needed to expand the effective use of conservation subdivisions in North Texas. The development of conservation subdivisions in the study area is perceived as a developer marketing tool to increase profits and fall short of intended conservation goals lacking actionable long-term maintenance plans. Recommendations based on the findings and for future research are presented to improve the future sustainability of urban wildlife habitat and therefore increase wildlife diversity and open space conservation within high-density, metropolitan areas.

T1  - Environmental filtering of wild bee assemblages in New York City parks and community gardens
AN  - 1897027864
AB  - Evidence suggests that bee declines are occurring on a global scale. One contributing factor to these declines may be habitat loss and fragmentation associated with urbanization. Using bee abundance data from New York City parks and gardens, I examined how bee communities are partitioned within this large metropolitan area by looking at environment filters at the landscape and local scales. At the landscape scale, I examined factors that differentiate bee communities between parks and gardens by constructing a mitochondrial coxl-based phylogeny; clades were characterized based on their association with habitat type and functional traits for each species were overlain on the phylogeny to examine patterns of ecological clustering. At the local scale, I investigated environmental factors (i.e., available sunlight, floral diversity, garden size and surrounding green space) that might influence bee diversity patterns among community gardens. I performed multiple regression analyses to identify models which best explained differences in bee abundance, richness and diversity. At the landscape level, species commonly found in parks tended to be soil nesting species that emerge as adults in early spring. Species associated with gardens were more commonly cavity nesters or oligoleges of plants commonly found in community gardens. At the local scale, bee abundance was primarily influenced by available sunlight, whereas richness and diversity were influenced by a combination of sunlight, floral diversity and surrounding green space. We suggest that efforts to conserve bees in cities should consider issues related to sunlight availability, suitable nesting resources, and habitat connectivity.

T1  - The social connectivity of urban rivers
AN  - 1864569318; PQ0003931434
AB  - By social connectivity we refer to the communication and movement of people, goods, ideas, and culture along and across rivers, recognizing longitudinal, lateral, and vertical connectivity, much as has been described for other rivers for hydrology and ecology. We focus on rivers as they pass through cities, and the relationships between these rivers and city dwellers. Historically, the most important longitudinal connectivity function of rivers was their role as major transport routes and the simplification of formerly complex, irregular banks and beds, into straight, uniform shipping channels has resulted in a loss of lateral and vertical connectivity, notably the quotidian uses such as fishing, washing clothes, water supply, swimming and other recreation. The scale of the river itself, and its scale in comparison to the scale of the city, largely determine the river's social function and the degree to which it influences city form. River width affects the perception of 'closeness' of the other bank, ease of bridging the river, influence of the river on the city's street pattern, and type of waterfront uses that occur. Up to 15m wide, people can converse, whereas across rivers ~50 to ~200m wide, people are not recognizable but still clearly visible, instilling the banks with a 'lively' atmosphere. At widths over ~200m, people blur, yet moving vehicles and trees branches shaking in wind may still provide some dynamic elements to an otherwise static landscape composed of building facades. In exceptionally wide rivers, the city on the opposite bank is little more than a skyline, which often becomes a signature and symbol of regional identity. In contemplating how people use rivers, we can define a range of human activities in relation to height above the water (i.e., instream to banktop), a vertical dimension of human connectivity with rivers. Many uses occur on the top of the bank, such as quiet contemplation, walking, or cycling along a riverside trail, while others depend on contact with the water itself, such as wading, diving, and canoeing (which presupposes adequate water quality). Many of these relationships are illustrated by the challenge of reconnecting Cairo with the Nile.

T1  - Comparing access for all: disability-induced accessibility disparity in Lisbon
AN  - 1854745367
AB  - It is well known that individual impairments create disparities in the accessibility of individuals to opportunities, lengthening the distances or time needed to reach them or even completely impeding access. However, the accurate calculation and representation of these disparities remain a major challenge for urban and transportation planners. In this paper, we adopt the concept of accessibility disparity, originally applied to measure place accessibility by different modes of transport, to measure and represent the accessibility of individuals with physical disabilities compared to those without disabilities. We use spatial network analysis to calculate spatial connectivity and the accessibility of Lisbon's city center, revealing what we define as 'disability-induced accessibility disparity'. Our results reveal not only the locations responsible for reduced accessibility, i.e., barriers and/or deterrents to movement, but also how much any given disparity reduces the accessibility of an individual, allowing the use of this methodology by planners to identify critical areas and to design inclusive public spaces.

T1  - Modelling the Influence of Aquatic Vegetation on the Hydrodynamics of an Alternative Bank Protection Measure in a Navigable Waterway: Research & Management
AN  - 1848482983
AB  - Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become an effective tool for assessing hydrodynamics in complex environments. This paper reports on a CFD study of navigation-induced flows in a shallow, wave-protected, littoral habitat of the urban Spree River. It was constructed as a rehabilitation structure for aquatic organisms and subject to abundant growth of aquatic and riparian vegetation. This study aims to quantify the hydrodynamics induced by vessel movements and its consequences for water exchange and lateral connectivity between the habitat and the main channel with three representative, natural densities of aquatic plants.

              
The simulations revealed both high efficiency of the rehabilitation structure in reducing hydrodynamic forces in the littoral and a superimposed reduction of hydrodynamic forces, and increase of flushing time with increased plant cover. Higher vegetation density resulted in lower wave propagation and lower connectivity of the rehabilitation structure with the fairway. Thus, natural succession of aquatic vegetation in the shallow habitats leads to increasing isolation and finally to terrestrialization. Maintaining the functionality of the rehabilitation structure as habitat for other aquatic organisms requires either plant removal or preferably adaptive modification, e.g. by successively increasing the openings to the main channel and letting the plants take over the protective function of the technical facilities. The developed CFD model helps to find hydrodynamically optimized solutions and to support decision-making process for maintaining littoral refuges for plants and weak swimming organisms in navigable waterways.

T1  - Riverine Landscape Patches Influence Trophic Dynamics of Riparian Ants: Research & Management
AN  - 1826491068
AB  - Food webs in riparian corridors are increasingly viewed as embedded in complex riverine landscapes characterized by an amalgam of aquatic, semi-aquatic, and terrestrial habitats. However, the influence of riverine landscape pattern on trophic dynamics of riparian consumers remains largely unknown. We used naturally abundant stable isotope ratios ([delta]15N) to compare trophic structure of ants (Formica subsericea) among riparian patch types (crop, grass/herbaceous, gravel bar, lawn, mudflat, shrub, swamp, and woody vegetation) at 12 riverine landscapes distributed along an urban-rural landscape gradient of the Scioto River, Ohio, USA. We expected that the diet of F. subsericea, a common generalist consumer, would reflect local prey availability and thus differences in trophic dynamics among patch types. Mean ant [delta]15N was higher in crop patches than in any other patch type, and was lowest in grass/herbaceous, lawn, shrub, and woody vegetation patches, suggesting that patch type was associated with trophic position of F. subsericea. We also found that the range of [delta]15N, and thus trophic breadth, was significantly different by patch type, with woody vegetation exhibiting the greatest spread. Variability in canopy, tree and shrub cover, and the degree of urban development was positively correlated with [delta]15N range (R2=0.78), pointing to the role of habitat structure in mediating trophic breadth of riparian ants. These findings provide evidence that riverine landscape pattern can strongly influence trophic dynamics of riparian arthropods. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T1  - Flood control structures in tidal creeks associated with reduction in nursery potential for native fishes and creation of hotspots for invasive species
AN  - 1799888142
AB  - Habitat connectivity is important for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem processes yet globally is highly restricted by anthropogenic actions. Anthropogenic barriers are common in aquatic ecosystems; however, the effects of small-scale barriers such as floodgates have received relatively little study. Here we assess fish communities in ten tributaries over the spring-summer season of the lower Fraser River (British Columbia, Canada), five with floodgates and five reference sites without barriers, located primarily in agricultural land use areas. While the Fraser River supports the largest salmon runs in Canada, the lower Fraser river-floodplain ecosystem has numerous dikes and floodgates to protect valuable agricultural and urban developments. Floodgate presence was associated with reduced dissolved oxygen concentrations, threefold greater abundance of invasive fish species, and decreased abundances of five native fish species, including two salmon species. These findings provide evidence that floodgates decrease suitable habitat for native fishes, and become hotspots for non-native species. Given climate change, sea-level rise, and aging flood protection infrastructure, there is an opportunity to incorporate biodiversity considerations into further development or restoration of this infrastructure.

T1  - Ecology of Carnivorous Species in Urban Ecosystems: Are they Adapted?
AN  - 2700778003
AB  - Com o atual crescimento das populações humanas, principalmente em zonas urbanas, o crescimento das áreas urbanas atingiu proporções nunca antes vistas. Este processo tem levado à destruição e fragmentação dos habitats e, consequentemente, à criação de habitats com novas características. Existe, então, a necessidade de estudar o impacto que o crescimento urbano provoca nas populações selvagens existentes nesses locais (parques e jardins urbanos). Perceber quais são os fatores que modificam a densidade e diversidade das populações de mamíferos é essencial para selecionar politicas de gestão ao nível da conservação da biodiversidade. O presente estudo visa avaliar o nível de adaptação dos carnívoros presentes nos dois locais de estudo (Jardim Botânico da Universidade de Coimbra e Mata Nacional do Choupal), bem como a densidade dos micromamíferos (presas). A foto-armadilhagem, capturas de micromamíferos e a análise de excrementos foram as técnicas utilizadas para a realização deste estudo. Considerando os resultados obtidos nos dois locais, foram observados maiores valores de diversidade e densidade no Choupal (peri-urbano). O Jardim Botânico (urbano) tem baixos valores de densidade de micromamíferos e uma quase inexistência de carnívoros. Os resultados de densidade registados no Choupal permitiram perceber que os habitats urbanos podem possuir densidades mais altas comparativamente às obtidas em zonas rurais. Relativamente ao nicho ecológico, a maior sobreposição de nicho foi registada entre a raposa e o texugo, o que indica que estas espécies podem coexistir e dividir os recursos disponíveis.Conclui-se que a fragmentação nos habitats, provocada pelo desenvolvimento urbano, pode provocar isolamento e perda de recursos, afectando populações selvagens. Estas alterações irão provocar mudanças nas estruturas populacionais, causando diferenças na adaptação das diferentes espécies, o que poderá levar à perda de biodiversidade. São então necessários mais estudos em ecologia urbana, de forma a propor acções para mitigar estesefeitos, como por exemplo a criação de corredores ecológicos, para que se permita a movimentação das plantas e animais entre os diferentes fragmentosAlternate abstract:With the current growth of human populations, mainly in urban zones, the growth of areas occupied by cities has reached proportions never seen before. This process has been leading to the destruction and fragmentation of habitats and, consequently, to the appearance of habitats with new characteristics. Therefore, there is a need to study the impact that urban growth causes on wild populations that live in those spaces (parks and urban gardens). Understanding which factors modify the density and diversity of mammal populations is essential to select management policies regarding conservation of biodiversity. The present study aims to evaluate the level of adaptation of carnivores represented in both places where this study was undertaken (Botanical Garden of University of Coimbra and Choupal National Forest) and the density of small mammals (preys). Camera-trapping, life trapping and scats analysis were the techniques chosen to perform this study. Considering the results obtained in both places, higher values of diversity and density were observed in Choupal National Forest (peri-urban). Botanical Garden (urban) showed lower values of density of small mammals, and almost a total inexistence of carnivores. Density estimates obtained for Choupal allowed to understand that urban habitats may possess higher densities, when compared to the ones obtained in another studies carried out in rural areas. Regarding ecological niches, the higher overlap was observed between the Red fox and European badger, which indicates that these species are able to coexist and share the available resources.It is then possible to conclude that habitats’ fragmentation, caused by urban development, may lead to isolation and loss of resources, affecting wild populations. These changes will lead to alterations in population structures, causing differences in the adaptation of the different species, which may cause loss of biodiversity. More studies in urban ecology are needed, to propose actions capable of mitigating these effects, as the creation ofecological corridors to allow the movement of plants and animals between different patches.

T1  - The Role of Spatial Heterogeneity and Urban Pattern in Modulating Ecosystem Services
AN  - 1884277983
AB  - The shift of global populations to cities heralds a new epoch marked by human impact, the Anthropocene, and with it radical changes to the biosphere. Some of the most significant change has occurred in developing countries, where amenity migration to rural areas within commuting distance of expanding urban centers has fundamentally restructured the configuration, hydrology and ecologies of surrounding watersheds. The export of urbanization to the countryside is manifested by rapid conversions of greenfields to impervious covers designed for human use, conversions that have consumed and fragmented networks of green infrastructure supporting growing populations. While the benefits of urbanization to human populations have been substantial, the ability of novel and evolving landscapes to sustain the production of environmental services, such as the ability to purify water, sequester climate-changing carbon, and harbor biodiversity, is poorly understood and historically shown to be compromised. The pace of urbanization, and particularly the combinatorial effects of climate change and development-caused hydrological alteration, has made the task of managing landscapes for human well-being increasingly difficult. Given the persistence of land change drivers such as urban population growth, there is a critical need to describe the trajectory of land cover change using both theory and projection, and anticipate impacts associated with urban form in order to proactively respond to environmental vulnerabilities.    A socio-ecological systems approach to the challenge of sustainable environmental provisioning has facilitated efforts to understand the dynamics of co-evolving human and environmental systems. However, a lack of concise theory regarding urban pattern and process, and the paucity of representative case study, has left the role of spatial structure in modulating ecosystem function largely unexplored. To overcome some of these challenges, I describe a series of three related studies where I used a novel integration of land change and ecosystem services simulations in order to map and measure the co-evolution of human and natural systems in transitioning socio-ecological landscapes (SEL), and generate ecosystemscale cause and effect data. In the first study I used this data to estimate the costs of waterborne non-point source pollution, carbon sequestration, and land cover based revenues for a rapidly urbanizing model system over a 24 year period. I also compared the effect associated with alternative patterns of urban growth, contrasting sprawl, infill and de-regulated scenarios with business as usual trends to gauge the effectiveness of environmental planning paradigms, such as “smart growth”. In the second, I tested the capacity a leading theory to explain the role of spatial heterogeneity in modulating ecosystem function in urban systems, to induce the integrated simulation results. Using structural equation modeling to translate the conceptualizations of Alberti (2005) into testable hypotheses, I tested for direct, indirect and modulating effects of landscape composition, connectivity, form, and land use intensity on the production of NPSP and carbon storage. In the third I examined land cover projection data for the presence of patterns suggesting that landscapes evolved in predictable ways. Using a dynamic proxy to bridge human and environmental effect, I tracked the evolution of connectivity in urbanizing watersheds by holding magnitude of change constant for three pattern alternative, and analyzing spatial configuration using distance-based, structural and circuit-based methods. These methods represent a move to predictive, rather than reactive, analytical paradigm, and allow us to move beyond the focus of managing current problems. They emphasize the utility of integrated urban growth-ecosystem service analyses in order to anticipate environmental trade-offs likely required by society. My findings emphasize the need for ecosystem service analyses to more adequately understand development tradeoffs in the metropolitan context. We conclude that not all urban growth impacts environments evenly, and that by controlling the compositional mix, configuration and connectedness, not just the amount of development, we can influence more benign environmental outcomes. To reduce environmental impacts regionally, planners are advised to manage amplifying effects of development by maintaining land cover diversity, and limiting the connectivity of developed land covers along hydrological gradients.

T1  - Movement and population structure of cerambycid beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) and white-footed deermice (<i>Peromyscus leucopus</i>) on a fragmented forest landscape
AN  - 1776481153
AB  - Cerambycid beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) locate suitable hosts and mates using both pheromones and plant volatiles, many of which have been identified and are now produced synthetically for trap lures. The range over which these lures attract cerambycids within a forest, and the tendency for cerambycids to move out of a forest in response to these lures, have not been previously explored to our knowledge. We conducted two field experiments using baited and unbaited flight intercept traps in northern Delaware to investigate these questions. Within forest fragments, traps that were 2 m from the baited trap, but not 10 or 20 m, captured more beetles than control traps suggesting relatively short-range and nonspecific attraction by these lures. In contrast, male  Prionus laticollis (Drury), which were attracted by the female-produced sex pheromone 3,5-dimethyldodecanoic acid, were rarely caught in unbaited traps at any distance from baited traps. Baited traps attracted significantly more cerambycids than unbaited traps outside of the forest at distances up to 40 m from the forest edge, with catch generally decreasing between 8 and 40 m from the forest. Some cerambycids were caught in both baited and unbaited traps at all distances from the forest edge, indicating that at least some cerambycids disperse freely outside of the forest independent of any pheromone attractants. Our results provide context to previous studies that used these pheromone lures, and offer insights into the dispersal behavior of cerambycids.    Forest fragmentation and human development undoubtedly affect wildlife movement on a landscape, but this effect likely varies by species. We analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two species of cerambycid beetles and in white- footed deermice (Peromyscus leucopus) to determine the population structure of these species on the same fragmented landscape in northern Delaware. White-footed deermice showed more population structure than either cerambycid species, indicating that cerambycids are more capable of movement among forest fragments. The cerambycid Xylotrechus colonus  showed less population structure than Prionus laticollis, which may be explained by both dispersal ability and life history differences. Our study highlights the importance of using diverse study species to assess connectivity and movement on a human-dominated landscape.

T1  - ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF THE URBAN PARK CHICO MENDES, PORTO ALEGRE - RS, BRAZILDIAGNOSE THE ENVIRONMENTAL CHICO MENDES MUNICIPAL PARK, PORTO ALEGRE- RS, BRASIL
AN  - 1684278974
AB  - The environmental impacts in this XXI century increased dangerously and, thus, was reinforced the paradigm of maintaining the environment. In the context of an urban forest, was recommended the increase of green areas and the connectivity between them, as well as encourage greater use of native essences, even as an expansion in the diversity of species. The aim of this study was to diagnose the environmental conditions of Chico Mendes Municipal Park. The qualitative analysis of avifauna and plant was based on the presence and absence compared to other studies. The Sørensen index was estimated for flora and avifauna, and a review of the phytosanitary conditions of tree specimens. Thus, in the present study were cataloged 51 species of birds in the Chico Mendes Park, being 23 considered migratory and 28 as residents, 2 species of amphibians, reptiles 10, 9 mammals and 55 plants. The Sørensen index for avifauna expressed a similarity value of 0.65420 when compared to other studies; while the same index for tree flora was in order of 0.37500. It is necessary the development of awareness and transformation tools that promote behavioral change in the surrounding community.

T1  - Conservation Status Of Lwafi Game Reserve, Tanzania
AN  - 1728919188
AB  - Rich in biodiversity, Tanzania's protected areas (PAs) are internationally recognized as of primary conservation value. Biodiversity loss continues, however, and limited understanding of ecological stocks and limited funding for management are making it harder to plan and carry out conservation activities.  Lwafi Game Reserve (GR) is an important part of the conservation network in western Tanzania that falls in the Katavi - Rukwa ecosystem in Rukwa Region, Tanzania. I examined the role of Lwafi GR in protecting wildlife and facilitating movements between Katavi National Park (NP) and Loasi and Kalambo Forest Reserves (FRs). In particular I assessed the abundance and distribution of Lwafi GR mammals, determined signs of movements of mammals between Lwafi GR and Loasi and Kalambo FRs and possibly further into Zambia, established and quantified threats to the survival of wildlife in Lwafi GR, and determined perceived and real boundaries of Lwafi GR.      My findings show that farming, hunting, logging and charcoal production take place inside and around the Reserves. Farming is dominant on the western boundaries especially adjacent to Loasi and Kalambo FRs both inside and around the border of the Reserves. The intensity of livestock incursion is similar between the eastern and western sides of the Reserves, but livestock graze more around the border on the western side than the eastern side of the Reserves. Additionally, I find that the distance from village settlements to the Reserves is much more important in determining the occurrence of human activities inside and around the PAs than the distance to town/market.        For the ecological part of the study, I found 38 species of mammals in the surveyed area. The mammals are more abundant in the northern part of Lwafi GR (Lyazumbi - Kabwe and Kakoma - Ninde transects) than in the south (Namanyere - Kipili, China - Wampembe and King'ombe - Kala transects).  The presence of some species declined with the distance from the nearest village center, some increased, and others did not change. Most of the species that showed a decline - eland (Taurotragus oryx), giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), impala (Aepyceros melampus), hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus), roan (Hippotragus equinus ), blue duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia), and dik dik (Madoqua kirkii) - could be attributed to hunting since they are consumed by locals; however some edible species did not demonstrate this trend. These species include buffalo (Syncerus caffer), bush buck (Tragelaphus scriptus), klipspringer (Oreotragus oreotragus) and bush rat (Thryonomys). Generally species including elephant (Loxodonta africana) were found throughout Lwafi GR with some declines towards the southern part of the GR, possibly due to the availability of food, shelter and cover. In particular, species such as African palm civet (Nandinia binotata), bush duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia), lion (Panthera leo), reedbuck (Redunca arundinum), sable antelope (Hippotragus niger), sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekii), topi ( Damaliscus korrigum) and zebra (Equus quagga),were seen in Lwafi GR only in the dry season and disappeared in the wet season. These species either migrated to Katavi NP during the wet season or are less detectable during that time.       I conclude that Lwafi GR is facing acute anthropogenic pressures. Additionally, Lwafi GR is an important depository for wildlife and a potential area for developing tourism; the presence of carnivores such as lion, aardvark ( Orycteropus afer), black-backed Jackal (Canis mesomelas ), leopard (Panthera pardus), and wild dog (Lycaon pictus) can offer a special attraction to tourists. This could be complimented by Kalambo Falls at the Tanzania - Zambia border.      I suggest that the Tanzania government should consider enlarging the size of Lwafi GR and that the Mahale - Katavi corridor be upgraded to a Wildlife Management Area (WMA), a status that ensures management by local people. Finally, there should be periodic ecological surveys in order to have long-term records on animal as well as other biodiversity in Lwafi GR. With regard to connectivity to Zambia's PAs, I suggest that wildlife authorities on both sides consider the protection of a wildlife corridor to Nsumbu NP in Zambia.  (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

T1  - Systematics and evolution of the <i>Ronnbergia</i> alliance (Bromeliaceae): History of disjunct diversification in three biodiversity hotspots of the neotropics
AN  - 1722054689
AB  - The systematics, biogeography and evolution of the “ Ronnbergia Alliance,” a nested lineage within the Core Bromelioideae, were investigated. In the first chapter, the phylogenetic relationships of the Ronnbergia Alliance were reconstructed using three chloroplast and three nuclear DNA sequence markers in combination with a wide species sampling across the Core Bromelioideae and a nearly complete species-level sampling of the five species complexes that likely comprise the Ronnbergia  Alliance. The analysis indicates that the Ronnbergia Alliance is a robust monophyletic group sister to the remaining Core Bromelioideae, and it is composed by species of the polyphyletic genera Aechmea,  Hohenbergia and Ronnbergia. The first of main lineage within the Ronnbergia Alliance, here called the Pacific Clade, contains species of that occur exclusively in the forests of southern Central America to northwestern South America. The second clade, called the Atlantic Clade, contains species mostly limited to the central corridor of the Atlantic Forest and the Greater Antilles. The combination of apically spreading tubular corollas and unappendaged ovules are diagnostic for the Ronnbergia  Alliance, whereas flower size, corolla tube length, and petal pigmentation are important characters to differentiate the Pacific and Atlantic Clades. A new taxonomic reorganization and synopsis for this clade was proposed in the second chapter. Here, all the species of the Pacific Clade were placed in Ronnbergia, whereas the species of the Atlantic Clade were relocated in the resurrected genus Wittmackia. In the third chapter, a complete taxonomic revision of the Caribbean clade of  Wittmackia was conducted. In the fourth chapter, the biogeographic history and evolutionary rate dynamics of the Ronnbergia Alliance were analyzed. These analyses showed that one vicariant event that separated Ronnbergia from Wittmackia in South America, and a later long-distance dispersal event allowed the separation of Wittmackia between the Atlantic Forest and Jamaica. Although the evolutionary rate dynamics remained constant during the diversification of Ronnbergia, these rates were heterogeneous during the radiation of Wittmackia. This is the first species-level approach that combines phylogenetic, ecological, geographic and morphological information to reveal fine-scale processes that shaped the evolution of highly diverse lineages of Bromeliaceae.

T1  - Simulating Free-Roaming Cat Population Management Options in Open Demographic Environments
AN  - 1628247758
AB  - Large populations of free-roaming cats (FRCs) generate ongoing concerns for welfare of both individual animals and populations, for human public health, for viability of native wildlife populations, and for local ecological damage. Managing FRC populations is a complex task, without universal agreement on best practices. Previous analyses that use simulation modeling tools to evaluate alternative management methods have focused on relative efficacy of removal (or trap-return, TR), typically involving euthanasia, and sterilization (or trap-neuter-return, TNR) in demographically isolated populations. We used a stochastic demographic simulation approach to evaluate removal, permanent sterilization, and two postulated methods of temporary contraception for FRC population management. Our models include demographic connectivity to neighboring untreated cat populations through natural dispersal in a metapopulation context across urban and rural landscapes, and also feature abandonment of owned animals. Within population type, a given implementation rate of the TR strategy results in the most rapid rate of population decline and (when populations are isolated) the highest probability of population elimination, followed in order of decreasing efficacy by equivalent rates of implementation of TNR and temporary contraception. Even low levels of demographic connectivity significantly reduce the effectiveness of any management intervention, and continued abandonment is similarly problematic. This is the first demographic simulation analysis to consider the use of temporary contraception and account for the realities of FRC dispersal and owned cat abandonment.

T1  - Investigating the small public urban open spaces at high-density cities: a case study of hong kong
AN  - 2002215530
AB  - Many researches have shown that urban parks can enhance the quality of life, which is a key factor of building a sustainable city. Hong Kong, as one of the most densely populated financial city in the world, has severely low urban park density. Instead, a large number of small public urban open spaces (SPUOS) are scattered within the city fabrics. This paper therefore aims to study the design and functions of these SPUOS. It is also hoped that find out whether a network of connected small open spaces can compensate for a large urban park. After reviewing the history of urban parks in Hong Kong. It is believed that the multitude of SPUOS is the result of poor urban planning and imperfect urban renewal schemes during the early occupation by the British Government. These SPUOS are usually around 1000 to 1500 m2 large in size and can be abundantly found along adjacent streets. For the design of the SPUOS, benches are usually the only facility installed and the vegetation is of poor quality. The connectivity of SPUOS located within the study area in the Yau Tsim Mong District is investigated with the use of graph theory and connectivity indices. The result has shown that these SPUOS in the study area have a high degree of connectivity. They are further compared with a larger urban park located nearby. Based on the comparisons and other prior researches, a conclusion has been drawn that size of a park is not the major concern of park users but rather its facilities and design. It is believed that a network of connected SPUOS might serve the local community better due to their locations. However, they should not be able to entirely replace large urban parks since they have fewer amenities provided. The SPUOS are found to have rather different functions to the society than what urban parks are commonly expected. Their environment and economic functions are constrained mainly by the poor design and the locations. An interview with the representative of a non-government organization has been made to further understand their social functions. The interviewee believes that SPUOS now mainly act as social hubs and living rooms for senior citizens. This statement is then verified by the result of a prior survey and some other researches. This is due to the combination of aging population structure, exploding population growth, and expanding poverty gap. Lastly, a comparative study has been made on the small public urban green spaces (SPUGS) in Copenhagen. The SPUGS can attract visitors of different age group from other far neighborhoods. Despite than fact that there is cultural difference and citizens from these two cities have different lifestyles, a better design of the pocket park might be the reason of why it becomes an attractive natural meeting point in the central Copenhagen for all age-groups visitors. Based on all the investigations and findings, suggestions have been made to improve the quality of SPUOS in Hong Kong.

T1  - Ant and spider dynamics in complex riverine landscapes of the Scioto River basin, Ohio: Implications for riparian ecosystem structure and function
AN  - 1734367515
AB  - In recent years, a holistic ecosystem conceptualization has emerged that structurally and functionally links the river, and its riparian and floodplain zones into an integrated ecological unit—the riverine landscape. The array of riverine landscapes distributed across a river system represents biophysical complexity over broad spatial and temporal scales. Internal riverine landscape patchiness (e.g., gravel bars, mudflats, swamps, etc.), on the other hand, represents heterogeneity at finer spatiotemporal scales. Collectively, an understanding of environmental drivers and consequences of riverine landscape patch dynamics is critical to both basic riverine science as well as to management and conservation efforts. However, despite the well-documented importance of river corridors (e.g., as biological refuges in human-modified landscapes), the role of riverine landscape pattern and composition on ecosystem structure and function is largely unknown.    In this dissertation, I worked at 12 study reaches distributed along an urban-rural gradient of the Scioto River, Ohio, USA. To better understand environmental drivers of riverine landscape distribution and physical heterogeneity, I investigated the influence of internal (river size, lateral flow connectivity) and external (catchment land use and land cover) factors on site-specific riverine landscape patterns. At a finer scale, I used riparian spiders of the family Tetragnathidae and ants as model organisms to explore the associations between internal riverine landscape patchiness and the distribution, diversity, and trophic dynamics [e.g., trophic position (TP)] of riparian arthropod communities. Because of a growing recognition of the importance of aquatic-to-terrestrial energetic subsidies (largely in the form of aquatic insects that emerge from the water as adults) to riparian and terrestrial food webs, I gave particular consideration to the reliance of aquatic carbon [C (CA)] of riparian spiders and ants.    Riverine landscape patchiness was measured using a combination of field (vegetation surveys, canopy photography, shoreline habitat measurements) and remote-sensing approaches [e.g., using a GIS, aerial photos, and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data]. Ants and spiders were surveyed on each side of the river at each study reach. A suite of analytical methods were used including Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), linear regression, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modeling, a model-selection approach using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS).    I found that a mixture of external and internal factors were associated with riverine landscape pattern (patch area and shape and size) including drainage area (a proxy for ecosystem size), proximity to impoundment (a proxy for lateral flow connectivity), and catchment land use and land cover (e.g., % urban, % agriculture). Percent impervious surfaces in the catchment, for instance, was strongly related to more convoluted patch shapes in the riverine landscape. Riparian ant density and diversity were highly variable along the urban-rural gradient. Agricultural riverine landscapes exhibited lower ant density but elevated ant diversity. Patch area, edge, and shape emerged as important predictors of ant diversity whereas patch composition, as well as patch area, edge, and patch density were strongly related to ant density. However, MaxEnt modeling indicated that patch-type influenced ant habitat choice less than gradients in distance from surface water.    Patch composition was strongly associated, with TP and CA of ants (Formica subsericea) greatest at crop patches (TP = 1.79, CA = 91%). I observed that both terrestrial (habitat) and aquatic (emergent insect food resources) were important environmental determinants of riparian tetragnathid distribution, trophic dynamics, and the capacity of spiders to ecologically link aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. For example, tetragnathid TP, which averaged 2.45 across all study reaches, was largely driven by emergent insect density. For both ants and spiders, CA was positively related to TP (R2 = 0.14 for ants, R2 = 0.48 for spiders), suggesting that algal-based energy pathways contribute to more complex riparian food webs.    Collectively, these findings indicate that patchiness in riverine landscapes exerts strong influences on the distribution, diversity, and trophic dynamics of riparian arthropod consumers. Additionally, my results contribute to a growing understanding of the impacts of landscape change in river corridors, and suggest that integrating conservation efforts at both broad (e.g., catchment) and fine scales (e.g., the aquatic-terrestrial interface) will be an important step in maintaining diverse, functional river-riparian ecosystems. In particular, I found that urbanization is likely to prompt changes in riverine landscape structure as well as arthropod distribution, diversity, and trophic structure. Because these findings provide evidence that spatial habitat patterns within riverine landscapes can influence the structure and functions of riparian ecosystems, they also lend insight into the utility of landscape ecology to river science.

T1  - Fish Assemblages and Potential Barriers in Urban Streams
AN  - 1520244389
AB  - Urbanization and associated infrastructures may fragment habitats, particularly within streams. This thesis examines the impacts of culverts on fish assemblages near Vancouver, Canada. I compared fish communities across 26 streams with and without culverts. Densities of cutthroat trout (O ncorhynchus clarkii) increased whereas coastrange sculpin ( Cottus aleuticus) and prickly sculpin (C. asper) densities decreased, on both sides, relative to unculverted reference streams. I also found that simple retrofits for improving culvert passage may increase fish diversity over decadal timescales. I then examined the effects of four culverts within one urban watershed and show that successive culverts had a cumulative effect on fish distributions, particularly for prickly sculpin and cutthroat trout (negative and positive, respectively). Overall, this thesis demonstrates that culverts may drive changes in fish communities through speciesspecific impacts that are consistent both within and across watersheds. Understanding biotic responses to stream fragmentation can inform urban watershed restoration and conservation efforts.   Keywords: barrier; connectivity; culvert retrofit; fish passage; road crossing; river restoration.

T1  - Shared-Use Pathways Located in Natural Settings within the Urban Context: A Multiple Case Study Exploring How Design Affects Use by Children
AN  - 1462061607
AB  - With an increasingly urbanized world, children have less opportunity to move freely about their neighborhood environments, interact with nature, and engage in free-play behaviors. Vehicle traffic and parental concerns about safety have limited biking and walking for children. Pathways provide opportunities for multiple healthy behaviors for children, including opportunities for physical activity, contact with nature, active transportation, access to play, and independent mobility. Pathway use by children has not been studied, although the federal government provides transportation funding for pathways and children have need for such recreation and transportation alternatives. Understanding children’s use of pathways is essential for communities that they may effectively utilize transportation dollars in planning and designing high quality pathways for use by children.   A case study approach that includes four pathways in four states and utilizes multiple methods informed this research. Two types of pathways were selected as cases: pathways located within destination parks that incorporated play equipment in play pockets, located in Springfield, Missouri; Chattanooga, Tennessee, and pathways located along neighborhood greenways, located in Richardson, Texas; and Cary, North Carolina. Behavior Mapping was used to observe pathway affordances and behavior in settings that occurred along pathway corridors. Parental perceptions of benefits, safety, and independent mobility were determined through surveys conducted at all four sites. Pathway traffic counts conducted on site provided information on the age of.   Results suggest the following conclusions: 1. While vegetation may provide benefits such as shade, wildlife habitat, contact with nature, and scenic beauty, dense vegetation my discourage use by increasing parental fears. 2. Installation of play pockets may lead to more frequent pathway visits and increased duration of visits. This is important as time spent outdoors is associated with higher levels of physical activity for children. 3. Children are attracted to wildlife along pathway corridors. This important attribute may be encouraged by pathway planners and managers through careful attention to pathway location and landscape quality. 4. Parents ranked ‘family fun’ highest as a desired pathway benefit, followed closely by physical activity, contact with nature, and scenic beauty. These family benefits may be useful information to public health, and park and recreation system officials to promote pathway use. 5. Parents are concerned about social safety of children in natural environments but high visibility along pathway corridors may decrease parental fears.

T1  - The role of urban climate and land cover in phenology, nest success, and habitat use
AN  - 1444309333
AB  - Urban development is the fastest growing global land use and it increasingly brings drastic environmental change to natural systems. Climatic variability and spatial habitat heterogeneity within a city could influence species in habitat remnants.  The objectives of this project were to investigate the relative importance of temperature variation and urban land cover for nest survival, the function of thermal refuges for habitat use by breeding birds, and the relationship between urban climate and phenology.  Temperatures, leaf phenology, invertebrate abundance, nest habitat, and nest fate were monitored over a four-year study period at nine sites along an urban to rural gradient.  The sites were located in a riparian corridor passing through the cities of Reno and Sparks, Nevada.  Study area temperature anomalies from the 20-yr normal strongly impacted nest survival rates of American Robins (Turdus migratorius), Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura ), and Black-headed Grosbeaks (Pheucticus melanocephalus ).  Nest survival increased at warmer than normal temperatures and to a lesser extent at colder than normal temperatures.  Canopy cover within a 20m radius of the nest and pedestrian traffic at a site were positively associated with nest survival. Microsites available to nesting birds that had more vegetation were cooler at night and warmer in the day when they had more bare ground, less impervious surfaces, and less canopy cover.  The nests of doves and robins were constructed at cooler locations when air temperatures were warmer.  Temperature varied between sites with the warmest temperatures recorded in rural sites, followed by the more urban sites, and with coolest temperatures in suburban sites. The timing of nesting by robins occurred earlier in the warmer sites and at sites with earlier bud break by Populus  spp.  Peaks in foliar invertebrate abundance were also weakly associated with leaf out, while the sequence of peaks by aerial invertebrates was related more to the level of urbanization at a site.  The results from these studies demonstrate the ability of urban development to differentially affect phenology across trophic levels, have an additive effect with temperature variation on nest survival, and offer opportunities to provide thermal refuges to buffer the impacts of regional climate change.

T1  - Mammalian habitat use along a residential development gradient in northern Colorado
AN  - 1439927159
AB  - "Exurban" development occupies nearly five times more land in the United States than urban and suburban development combined. Understanding the effects of exurban development on biodiversity thus has important and wide-ranging implications for the planning, construction and stewardship of sustainable communities and surrounding rural lands. To assess the impact of exurban development on mammalian habitat use, wildlife cameras were placed along a unique development gradient designed to capture landscape permeability in a rapidly growing rural region of Colorado. Multiple-season species occupancy and relative activity (frequency of detections) were measured in summer and winter seasons and these data were analyzed in conjunction with a novel, acoustic-based approach to assessing human activity. Impacts of exurban housing varied by mammal species, with some species, such as bobcats, elk, and coyotes, showing decreased activity and occupancy levels at higher housing densities, whereas others, including red foxes and Abert's squirrels, occurred more frequently in these areas. Human-sourced activities associated with development and non-natural sound levels emerged as top models for most species. Relative activity rates corroborated occupancy results, indicating that some species not only use habitat in high density areas, they use it more frequently. In addition, some species, including black bears, preferentially used embedded greenbelts in high-density exurban subdivisions, suggesting that greenbelts may be important for structural and functional connectivity. This study demonstrates that the impacts of exurban development are species-dependent. However, incorporating well-designed and naturally vegetated open spaces into development projects and minimizing human disturbance may be critical to mitigating development impacts to most wildlife in regions undergoing continued exurban expansion.

T1  - Recent Upgrades to NASA SPoRT Initialization Datasets for the Environmental Modeling System
AN  - 2128381699
AB  - The NASA Short-term Prediction Research and Transition (SPoRT) Center has developed several products for its National Weather Service (NWS) partners that can initialize specific fields for local model runs within the NOAA/NWS Science and Training Resource Center (STRC) Environmental Modeling System (EMS). In last year's NWA abstract on this topic, the suite of SPoRT products supported in the STRC EMS was presented, which includes a Sea Surface Temperature (SST) composite, a Great Lakes sea-ice extent, a Green Vegetation Fraction (GVF) composite, and NASA Land Information System (LIS) gridded output. This abstract and companion presentation describes recent upgrades made to the SST and GVF composites, as well as the real-time LIS runs. The Great Lakes sea-ice product is unchanged from 2011. The SPoRT SST composite product has been expanded geographically and as a result, the resolution has been coarsened from 1 km to 2 km to accommodate the larger domain. The expanded domain covers much of the northern hemisphere from eastern Asia to western Europe (0 N to 80 N latitude and 150 E to 10 E longitude). In addition, the NESDIS POES-GOES product was added to fill in gaps caused by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) being unable to sense in cloudy regions, replacing the recently-lost Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS with negligible change to product fidelity. The SST product now runs twice per day for Terra and Aqua combined data collections from 0000 to 1200 UTC and from 1200 to 0000 UTC, with valid analysis times at 0600 and 1800 UTC. The twice-daily compositing technique reduces the overall latency of the previous version while still representing the diurnal cycle characteristics. The SST composites are available at approximately four hours after the end of each collection period (i.e. 1600 UTC for the nighttime analysis and 0400 UTC for the daytime analysis). The real-time MODIS GVF composite has only received minor updates in the past year. The domain was expanded slightly to extend further west, north, and east to improve coverage over parts of southern Canada. Minor adjustments were also made to the manner in which GVF is calculated from the distribution of maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from MODIS. The presentation will highlight some examples of the substantial inter-annual change in GVF that occurred from 2010 to 2011 in the U.S. Southern Plains as a result of the summer 2011 drought, and the early vegetation green up across the eastern U.S. due to the very warm conditions in March 2012. Finally, the SPoRT LIS runs the operational Noah land surface model (LSM) in real time over much of the eastern half of the CONUS. The Noah LSM is continually cycled in real time, uncoupled to any model, and driven by operational atmospheric analyses over a long-term, multi-year integration. The LIS-Noah provides the STRC EMS with high-resolution (3 km) LSM initialization data that are in equilibrium with the operational analysis forcing. The Noah LSM within the SPoRT LIS has been upgraded from version 2.7.1 to version 3.2, which has improved look-up table attributes for several land surface quantities. The surface albedo field is now being adjusted based on the input real-time MODIS GVF, thereby improving the net radiation. Also, the LIS-Noah now uses the newer MODIS-based land use classification scheme (i.e. the International Biosphere-Geosphere Programme [IGBP]) that has a better depiction of urban corridors in areas where urban sprawl has occurred. STRC EMS users interested in initializing their LSM fields with high-resolution SPoRT LIS data should set up their model domain with the MODIS-IGBP 20-class land use database and select Noah as the LSM.

T1  - Ecological Connectivity of Trypanosoma cruzi Reservoirs and Triatoma pallidipennis Hosts in an Anthropogenic Landscape with Endemic Chagas Disease
AN  - 1326552929
AB  - Traditional methods for Chagas disease prevention are targeted at domestic vector reduction, as well as control of transfusion and maternal-fetal transmission. Population connectivity of Trypanosoma cruzi-infected vectors and hosts, among sylvatic, ecotone and domestic habitats could jeopardize targeted efforts to reduce human exposure. This connectivity was evaluated in a Mexican community with reports of high vector infestation, human infection, and Chagas disease, surrounded by agricultural and natural areas. We surveyed bats, rodents, and triatomines in dry and rainy seasons in three adjacent habitats (domestic, ecotone, sylvatic), and measured T. cruzi prevalence, and host feeding sources of triatomines. Of 12 bat and 7 rodent species, no bat tested positive for T. cruzi, but all rodent species tested positive in at least one season or habitat. Highest T. cruzi infection prevalence was found in the rodents, Baiomys musculus and Neotoma mexicana. In general, parasite prevalence was not related to habitat or season, although the sylvatic habitat had higher infection prevalence than by chance, during the dry season. Wild and domestic mammals were identified as bloodmeals of T. pallidipennis, with 9% of individuals having mixed human (4.8% single human) and other mammal species in bloodmeals, especially in the dry season; these vectors tested >50% positive for T. cruzi. Overall, ecological connectivity is broad across this matrix, based on high rodent community similarity, vector and T. cruzi presence. Cost-effective T. cruzi, vector control strategies and Chagas disease transmission prevention will need to consider continuous potential for parasite movement over the entire landscape. This study provides clear evidence that these strategies will need to include reservoir/host species in at least ecotones, in addition to domestic habitats.

T1  - The importance of habitat design and aquatic connectivity in amphibian use of urban stormwater retention ponds
AN  - 1015639003
AB  - Issue Title: Special Section: Urban Rivers              Stormwater retention ponds in urbanizing catchments are constructed to collect and treat runoff from impervious surfaces. Amphibians often inhabit retention ponds, which may partly offset the loss of natural wetlands resulting from urbanization. We investigated the use of retention ponds by frogs in a rapidly-urbanizing region of south-eastern Australia to (1) determine the habitat attributes associated with individual species, and (2) recommend specific wetland design criteria to enhance populations of frog species in the region and in other urbanizing areas throughout their distribution. We detected nine species of frogs during calling surveys at 30 retention pond sites in Greater Melbourne, 2008-2010. There were contrasting differences in habitat associations among five species for which we produced regression models of abundance or occurrence. The mean abundance of Crinia signifera increased with site area, whereas Limnodynastes dumerilii was associated with smaller sites. The occurrence of L. dumerilii was positively associated with waterbody shore depth, whereas L. peronii and L. tasmaniensis were associated with shallow shores. Two species were positively associated with time since construction or since dredging of a site, whereas the occurrence of L. dumerilii decreased with site age. Aquatic vegetation at a site was important for the occurrence of L. peronii and Litoria ewingii. There was evidence for a positive effect of aquatic connectivity on the occurrence of Limnodynastes peronii, which emphasizes the importance of riparian corridors in urban settings. These results highlight the contrasting differences in habitat associations among species in the region. We recommend that retention ponds in our region and elsewhere be constructed or enhanced to include specific habitat attributes that were found to be associated with different amphibian species. We recommend long-term monitoring at sites to determine whether retention ponds augment existing frog populations or contribute to declines.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The epidemiology of lagos bat virus and henipaviruses in straw-coloured fruit bats (eidolon helvum), using population genetics to infer population connectivity
AN  - 1442475503
AB  - The straw-coloured fruit bat, Eidolon helvum, has been identified as a reservoir for potentially-zoonotic henipaviruses and Lagos bat virus (LBV) in continental Africa. Longitudinal studies at a large urban colony in Accra, Ghana aim to better understand E. helvum and viral ecology, as well as the nature of human-bat interactions. To assess whether the findings from these studies can be extrapolated across the species’ continental range, more information on the movement ecology of the species and connectivity of populations across its range was required. A multifaceted approach, using techniques from the field of genetics, population ecology, and virology, was used to understand the ways in which the structure and dynamics of fruit bat populations across Africa may affect the viral transmission dynamics within them. Given recent difficulties in using electronic positioning systems on E. helvum to track movement, genetic methods were proposed as the most appropriate way to assess connectivity between populations across such a vast range. Henipavirus and LBV serological analyses were undertaken on samples from 12 populations of E. helvum bats across its continental and offshore-island range. A combination of mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite markers were used to describe the genetic metapopulation structure of E. helvum and data were obtained in each location on population sizes, demographic structure, reproductive and migratory seasonality, as well as bat-human interactions. Consistent with expectations for a vagile migratory species, a panmictic continental population structure was detected across its continental range, although the extent of this panmixia was greater than previously detected in any other mammal or bird. Antibodies to henipaviruses and LBV were detected in all continental populations. Isolated island populations in the Gulf of Guinea were genetically distinct from each other and the continental population. Given the isolation of these island fruit bats and the lack of connectivity with other populations, it was expected that populations would be too small to allow persistence of any viruses that cause acute, immunising infections. Contrary to expectations, island individuals displayed evidence for exposure to both viruses. E. helvum is known to roost close in proximity to human populations across continental Africa, and these results could therefore have important public health implications. Further longitudinal studies across multiple locations and information on social structure, daily and seasonal movements are needed to make inferences about virus transmission dynamics and zoonotic risks within the complex population structure.

T1  - The effects of urbanization and road development on carnivores in Southern California
AN  - 1288376606
AB  - Habitat destruction and degradation is a serious threat to biodiversity, and urbanization and road development are driving factors in habitat loss. As the human footprint continues to expand, the natural landscape becomes increasingly fragmented and human development can create barriers to wildlife movement and gene flow. Carnivores in particular are sensitive to fragmentation and may be used as model animals for understanding how roads and urbanization can fragment wildlife populations. In this thesis, I investigate the effects of urbanization and road development on carnivores in southern California. Since southern California is one of the most populous areas of the country, coupled with high biodiversity, it is a unique area to study the effects of road development and urbanization on carnivores.     In the first chapter, I estimate the density of bobcats in a coastal reserve isolated by urbanization using mark-recapture and mark-resight techniques with camera trap data. The use of camera trap data to estimate carnivore abundance is increasingly common, and to date many such studies have utilized a mark-recapture framework and focused on carnivores with unique pelage patterns. The recent improvement of mark-resight estimators, however, provides an opportunity to estimate the abundance of carnivores without unique pelage patterns. We utilized both the mark-recapture and mark-resight frameworks to estimate bobcat population sizes in a geographically isolated urban reserve in southern California. Due to their sensitivities to urban fragmentation, bobcats have been a focal species in several studies throughout southern California, yet few population estimates exist for this region. Since bobcats are individually identifiable, and a subset of the study population was physically marked with GPS telemetry collars, we were able to compare the utility of both the mark-recapture and mark-resight frameworks for carnivore population estimation with camera trap data. We deployed a sampling grid of 30 cameras throughout the study area and recorded 109 bobcat photos during 4,669 camera nights from July 2006 through January 2007. Density point estimates were reasonably consistent with prior studies and ranged from 0.40 to 0.55 bobcats per km2 depending upon the estimator used, but the confidence intervals for all estimates overlapped suggesting that they were not significantly different. Percent confidence interval length ranged from 150% to 180% indicating a low amount of precision for all of our estimates. We conclude that mark-resight estimators performed comparably to the mark-recapture estimators and show promise for use with camera trap data to estimate carnivore population sizes. The low precision for both our mark-recapture and mark-resight estimators, however, highlights the sensitivity of both frameworks to small datasets typical of large carnivore studies. In future studies, it will be important to develop techniques to increase capture probabilities of target species to maximize the utility of camera traps for estimating population sizes.     In the second chapter, I evaluate the effects of a road expansion and mitigation project on underpass usage of three target species: bobcat, coyote and mule deer. Roads can negatively impact wildlife, particularly large mammals. In response, transportation agencies have implemented mitigation measures like the installation of wildlife fencing and wildlife crossing structures. The evaluation of these mitigation measures is crucial to determine the success of reducing road impacts. Herein, we evaluate a road expansion and mitigation project completed by the California Department of Transportation along State Route 71 (CA-71) through the Chino Hills southeast of Los Angeles. We designed a remote camera survey to study how the widening of CA-71 and implementation of mitigation measures affected large mammal movement and underpass use. Based on camera detections, bobcat underpass use was higher in the construction and mitigation zone after construction than before, but there was no difference in use of underpasses in the impact compared to the control zone in either time period. Underpass use by coyotes was higher in the control zone than in the impact zone, but there was no difference in use between the before and after periods. Small numbers of mule deer detections at few underpasses precluded a comparison between the control and impact zones, but a comparison of before and after periods revealed that mule deer underpass use was slightly higher post-construction. We cannot fully attribute increased detections post-construction to mitigation efforts, and other factors, such as habitat availability, urbanization, or demography, may have also influenced underpass use along CA-71. Nonetheless, even with the expansion of the freeway and subsequent increase in traffic volume, mitigation structures along CA-71 did allow for continued movement and hence connectivity across the roadway for the target species.

T1  - Verification of the analysis method for extracting the spatial continuity of the vegetation distribution on a regional scale
AN  - 1671394368; 15583166
AB  - Vegetation plays a key role in not only improving urban environments, but also conserving ecosystems. The spatial continuity of vegetation distributions can be expected to make green corridors for landscape management, wind paths against heat island phenomena. In this paper, we develop a spatial analysis method of vegetation distributions using remotely sensed data on a regional scale. The method consists of a spatial autocorrelation analysis, an overlay analysis, and a hydrological analysis with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) adopted as the proxy of vegetation abundance. Application of the method leads to the extraction of the lines between the core areas and sparse areas of vegetation. The purpose of this study is to verify our method through applying a vegetation map digitized from aerial photographs. The map contained three vegetation types of land cover: grasslands, agricultural fields, and tree-covered areas. We use remotely sensed data collected at four different time periods at the regional scale, along with information on the seasonal fluctuations of the vegetation. As a result, the exclusion of seasonal land-cover changes, as in the reaping of agricultural fields, in the process of applying the proposed method produces an effect. The analysis reveals steady areas unaffected by the seasonal fluctuation of vegetation along the lines extracted by applying the proposed method.

T1  - Ecology and conservation of prairie rattlesnakes (<i> Crotalus viridis viridis</i>) in relation to movement in a fragmented urban environment
AN  - 895976697
AB  - Eighteen prairie rattlesnakes (Crotalus viridis viridis ) were tracked using radio-telemetry and 82 snakes were PIT-tagged over a 2-year period in Lethbridge, AB to determine population size, movement patterns, and habitat utilization, and to predict fragmentation effects on the species within an urban locale. Population size was estimated using closed population models at 374 snakes (295 adults) and open population models at 204 snakes (161 adults), greater than an estimate of <50 adults in 2003 (Ernst, 2003) and 2006 (Ernst & Quinlan, 2006).    Mean home range sizes, based on 95% minimum convex polygon analysis, differed significantly between years (31.51 ha in 2005, 3.72 ha in 2006). Calculated movement parameters, such as mean distance moved per day, total distance moved over the course of the active season, and frequency of movement varied between years and individuals. Greater-than-expected (under hypotheses of even habitat choice) utilization was observed in habitat types located within coulee and flood plain areas, with apparent preference towards unbroken parcels of grassland or cottonwoods, whereas less-than-predicted utilization of agricultural habitat type was observed. Fragmentation effects on prairie rattlesnake movement and occurrence were examined through modeling and were found to coincide with observed species' locations, suggesting that prairie rattlesnakes are undergoing modification of movement patterns to avoid highly concentrated human density or use. Influence of weather on the use of vegetative ground cover was observed, as it was accessed more by prairie rattlesnakes at higher temperatures.    Recommendations towards future management of the prairie rattlesnake population in Lethbridge are given, including protection of the Bridge View Drive site and inclusion of varied habitat types and terrain when planning habitat and wildlife corridors. Management decisions that ensure remaining habitat parcels and connective areas near rattlesnake foraging or movement corridors are also advocated. Identification of future research focuses include studies on juvenile survivorship, genetic structure, and vehicle-related mortality.

T1  - Effects of urbanization on pattern and typical function of regional wetlands
AN  - 1874571113
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorGlobal urbanization has dramatically impacted various kinds of wetlands in the last decades. China has also been experiencing rapid urbanization due to the intensive economic growth and industrialization since market-oriented economic reformation in 1978. During the past three decades, large areas of wetlands in east and south estuarine cities of China disappeared and the remaining areas became vulnerable due to urban industry, agriculture and domestic developments. In the paper, two regions with different development patterns of urbanization were choosed as typical examples. There is cluster-style development pattern of urbanization in the Pearl River estuary (PRE), and decentralized development pattern of urbanization exists in Longitudinal Range-Gorge Region (LRGR). The objectives of this paper are to: 1) conduct a systematic and holistic quantitative studies on the wetland pattern and ecological function under the stress of varous activites of urban based on the change of wetland pattern caused by urbanization; 2) discuss the spatial pattern of evolution of wetlands, the changes of typical ecological function, and the relationship between spatial pattern of wetlands and the main ecological functions; 3) examine the driving mechanism of degradation of wetland functions; 4) divide function zones base on the wetland function and establish rational control strategies. The research results can be summarized as follows: 1) The evolution characteristics of wetland patterns were studied in three decades in the Pearl River Estuary. From 1979 to 2009, the net loss of area of wetlands was 1/3 (12383 km2) and the occupied area ratio also decreased from 53.36% to 38.91%. We found that the tendency that nature wetlands changed to constructed wetlands and then to urban land was obvious in the process of transfer of wetlands and the direct and major way for degradation of wetland was cluster-style development of urban land. The urbanization can greatly exacerbate the transition activities of different types of wetlands resulted from that the total transition index (TTI) were far greater than the net transition index (NTI). Meanwhile, based on the analysis methods of river network and landscape network, wetland network in PRE was constructed using the vector data of wetland. The length, connectivity and complexity of river corridor have already been reduced from 1979 to 2009. Wetland networks in PRE have a trend of evolution, inverted "V" type to "# "type, then to main river-way. 2) Water purification functions of wetlands and drive mechanism from urbanization were studied from 1979 to 2009 in PRE. The wetland network structure index Dr,β,γ,α are closely related to the capacity of water purification. The good corridor connectivity and patches near degrees are the important conditions for network water purification. Estuary wetland pattern changes have a direct impact on the water purification in regional wetland system, which is irreversible with lands for city construction lack gradually. 3) The evolution characteristics of wetland patterns were studied in three decades in the LRGR. Highway construction is closely related to urban development. Perfect highway construction is not only the base of city development, but also an important style of urban system formation. The relationship between mountainous city land and highway density can be described by the linear regression equation. Highway development in mountains is the foundation conditions of urban sprawl, and also is main ways of urbanization impact on wetlands. By analyzing wetland pattern driven by the highway construction, the wetland density in the highway buffer (2000m) is decreased from 0.10 km-1 to 0.06 km-1. Patches density and edge density of the natural wetland and artificial wetland in the buffers present the increasing trend, and the increasing trend is evident. The results indicated that natural wetlands and artificial wetlands were gradually fragmentation. 4) The biodiversity function of wetlands and drive mechanism from urbanization were studied in LRGR. Highway construction influences wetland pattern and biodiversity in mountainous. As a representative activity in the mountains, highway construction has detrimental side effects on maintaining biodiversity function in the regional wetlands. In influencing zone of highway, construction activities mainly influence the single block wetland, such as, lake, reservoir and swamp; and decrease biodiversity of wetlands. The Shannon diversity index is nearly proportional to wetland area with polynomial exp (S2), which is consistent with Gaussian regression model. 5)The Pearl River Estuary is divided into two primary function zones and six secondary function zones; Yunnan mountainous area is divided into two primary function areas and five secondary function zones. The protection policies were formulated separately based on regional typical wetland

T1  - Scenic beauty estimation of urban greenway greening in the central district of guangzhou
AN  - 1874410179
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorNowadays, with rapid urbanization and increasing nature environmental pollution, people call for a nature space urgently to escape the noisy city life. And the emerging of the greenway solves such problem well. It is considered as an eco-corridor functioned with ecological, connective, aesthetic, recreational and cultural. And it also satisfies city residents' request for nature. Pearl River Delta Regional Greenway is constructed with such purpose. It's a regional greenway in China, represents that regional ecology protection makes a great leap from theory research to practical item. Urban greenway is a part of the Pearl River Delta Regional Greenway. It locates in the centre of the city, serves all of the city residents. Its aesthetic and recreational function is more important than any other function in greenway. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and analyze urban greenway in the central district of Guangzhou, discuss the influence of different landscape factors to scenic beauty estimation values (SBEs) with Scenic Beauty Estimation (SBE) method belonged to psychophysical paradigm, and finally provide the suggestions based on the classification of such greenways. The study process with SBE method shows below: Select 50 typical landscapes of 26 urban greenways in the central district of Guangzhou, then take photos of the landscapes and investigate the quadrats. Acquire the public preference rating for each photo in three ways, including slides survey, field investigation and internet survey. Calculate the standard SBEs for each landscape with 200 available questionnaires and the landscape factors for each quadrat with the investigation data. Then build the multivariate linear regression model with SBEs and landscape factors: SBEs=6.193+77.983×Arbor Green Looking Ratio+2.521×Species+0.451×Arbor Mean DBH -2.508×Tree Form Diversity, to analyze the influence of landscape factors to standard SBEs. Additionally discuss the differences between three investigation ways and the consistency between different research groups. Finally classify the greenways according to the surrounding site differences into five classifications: park type, river type, brook type, suburban type and street type, and provide suggestions based on the classification. The study results shows below: (1) The preference to the greenway greening for public relates to the classification of greenway, which shows the surrounding landscape and the location of greenway. The greening landscape of park type greenways is more attractive to city residents, such as Datong Road, Shamian Street and Luhu Road. They rank first three. And the SBEs are all above 110. Because in this kind of landscape, the trees are tall and old, the crown is broad, and the park scenery around is beautiful. On the contrary, the SBEs of street type greenways, such as Zhongshan 8 Road, South Kangwang Road, Fangcun Avenue, are all below 15. They rank bottom three, are the most unpopular of all the greenways. So it's a necessary to decrease or shorten such kind of greenways. The river type and brook type greenways receive mixed reviews. We should tighten the bonds of the greening and the environment around during the designing. And the evolution of suburban type greenways relates closely on the greening itself. (2) The landscape factors of arbor green looking ratio, species, tree form diversity and arbor mean DBH has great influence on the SBEs to the landscape. In the regression model, we find that the landscape factor of tree from diversity is in inverse proportion to the SBEs, and the other three are proportional to it. So the ideal greening mode of greenway in people's mind is that of numerous species, tall trees, thick trunk, broad crown and uniform crown style. (3) In SBE method, slides survey could take the place of field investigation, and internet survey should be also used together. Different degrees of familiarity to the greenways makes no difference to the evaluate result. There is no significant difference between slides survey with field investigation. Though analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of these investigations, it is found that slides survey should be used primarily. Since the result of internet survey makes different to them, it should be used together with slides survey. The evaluate result by different groups with different degrees of familiarity to the greenways shows no significant difference, and it also proves that office-based evaluation could take the place of field evaluation well. So it's unnecessary to consider such factors during using the SBE method about choosing study groups and survey

T1  - Road to the Future: Strategies for Wildlife Crossings and Youth Empowerment to Improve Wildlife Habitat in Roaded Landscapes
AN  - 898324191; ED523536
AB  - As the footprint of human society expands upon the earth, habitat loss and landscape fragmentation is an increasing global problem. That problem includes loss of native habitats as these areas are harvested, converted to agricultural crops, and occupied by human settlement. Roads increase human access to previously inaccessible areas, encourage landscape conversion as human access is increased, and are a pervasive component of the developed landscape. Helping our youth understand and engage with these processes is critical for informed decision-making about conservation of biodiversity, increased awareness and sensitivity to the effects of landscape fragmentation, improved attitudes toward local environments, and empowering environmentally responsible behavior. This dissertation addresses the question "What management strategies will optimize wildlife crossing structures and what educational strategies will optimize youth understanding and engagement to improve wildlife habitat in roaded landscapes?" The first chapter is global and reviews the literature addressing road crossings for wildlife. This chapter demonstrates that a network of crossing structures across roads can restore habitat connectivity for target species of wildlife; these structures function optimally for wildlife when best management practices including long-term monitoring and adaptive management are implemented. Nine best management practices developed in this paper advance the quest for optimization of wildlife crossings. Wildlife crossings are a significant tool for conserving wildlife in roaded landscapes. A broader question about advancing society's wildlife goals for roaded landscapes addresses education of our youth. Crossings are major engineering investments. As young people learn to value and take action on environmental issues, we may have improved opportunities to reconnect wildlife habitats. The remaining chapters in the dissertation address that second aspect of living in a roaded landscape: education. The chapters present and analyze the Taking Action Opportunities (TAO) curriculum in which students investigate the effects of habitat change for themselves using remote cameras to explore and understand biodiversity in fragmented habitats. Students compare camera-trap results in their schoolyard with findings in a nearby protected area and become engaged in social action, communicating with school and community leaders to achieve changes that improve habitats for biodiversity. The curriculum is quantitatively analyzed to show how it affects attitudes and behaviors of 5th-grade students. Two years of field testing results using TAO are analyzed with matched pairs pre and post tests. In those analyses, students using TAO as the experimental treatment were compared to a control group of students in the same school district who participated only in the standard environments curriculum delivered in 5th grade. Students in the experimental group were found to have higher scores on knowledge; attitudes; and behavior confidence, intent, and practice. Greatest gains were demonstrated in the category of behavior practice, providing evidence that TAO is a successful mechanism to increase student awareness of issues of habitat loss and landscape fragmentation and take action to improve wildlife habitat in their school and community. These five chapters advance society's ability to sustain the coexistence of wildlife and human communities in roaded landscapes. Some landscape conditions require "hard" engineering approaches and others require "soft" educational approaches. Through strategic investment, school districts, cities, states, and nations can protect and manage wildlife-rich habitats, reduce habitat loss and fragmentation, and can encourage young people to understand and value those wildlife-rich habitats.

T1  - Greenspace conservation planning framework for urban regions based on a forest bird -habitat relationship study and the resilience thinking
AN  - 637762844
AB  - The research involves first conducting a “case study” of ecological data and applying the results, together with the resilience concept, to the development of a greenspace conservation planning framework for urban regions. The first part of the research investigates the relationship between forest bird abundance and the surrounding landscape characteristics, especially, forest area and its spatial configuration in urban regions at multiple scales. The results are similar for simple and multiple regression analyses across three scales. The percentage of forest cover in a landscape is positively correlated with bird abundance with some thresholds. Overall, the percentage of forest cover in the landscape, contrast-weighted forest edge density, and the similarity of land cover types to forest cover are identified as important for the conservation of the target bird species. The study points to the importance of species-specific habitat requirements even for species with similar life history traits and of maintaining some forest edges and/or edge contrast.

T1  - Climate Change, Species Range Expansion and the Institutional Response
AN  - 2228323745
AB  - Climate change poses significant threats and opportunities to all life on Earth. Fundamental to the maintenance of biodiversity, in temperate latitudes, is the degree to which species can undergo range expansion to respond to poleward shifts in suitable climate space. However, in Europe, the ability of lowland species to achieve this may be impeded by the intensively managed and fragmented nature of the landscape, especially in heavily developed areas such as the Urban Mersey Basin Natural Area of North West England, the study area for this research. The thesis aims to further understanding of how species undergo range expansion in such situations, and through this to inform the development of possible adaptation strategies, and their integration into an effective institutional response. Butterflies are chosen as the indicator taxon because of their responsiveness to climate change and because their changing distribution through time has been logged very effectively in Britain by a national recording scheme. This data is used to explore the extent and regional variation of recent range expansion by 15 butterfly species through the British landmass. From this cohort, five generalist species are chosen for more detailed study within the Urban Mersey Basin. Data analyses showed that all five species have successfully extended their range through and beyond this area during the study period (1983-2004). However, the 'movement strategies' are distinctive between species. Two species (comma and speckled wood) were able to navigate successfully though the built up area, two were more associated with open land (purple hairstreak and gatekeeper) and one (small skipper) was intermediate. The analysis of distribution in relation to land cover and habitat type suggests that, for the more selective 'countryside' species, chains of interlinked habitat can provide effective 'movement corridors' or 'networks'. Corridor features within the landscape may impede or facilitate movement, depending on species ecology and behaviour. This knowledge was then applied to four specialist butterfly species, associated with woodland (2), grassland (1) and heathland (1) habitats. This analysis suggested that the availability of preferred habitat and species mobility will both influence potential for range expansion. To facilitate range expansion by specialists it is suggested that habitat specific networks need to be established through restoring, creating and extending habitat patches and by altering corridor management within and between these networks. Climate change adaptation for biodiversity in urbanised parts of lowland Britain should, it is argued, focus on the establishment of near continuous chains of high quality habitat, with strategic planning to 'engineer' effective connectivity for a range of habitat types. Whilst the policy framework at European, national and regional levels recognises the importance of increasing landscape connectivity in response to climate change, the thesis suggests that the facilitation of species range expansion, especially for 'specialists', will require more effective landscape planning and management at the sub-regional scale. This will need to involve a range of actors and agencies in a better targeted and more effectively coordinated response than is currently evident.

T1  - Assessment of biodiversity conservation importance in the beibu gulf economic region of the hainan province
AN  - 1870557569
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorBiodiversity conservation is a global focus, and biodiversity assessment is the basis of the biodiversity assessment and management. To obtain precisebiodiversity information is a foundation of scientific decision-making for biodiversity conservation. The broadscale biodiversity assessment has alread-y become an urgent problem in the study and administration of biodiversi-ty. In this paper, we will search the literature and establish the species data, analyze the global regional biodiversity assessment in conservation imp-ortance, make up the biodiversity assessment index system and the compr-ehensive biodiversity assessment method on the Beibu Gulf area of the Hainan province, so, we can do the biodiversity assessment of the Beibu Gulf of Hainan. Finally, according to the results of the assessment and the development plan of Beibu Gulf of Hainan, we can give out the pertinently advice and measures about the biodiversity conservation in the Beibu Gulf area of the Hainan Province. The results were as follows: 1. After the research of the home and abroad regional biodiversity assessment in conservation importance, we formulate the biodiversity assessment index system of the Beibu Gulf area of the Hainan province, including six indicators: species richness consisted by the wild higher animals and plants species richness, diversity of ecosystem types, completeness of vertical stratification of vegetation, endemism, extent of threatened species and extent of alien species invasion. 2. Through the comprehensive biodiversity assessment method, we can obtain the results of the biodiversity conservation in the Beibu Gulf area of the Hainan province by county level; at last, the assessment results were classified into three grades. Changjiang, Ledong is the classⅠmeaning boast highly rich in biodiversity of the assessment as the highly rich not only in species and diversity of ecosystem types, but the endemism and the extent of threatened species; the biodiversity index(BI) is Ledong>Changjiang. Haikou, Danzhou and Dongfang is classⅡ what is boast quite high biodiversity as the quite high rich not only in diversity of ecosystem types and species, but the endemism and the extent of threatened species; and they have somewhere highly rich in species. Chengmai and Lingao have moderate biodiversity with the moderate rich with class Ⅲ on behalf of diversity of ecosystem types and species, including the endemism and the extent of threatened species; and they have somewhere moderate rich in species, the BI is Chengmai>and Lingao. These data are consistent with the actual biodiversity status, and generally reflect the distribution of biodiversity in Beibu Gulf area of the Hainan province. 3. On the basis of the results of the assessment and the development plan of Beibu Gulf of Hainan, we can make out the pertinently advice and measures about the biodiversity conservation in the Beibu Gulf area of the Hainan Province. The primary measures are as follows: to carry out the investigation of biodiversity in the Beibu Gulf area of the Hainan province. Biodiversity impact assessment and ecological compensation are needed in the Beibu Gulf area of the Hainan especially in the West Industial Corridor including Lingao, Danzhou, Changjiang, Dongfang. We should enhance the precaution and remedy about the alien species invasion especially in the Chengmai and Lingao which are developed under agriculture. Tourist city like the Haikou and Ledong have to strengthen the scientific exploitation and coordinated management which is more obvious comprised the increase of the management level of the nature reserve especially the national nature

T1  - Construction and application of ecological property evaluation index system for urban parks: a case study of xiamen urban parks
AN  - 1870386100
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorAs an important component of eco-city construction, improving the ecological property of urban parks is the development direction of modern urban parks, however, there is still lack of a valid index system to evaluate ecological property of urban parks. The present study focused on the connotation of ecological property, set up an index system for evaluating ecological property of urban parks with Delphi Method and Analytic Hierarchy Process. Thereafter, seven typical urban parks in Xiamen were taken as a case to verify the index system. Firstly, this study set up an index system for evaluating ecological property of urban parks taking the rationality of ecological structure as well as the efficiency of functions as the criterias. The index system consisted of four aspects, which were community structure, landscape pattern, ecological service function and garden ornamental function. Then the degree of ecological property was divided into four grades according to their scores, which were excellent(grade I), good(grade II), fair(grade III), and poor(grade IV). Secondly, we measured the principal indexes such as vegetation quantity, tree species diversity, landscape diversity, birds diversity, and carbon fixation and oxygen release, decrease of temperature and increase of humidity, dust-retention and noise reduction in seven typical parks of Xiamen. According to their vegetation characteristics, seven parks were classified to semi-natural parks(Huweishan Park, Xianyue Park and Zhonglun Park)and artificial parks(Zhongshan Park, Nanhu Park, Bailuzhou Park and Huli Park). Finally, these seven parks were evaluated using the index system and the evaluating scores were in the order of Huweishan Park(0.6830, II)>Xianyue Park(0.6698, II)>Zhongshan Park(0.6365, II)>Nanhu Park(0.6120, II)>Zhonglun Park(0.6057, II)>Huli Park(0.5181, III)>Bailuzhou Park(0.5067, III). According to our investigation and evaluation, the structure and function of the seven parks were further analyzed. The results indicated that Huweishan Park and Xianyue Park had higher green space ratios and native species percentages, richer community levels and more diverse bird species than artificial parks. Their average patch areas were larger and plaque integrity and connectivity were better, but the landscape diversities were lower. These two parks thus had better ecological service functions, but weak garden ornamental functions. In Zhonglun Park, the community structure was simplified after artificial modification, and its ecological service functions were poorer than the other semi-natural pakrs. In the artificial parks, Zhongshan Park and Nanhu Park had more diverse tree species than the others, with more rational collocation of native species and exotic species. The landscape types were diverse, but their fragmentation degrees were high. In Bailuzhou Park, the community structure was simple and tree species were poor. In Huli Park, there was a large number of recreation facilities and water surface area and the green space ratio was low. With regard to functions, Zhongshan Park had strong ecological service functions while the other three artificial parks had weak ecological service functions, but strong garden ornamental functions. In a word, there were better ecological structures and ecological service functions in semi-natural parks, but stronger ornamental functions in artificial parks. This study set up the index system for evaluating ecological property with strong scientificity and feasibility. It had certain reference value to ecological construction of urban

T1  - Environmental impact and countermeasure research of hydropower development in ecologically sensitive areas
AN  - 1868631174
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorWith the rapid development of the national economic society, hydropower construction also gets a rapid development. At the same time, environment problems caused by hydropower construction cannot be underestimated, such as effects to hydrological, effects to aquatic ecosystem, effects of construction, effects of the reservoir storage, effects of the operation, effects of the cascade development, and so on. After years of unremitting efforts, countermeasure research of the environmental impact for hydropower development has made some preliminary achievements. But when it comes to some of the ecologically sensitive zone,we still unable to put forward targeted countermeasures. Based on investigation to the natural ecological environment of the area, this thesis conducts a detailed analysis of environmental issues due to the construction of Angu Hydropower Station. At the same time, a systematic study to environmental protection measures for restoration of ecological functions of wetlands is also conducted. The purpose of this thesis is to provide a reference for the solution of ecological problems that caused by hydropower projects in ecologically sensitive areas across the country. Angu Hydropower Station of Dadu River, with a hybrid development approach, is located in Leshan City, Sichuan Province. This thesis firstly gives an overview to the project, then takes a systematic analysis to the natural conditions, development of the socio-economic, and the ecological environment of the field. The results show that the station located in the area with large population, more developed economies, strong human disturbances and seasonal flooded wetlands. The area is the typical region of artificial interference with strong agricultural wetlands, does not belong to the wetlands of International Importance, and does not belong to the wetlands with state protection. The thesis also takes a systematic analysis on the environmental impact to the areas for the construction of Angu hydropower station. The results show that the biggest impaction happens to the topography, the ecosystems, the structure and function of the wetlands. For example, the reservoir inundation, construction, backfilling create land and land use change in its topography; After the completion of the island station node flow will further shifting alliances, the river hydrological regime of wetlands changes; Project impact wetland vegetation types evolved to drought or water logging type of riparian vegetation; Also of amphibians, reptiles habitat and natural landscape works of certain impact areas, and many other issues. Therefore, combine the Angu hydropower station's construction area requirements of the actual situation and the State Environmental Protection. In this thesis, optimization of engineering plans, build connectivity engineering measures, and implementation of wetland restoration three aspects, give the typical countermeasure for environmental protection of these ecologically sensitive areas. By optimizing the engineering program to reduce the area, to reduce the project impact wetlands directly occupied; Construction connection mechanical control measure, let-down ecological flow rate, to ensure that wetlands and river left bank weeks wetland connectivity and integrity of the system; With the late resettlement project, implementation of wetland restoration engineering, remodeling micro-topography for the downstream floodway, Restore rivers in the region of typical wetland ecosystems and other countermeasures. This article analyzes that, the project environmental protection measures by taking the above greatly reduces the level of the rivers of this construction of the wetland ecosystem. And through artificial restoration measures, can improve species diversity of wetland ecosystems and biomass, thereby enhancing the ecological functions of wetlands. After the settlement of this article referred to in dealing with similar environmental problems in ecologically sensitive areas can learn from the text of the environmental planning and engineering to the method of combining measures, to fellow the new progress of water conservancy: Live in harmony with nature and finally intergrowth with each

T1  - Researches on ecologic restoration of the damaged area of fenghuang mountain in wuhan east-lake high-tech zone
AN  - 1868115667
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorLocated in the south of Wuhan East-Lake High-tech Zone, Fenghuang Mountain is an important component of the ecology corridor of South-east Wuhan. After more than forty years of building stone mining, the mountain's physiognomy has been severely damaged and formed near 300000 m2 broken slope. In this area, the origin vegetation is almost totally destroyed with only a few masson-pine survived, resulting in bare mountain massif, severe water and soil erosion, ecology system degradation, and severely affected urban environment of Wuhan. To restore the ecology system of the damaged mountain is an important ecological construction project. Guided with ecology theories, this paper analyzed and concluded the landscape restoration mode and technology of the damaged mountain, expounded the necessity of the ecology restoration project of the Fenghuang Mountain, explained the restoration plan, elaborated the restoration technology, investigated the effects of different restoration measures, discussed the key technology and put forward some countermeasures and suggestions. In the restoration plan, this paper analyzed the cause of formation and the characteristics of the mountain damage, investigate the ecological state, put forward the restoration object, discussed the restoration plan principle, concluded the plan idea and object, put forward the design concept, drew up the plant selection and design plan. The ecological restoration of the Fenghuang Mountain included geologic repairing and vegetation restoration. The geologic repairing included topography preparation, retaining wall construction, drain preparation. In vegetation restoration, the technology used included landscape plants transplanting, seed spraying sow with three-dimension net, seed spraying sow with steel net, seed spraying sow with replaced soil, finished vegetation blanket transplanting. Applying the above technology, vegetation restoration was finished from 10 to 90 degree of slope grade in the nearly 300000 m2 broken slope. Near one year's observation after the restoration works was conducted to research the growth states of the plants, the plant species diversity, the plant community diversity and the plant landscape, base on which the restoration effect was analyzed and valuated. Results showed that the vegetation was in good growth state, and good ecologic, social and economic effects were obtained. The research results had important value in Wuhan's "Friendly Environment Society" construction, and provided certain helpful references for comprehensive repairing and restoration of damaged mountain in Wuhan and other

T1  - Avian use of suburban greenways as stopover habitat
AN  - 226846212
AB  - Greenways may provide stopover habitat for migrating birds in otherwise inhospitable suburban landscapes. We examined the effect of greenway forested corridor width, vegetation composition and structure, and adjacent land cover on the species richness and abundance of migrating songbirds during spring and fall migration in Raleigh and Cary, North Carolina, USA. Generally, migrating birds were more abundant in wider forest corridors during spring and fall migration. During the spring, migrants were detected more commonly in greenways with taller trees and a higher percentage of hardwood trees. In the fall, migrant richness and abundance was highest in greenways with lower canopy cover, possibly because of the increased vertical complexity of the vegetation at these sites. Forest-interior migrant richness was not correlated with corridor width in either season, but these species were more abundant in greenways bordered by less bare earth and pavement cover in the spring. No other bird groupings were correlated with adjacent land cover measures. Although migrants used greenways of all widths, forested corridors wider than 150 m should be conserved whenever possible to provide stopover habitat for forest-interior migrants. Shrub cover should be retained to maintain vegetative complexity. Habitat for the greatest diversity of migrants can be provided by constructing greenways in areas of lower development intensity and encouraging residents to retain shrubs and trees on properties bordering greenways.

T1  - Amphibian populations at the Celery Bog Nature Area and the potential effects of land use and water quality
AN  - 366093057
AB  - Amphibian populations have been declining worldwide for the last century and the major cause of these declines have been habitat destruction. The Celery Bog was once drained for agricultural purposes but has since been restored to a wetland. Amphibian populations had not previously been studied at the Celery Bog Nature Area. This study provided baseline data on amphibians at the Celery Bog Nature Area for the city of West Lafayette. Amphibian mating calls and search and seize surveys were conducted in 2008 and 2009 to monitor amphibian populations. In 2008 and 2009 water samples were collected and analyzed for nitrate/nitrite, phosphate, and pH. The land use was analyzed using ArcGIS. The study found eight species of amphibians living in the nature area. The pothole wetlands not connected to the Celery Bog had the highest species richness both years. The nitrate/nitrite and phosphate levels were below levels that would impact amphibians. In 2009 the pH levels in the Celery Bog were higher than 8.5 on average which could potential impact amphibian populations. There was a negative correlation between species richness and pH in 2009. There was a positive correlation between the species richness and percentage of natural habitat inside each of the four buffer zones (30m, 60m, 289m, and 1km). The Celery Bog Nature Area provides multiple types of habitat for amphibian populations and safe corridors for amphibians to migrate through.

T1  - An exploration of the impact of greenway trail development on riparian habitat
AN  - 304973643
AB  - Greenways are linear parks generally designed and managed to support recreation and conservation. Ahern's (2004) greenway theory includes three hypotheses: co-occurrence of resources, inherent benefits of connectivity, and the compatibility of uses. The compatibility of recreation and conservation uses was the foundation for the current study. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of greenway development through an examination of trail footprint width (at 8, 10 and 12 ft widths plus their respective mowed areas), trail age, and surface type on percent canopy cover and surface temperature; the secondary purpose was to explore biodiversity through a comparison of tree species diversity for the greenway and a pristine natural area. Two greenways in Middle Tennessee were utilized to achieve the study purposes. Study findings revealed that eight foot asphalt trails do not effect percent canopy cover, while ten and 12 ft trails do effect percent canopy cover ( p = .000) as compared to on and off-site controls. As well, trail center surface temperatures were significantly different from on-site control surface temperatures (p = .000). The main effects model resulting from multivariate analysis of variance revealed that footprint width effects on percent canopy cover and surface temperature were significant; however, further analysis using Tukey's HSD post hoc analysis indicated that there were no significant effects, and the model lacked predictability and explained little variance (r2 =  .04). Study findings indicated that trail age had no effect on percent canopy cover. There was a significant, but weak correlation between on-site control canopy cover and surface temperature, yet not between the trail percent canopy cover and surface temperature. T-tests results indicated no significant difference between concrete and asphalt surface temperatures. Finally, descriptive analysis found tree species diversity lower on the greenway when compared to a pristine area. Study results may help planners and designers better integrate conservation of natural resources and recreation infrastructure in riparian greenways. Furthermore, study results may be helpful to greenway managers interested in understanding how vegetation management around hard surfaced trails may impact tree canopy cover. Finally, results from this exploratory study indicate future research directions.

T1  - Study on the Development Strategy of Pingnan County in Guangxi
TT  - 广西平南县发展战略研究
AN  - 1026920746
AB  - Pingnan County locates in the southeast of Guangxi, belongs to Guigang city of Guangxi with the county level Guiping city, Guangnan district, Guangbei district and Qintang district. The geography position is superior, which is the conjunction of the East Coastal developed areas and the resourceful western areas.


Since reforming and opening, Pingnan County has developed quickly, but at present the traditional industries are the main industries, the urban-rural dual structure still exists in the region. Now Pingnan County is in the key period of urbanization and industrialization. Pingnan County can go an economical development pathway of the characteristic industries and the preponderant industries, regarding the mainstay and obviously advantageous industries as the breakthrough, concerning the regional realities. 


Studies on the development strategy of Pingnan county has both theoretical and practical significance. The intra-county economy is the important foundation, the comprehensive and regional basic cell of the national economy. The economy of Pingnan county is not only a complex of the macroscopic economy and the microscopic economy, but also a complex of the urban economy and the rural economy.  The paper attempts to explore the problems of the development strategy of Pingnan County by utilizing the theories of regional economics.


Regarding Pingnan County which is becoming lagged comparatively as the object researched, the objective of the article is to find an overtaking method or way to exert the late-developing advantage to utmost by using the theories of regional economics and comparative analytical methods. 


The paper divides four chapters except Guide:


Chapter one discusses the development situation of Pingnan county. Before Pingnan county was incorporated into Guigang city in 1996, the economic strength of Pingnan county had been at the medium level within the eight counties or cities in original Yulin district. After establishing of Guigang city at prefecture level, the economic development total quantity of Pingnan county stood at the second status in the whole city, the per Gross Regional Product was at the first, the agricultural development strength is relatively abundant, the per Industrial Value-added was latter, the per capita annual income of urban households stood at the reciprocal second. According to Channer’s judgment standard about the economic development phase, at present Pingnan county is at the transition stage from the pre-industrial society to the prophase of industrialization. At present, the economic increase of Pingnan county has been good. From 1996 to 2004, GDP increased from 2249000000 Yuan to 4409000000 Yuan. In recent years the biggest power of the economic increase was the gross investment growing quickly. 


The advantages of development of Pingnan county displays in several aspects，including geography, natural resources, agriculture, land and labor force. The regional advantages are obvious, the traffic is convenient, Pingnan county has the superiority along the Xijiang river. The natural resources are abundant. The reserves proven of the limestone are 4600000000 tons. The advantageous conditions are offered to develop the characteristic and ascendancy agriculture products, on account of the subtropical climate, the good foundation of planting and raising industry, the high producing horizon. The industrial land is sufficient; the development cost of land is much lower than the cost in the East Coastal areas. The labor force is rich; the percentage of the persons whose educational level of the senior middle school ＆ higher level occupies 8.06%, the percentage of the persons whose educational level of the junior middle school ＆ higher level occupies 42.13%. On the other hand, some factors are constraining the next development of Pingnan county, such as the delay of urbanization, the low-level industry and the shortage of human resources reserves. In 2000 the urbanization level of Pingnan county was 19.0%. The proportion of the traditional farming, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery is excessively high. Because of the small value of industry and the low level of industry, the field and scope of the whole industry loading technology is restricted. The professional technical personnel reserves insufficiently. The proportion of agricultural, engineering and economic professional technical personnel is too low. Moreover, this will cause the lack of talented in the primary industry and the secondary industry. However the problems of “Agriculture, Rural Areas, and Farmers” are the main problems that effect the integration of urban and rural. 


 Chapter two analyses the external environment of the development of Pingnan county. Some factors such as the economic integration in the world, the global industrial transform and establishing of the China- ASEAN have brought some profound influences on the economic development of Pingnan county. Now China has entered the intermediate stage of urbanization and industrialization, Pingnan county should persist the guiding ideology of the sustainable development, catch hold of the opportunities of entry to WTO and the strategy of exploiting the west areas, accept initiatively the industrial transform from Guangdong province and Hongkong, strengthen the regional cooperation with “extensive Zhujiang delta” areas , cultivate some core industries or impetus industries in the economic coordination areas of “Yulin and Guigang corridor”.


In chapter three, the paper insists the guiding ideology and gives a strategic orientation of the development of Pingnan county, concerning the actual situations.


The overall strategic targets and the urban function of Pingnan county can be positioned as the following: the greatest building material industrial city in the southeast of Guangxi, regional assistant center, a base for yielding and processing extraversion subtropical farm produce, the front to accept the economic radiation and industrial transform from Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, the amenity landscape garden city by river possessing the characteristic of the south of China.


A preliminary forecast of the level of the economic development and urbanization has said that GDP will be over 12580000000 Yuan by 2015, GDP per capita will approximately achieve 8810 Yuan, GDP will be over 37515000000 Yuan by 2025, GDP per capita will approximately amount 22990 Yuan, that the urbanization level will be 39.05% by 2010, the urbanization level will be 47.33% by 2015, the urbanization level will be 56.26% by 2025.


In the future, the urban system of Pingnan county will be adopted possibly urban points and axes combination-network model. The group of regional cities and towns will develop according to three axes. The first will base upon the second-class road from Wuxuan county to Pingnan county and the main road along the Xijiang river. The second will base upon the second-class road from Nanning city to Wuzhou city. The third will base upon the second-class roads from Jinxiu county to Pingnan county and from Pingnan county to Rong county. In the future, the urban system will come into being two economic regions of the north and the south, regarding the county seat as the main development center, Daan town and Zhenlong town etc as the vice-center. The five towns of Danzhu, Daan, Sihuang, Daxin and Zhenlong will be selected as the central towns. The towns in the county seat and the central towns may be regarded as the optimization development towns, the other towns on the plains areas may be regarded as the emphatic development towns, the towns in the mountainous areas may be regarded as the limited development towns.


The strategic targets above will be divided into two stages. In the first stage, it will take roughly 10 years to speed up the infrastructure, optimize and update the industrial structure, strengthen the basic status of the agriculture, make great efforts to promote the industrialization and urbanization. In the second stage, it will continue to consummate the infrastructure, adjust reasonably the layouts of the primary industry, the secondary industry and the tertiary industry and realize initially the city modernization and the urban and rural integration.


The strategic focal points of Pingnan county are choosing and cultivating the leading industries and the new mainstay industries. Cement, chemical pesticide, handicraft manufacture and high quality highly effective characteristic agriculture may be determined the leading industries, because of their huge potential of development and their great advantages of resources, producing technology and producing cost. The cocoon silk industry, manufacture of paper, ceramics and manufacture of textile wearing apparel may be determined the new mainstay industries.


Chapter four puts forward six strategic measures of the development of Pingan county as follows. First, the industrialization should be speeded up though recruiting business and drawing capital. We should improve the soft and hard environment of investment, accept actively the industrial transform from Guangdong and Hongkong, and construct prominently the industrial gardens. Second, we should strengthen the human resources development. We should exert great efforts to improve the basic education, establish and perfect the vocational skill training system, and build a good environment to attract talented. Third, we should develop positively the non-government economy.  The government must give macroscopic instruction, guide the innovation of system and management, support the technical innovation and strengthen the service function. Fourth, we should transform the government function and improve the administration efficiency. Fifth, we should push forward the integration of urban and rural and promote the harmonious development of urban and rural. We should solve the problem of the rural surplus labor force shift, expand the way of the farmers’ additional income, establish and perfect the social security system of the rural areas. Sixth, we should insist the sustainable development of agriculture, industry and population to go the way of the sustainable development.


The innovations in the paper are chiefly expressed: Firstly, the development strategy of Pingnan county is studied in a new visual angle using the regional economic correlative theories. Secondly, the towns of Pingnan county are divided into optimization development towns, emphatic development towns and limited development towns for the first time, according to the guiding ideology of dividing functional areas in the 11th 5-year planning. Thirdly, the guiding thinking is brought forward first that the colony of the regional towns in Pingnan county must be developed in term of three axes. Fourth, six material and operable measures of the development strategy of Pingan county are brought forward concerning the situations of Pingnan county.





Key words: Development strategy，Strategic measuresAlternate abstract:平南县位于广西东南部，和县级桂平市、港南区、港北区和覃塘区同属于广西贵港市管辖，是东部沿海发达地区和资源丰富的西部地区的结合部，地理位置优越。                                                                                                                                                                 


改革开放以来，平南县得到很快发展，但目前仍是以传统产业为主，区域内城乡“二元”结构仍然存在。平南县现处在城市化和工业化发展的关键时期，必须结合本区域的实际，以支柱产业和优势明显的行业为突破口，走特色产业和优势工业的发展路子。


研究平南县的发展战略在理论上和实践上都具有很大的意义。县域经济是整个国民经济的重要基础，是国民经济中具有综合性和区域性的基本单元。平南县经济既是宏观经济和微观经济的结合，又是城市经济和农村经济的结合。论文试图运用区域经济学的理论，来探讨平南县发展战略问题，给其他类似的县域经济的研究提供较好的借鉴。


论文运用区域经济学的有关理论和比较分析的研究方法，以经济发展相对滞后的平南县为研究对象，探索一种能够最大限度发挥其区域后发优势的真正赶超的途径和方法。


除导论外，本文的结构共分四章：


第一章是对平南县的发展状况进行论述。1996年归并到贵港市前平南县的经济实力在原玉林地区八县市中，属于中等水平；地级贵港市成立后，平南县经济发展总量居于全市的第二位，人均地区生产总值居于第一位，农业发展实力相对雄厚，工业增加值的人均值偏后，城镇居民人均可支配收入在全市居倒数第二位。根据钱纳里关于经济发展阶段的判断标准，平南县现处于前工业社会向工业化前期过渡的阶段。当前，平南县的经济增长状况良好，从1996年到2004年，GDP由22.49亿元增加到44.09亿元。近年来经济增长最大的动力在于快速增大的投资规模。


平南县的发展优势表现在几个方面：区位、自然资源、农业、土地和劳动力。区位优势明显，交通便利，具有沿江优势。自然资源丰富，石灰石探明储量46亿吨。具有亚热带气候特点，种养业基础好，生产水平高，为发展具有特色的优势农业产品创造了得天独厚的条件。工业用地充足，土地开发成本远比东部沿海地区低得多。劳动力丰富，高中及高中以上文化程度的占8.06%，初中及以上文化程度的占42.13%。但城市化发展滞后、产业层次低和人力资源储备不足等因素还在制约着平南县下一步的发展。2000年平南县城市化水平为19.0%。传统农林牧副渔业比重过高、工业总量小、产业层次低，使得整个产业承载技术的领域和范围受到限制。专业技术人员储备不足，农业、工程系列与经济类的专业技术人员比例偏低，第一、二产业缺乏人才的支撑。 “三农”问题仍然是影响城乡一体化的主要问题。


第二章论述了平南县发展的外部环境。世界经济一体化、全球性的产业转移和中国—东盟自由贸易圈的构建对平南县的经济发展产生深远的影响。现在中国已进入城市化和工业化发展的中期阶段，平南县应该坚持可持续发展的指导思想，抓住加入WTO和西部大开发战略的实施的机遇，主动接受粤港产业转移，加强与“泛珠三角”的区域合作，在“玉贵经济走廊”的经济协作区内培育核心产业或带动性的产业。


论文在第三章里根据实际情况，坚持可持续发展的指导思想，对平南县进行发展定位。


平南县的总体战略目标定位和城市功能定位为：将平南县建成桂东南最大的建材工业城市、区域性辅助中心和外向型亚热带农产品生产与加工基地，成为接受粤港澳经济辐射和产业转移的前沿，建成宜居的具有南国特色的江滨山水园林城市。


对平南县经济发展水平和城市化水平初步预测。到2015年GDP达125.80亿元以上，人均GDP约达到8810元，到2025年GDP达375.15亿元以上，人均GDP约达到22990 元；2010年城市化水平为 39.05%， 2015年的城市化水平47.33%，2025年的城市化水平为56.26%。


平南县未来的城镇体系可能采用城镇点轴组合网络形式。区域城镇群体按三条轴线发展：第一条是以武宣至平南的二级公路和沿江公路干线为基础。第二条是以南宁至梧州的二级公路为基础。第三以金秀至平南、平南至容县的二级公路为基础。未来的城镇体系将以县城为发展中心，大安、镇隆等镇作为副中心，形成南北两个经济地区。确定丹竹、大安、思旺、大新、镇隆等5个建制镇为中心城镇，把建城区的城镇和中心城镇作为优化开发城镇，其它平原的城镇作为重点开发城镇，山区城镇则作为限制开发城镇。 


按两阶段实现上述的战略目标。第一阶段，大体上用10年左右时间，加快基础设施，促进产业优化升级，强化农业基础地位，努力推进工业化和城市化。第二阶段，2016—2025年，继续完善各项基础设施，合理调整一二三产业的布局，初步实现城市现代化和城乡一体化。


平南县的战略重点是选择培育主导产业和新兴支柱产业。水泥、化学农药、工艺品制造业和优质高效的特色农业等产业发展潜力巨大，在资源上、生产技术上和生产成本上都具有很大的优势，可以定位为主导产业。可以把茧丝绸产业、造纸业、日用陶瓷产业和纺织制衣产业作为新兴支柱产业来发展。


     第四章提出了平南县发展战略的六大对策：一是以招商引资加快工业化的进程。改善投资的软硬环境，积极承接粤港产业转移，突出工业园区的建设。二是加强人力资源的开发。切实抓好基础教育，建立和健全职业技能培训体系，营造吸引人才的良好的环境。三是积极发展民营经济。发挥政府的宏观指导作用，引导制度和管理创新，支持技术创新，强化服务功能。四是转变政府职能，提高行政管理效率。五是推进城乡一体化，促进城乡协调发展。解决农村剩余劳动力转移问题，拓宽农民增收的途径，建立健全农村社会保障制度。六是走可持续发展之路，坚持农业、工业和人口的可持续发展。


论文创新点可以概括为：一是运用区域经济学相关理论，用全新的视角去研究平南县发展战略。二是首次根据中国“十一．五规划”对功能区划分的指导思想，把平南县的城镇分为优化开发城镇、重点开发城镇和限制开发城镇三类。三是首次提出平南县区域城镇群体按三条轴线发展的指导思路。四是针对平南县的实际，提出了六个具体的、操作性强的平南县发展战略对策。

T1  - Trees for Toronto: Magazine of the Royal Ontario Museum
AN  - 199528330
AB  - Unable to save the trees, the ROM together with the City of Toronto came up with an innovative alternative: replace the lost tree canopy elsewhere and use the ROM's unique expertise to promote awareness and stewardship of the urban forest. Called Trees for Toronto, the collaborative project with the City Forester's Office has a mandate to plant trees in nearby Queen's Park and establish a tree identification and '* awareness program for the park.

              
In the summer of 2004 the Trees for Toronto project started with an assessment using the Neighbourwoods© protocol developed by two U ofT Faculty of Forestry professors. The position and condition of 290 trees was recorded on a satellite image of the park. The survey found 47 different species and cultivated varieties in the park, including three butternut trees, which are listed as endangered today. While Queen's Park is quite species rich for its size, six species account for 54 percent of its trees-Norway maple, red oak, Austrian pine, European ash, little-leafed linden, and white cedar. Only a few individuals represent each of the remaining 41 species. As is true in most of the city, Norway maple, an introduced species, is the most abundant tree. It's not surprising. For many years it was standard practice to plant introduced species in urban settings-they are less susceptible to drought and pollution. Needless to say, this practice has changed, with emphasis now placed on adding native species to the urban forest to restore natural ecosystems and create green corridors that can support native wildlife.

T1  - Circum-harbour afforestation plan around Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong
AN  - 304731240
AB  - Harbourfront greening to make better use of the unique harbour assets is Hong Kong Government's long-term vision of waterfront gentrification. Land reclamation in the Victoria Harbour has always been a cardinal way to cope with rapid urbanization in Hong Kong, producing more than 60 km2 (5.5%) of land within the 1,100 km2 territory since 1870s. With very limited public open space in built-up areas, impermeability and compactness of the city has generated extensive areas of saturated site coverage and negligence of plantable areas.    Waterfront greening and circum-harbour hillslope enrichment were investigated to yield pragmatic recommendations to improve city greenery. This study evaluates greening constraints in the city, finds potential sites for greening improvement, assesses feasibility of reviving degraded peri-hillslopes, and selects appropriate species to faciliate vegetation establishment. Solutions are proposed to increase green spaces along the coastal zone, connectivity among green spaces, pedestrian accessibility to the waterfront precinct, and per-urban woodland expansion.    The study is carried out at two locations: (1) the waterfront of Victoria Harbour including one to two street blocks adjacent to the coast; and (2) the urban fringe hillslopes which constitute a viewshed visible from the harbour. The waterfront section is divided into four harbourfront zones according to land use, prospect of potential development and land formation characteristics. Nearly 6 km2 of coastal land are included in the assessment. Major trunk roads and district distributors are included for a comprehensive site analysis.    Peri-urban hillslopes in five zones are delineated by natural topographic boundaries of prominent hills. Sluggish natural forest succession at some sites is attributed to instability of slopes and poor site conditions. There is room for improvement in terms of species selection, silvicultural treatment, and maintenance to accelerate woodland establishment at poor sites. To serve as indicators of planting capability, the site assessment of underlying constraints included slope steepness, aspect and instability, landform, parent materials and terrain components.    The Greening Potential Index (GPI) in five classes, developed to measure greening possibility of individual coastal sites, shows many high potential sites among 14 districts, of which 42 specific locations were identified for specific on-site and roadside greening recommendations. The Hillslope Suitability Index (HSI) in four classes was formulated to indicate hillslope planting suitability for a 5-year customised afforestation plan. With 43% of the sites in the second unfavourable class, tree planting requires special treatments and efforts. This plan aims at rehabilitating poor sites in the first stage, and enhancement planting of better sites thereafter. Mixed planting with more native species is preferred to enrich plant diversity of woodlands.    The greening endeavours aim at the quality and quantity of natural elements, allowing the limited plantable areas in the city to accommodate the optimal vegetation. All vacant or underused space should be enlisted in the greening programmes.    The findings hint strongly the need for a different mindset and methodology to bring more green parcels in built-up areas and to enhance the natural backdrop of the city.

T1  - Pedestrian corridors in downtown Dallas, Texas and their implications on the movement of downtown residents
AN  - 304707276
AB  - The City of Dallas has embarked upon an aggressive economic redevelopment effort in the downtown area. Economic goals of this redevelopment effort are closely tied to and dependent upon a critical mass of downtown residents. The target number of residents is 10,000 by 2015 (Strategic Engagement: Dallas' Economic Development Plan. City of Dallas, Office of Economic Development, 2005.) However, the urban form of downtown Dallas is a vehicle-oriented network of streets. Although downtown residency numbers have climbed from only 896 (excluding institutionalized persons) to 2,277 in the decade between 1990 and 2000 (Census.gov) and was estimated by the metropolitan planning organization to be 5,646 in 2005, no study has documented the location and travel mode choices of these residents. However, recent planning efforts have created physical pathways for pedestrian movement in the Main Street area.    Using concepts pioneered by landscape ecology, a wildlife behavior model theory, and surveys of downtown residents and key decision makers, patches and corridors utilized by downtown residents were mapped and analyzed. A new network of corridors was also recommended to better connect the patches identified in the study. In addition to the current land uses and activities, future nodes of activity were predicted along the corridors. These new were nodes predicted based on accessory activity attracted by the presence of large numbers of pedestrians.    An active street life is generally understood to be a desirable quality in attracting redevelopment to downtown areas. This study found that the lack of existing pedestrian corridors connecting patches of downtown activity inhibited pedestrian activity and promoted vehicular options, thus decreasing an active street life. The connection of patches within the habitat of downtown residents through designated corridors is applicable to any large urban centers with downtown populations. However, to be effective, the process of identifying patches relevant to populations must be conducted prior to corridor implementation and public entities, such as city planning and zoning regulations, must recognize and support creation of these corridors.

T1  - An 828 Year Streamflow Reconstruction for the Jordan River Drainage Basin of Northern Utah
AN  - 2537128430
AB  - Mountain water resources are essential to those living along the Salt Lake City urban corridor. Water resource planners base their policy on twentieth century climate conditions and streamflow records. Often these records only account for a small amount of the natural variability in streamflow and climate. By utilizing dendrochronology this study seeks to better understand variability of streamflow in the Jordan River Drainage Basin over the last 828 years. A GIS model was used to identify potential sampling sites where tree growth would be sensitive to climate and factors affecting stream run-off. Over eighty samples from ancient limber pine (Pinus flexilis) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) were obtained to perform the reconstruction. Results indicate significant correlation between tree growth and streamflow. A multiple linear regression model created with tree-ring width as the predictor of October - March American Fork River streamflow explained 51.7% of streamflow variance. Analysis of the reconstruction indicates that present records do not adequately represent potential streamflow variability, and several droughts of greater severity and length occurred before the instrumental period.

T1  - Floodplain connectivity and river corridor complexity: Implications for river restoration and planning for floodplain management
AN  - 305364761
AB  - River channels and floodplains are inextricably linked elements of river ecosystems, and hydrologic connections between the two affect geomorphic, ecological, and flood management conditions in river corridors. Many river channels and floodplains have been disconnected, making floodplain ecosystems among the most endangered in the world. Recently, river managers have begun to reconnect floodplains to restore degraded waterways. However, there is still considerable uncertainty associated with planning and design of floodplain reconnection.    To begin to address this uncertainty, I evaluated relationships between floodplain connectivity and river corridor complexity at different scales (i.e., river reach to bedform) and in different settings (i.e., agricultural to urban). I measured changes in river corridor complexity after floodplain disconnection along lower Deer Creek, a tributary to the Sacramento River draining 229 mi2 in Tehama County, California. Using recent and historical aerial photography, I measured decreases in riffle habitat (up to 84%), pool habitat (up to 100%), cumulative channel length (up to 72%), shaded riverine aquatic habitat (up to 81%) and riparian vegetation (up to 94%), and increases in riffle spacing (up to 1162%), pool spacing (up to 178%), and low flow channel width (up to 84%) between 1938 and 1999. These results suggest that significant and persistent reductions in river corridor complexity can be associated with floodplain disconnection, and provide an estimate of restoration potential for floodplain reconnection on lower Deer Creek.    Next, to link changes in complexity to river water temperature dynamics, I measured effects of hyporheic exchange on daily water temperature fluctuations in lower Deer Creek at sites of varying channel complexity. Comparing hourly temperature of upwelling hyporheic water with downwelling water, I observed up to 7.19°C reduction in amplitude of daily temperature fluctuation, up to 3.5°C reduction in daily peak temperature, and lag times between downwelling and upwelling peaks of up to 19 hours. Differences in downwelling and upwelling water temperature characteristics were strongly correlated with elevation difference between downwelling and upwelling sites (R2 = 0.61, 0.53, and 0.69; p < 0.008, 0.016, and 0.003 for amplitude reduction, peak reduction, and lag time, respectively), suggesting that channel simplification related to floodplain disconnection can affect processes occurring at the bar-unit scale.    I also assessed changes in river corridor complexity associated with small-scale floodplain reconnection through post project appraisals (PPAs) of five compound channel projects in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. In most cases, these projects resulted in improved geomorphic and ecological conditions, with width and elevation of created floodplain surfaces (relative to low flow dimensions) apparently the most significant influence on project success. This research builds on previous studies of channel change to develop a new method to measure changes in river corridor complexity associated with floodplain disconnection. In addition, this research adds to recent studies of hyporheic exchange by placing it in the context of river corridor simplification.    This research also provides a systematic assessment of post-project performance of compound channels, an increasingly applied but little studied approach to multi-objective flood management based on floodplain reconnection. Finally, this research proposes a new framework to more effectively put ecosystem restoration on equal footing with flood protection in planning processes for floodplain management.

T1  - Evaluation of rural land-use plans in protected area bio-networks in northeastern tanzania
AN  - 301673092
AB  - The application of rural land-use planning is seen by many in developing countries as a panacea for minimising land-use conflicts and for increasing the productivity of natural resources in African rangelands. However, this assumption has not been thoroughly tested in the context of wildlife corridors in African rangelands. The focus of the research work for this thesis was to evaluate both "conventional" and "participatory" approaches to land-use planning in an African rangeland setting, and to assess the impact of these land-use plans in mitigating conflict and enhancing conservation of important wildlife migratory routes. Nine villages were selected for study in Northeastern Tanzanian rangelands, within the Tarangire-Manyara, Greater Serengeti and MkomaziTsavo ecosystems. Several methods were used to provide an indication of the performance of the plans, against their stated objectives of minimising land-use conflict and conserving wildlife migratory routes. Eight hundred and fifty two households, 13 "expert witnesses" and 4 representatives of planning agencies were interviewed. Several field assessment visits and focus group discussions were also carried out. Review and analysis was conducted on archive data, land-use plans technical reports and general management plans for neighbouring Parks. The results of the research presented in this thesis revealed five major findings: (1) involvement of land-use stakeholders in land use preparation was low; (2) different types of conflicts and encroachments increased after the plans were implemented; (3) Park management failed to involve adjacent villages in the preparation and implementation of Park GMPs; (4) the amount of conflict around villages where plans were in place was comparable to that around villages with no plans, suggesting that the plans made no difference to conflict; (5) overall, both participatory and conventional plans failed to achieve their objectives of mitigating conflicts and enhancing conservation of wildlife corridors and dispersal areas. The major causes of weakness and failure of the plans to achieve their desired objectives were: (l) insufficient participation oflocal communities in the planning process; (2) lack of robust of robust, transparent and accountable implementation strategies for the plans; (3) inadequately qualified rural planners; (4) lack of a comprehensive vision - "holistic approach" - to the planning process. Taking these findings into account, the author has made recommendations for an improved Buffer Zone Land-use Planning framework (BUZLUP) that could contribute to progress in mitigating conflicts and enhancing both conservation and development in Northeastern Tanzania. It is concluded, however, that high quality plans in themselves cannot ensure the successful establishment and maintenance of effective wildlife corridors. In addition to improved planning strategies such as the proposed BUZLUP framework, other broader socio-economic issues need to be addressed, including strengthened conservation education, better protection for rural people's natural resources and support for their livelihoods, equitable benefit sharing from conservation and tourism activities, and more devolution of decision-making powers to the grass-roots level in communities neighbouring conservation areas.

T1  - Environmentalists criticize wildlife corridor plan
AN  - 457583586
AB  - CANMORE - Canmore environmental organizations are urging the provincial government to rethink the layout of wildlife corridors on Three Sisters Resorts property near Canmore.                 Mayor Ron Casey says the town should be allowed to make some decisions regarding wildlife corridors on Three Sisters lands because it is part of Canmore, but that right has been removed by the Canmore Clause of the Municipal Government Act after the NRCB decision.                 "Of course, the intent is that we want to maintain viable wildlife corridors and movement corridors throughout Three Sisters property when we look at their golf course development proposals on those corridors," [Dave Nielsen] said.

T1  - From Second Creek to New Pangea: A multi-scale analysis of patterns and trends in aquatic biodiversity
AN  - 304726644
AB  - The Earth's freshwater ecosystems are undergoing a period of dramatic change. The simultaneous expansion and contraction of aquatic species' ranges is leaving an indelible mark on the evolutionary histories of the world's freshwater species. This dissertation represents a compilation of research efforts that quantify, explain, and propose policy recommendations concerning current trends in aquatic biodiversity. Part II provides an appraisal of the status of the world's freshwater fishes that asks two primary questions—are all taxonomic groups equally susceptible to extinction, and can we identify a unifying suite of extinction risk factors? Although I concluded, that extinction risk is not randomly distributed among freshwater fish families, the identification of a unifying set of extinction predictors remains elusive. In Part III, focusing on the U.S., a species list was compiled for each of the lower 48 states to represent their historic and future freshwater fish faunas. Species richness was calculated for each state, and the degree of change in faunal similarity was estimated between neighboring states. Comparisons indicated that states are likely to become more distinct from their neighbors in the future. In Part IV, I evaluate aquatic diversity trends along a natural gradient within the state of Tennessee. Changes in species richness and faunal similarity occurring between historic and future faunas were calculated between ecoregions. Species richness was found to decrease statewide. Similarity increased for virtually all ecoregion-taxonomic combinations indicating that Tennessee is losing its historic biological distinctiveness. Part V represents a study of biophysical homogenization at a fine spatial scale. I compared the frequency of debris dams in a forested reference stream to a stream in a heavily urbanized watershed. I found that debris dams occurred in greater frequency within the forested reference stream compared to the urban stream. A follow-up analysis determined that although there was a significantly greater amount of riparian canopy litter within the urban stream corridor, the quality and timing of litter inputs prevented debris dam genesis and retention. It is believed that the scouring flows that typically accompany highly impervious urban watersheds contributed to decreased frequency of debris dams in the urban stream.

T1  - Using landscape structure indices to understand the possible impacts of landscape change: Case of the mountain preserves in the city of Phoenix, Arizona
AN  - 251081165
AB  - Historic land use development in Phoenix has impacted the city's ecologically valuable open spaces. This dissertation studies the possible effect of landscape change between 1968 and 1998 on the South Mountain Preserve (SMP) and Phoenix Mountains Preserve (PMP). Recommendations for a future development pattern are provided. Three principal analyses are employed: (1) matrix utility analysis; (2) isolation analysis; and (3) connectivity analysis. Black and white aerial photographs of the study area were used for the investigation in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The results indicate: (1) a decline in matrix utility value of 21.65% for SMP, and 36.50% for PMP, (2) an increase in isolation value of 1.28% for SMP, and 285% for PMP, and (3) a decline in the overall matrix connectivity value of 67.8%. The conclusions of the research are that the ecological values of the mountain preserves may change due to the historic land use pattern: (1) the areas surrounding the mountain preserves were occupied by environmentally less sensitive land use types, (2) existing open space patches became smaller and more isolated due to increasing fragmentation, (3) connectivity between the open space patches was paralyzed as the detrimental effect of urban sprawl, and (4) PMP experienced more decline in the ecological values than SMP. Recommendations primarily include: (1) encouraging more environmentally compatible land uses around the preserves, (2) creating buffer zones, (3) considering both content and the context of the preserve in management actions, (4) developing effective land acquisition and zoning plans, (5) unifying preservation efforts of different local and government agencies, (6) improving connectivity with other open-space systems, and (7) maintaining near-natural levels of biodiversity in the urban matrix.

T1  - Canmore developer calls on town to enforce corridor bylaws.
AN  - 457574236
AB  - "Dogs have a tendency to push bush and chase wildlife and it does complicate matters. It's definitely an issue ... bylaw enforcement (officers) need to get out there," [Frank Kernick] said. A town spokesperson couldn't be reached for comment. Trails are carved through wildlife corridors for human use, but many of them cut perpendicularly across the zones to minimize human impact. Kernick said off-leash dogs roam throughout the corridors and further upset the natural movement patterns of wildlife. Off-leash dogs also complicate the developer's wildlife monitoring program. Eagle Terrace takes part in an ongoing program to monitor the corridor near its subdivision in north Canmore, and Kernick said dog prints are outnumbering the tracks of other animals.

T1  - The natural South Florida system II: Predrainage ecology
AN  - 758231255
AB  - The goal of the South Florida restoration process is to reestablish a sustainable ecological system that approximates the predrainage system (i.e., the system that existed before canals and water control structures were built). A critical step in the restoration process is to describe the predrainage system with sufficient detail to capture the essential landscape features (e.g., space, connectivity, patterns) that gave the region its defining character and supported its natural abundance and diversity of plants and wildlife.

              
A previous attempt at reconstruction of predrainage (circa 1870) vegetation patterns covered only the Everglades (Davis et al., 1994) but introduced a concept of landscape mosaics that should be extended to South Florida. We propose 16 landscape units that include freshwater landscapes, upland landscapes, coastal wetlands, and estuaries (particularly Florida and Biscayne Bays), the Florida Keys and Reef Tract, and the Inner Southwest Florida Shelf.

              
The predrainage area, because of its enormous size, supported a landscape heterogeneity that was advantageous to animals with several distinct habitat-related life strategies. Five species have been selected to illustrate different dependencies on landscape patterns in predrainage South Florida: wood stork (Mycteria americana), American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis), Cape Sable seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis), and pink shrimp (Penaeus duorarum). As individuals or as populations, these animals operated across several spatial and temporal scales. The predrainage system's large spatial extent and complex hydropatterns allowed wood storks and other animals with large feeding ranges to take advantage of the strongly seasonal rainfall pattern, while at the same time providing a refuge somewhere in the system for survival of all other species. Landscape heterogeneity and large spatial extent promoted the region's natural wildlife abundance and species diversity.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Concepts for alternative suburban planning in the northern Phoenix area
AN  - 229642830; 01798104; 04236707
AB  - As part of the ongoing cooperation between the city of Phoenix and Arizona State University, a charrette was organized.  Planners, landscape architects, environmental scientists, and architects explored concepts for development within a 110-square-mile portion of Phoenix.  The charrette was the summation of over a year of environment studies of the planning area.  This part of northern Phoenix occupies a largely undeveloped upper Sonoran desert landscape experiencing intense development pressure.  Four charrette teams addressed desert preservation, rural desert development, suburban desert development team.  One of these called for an alternative patterns of development aligned with natural drainage corridors.  Several concepts from the charrette and findings from the environmental research were adopted by the city in the revised general plan for the area.

T1  - The effectiveness of urban space corridors in meeting recreational habitat and wildlife needs (BL)
AN  - 301563272
AB  - Urban space corridors can be defined as linear tracts of undeveloped, vegetated land located in city centres and suburbs that accommodate the recreational needs of human users and the refugia requirements of wildlife. This research study investigated the planning, design, use and management of urban corridors in many locations throughout the world.  The hypothesis selected for the study was to determine if managed recreational use is compatible with habitat conservation and wildlife occurrence in open space corridor systems. To do this detailed site based surveys were conducted in Singapore and many completed corridor systems in the United Kingdom were investigated for selection criteria, design parameters and management practices. Other locations and corridors schemes were also researched in the literature and site visits were made to Australia, New Zealand, South African and America. The partially completed island-wide network of park connectors in Singapore provided a suitable resource for an on site assessment of recreational use, bird occurrence and corridor maintenance and management.It was determined that there was strong public support for and enthusiastic use of corridor trails and that good opportunities were available for improving biodiversity. Whilst there is still doubt on the viability of corridor resources to act as conduits for wildlife they are effective as wildlife refuges subject to habitat design. In cases where corridors are narrow or even partially disconnected continuity of recreational trails is considered important to achieve. For wildlife, such as birds, their general mobility tends to overcome minor fragmentation effects. The importance of the matrix that comprises the surrounding land adjoining the corridors was established for wildlife (birds), especially where corridors are narrow or are closely encroached by densely built developments such as city centres. Compatibility between recreational use and bird occurrence was determined through the surveys and a comparative evaluative framework was devised for ten corridor locations in Singapore to include environment, habitat and maintenance characteristics.

T1  - The regeneration of an urban corridor: Enriching the experience of a highway strip at the city's edge
AN  - 304462422
AB  - In The Granite Garden, Anne Spirn envisions a future city where "The paths on which people move into and through the city are designed with care. Every street and highway, and every other transportation corridor, is designed for efficient movement, for pleasure, and as an asset to the neighborhood through which it moves" (Spirn 1984, 270).    This practicum provides an examination of one of those "paths on which people move into and through the city", a Winnipeg traffic corridors, Pembina Highway, between the Killarney Ave., Kirkbridge Dr. Intersection, and the Perimeter Highway. The practicum looks at what traffic corridors are, what factors have contributed to their present structure, appearance, and character, and what can be done to improve the experience both of being in the corridor and of moving through it. The focus of the proposal is on community liveability and the pedestrian environment.    The practicum begins by reviewing various historic and current factors which have influenced the evolution of cities and streets. The corridor, Pembina Highway and its context are analyzed, and factors which affect the use of the site are examined.    The results of a literature review are presented in an overview of current design ideas and issues associated with streets, cities, and neighborhoods. Issues identified by the research are used to generate a functional, cohesive, and aesthetically pleasing design for the site. Plant material, pedestrian walkways, open space, bicycle paths, signage, and lighting are all part of the requirements for an attractive, more human scale street environment that reflects the character and identity of the community, provides opportunities for people to move easily through the area, and is supportive of local businesses. This design presents the Pembina Highway traffic corridor as a meaningful and vital urban place as well as an important gateway to Winnipeg.

T1  - Geomorphology and Structure of Taal Volcano and the Macolod Corridor, Philippines From Remote Sending [i.e. Sensing] and Digital Terrain Data
AN  - 2560857442
AB  - Synoptic coverage of Southwestern Luzon provided by remote sensing images and new digital terrain data yields new insight into the geomorphology, geologic history and structure of Taal Volcano. Structural evidence for the occurrence of extension at Taal is determined, and a mechanism linking extension and volcanism at Taal to termination of a proximal right-lateral fault, is proposed. The morphologies and structure of other volcanic centers in SW Luzon are also examined, and similar mechanisms of control to their locations are proposed.Taal is characterized by both historically frequent, highly explosive eruptions, and by prehistoric eruption(s) of colossal proportions. The current eruptive center (Volcano Island) occupies a prehistoric, lake-filled volcano-tectonic depression, previously interpreted to be a graben containing caldera(s). Taal is located within an ENE-aligned volcanic region called the Macolod Corridor, which lies broadly normal to the trend of the Bataan-Mindoro subduction-related volcanic arc. The Macolod Corridor is characterized by recently erupted primitive basalts and NE-striking normal faults; therefore previous investigators have argued that Macolod Corridor volcanism is controlled by extension or trans-tension. A major goal of this study is to more closely examine structural evidence for extension.The development of a complete structural understanding of Taal has been impeded largely by poor field access and exposure, due to ubiquitous dense vegetation. This study therefore employs eight remote sensing and digital terrain data sets of SW Luzon as sources of geomorphic and structural information. The data sets include radar backscatter data, the most useful of which is Shuttle Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C) multi-channel data; two Digital Elevation Maps (OEMs), one of radar derivation, and one of topographic map derivation; a Digital Bathymetric Map (DBM) of Lake Taal; and a SPOT multispectral scene of Taal VTD. The DBM is mosaicked with the two DEMs to provide comprehensive views of Taal VTD.

T1  - Four legs good, two legs bad: the pursuit of an animals-only utopia is making BC jobs an endangered species (Wildlands' Project and the Yellowstone to Yukon Biodiversity Strategy (Y2Y))
AN  - 207106483
AB  - It's no secret that B.C.'s eco-zealots fantasize about dismantling roads, closing towns, and choking industry. If their goals were ever fully realized, wild animals would multiply unchecked in vast unbroken tracts of provincial wilderness, while humanity huddles in shrinking islands of civilization. Until recently, however, such grandiose plans could be dismissed as green pipe-dreams, since environmental extremists had accomplished little more than isolated acts of sabotage. Not any more. A recent episode of David Suzuki's The Nature of Things highlighted the increasing credence being accorded the "Wildlands Project," a plan to depopulate huge areas of western North America. Still, public knowledge remains sketchy of just how sweeping that plan is. Its strategists have carefully crafted a step-by-step script, and they have made key strides towards their  fauna-first fantasy. As a result, critics warn, the livelihoods of thousands of B.C. families in resource-dependent communities are at risk. The success of the environmental movement in influencing B.C.'s ruling New Democrats is one key reason to take the Wildlands Project seriously. Many of its backers, such as the Western Canada Wilderness Committee and the Sierra Club, have strong links with the provincial NDP. And during the NDP's first term, environmentalists managed to lay much of the groundwork for the Wildlands Project's central goal of creating immense development-free land corridors by persuading Victoria to sharply increase the scope of provincial land set-asides. That NDP willingness to placate greens continues, as evidenced by a recent government pledge to seek United Nations "biosphere reserve" status for the contentious Clayoquot Sound area. Activists also convinced the Harcourt New Democrats to impose the 1994 Forest Practices Code to minimize the environmental impact of logging. Company spokesmen blame those regulations for much of the current malaise that pervades the forest industry (see story, page 22). Last month, television viewers were afforded a glimpse of the environmental movement's future plans. Dr. Suzuki, the former University of B.C. geneticist who has become Canada's highest-profile environmental propagandist, devoted the February 20 episode of his weekly CBC series to extolling the virtues of the "Yellowstone to Yukon (Y2Y) Biodiversity Strategy." Y2Y seeks to link Rocky Mountain parks with protected migration corridors and buffer zones in which human activity is severely restricted. In some cases, roads would be dismantled and businesses closed so grizzly bears can range freely. "Y2Y has been developing for years right under our noses," says Jack Carradice, executive director of the B.C. Environmental Information Institute. "In some areas, it is practically a fait accompli. It's a huge threat to Cranbrook, Revelstoke, Prince George, and other communities along the Rockies." More troubling still is that Y2Y is merely the flagship endeavour of the Wildlands Project, created in 1992 by Earth First founder Dave Foreman. The project aims to eliminate human activity in at least half of North America. "There's very big money and influence behind this scheme," says Mr. Carradice. "We can't afford not to take it seriously." Dr. Suzuki characterizes the Rockies as a place where "everywhere you look, life has found a foothold." However, "as in much of North America, nature doesn't have the space it needs. The landscape is broken into fragments." The first "fragment" examined is Wy- oming's Yellowstone National Park, a one-million-hectare preserve established in 1872 that is home to one of the world's largest elk herds, 3,400 bison, and 300 grizzlies. "Nature is in trouble here," Dr. Suzuki claims, explaining that when migratory animals move beyond park boundaries, they risk being "shot or slaughtered" by humans. He also laments that timber is being harvested and tourist facilities are being built just beyond park boundaries. Human activity nearby is only part of the alleged problem. With three million visitors a year and climbing, Dr. Suzuki warns that Yellowstone "is being crowded out...parks are becoming prisons, embattled islands of disturbed and damaged wilderness." He adds that male grizzlies can range up to 2,400 square kilometres, but since Yellowstone's grizzly population has been isolated, "bears will disappear due to inbreeding if people don't kill them first." The Wildlands Project, a "plan for the next 1,000 years," is then unveiled. Louisa Wil-cox, a Wildlands Project director, describes her colleagues as "a collection of conservationists, visionaries, philosophers and biologists attempting to  define a broader vision of wildland protection in North America. This vision is based for the first time on good  science." Nothing more is revealed about the project, other than that its members want buffer zones around protected areas in the Rockies and "wildlife corridors" to "reconnect" them.

T1  - The dispersal, storage and remobilization of heavy metals in the River Aire contaminated by urban and industrial wastes.
AN  - 301520055
AB  - Industrial and urban activities in the Leeds catchment of the River Aire have caused the widespread dispersal and contamination by a variety of pollutants, including heavy metals.  This contamination is reflected by enhanced metal concentrations in the sediments and soils of the river and floodplain.  The cycling of sediment and associated metals in the fluvial environment is highly related to hydrological, geomorphological and chemical phenomena.  The main research objective is to investigate quantitatively the dispersal, storage and remobilization of heavy metals in the Leeds reach of the River Aire.A wide variety of relevant processes are analysed.  Metal pollution studies have often neglected urban and industrial catchments, where sources of pollutants to the river channel are diverse.  In the past, heavy metals have entered the river from industrial activities, sewage disposal and coal combustion.  The main present source of metals is the disposal of domestic and industrial effluent from sewage treatment works.The fluvial dispersal of wastes has caused enhanced concentrations of heavy metals in aquatic sediment and floodplain soils.  This results in long-term storage of metals in river corridors and poses problems as sediments act as a source of contaminants long after pollution of the fluvial systems has been abated.  The pollution problem is most severe immediately downstream of sewage treatment works, through the city centre, where traffic and industrial density is greatest and where floodplains are frequently inundated with floodwaters.Heavy metals are not necessarily permanently fixed by the sediment and can be remobilised through mechanical, chemical and biological processes, affecting surface and groundwater quality and plant animal and human health.  However, it is not the total amount of a metal stored in sediment, but how it is actually bound that is important in assessing its environmental impact.  Results suggest that a significant proportion of each metal is held in a potentially mobile and bioavailable form, particularly cadmium.The data collected is used to compile mass budgets of sediments and associated metals for the alluvial area of the River Aire in Leeds.  The results suggest that this section of the Aire contributes large metal loads to the Humber Estuary and out into the North Sea.

T1  - [Riparian ecosystem recovery in arid lands: strategies & references]
AN  - 207673589
AB  - [George O. Malanson]'s book is the more comprehensive and theoretical of the two. The focus is on the value of the ideas and method of landscape ecology in understanding and to a lesser extent, in planning and managing riparian areas. In the spirit of the Cambridge Studies in Ecology Series, Malanson presents a wide - ranging and relatively current review of the application of landscape ecology to riparian areas. In so doing he reviews the history of the development of landscape ecology, links the ideas and methods to riparian topics, structures and processes, and eventually to forest, grassland and other ecoregions, channel dynamics, community structure and patterns, edge effects, soil moisture, flooding and other relevant topics. Considerable space is devoted to disturbance and its effects on landforms, and biological communities. Sections of the book are also devoted to corridors, plant dispersal, landscape reproduction and modeling. Overall, the Malanson book is a good general introduction to riparian landscapes from the perspective of landscape ecology. However, it does not devote much attention to riparian wildlife and to the role of riparian areas and landscape ecology in wildlife conservation. In this sense the book is oriented more to the approaches that geographers usually take than to those of more wildlife or biologically oriented scientists, scholars and professionals.

T1  - Biodiversity, wilderness & ecological cities
AN  - 223161052
AB  - As far back as 1970, Eugene Odum, whose ecology textbooks are used in universities throughout North America, estimated that 40% of the State of Georgia should be managed as natural areas. Two years later, along with H.T. Odum, he suggested that managing half of southern Florida as natural area and half as cultural land was optimal. Currently, [Reed Noss] and [Michael Soule], while recognizing that each region must be assessed individually, suggest at least half of the land area of the 48 lower states be encompassed for management as wilderness areas. Given the fragmented condition of the United States, much of this land would have to be restored to wilderness through ecological regeneration, which would include, for example, the removal of roads, the removal of exotics and the replanting of native species. For areas in Canada that have more wild land remaining, they recommend higher targets. In British Columbia, [Jeff McNeely] (who has admitted making a mistake by recommending 12% protected areas to the Brundtland Commission) suggested 70% of land mass as protected areas as a reasonable figure for B.C. in his recent talk; "Biodiversity: New Ideas in Protected Areas". Obviously McNeely has been paying more attention to conservation biologists lately and so should we all.

              
Habitat fragmentation, as Noss and others have shown, is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity. It occurs when large areas of natural habitat are broken up into smaller, isolated pieces or "islands". In order to ensure biodiversity for the entire range of species, including genetic, species, ecosystem and landscape diversity, parks and protected areas must be connected to each other. Only in this way can evolutionary processes such as population dispersion and differentiation, gene pool flow and mixing, and mutation be maintained. Noss and Larry Harris have defined connectivity with respect to protected areas as a reserve system where individual reserves are functionally united into a whole thatis greater than the sum of its parts.

              
A New Yorker, [Benton MacKaye] analyzed the "industrial water - shed" of New York City. At that time 75 years ago New York was the harbinger of the automobile age. MacKaye clearly understood the relationship of cities to wilderness. He saw the wilderness as containing both the psychological and natural forces needed to help stem the tide of civilization. For MacKaye, the "primeval world" contained the source of life itself. The biological and spiritual "key" to the restoration of New York's industrial watershed lay in the mountain wilderness of New England wilderness of those mountains. The Appalachian Trail built by hundreds local volunteer groups and individuals inspired by MacKaye's vision of the eastern mountains as the backbone of a regenerated Appalachia remains intact to - day. It may yet prove to be the "backbone" of ecological restoration in the eastern U.S.

T1  - Community satisfaction and mobility decisions: A case study in Jubail Industrial City, Saudi Arabia
AN  - 304087426
AB  - This dissertation provides a partial explanation for transience in Jubail Industrial City (JIC) in Saudi Arabia despite abundant housing and employment opportunities. A quantitative analysis of a self-administered questionnaire sample of 540 JIC employees revealed that five community attachment factors related to residents' demographics, concrete and perceived housing attributes, and future housing expectations contribute to approximately 45% of the residents' overall satisfaction variance while the latter explained almost 35% of the variance in their mobility decisions. Open-ended response in the latter sample, and the response of nine additional interview cases revealed that inadequacies in social climate and dwelling maintenance were primary contributors to dissatisfaction and the intention to move by JIC residents. Dissatisfaction with the social climate was determined by the nature of JIC as a remote town from the homeplace and major urban centers, and as a work-dominated place with little time for leisurely social activities. Dissatisfied movers attributed their perceptions of declining housing conditions to profit-oriented maintenance contracting at the expense of quality, a perception that is heightened by residents' concern about the long-term effects of sand-storms and air pollution on housing upkeep. In order to enhance residents' commitment to stay in JIC, officials need to enhance the town's connectivity with the rest of the country, diversify leisurely pursuits, expand maintenance policy options for the residents, involve them in the decision-making process, and intensify the use of heat-resistant vegetation along community borders with desert and industrial areas.

AB  - The diversity of both the population and terrain coupled with the recalcitrance of oil and gas companies have made the new subdivision ordinance to accommodate the special needs of Alaska's North Slope Borough a challenging project.  The ordinance was designed to respond to local concerns about appropriate street and lot design and orientation in the 88,000-square-mile borough.  Construction Systems Management (Anchorage) developed the ordinance in coordination with the borough planning staff.  Among the provisions are those that: 1.  prohibit street and road development across the migration paths of wildlife, 2.  encourage roads and transportation corridors to be minimized by such means as clustering, 3.  encourage streets to be aligned so as to maximize the natural removal of snow, 4.  provide for a platting administrator to process minor plats, and 5.  give the borough authority to require the dedication of lands for trails and subsistence areas, such as a whaling park.  The North Slope Borough now has 3 land-management tools to cope with rapidly changing conditions: 1.  the zoning ordinance, 2.  the new subdivision ordinance, and 3.  the overall comprehensive plan.
