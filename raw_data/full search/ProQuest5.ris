AB  - Poultry production and trading in India have been facing a spectacular growth as the demand for poultry products increases. Live bird shops (LBSs) and poultry trading practices are known risk factors in the spread of diseases within poultry production and distribution networks. Although such shops are ubiquitous in India, poultry trading practices and potential impact on disease risk are poorly understood. The objectives of this study were to characterise LBSs for Exotic Broiler (EB) and Desi species, based on trading practices likely to increase infectious risk, and to assess the connectivity between shops through the trade of live poultry.A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted in 86 LBSs, selected through a multi-stage sampling method. Eight cities were first purposively selected and, within each city, shops were identified using random spatial sampling. The standardised questionnaires focused on shop management characteristics, hygiene practices and details of their chicken suppliers. The suppliers were then contacted and asked about their trading practices and suppliers until catchment areas were identified. Finally, disease transmission pathways were investigated and poultry trading networks were constructed for EB chickens, to assess the connectivity between shops.Preliminary descriptive analysis suggests a high heterogeneity in the scale of operations, with daily sales ranging from 6 up to 800 and from 0 to 30 chickens, respectively for EB and Desi species. Most of the shops reported to have unsold chickens at the end of the day, with a proportion of unsold chickens reaching up to 26% and 45.2%, respectively for EB and Desi chickens. Several practices were identified as having a potential influence on disease introduction and transmission, into and within the shops. The transport of chickens from farms to shops typically involves one (85.3%) or two intermediaries (10.3%). While each city obtained chickens only from one to four districts (out of the 33 districts of Gujarat), four districts supplied more than one city.The described practices may promote pathogen amplification within Gujarat’s shops. Moreover, the network shaped by poultry movements, regarding EB chickens, connect distant poultry populations that include both tribal and non-tribal areas, increasing the risk of pathogen spread in the region. Nevertheless, most of the surveyed cities get their supplies from the closest district(s). Further investigation on risk pathways for disease transmission and identification of their geographical and socio-economic determinants are some of the next steps.Alternate abstract:A produção e comércio de aves na Índia tem crescido face ao aumento da procura de produtos avícolas. Os mercados de aves vivas (MAVs) e práticas relacionadas são reconhecidos como fatores de risco na disseminação de doenças entre redes de produção e de distribuição (RPD) de aves. Embora os MAVs sejam ubiquitários na Índia, o impacto das suas práticas na introdução de agente patogénicos são pouco compreendidos. Este estudo tem como objetivo caracterizar os MAVs para as espécies “frango exótico” (“FE”) e “Desi”, com base nas diferentes práticas de comercialização que podem influenciar o risco de doença, e determinar o grau de conectividade entre mercados através do tráfego de aves vivas.Um estudo transversal foi conduzido em 86 MAVs, selecionados por método de amostragem multi-etapas. Inicialmente foram selecionadas 8 cidades e, em cada cidade, escolhidos os MAVs por método de amostragem espacial aleatória. Os questionários abordaram características comerciais, práticas de higiene e informação detalhada sobre fornecedores. Os fornecedores foram também contatados e as duas práticas foram novamente investigadas até identificar o local de origem das aves. Foram também investigadas vias de transmissão de agentes patogénicos, de acordo com as práticas descritas, e foram construídas RPD de aves, para avaliar a conectividade entre MAVs.A análise preliminar sugere uma grande heterogeneidade na escala de operações dos MAVs, com vendas diárias de 6 a 800 e de 0 a 30 galinhas, respetivamente para “FE” e “galinhas Desi”. A maioria dos MAVs reportaram ter aves por vender no final de cada dia, com proporções que chegam aos 26% para “FE” e 45.2% para “Desi”. Várias práticas foram identificadas como potenciais vias de introdução ou transmissão de doença, para e entre MAVs. O transporte de aves desde áreas de produção até aos estabelecimentos de venda, envolve geralmente 1 (85.3%) ou 2 (10.3%) intermediários. Cada cidade recebe galinhas desde 1 a 4 distritos (num universo de 33 distritos em Gujarat) e 4 distritos fornecem mais do que 1 cidade.As práticas descritas podem promover a persistência e amplificação de doença em MAVs em Gujarat. A rede formada pelos movimentos de aves entre estabelecimentos interliga populações distantes, incluindo áreas tribais e não tribais, o que incrementa o risco de disseminação de doenças. A maioria das cidades estudadas obtém as suas aves dos distritos vizinhos. Alguns dos próximos passos incluem investigações adicionais de vias da transmissão de doença e identificação de determinantes geográficos e socioeconómicos.

T1  - Active Transport Network Design Based on Transit-Oriented Development and Complete Street Approach: Finding the Potential in Qazvin
AN  - 2632777299
AB  - Today, automobile dependency constantly causes traffic congestion, delays, reduced access, increased fuel and energy consumption, and environmental emissions. Automobile dependency has caused many direct and indirect transportation problems that may influence our life. Urban planners and transportation engineers seek to improve transport networks considering social issues. One of the most successful solutions for advocating sustainable transport is transit-oriented development (TOD). Another solution that planners encourage to use is designing the roadways based on a complete street approach, which is a system that provides safe, convenient, and comfortable travel and increases accessibility for users of all ages regardless of their transport modes. The present study employed the saturated roads that have heavy traffic most of the time and public transport e-ticket data to investigate the potential complete streets in Qazvin. An online questionnaire was developed using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method based on the TOD and the complete street framework to investigate the essential criteria for redesigning the network based on the active transport approach. Thus, after analyzing the six criteria (density, diversity, distance, accessibility, demand management, and design) and eight sub-criteria (pedestrian flow, pedestrian density, connectivity, safety, bike route, bus route, road width, and urban tree canopy index), the proposed active transport network emerged and results show that five high priority streets were identified to be considered as a solution.

T1  - Landscape features and caribou harvesting during three decades in Newfoundland
AN  - 2623496478
AB  - Landscapes can influence the distribution of harvesting by influencing animal distribution and hunter access. For species like caribou, Rangifer tarandus, decades-long shifts in abundance and distribution might alter such relationships, but few studies have been conducted at such scales. We examined relationships between landscape features and 21,380 harvest records of migratory caribou in Newfoundland during caribou population growth (1980s), cessation of growth (1990s), and decline (2000s). We focused on features hypothesized to influence the distributions of caribou and hunters: lichen landcover, roads, cutblocks, outfitter camps, power lines, and towns. We uncovered larger harvests by resident hunters of male and female caribou among lichen landcover, likely providing preferred caribou forage, and larger harvests by non-resident hunters of male caribou away from towns, reflecting the locations of outfitter camps. Only during later decades, resident harvests occurred nearer power lines and cutblocks, likely providing hunter access and reflecting risk-prone foraging by caribou. We surmise that the harvest was facilitated by open habitats, preferred by caribou, and anthropogenic features leading to hunter access, especially as the caribou population declined. Such knowledge at broad scales is increasingly important in an era of widespread disruption to landscapes.Alternate abstract:RÉSUMÉLes prélèvements fauniques peuvent être influencés par l’effet des paysages sur la répartition des animaux et l’accès des chasseurs. Pour des espèces comme le caribou, Rangifer tarandus, des changements d’abondance et de répartition peuvent altérer ces relations durant des décennies, mais peu d’études ont été réalisées à cette échelle. Nous avons examiné les relations entre les caractéristiques du paysage et 21 380 prélèvements de caribou migratoire à Terre-Neuve pendant une période de croissance de la population de caribou (les années 1980), de cessation de croissance (les années 1990) et de déclin (les années 2000). Nous nous sommes concentrés sur les caractéristiques supposées influencer la répartition des caribous et des chasseurs: le recouvrement de lichen, les routes, les parterres de coupe forestière, les camps de pourvoiries, les lignes de transport électrique et les villes. Nous avons révélé des prélèvements plus élevés de caribous mâles et femelles par des chasseurs résidents dans les sites à lichen fournissant apparemment un fourrage préféré par le caribou. Nous avons aussi révélé des prélèvements plus élevés de caribous mâles par les chasseurs non-résidents loin des villes, en lien avec les localisations de camps de pourvoiries. Pendant les décennies les plus récentes, les prélèvements par des chasseurs résidents ont eu lieu plus près des ligne de transport électrique et des parterres de coupe forestière, probablement parce que l’accès y était plus aisé pour les chasseurs et que les caribous y avaient des comportement plus à risque. Nous présumons que le prélèvement était facilité par les habitats ouverts, préférés par les caribous, et par des structures anthropiques facilitant l’accès des chasseurs, surtout en période de déclin des populations de caribou. Ces connaissances à grande échelle sont de plus en plus importantes dans une ère de perturbation généralisée des paysages.

T1  - Novel Strategies for Glutamate Clearance in the Glia-Deprived Synaptic Hub of <i>C. Elegans</i>
AN  - 2615101574
AB  - As the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain, Glutamate (Glu) is critical for normal neuronal physiology. Disruption in Glu clearance results in hyper-stimulation of glutamatergic circuits, potentially leading to excitotoxic neurodegeneration. The canonical model of brain connectivity describes glutamatergic synapses as well insulated and enveloped by glia. These glia express Glu Transporters (GluTs) which work to clear Glu following synaptic activity. However, critical areas of the brain such as the mammalian hippocampus display poor synaptic isolation, which may result in Glu spillover between adjacent synapses and subsequent loss of circuit specificity. How accurate signal transmission is achieved in these glia-deprived areas remains unclear. We approach this question using the C. elegans system, which faces the same dilemma as the mammalian hippocampus. Using a combination of behavioral assays and imaging of transgenic animals expressing Ca2+-sensitive reporter GCaMP or Glu-sensitive reporter iGluSnFR, we demonstrate a combined role of synaptic location and pharyngeal pulsatility in efficient Glu clearance of the nerve ring. We find that perfusion of Glu-rich interstitial fluid plays a vital role in GluT-mediated synaptic clearance, shown in our experiments where we induce paralysis of pharyngeal and head muscles to inhibit local movement. This study provides novel insights to mechanisms of effective Glu clearance in the absence of glia, a feature shared between nematodes and vital areas of the mammalian brain. Investigating novel mechanisms of Glu clearance can inform us in seeking candidate targets for therapeutic interventions in brain ischemia, and potential ways of manipulating brain pulsations and heart rate to promote clearance of solutes and aggregates (such as amyloid β) in patients to slow the onset of Alzheimer’s disease and other neuropathies.

T1  - Near-critical 2D percolation with heavy-tailed impurities, forest fires and frozen percolation
AN  - 2597941346
AB  - We introduce a new percolation model on planar lattices. First, impurities (“holes”) are removed independently from the lattice. On the remaining part, we then consider site percolation with some parameter p close to the critical value pc. The mentioned impurities are not only microscopic, but allowed to be mesoscopic (“heavy-tailed”, in some sense). For technical reasons (the proofs of our results use quite precise bounds on critical exponents in Bernoulli percolation), our study focuses on the triangular lattice. We determine explicitly the range of parameters in the distribution of impurities for which the connectivity properties of percolation remain of the same order as without impurities, for distances below a certain characteristic length. This generalizes a celebrated result by Kesten for classical near-critical percolation (which can be viewed as critical percolation with single-site impurities). New challenges arise from the potentially large impurities. This generalization, which is also of independent interest, turns out to be crucial to study models of forest fires (or epidemics). In these models, all vertices are initially vacant, and then become occupied at rate 1. If an occupied vertex is hit by lightning, which occurs at a very small rate ζ, its entire occupied cluster burns immediately, so that all its vertices become vacant. Our results for percolation with impurities are instrumental in analyzing the behavior of these forest fire models near and beyond the critical time (i.e. the time after which, in a forest without fires, an infinite cluster of trees emerges). In particular, we prove (so far, for the case when burnt trees do not recover) the existence of a sequence of “exceptional scales” (functions of ζ). For forests on boxes with such side lengths, the impact of fires does not vanish in the limit as ζ↘0. This surprising behavior, related to the non-monotonicity of these processes, was not predicted in the physics literature.

T1  - An integrated multi-controller management framework for highly reliable software defined networking
AN  - 2528638126
AB  - Software-defined networking (SDN) has become the technology of choice for designing the next-generation network infrastructure that is featured with high-volume traffics, rapidly increased scale, and dynamic nature. Furthermore, to deploy multiple controllers in the control plane of SDN is widely considered with the aim of improving the stability and reliability of the network. This paper presents an integrated framework for a comprehensive multi-controller management in SDN. The proposed framework is comprised of a network planning phase and a runtime maintenance phase. Novel algorithms are proposed in the network planning phase to estimate the required number of controllers in the network, to determine the nodes for placing the controllers, and to assign the switch to its managing controller. Moreover, these algorithms are designed by mitigating the problems of device isolation and controller overload such that the reliability and stability of the control plane can be enhanced. In addition, a mechanism based on the State Behavior Tree is proposed in the runtime maintenance phase of the framework. This mechanism dynamically manages the loading of the controller during the execution time so that the occurrence of the controller overload is minimized. The experimental results show that, compared to the prior arts, the proposed framework reduces the isolation probability by up to 89% and increases the device connectivity by up to 34%. The occurrence of the controller overload during runtime is also significantly decreased.

T1  - A Data Processing Pipeline For Cyber-Physical Risk Assessments Of Municipal Supply Chains
AN  - 2631963844
AB  - Conference Title: 2021 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)Conference Start Date:  2021,  Dec.  12 Conference End Date:  2021,  Dec.  15 Conference Location: Phoenix, AZ, USASmart city technologies promise reduced congestion by optimizing transportation movements. Increased connectivity, however, may increase the attack surface of a municipality's critical functions. Increased supply chain attacks (up nearly 80 % in 2019) and municipal ransomware attacks (up 60 % in 2019) motivate the need for holistic approaches to risk assessment. Therefore, we present a methodology to quantify the degree to which supply-chain movements may be observed or disrupted via compromised smart-city devices. Our data-processing pipeline uses publicly available datasets to model intermodal commodity flows within and surrounding a municipality. Using a hierarchy tree to adaptively sample spatial networks within geographic regions of interest, we bridge the gap between grid- and network-based risk assessment frameworks. Results based on fieldwork for the Jack Voltaic exercises sponsored by the Army Cyber Institute demonstrate our approach on intermodal movements through Charleston, SC and San Diego, CA.

T1  - Neuroplasticity of the Corticospinal System: Applications of Neuromodulation-based Therapies
AN  - 2544487193
AB  - The motor cortex and corticospinal tract are necessary for producing skilled movements. I use intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), a high-frequency stimulation protocol known to promote neural plasticity, as a tool to characterize short- and long-term plasticity of the CS system.Although it is well known that activity-dependent motor cortex (MCX) plasticity produces long-term potentiation (LTP) of local cortical circuits, leading to enhanced motor evoked potentials (MEPs), the effects produced by the corticospinal (CS) projection on spinal cord neurons have not yet been thoroughly studied. In Chapter 2, I determined if the CS tract (CST) is capable of producing LTP in the spinal cord. I used multichannel recording of motor-evoked intraspinal excitatory local field potentials (LFPs) in adult rats after iTBS. I stimulated the wrist area of MCX and recorded at the 6th cervical spinal cord segment. A single 3-minute block of MCX iTBS potentiated the monosynaptic excitatory LFP recorded within the CST termination field in the dorsal horn and intermediate zone, for at least 15 minutes after stimulation. Ventrolaterally in the spinal cord gray matter, iTBS potentiated a late negative LFP that was localized to the wrist muscle motor pool. Response enhancement after a single block of iTBS in MCX thus produces LTP of the evoked monosynaptic and oligosynaptic CST responses. The time course of this LTP has the properties of early-LTP, the first phase of LTP which enables an increase in synaptic strength and is known to play an important role in memory function in the hippocampus, amygdala and other cortical brain structures in mammals. Pharmacological blockade of iTBS-induced LTP in MCX using MK801, an NMDA receptor antagonist, failed to prevent spinal LFP potentiation, showing that spinal plasticity can be induced in an activity-dependent manner without MCX LTP. Pyramidal tract iTBS, which preferentially activates the CST, also produced significant spinal LTP, indicating the capacity for plasticity at the CST-spinal neuron synapse. My findings show CST monosynaptic response plasticity in spinal interneurons and demonstrate that spinal premotor circuits are capable of modifying the way descending MCX signals are processed in an activity-dependent manner. These findings are important for understanding the key structures for motor learning and motor recovery after injury and suggest that spinal circuits, as the implementer of supraspinal muscle control signals, are capable of further modifying the actions of the MCX in an activity-dependent manner.I next determined if early-LTP can be converted, with repeated and chronic iTBS into the late phase of long-term potentiation (Late- or L-LTP), which allows enduring modification of the structure and function of neuronal connectivity (Chapter 3). I determined if there is day-to-day carryover of MEP augmentation produced by iTBS and elucidated the anatomical and molecular underpinnings of this robust corticospinal system plasticity.For these experiments, I recorded chronically from the extensor carpi radialis muscle in naïve rats and examined MCX-evoked motor responses (MEPs) as a measure of CS system plasticity. I promoted MEP plasticity by MCX iTBS for varying times daily and for one or more days. I found that one block (3 mins) of iTBS produced strong EMG potentiation lasting for up to 35 min; consistent with early-LTP which is independent of protein synthesis. Five contiguous blocks of iTBS during a single session (27 mins), prolonged EMG potentiation for 24-48 hours and resulted in upregulation of signaling of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulator of neuronal translational capacity. These changes are a signature of a stable and long-lasting LTP (late-LTP). In addition, iTBS-induced L-LTP was enhanced or blocked bidirectionally by modulating cortical activity chemogenetically using engineered G-protein coupled excitatory and inhibitory receptors (GPCR); Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), respectively. We next assayed CST structural changes that could support the enhanced motor responses. Chronic stimulation promotes a significant increase in CST axon length in the contralateral spinal cord intermediate zone. 3D reconstruction of CST synapses, defined by the co-expression of the pre- and post-synaptic markers VGlut1 and PSD-95 in labeled CST axons, revealed a significant increase in the total number and volume of PSD-95 clusters. Intrinsic presynaptic bouton characteristics did not change; however, the number of presynaptic sites increased in proportion to the increase in CST axon length.Taken together, my findings show early-LTP of the CST EPSP in the dorsal horn and intermediate zone of the spinal cord that leads to early-LTP of the CST oligosynaptic response in the motor pools and wrist muscle. A prolonged potentiation of MEP, or late-LTP, occurs after repeated blocks of iTBS. The transition from early- to late-LTP is accompanied by upregulation of known L-LTP cortical plasticity markers. Remarkably, delivery of iTBS daily for 10 days leads to the emergence of persistent MEP augmentation. We show that iTBS can be used both to lay the groundwork for a brief to an enduring form of MEP enhancement and CST structural changes underlying the stronger and more effective of synaptic transmission of the CST.  The maintained increase in MEP magnitude we observe with L-LTP and CST synaptic structural changes may be viewed as the neurophysiological surrogate for LTP-dependent processes more generally, such as motor learning within the CS motor systems.

T1  - A Novel Collaborative IoD-Assisted VANET Approach for Coverage Area Maximization
AN  - 2519084110
AB  - Internet of Drones (IoD) is an efficient technique that can be integrated with vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) to provide terrestrial communications by acting as an aerial relay when terrestrial infrastructure is unreliable or unavailable. To fully exploit the drones’ flexibility and superiority, we propose a novel dynamic IoD collaborative communication approach for urban VANETs. Unlike most of the existing approaches, the IoD nodes are dynamically deployed based on current locations of ground vehicles to effectively mitigate inevitable isolated cars in conventional VANETs. For efficiently coordinating IoD, we model IoD to optimize coverage based on the location of vehicles. The goal is to obtain an efficient IoD deployment to maximize the number of covered vehicles, i.e., minimize the number of isolated vehicles in the target area. More importantly, the proposed approach provides sufficient interconnections between IoD nodes. To do so, an improved version of succinct population-based meta-heuristic, namely Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) inspired by food searching behavior of birds or fishes flock, is implemented for IoD assisted VANET (IoDAV). Moreover, the coverage, received signal quality, and IoD connectivity are achieved by IPSO’s objective function for optimal IoD deployment at the same time. We carry out an extensive experiment based on the received signal at floating vehicles to examine the proposed IoDAV performance. We compare the results with the baseline VANET with no IoD (NIoD) and Fixed IoD assisted (FIoD). The comparisons are based on the coverage percentage of the ground vehicles and the quality of the received signal. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IoDAV approach allows finding the optimal IoD positions throughout the time based on the vehicle’s movements and achieves better coverage and better quality of the received signal by finding the most appropriate IoD position compared with NIoD and FIoD schemes.

AN  - 2458776545
AB  - According to The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, some 9,000 satellites, probes, landers, crewed spacecraft, cargo craft, and space station flight elements had been launched into Earth orbit or beyond since 1957, when Sputnik launched.

Perhaps a space-based solar power station?

A US-Australia joint venture called Solar Space Technologies (SST) has drawn up an extensive plan to build an orbiting solar-power-generated satellite network which could be operational in eight years.

With abundant cheap power it can be piped or channeled to wherever it's needed, or desalination plants could be built to pump desalinated and re-mineralized water from the coast to wherever it's needed without having to make compromises between environmental, agricultural and town water needs.

This paper presents our Model-Based Security Testing (MBST) approach, designed for cybersecurity evaluation of the OTA update system for automobiles, which has an integrated testbed and a software tool that is capable of automatically generating and executing test cases by using attack trees as an input. Integrating threat modelling in the testing provides several benefits, including clear and systematic identification of different threats. Automation of the test-case generation and execution has the obvious benefits of saving time and manual effort, as manual test-case generation is both a time-consuming and error-prone process (especially, when the testing involves several test-cases). A simple simulated attack is used to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of our testing approach. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior research that uses a testing approach similar to our approach for automotive OTA security evaluation.

T1  - Guest Editorial: Robust Resource-Constrained Systems for Machine Learning
AN  - 2393783843
AB  - Machine learning (ML) is nowadays embedded in several computing devices, consumer electronics, and cyber-physical systems. Smart sensors are deployed everywhere, in applications such as wearables and perceptual computing devices, and intelligent algorithms power our connected world. These devices collect and aggregate volumes of data, and in doing so, they augment our society in multiple ways; from healthcare, to social networks, to consumer electronics, and many more. To process these immense volumes of data, ML is emerging as the de facto analysis tool that powers several aspects of our Big Data society. Applications spanning from infrastructure (smart cities, intelligent transportation systems, smart grids, and to name a few), to social networks and content delivery, to e-commerce and smart factories, and emerging concepts such as self-driving cars and autonomous robots, are powered by ML technologies. These emerging systems require real-time inference and decision support; such scenarios, therefore, may use customized hardware accelerators, are typically bound by limited resources, and are restricted to limited connectivity and bandwidth. Thus, near-sensor computation and near-sensor intelligence have started emerging as necessities to continue supporting the paradigm shift of our connected world. The need for real-time intelligent data analytics (especially in the era of Big Data) for decision support near the data acquisition points emphasizes the need for revolutionizing the way we design, build, test, and verify processors, accelerators, and systems that facilitate ML (and deep learning, in particular) implemented in resource-constrained environments for use at the edge and the fog. As such, traditional von Neumann architectures are no longer sufficient and suitable, primarily because of limitations in both performance and energy efficiency caused especially by large amounts of data movement. Furthermore, due to the connected nature of such systems, security and reliability are also critically important. Robustness, therefore, in the form of reliability and operational capability in the presence of faults, whether malicious or accidental, is a critical need for such systems. Moreover, the operating nature of these systems relies on input data that is characterized by the four “V’s”: velocity (speed of data generation), variability (variable forms and types), veracity (unreliable and unpredictable), and volume (i.e., large amounts of data). Thus, the robustness of such systems needs to consider this issue as well. Furthermore, robustness in terms of security, and in terms of reliability to hardware and software faults, in particular, besides their importance when it comes to safety-critical applications, is also a positive factor in building trustworthiness toward these disrupting technologies from our society. To achieve this envisioned robustness, we need to refocus on problems such as design, verification, architecture, scheduling and allocation policies, optimization, and many more, for determining the most efficient, secure, and reliable way of implementing these novel applications within a robust, resource-constrained system, which may or may not be connected. This special issue, therefore, addresses a key aspect of fog and edge-based ML algorithms; robustness (as defined above) under resource-constraint scenarios. The special issue presents emerging works in how we design robust systems, both in terms of reliability as well as fault tolerance and security, while operating with a limited number of resources, and possibly in the presence of harsh environments that may eliminate connectivity and pollute the input data.

T1  - Cotton Agriculture and the Function of Gravel Mulch in the Northern Rio Grande
AN  - 2382100864
AB  - The site of Poshu’Owingeh was one of several ancestral Tewa villages to experience rapid growth in the 14th and 15th centuries A.D. in northern New Mexico. Recent research has proposed that this growth was one aspect of a trend characterized by nonlinear socioeconomic change produced by increasing population size and connectivity. Agriculture, commodity production, and exchange are fundamental to this model, but direct evidence for intensification is limited and no empirical data exists for the function and mechanics of the technologies which are supposed to have supported surplus production. This research addresses the problem by examining paleobotanical and soil evidence for the function of gravel mulch, a unique agricultural technology hypothesized to have supported cotton agriculture in portions of the Northern Rio Grande.
Physical soil properties and base cation ratios are used to reconstruct the irrigation effect of gravel mulch, and soil nutrient levels are measured to assess change in soil quality associated with cultivation. Fossil pollen assemblages recovered from agricultural soil layers are used to determine the mix of crops grown in gravel mulch fields. A spatial database of archaeological sites is used to reconstruct Puebloan population dynamics in the Tewa Basin. This is compared to published estimates of population growth, the timing of socioeconomic developments in the region, and climate reconstructions.
Fossil pollen concentrations indicate that cotton was the main crop grown at Poshu’Owingeh. The substantial increase in the ratio of cotton to maize and a decrease in the diversity of economic wild plant taxa at Poshu’Owingeh suggest cotton cultivation was more intensive here than other documented sites in the region. Soil analysis revealed no evidence for degradation associated with gravel mulch. Cation ratios and particle size distribution in the A horizon suggest that gravel mulch continues to enhance subsurface water flux. I estimate that the runoff required to produce the sodium leaching observed in mulched profiles is generated by relatively intense precipitation generated by monsoon storms. Peak rates for the spatial expansion of farming populations responsible for the construction of the gravel mulch-cotton fields follows rapid population growth in the great Tewa Basin, is coincident with the intensification of regional exchange networks, and strengthening of the North American Monsoon. Given the mechanics of agricultural technology documented in this study, and hypotheses for the importance of cotton in the regional economy; it is concluded that population dynamics, climate change, and human niche construction interacted played a significant role in social change and economic expansion in the late precontact Northern Rio Grande.

T1  - Reunited at Last: Genetic Recovery of Stream Fish Populations after Removal of Passage Barriers
AN  - 2328747629
AB  - One of the top threats to biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems is habitat fragmentation due to human activities. In streams, road crossings with poorly designed culverts can cause fragmentation and block fish passage, which limits genetic exchange between upstream and downstream individuals. The genetic effects of population isolation are well established, but the genetic response, or pattern of recovery, of fish populations following re-establishment of connectivity is poorly understood. This knowledge gap is addressed by measuring allelic diversity, genetic differentiation, and assignment probabilities in Mottled Sculpin (Cottus bairdii) sampled upstream and downstream of sites with varying time spans since culvert replacement. Sample collection occurred during the summer of 2018 from eight streams located throughout western Pennsylvania. This was the first time Mottled Sculpin microsatellites were used to assess the genetic effects of culvert barriers. Sites with restored passage barriers had little genetic differences among upstream and downstream populations. Results indicate immediate movement between upstream and downstream populations following barrier restoration.

T1  - Transparent Traces
AN  - 2311052387
AB  - I have come to believe that every personal story is a landscape story. We frequently forget that our lives are not only our own but a contribution to a web of stories that shape the history of the land. Personal stories of life that make us who we are and our landscapes what they are, often are lost if not documented or passed down to other generations. What stories does the landscape hide and which stories does the landscape reveal? The only way our histories can survive is if we share them. The memories and stories we stow away in our landscapes, come back to us in other circumstances: they reflect us, and we reflect them. 
So, what are the stories of life? And how are these stories a metaphor of a landscape? The possibility to trace the stories of a life through the land, the soil, the plants, and the water inspires this exploration. Historians, theorists, artists, and environmentalists have explored the phenomenon of connection between human and landscape. The bond of life and land exists through our strong family ties, like that of a woman who stays constant in our stories like the landscape. Women are the life, strength, and stability of our legacies. The aspect of deep genealogy is an exploration of oneself in the landscape. What do we find when we explore it? Our discovery of self in the landscape touches on the notion of what we call home and what we come to find as our identity. 
Being a participant observer of one’s own genealogy delves into the topic of topographies of memory, meaning, loss, and discovery. When we embed ourselves in the land, it creates a different kind of ecology; one that is closer, more intricate, crucial, and not always rational. Creating a family archive allows for the exploration of one’s life and the purpose behind it. You discover parts of yourself, when you uncover truths of your family; hidden memories waiting to be recovered through the telling of a story. We create new relationships through this journey, not only with people but with the landscape. A river is a place where these connections come together, with the combination of complex concepts of culture and history. As noted by Irine J. Klaver, there is a notion of the atmosphere of a river or “riversphere” as a concept that contains social, cultural, political and emotional dimensions of life by combining hydrology, biology, and ecology with lived experience.  Intertwining environment with the experience of life through storytelling is what enriches the atmosphere of rivers and reveals hidden histories. 
My exploration of these thoughts began when I was walking to my maternal Grandmother’s house in the Southern Serbian city of Nis, I passed a tributary river to the Nisava that was barely flowing, moving slowly with green muck and miscellaneous trash. The sight of this river prompted me to take a picture before going on my way. I began to think about this river and how its contents are connected to a larger system. I pondered the deeper meaning behind its connectivity: how do collective histories, known and unknown, forgotten, and erased, all contribute to the circumstances that we have today? The composition of invisible traces and transparent ones are revealed through the existence of a river. The color of the water, the shape of its bends, the intensity of its flow is inclusive with the course of a life. Visible form of land is harmonious with the occurrences of our daily lives. The riversphere holds our secrets, revealing some and keeping others buried deep in its sediments; rivers hold the truth about us. This fascinates me because it enters a realm of undocumented stories of history. The idea of tracing history along a river prompted me to begin my personal journey of loss and discovery through deep genealogical archival research along the waterways of Serbia.

T1  - The Archaeology of Small-Scale Slavery in Antebellum Missouri
AN  - 2244317907
AB  - In this thesis, I examine small-scale slavery and resistance by the enslaved to their condition using the conceptual framework of resistant accommodation, as applied to the circumstances on my family’s farm in Missouri. My family were slaveholders who came from Kentucky and settled in Hardin Township, Clinton County, Missouri, circa 1833. Family oral history included information on the location of the first house, but little else.
The term resistant accommodation, developed based on small-scale farming operations in colonial New England, implies that the enslaved outwardly conformed to the demands of their enslavers while covertly circumventing those demands to further their own interests. In this conceptual framework, resistance is not an end in itself. It further suggests that individual acts of resistance coalesced into a community of resistance through the networking, shared experiences, and mutual trust that developed among the enslaved when they were able to exploit gaps in the surveillance of their enslavers. Gaps in surveillance arose in part from enslavers’ competing attempts to maintain surveillance while also using their work force efficiently and emphasizing separateness through the control of shared space. The nature of the landscape was also a factor.
I hypothesize that conditions in colonial New England were broad enough to apply to slaveholder surveillance and resistance by the enslaved on small-scale farms across the antebellum Upper South and in Border States such a Missouri. I then present a case study using data from my family farm, settled by my great-great-great grandfather James Elliott, to test whether those data support an interpretation that conditions for the people my family enslaved were consistent with the expectations of resistance accommodation.
The Euroamerican settlers of the Upper South were largely small-scale yeoman farmers with smaller acreages and few or no slaves, interspersed physically with a smaller number of large-scale planters with large acreages and many slaves. Conditions and opportunities for the enslaved differed between small-scale and large-scale operations in terms of labor management, housing, and degree of surveillance. To understand the opportunities available to the people my family enslaved, it was important to determine the scale of their farming and slaveholding operation, and the nature of the surrounding landscape, for which I used both archaeological and historical methods.
The archaeological investigations included remote sensing and exploratory excavation at the site family oral history indicated was the location of the first house, followed by artifact analysis. The results suggest that a two-room hewn log house on a limestone foundation, typical of the antebellum period, existed on the site. The artifacts support an antebellum origin for the house, and the presence of male and female occupants, but provide no unique markers of African American occupancy. A comparison of the type, number, and quality of artifacts with those from a well-documented large-scale slaveholding operation suggest that the Elliott family had a small-scale operation.
Historical records confirmed that James Elliott was a small-scale farmer and slaveholder who raised a typical suite of crops and livestock that was sufficient to support his family and labor force while providing surplus production for the commercial market. Culturally, James and his family and slaves lived in an agrarian society. Only about 29 percent of Hardin Township’s heads of household were slaveholders, but the society was highly stratified based on land and slave ownership, with greater wealth accruing to six large-scale slaveholders.  
In a small-scale farming operation, the Elliotts’ enslaved (and those of other small-scale holders) could expect reduced surveillance while working, running approved errands, and attending church. These moments likely afforded the enslaved some time to further their own interests and socialize with their peers. The housing practices of small-scale holders were variable; James was among the 41 percent of them who did not provide separate slave quarters, making unauthorized nighttime excursions more difficult. 
I used a viewshed analysis to examine the characteristics of physical landscape; this analysis revealed that extensive areas around the Elliott farm were out of sight of the Elliott log house and the houses of neighboring slaveholders, and that the riparian corridors of small creeks connected these areas in ways that would allow slaves to gather clandestinely while avoiding detection. There is, therefore, compelling circumstantial evidence that opportunities were available to the enslaved to reduce or avoid surveillance. In addition, a report by the Hardin Township Slave Patrol from December 1859 shows that African Americans were in fact availing themselves of these opportunities, meeting in groups of two to six without authorization. These group actions show that a community of resistance existed among the township’s enslaved, a community built upon individual acts of resistance. It is likely that similar conditions prevailed throughout the Upper South.

T1  - Fin whale movements in the Gulf of California, Mexico, from satellite telemetry
AN  - 2166107650
AB  - Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) have a global distribution, but the population inhabiting the Gulf of California (GoC) is thought to be geographically and genetically isolated. However, their distribution and movements are poorly known. The goal of this study was to describe fin whale movements for the first time from 11 Argos satellite tags deployed in the southwest GoC in March 2001. A Bayesian Switching State-Space Model was applied to obtain improved locations and to characterize movement behavior as either “area-restricted searching” (indicative of patch residence, ARS) or “transiting” (indicative of moving between patches). Model performance was assessed with convergence diagnostics and by examining the distribution of the deviance and the behavioral parameters from Markov Chain Monte Carlo models. ARS was the predominant mode behavior 83% of the time during both the cool (December-May) and warm seasons (June-November), with slower travel speeds (mean = 0.84 km/h) than during transiting mode (mean = 3.38 km/h). We suggest ARS mode indicates either foraging activities (year around) or reproductive activities during the winter (cool season). We tagged during the cool season, when the whales were located in the Loreto-La Paz Corridor in the southwestern GoC, close to the shoreline. As the season progressed, individuals moved northward to the Midriff Islands and the upper gulf for the warm season, much farther from shore. One tag lasted long enough to document a whale’s return to Loreto the following cool season. One whale that was originally of undetermined sex, was tagged in the Bay of La Paz and was photographed 10 years later with a calf in the nearby San Jose Channel, suggesting seasonal site fidelity. The tagged whales moved along the western GoC to the upper gulf seasonally and did not transit to the eastern GoC south of the Midriff Islands. No tagged whales left the GoC, providing supporting evidence that these fin whales are a resident population.

T1  - A Mobility Solution for Hazardous Areas Based on 6LoWPAN
AN  - 2150307853
AB  - In a critical environment, e.g. in a factory where an employee faces hazardous conditions, monitoring the health status of the employee is important. Thus, continuous connectivity of the employee to the network is the main concern of such networks. In this paper, we have proposed a decentralized approach for mobility management of mobile nodes in hazardous areas like factory. The proposed mobility structure for hazardous areas, called MSHA, organizes static nodes as a tree for an efficient routing, automatic addressing, and handling movement of mobile nodes. MSHA is capable of handling multiple failures of static nodes which disconnect a mobile node from the network. MSHA is highly scalable regarding the number of mobile nodes and the size of the covered monitoring area. The proposed scheme is evaluated based on different factors. The results reveal the superiority of MSHA compared with the previous works. The promising analytical results manifest the performance (about 20%) of MSHA specifically in reducing packet loss and hand-off delay caused by the failure of the static nodes. The performance does not degrade with increasing the number of mobile nodes.

T1  - Eating Along the Silk Roads
AN  - 2043655278
AB  - The natural abundance of C4 vegetation is substantially higher in the desert zones of Central Asia, where livestock, as part of urban or nomadic subsistence, could have accessed enriched ô13C biomass and provided human consumers with protein-dense foods (meat and milk) with high ô13C values.At these sites, cultural materials associated with eighth- to thirteenth-century radiocarbon chronologies include cotton fabrics and variable mixtures of ceramics, ranging between standardized wheel-spun food storage vessels from distant oases communities and locally produced handmade coarse wares, which are rare in urban contexts.[...]at the community level, a second scale of dietary variability that is representative of multi-resource pastoralism is observed at late Otrar and Zhetysu, which display wide ranges of ô13C values.[...]many of the pan-regional turnovers in religion, language, and political authority that resulted in changes in architecture, technologies, and other commodity classes in the medieval period are historically described as nomadic innovations, and essential routes that connected Silk Road sites in the highland regions of Central Asia were likely shaped by nomadic mobility.

T1  - Researchon the Landscape Pattern of Tidal Flat Reclamation Area in Jiangsu Coastal Zone Based on GF-1 Satellite Imagery
AN  - 2115833013
AB  - Conference Title: 2018 7th International Conference on Agro-geoinformatics (Agro-geoinformatics)
Conference Start Date: 2018, Aug. 6
Conference End Date: 2018, Aug. 9
Conference Location: Hangzhou, China
The tidal flat in the transitional belt between land and ocean is deeply disturbed by human reclamation activity. The reclamation and development of tidal flat is the specific land use pattern of coastal zone. Jiangsu province possesses abundant tideland resources and a large-scale tidal flat reclamation has taken place in Jiangsu during the past several decades. Analysis of the landscape pattern of reclamation is one of the important components to realize the sustainable development in the coastal zone. This paper takes Yancheng City of Jiangsu as a case to analysis the landscape pattern of reclamation area by using GF-1 satellite imagery. The panchromatic and multispectral data were resampled for geometric correction and fused to obtain the multispectral data of 2m resolution. Object-based classification method was taken to classify different landscape categories in study area. Wheat paddies, rape paddies, forest and grass, rive and lake, aquaculture ponds, facility aquaculture, facility planting, industrial land and traffic land were extracted separately from the GF-1 imagery through multi-resolution segmentation, training samples selection, classification features establishment. Landscape indices of area, shape and distribution characteristics were calculated by using Fragstats software for analyses. The results show that within the study area, high resolution GF-1 satellite imagery could identify landscape types in tidal flat reclamation area and offer reliable information for the landscape pattern analysis. The cultivated land (including wheat paddies, rape paddies) and aquaculture area (including facility aquaculture and aquaculture ponds) are the main landscape types in the study area and the shape of most of the landscape type is very regular, which reflected the characteristics of intensification. As the corridors of the study area, traffic land, river and lake played a better connecting function and the overall connectivity of the landscape is relatively high. The distribution of landscape types is uneven, but the overall concentration trend is obvious.

T1  - 6 Reasons Why Designing UX for IoT is So Difficult
AN  - 1925377437
AB  - Diversity of interfaces and data points Typically, an IoT solution needs to handle multiple data types from multiple devices on a user interface (UI) that flows seamlessly across interfaces.

The inverter and weather station would commonly involve "dongle" hardware with a processor and wireless communications chip to pull and send data through a gateway to the cloud.

Once these multiple data types from multiple devices are together, the end user needs to access a simple yet informative visualization on any interface they want, like a phone, laptop, or on-site screen.

[...]IoT systems are always changing with new data points coming online or devices in the field being changed out.

Typical Hardware Selection Criteria Enough MIPS/RAM/ROM Running a real-time operating system (RTOS), or time-based scheduler, would be sufficient for most applications, but it will limit the ability to expand.

In some situations, low latency and minimal data loss are very important (autonomous vehicles or volcanic activity monitoring), while in others they are less so (solar generation or tide level monitoring).

If you work at a nuclear plant or are monitoring a volcano that's located just above a town, you might be a little paranoid about how much you trust that little green light.

Because IoT marries the real and digital worlds, data being right and wrong can have a significant impact on people, which is why trust must be built into the user experience of IoT solutions.

T1  - The Great Indian logistic industry: A Look at current scenario and future outlook
AN  - 1875672175
AB  - Challenges faced by the recent logistic industry in India The most essential challenge faced by the industry today is insufficient integration of transport networks, information technology and warehousing & distribution facilities. The disorganized nature of the logistics sector in India, its perception as a manpower-heavy industry and lack of adequate training institutions has led to a shortfall in skilled management and client service personnel. Solutions to some of the challenges Infrastructure is the backbone of every country's growth and prosperity and for the logistics industry to flourish special emphasis has to be on building world-class road networks, integrated rail corridors, modern cargo facilities at airports and creation of logistics parks which need to be given a status equivalent to Special Economic Zones. With the implementation of GST, the logistics companies, which are currently forced to set up many small warehouses across multiple cities can set up just a few, big warehouses region wise and can follow the hub-and-spoke model for freight movement from the warehouses to the different manufacturing plants, wholesale outlets, retail outlets and the various POS. The industry has moved from being just a service provider to the position which provides end to end supply chain solutions to...

T1  - Day-to-Day Population Movement and the Management of Dengue Epidemics
AN  - 1830017211
AB  - Dengue is a growing public health problem in tropical and subtropical cities. It is transmitted by mosquitoes, and the main strategy for epidemic prevention and control is insecticide fumigation. Effective management is, however, proving elusive. People's day-to-day movement about the city is believed to be an important factor in the epidemiological dynamics. We use a simple model to examine the fundamental roles of broad demographic and spatial structures in epidemic initiation, growth and control. We show that the key factors are local dilution, characterised by the vector-host ratio, and spatial connectivity, characterised by the extent of habitually variable movement patterns. Epidemic risk in the population is driven by the demographic groups that frequent the areas with the highest vector-host ratio, even if they only spend some of their time there. Synchronisation of epidemic trajectories in different demographic groups is governed by the vector-host ratios to which they are exposed and the strength of connectivity. Strategies for epidemic prevention and management may be made more effective if they take into account the fluctuating landscape of transmission intensity associated with spatial heterogeneity in the vector-host ratio and people's day-to-day movement patterns.

T1  - The Roadshow and Its Landscapes: From the Determinant to the Offering of Possibilities
AN  - 1799786875
AB  - Six eyes, focused by light beams, peer out of the hurtling steel machine, searching for yellow points of light peering back. One pair of searching eyes buoyed by a steady stream of Red Bull, the other two propped up by a potent mixture of fear and anxiety. Last night the machine decimated one such pair of reflecting eyes., .what was the source of that sound off the bumper? They are travelling at 120 km/h, a steady line of trees frames either side of the corridor of darkness cut through by their headlights. Time seems frozen but their advancement is evidenced by the towns that are swept by through their relentless movement forward: Pays Plat, Rossport, Selim, Schreiber, Terrace Bay, Ripple, Coldwell,... blurring together in a lightscape of High Intensity Discharge yellow. It's 3:14 AM, and the dawning of a new day will bring a fourth lecture in five days in a new city, and the promise of four more lectures: Ottawa, Toronto, Montreal, Halifax.

              
Part agitprop meant to engage the general public and the different institutions of design across Canada and part heroic statement meant to underline that architecture and architects are very much a part of everyday life, The Roadshow sought to map the currents of contemporary architectural debate. In opposition to past attempts to define Canadian architecture as a stable and legible entity, which is inevitably fraught with misconceptions given architecture's ever-evolving frames of reference beyond our geographic, political and cultural borders, The Roadshow explored a more inclusive framing of architectural ideation and production. The deconstruction of the creative work of eight architects and the examination of their differences and commonalities offered the potential for a structuring of interwoven design sensibilities. In this way, the physical journey across Canada paralleled an intellectual journey of discovery, framing the shift from the determinant aspects of any one architecture, of concrete, glass, steel and wood, to the interconnected preoccupations that frame the landscape of contemporary architectural production in Canada.

              
The participating architects of The Roadshow, [Roger Mullin] (Halifax), [Neil Minuk] (DIN Projects, Winnipeg), Randy Cohen (Atelier Big City, Montreal), David Battersby (Battersby Howat, Vancouver), Manon Asselin (Atelier TAG, Montreal), Lisa Rapoport (PLANT Architect, Toronto), Annie Lebel (Atelier Insitu, Montreal) and Philip Beesley (Philip Beesley Architect, Toronto), presented a single project that was paradigmatic of their design process, and in this way revealed key considerations around the ideation, development and manifestation of architectural intentions. Taken as a whole, these intentions spoke of the interconnection of the following themes and sensibilities of contemporary architecture:

T1  - Robust algorithms for estimating vehicle movement from motion sensors within smartphones
AN  - 1853936579
AB  - Building sustainable traffic control solutions for urban streets (e.g., eco-friendly signal control) and highways requires effective and reliable sensing capabilities for monitoring traffic flow conditions so that both the temporal and spatial extents of congestion are observed. This would enable optimal control strategies to be implemented for maximizing efficiency and for minimizing the environmental impacts of traffic. Various types of traffic detection systems, such as inductive loops, radar, and cameras have been used for these purposes. However, these systems are limited, both in scope and in time. Using GPS as an alternative method is not always viable because of problems such as urban canyons, battery depletion, and precision errors.    In this research, a novel approach has been taken, in which smartphone low energy sensors (such as the accelerometer) are exploited. The ubiquitous use of smartphones in everyday life, coupled with the fact that they can collect, store, compute, and transmit data, makes them a feasible and inexpensive alternative to the mainstream methods. Machine learning techniques have been used to develop models that are able to classify vehicle movement and to detect the stop and start points during a trip. Classifiers such as logistic regression, discriminant analysis, classification trees, support vector machines, neural networks, and Hidden Markov models have been tested. Hidden Markov models substantially outperformed all the other methods. The feature quality plays a key role in the success of a model. It was found that, the features which exploited the variance of the data were the most effective.    In order to assist in quantifying the performance of the machine learning models, a performance metric called Change Point Detection Performance Metric (CPDPM) was developed. CPDPM proved to be very useful in model evaluation in which the goal was to find the change points in time series data with high accuracy and precision. The integration of accelerometer data, even in the motion direction, yielded an estimated speed with a steady slope, because of factors such as phone sensor bias, vibration, gravity, and other white noise. A calibration method was developed that makes use of the predicted stop and start points and the slope of integrated accelerometer data, which achieves great accuracy in estimating speed.    The developed models can serve as the basis for many applications. One such field is fuel consumption and CO2 emission estimation, in which speed is the main input. Transportation mode detection can be improved by integrating speed information. By integrating Vehicle (Phone) to Infrastructure systems (V2I), the model outputs, such as the stop and start instances, average speed along a corridor, and queue length at an intersection, can provide useful information for traffic engineers, planners, and decision makers.

T1  - Anthropogenic disturbance and habitat loss for the red-listed Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus): Using ecological niche modeling and nighttime light satellite imagery
AN  - 1762110529; PQ0002171796
AB  - Habitat loss is a critical factor driving extinction of biodiversity worldwide, with models of future land use anticipating increases in rates of destruction of native habitats worldwide. The Asian black bear (Ursus thibetanus) is a red-listed species with a broad geographic range that has been fragmented dramatically by land use change. Remaining populations of U. thibetanus occupy diverse habitats, ranging from highlands to coastal regions. We integrated ecological niche models (ENMs) with nighttime satellite imagery to identify areas suitable for U. thibetanus after anthropogenic alteration. We found that at least 10% of the potential distributional area for the species is not suitable owing to urban or suburban encroachment. U. thibetanus seems to persist in highland areas, characterized by low temperature and high precipitation, whereas humans concentrate in lowlands and less-extreme climatic conditions. ENMs based solely on climate frequently overestimate suitable areas available for species; nighttime light imagery offers a robust alternative to refining estimates of species' ranges, designing protected areas and corridors, prioritizing threatened species, and determining areas of human-wildlife conflict across broad areas. Our approach is transferable to other taxa and contexts, and should be considered in conservation planning and policy implementation.

T1  - Co-benefits of designing communities for active living: An exploration of literature
AN  - 1664225743; 2015-10168-001
AB  - To reverse the global epidemic of physical inactivity that is responsible for more than 5 million deaths per year, many groups recommend creating “activity-friendly environments.” Such environments may have other benefits, beyond facilitating physical activity, but these potential co-benefits have not been well described. The purpose of the present paper is to explore a wide range of literature and conduct an initial summary of evidence on co-benefits of activity-friendly environments. An extensive but non-systematic review of scientific and “gray” literature was conducted. Five physical activity settings were defined: parks/open space/trails, urban design, transportation, schools, and workplaces/buildings. Several evidence-based activity-friendly features were identified for each setting. Six potential outcomes/co-benefits were searched: physical health, mental health, social benefits, safety/injury prevention, environmental sustainability, and economics. A total of 418 higher-quality findings were summarized. The overall summary indicated 22 of 30 setting by outcome combinations showed “strong” evidence of co-benefits. Each setting had strong evidence of at least three co-benefits, with only one occurrence of a net negative effect. All settings showed the potential to contribute to environmental sustainability and economic benefits. Specific environmental features with the strongest evidence of multiple co-benefits were park proximity, mixed land use, trees/greenery, accessibility and street connectivity, building design, and workplace physical activity policies/programs. The exploration revealed substantial evidence that designing community environments that make physical activity attractive and convenient is likely to produce additional important benefits. The extent of the evidence justifies systematic reviews and additional research to fill gaps. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Corredores Verdes Como Estratégia de Valorização da Paisagem e Recreio Público: Caso Prático do Ramal Ferroviário de Aljustrel
AN  - 2599012981
AB  - The greenway movement has been evolving since the 19th century, with the creation of axes in cities, along with boulevards, and Olmsted’s parkway concept. The industrial revolution caused an increase of awareness in ecology, along with a set of park and ecologic network projects that aimed towards conservation and sustainability. At present, these corridors are mainly known as the term greenway, with various authors highlighting their connecting, recreation, leisure, environmental and patrimonial conservation and protection functions. They also fall into different categories, such as river corridors, recreation corridors, ecologic corridors, historic/scenic/cultural corridors and greenway network. Integrated inside recreation corridors’ typology are trails that used old rail-ways, canals, waterlines and ridgelines, so, linear routes that obtain new functions. Railways have been highly intervened upon, in the last decades, with very well-known projects such as the Promenade Plantée, in Paris, and the High Line, in New York. Portugal has been reusing old railroads, following REFER’s (current IP, S.A.) “Ecotrail” Strategic Plan (“Plano Estratégico de Ecopistas”), in order to project trails, for the inhabitants, in non-motorized paths that preserve the environment and quality of life. With 11 of these trails inaugurated and 5 to intervene, Aljustrel’s railway is one of the later, inserted in a municipality rich in mining history and ecologic value. A proposal for a greenway in Aljustrel, inserted in recreation corridor’s typology, has all the potential to also be considered an ecological and historic/scenic/cultural corridor. Therefore, the intervention of this path aims at sustainable corridor that offers a recreational, ecological and patrimonial space to the locals and visitors, through a plan that includes three different yet combined routes.Alternate abstract:O movimento de corredores verdes tem vindo a evoluir desde o século XIX, com a criação de eixos nas cidades e boulevards, e o conceito de parkways de Olmsted. A revolução industrial suscitou um novo interesse e preocupação com a ecologia, trazendo consigo a proposta de parques e redes ecológicas com objetivos de conservação e sustentabilidade.Atualmente, os corredores verdes são maioritariamente conhecidos por greenways e vários autores focam as suas funções de ligação, recreio, lazer, conservação e proteção ambiental e patrimonial.Estes corredores são ainda diferenciados conforme as suas funções, existindo assim, corredores fluviais, recreativos, ecológicos, histórico/cénicos/culturais e redes de corredores verdes.Inserida na função de corredores recreativos estão percursos beneficiados por caminhos-de-ferro abandonados, canais, linhas de água e festo, ou seja, percursos lineares que podem receber novas funções. Os corredores ferroviários têm sido muito intervencionados nas últimas décadas, com projetos bastante conhecidos como a Promenade Plantée, em Paris, e a High Line, em Nova Iorque.Portugal tem vindo a intervir nas diversas linhas férreas em desuso, através do Plano Estratégico de Ecopistas, da REFER (atualmente IP, S.A.), que visa a projeção de percursos em vias não motorizadas, de apoio à população, que valorizem o meio ambiente e qualidade de vida.Com 11 ecopistas já inauguradas, e 5 por intervir, o ramal ferroviário de Aljustrel insere-se no segundo grupo, estando situado num concelho rico em património mineiro e ecológico. A proposta de um Corredor Verde em Aljustrel, a par do seu potencial como corredor ecológico e corredor histórico/cénico/cultural, constitui um importante corredor de recreio para o público. A intervenção deste percurso visa, assim, a criação de um Corredor que ofereça à população local e visitante um espaço sustentável que seja recreativo, ecológico e patrimonial, através da proposta de três percursos distintos interligados entre si.

T1  - Spatial community structure and epidemics
AN  - 1937360606
AB  - Networks are a useful quantitative representation for complex systems of interacting entities arising in fields such as biological, physical and social sciences. A network representation provides a degree of simplification while capturing key connectivity patterns. This thesis focuses on two main themes: the study of community structure, an important mesoscopic feature of many networks, and its application to study spatiotemporal spread of infectious diseases. Community detection seeks to partition a network into dense sets of nodes that are connected sparsely to other dense sets. The notion of denseness is often relative to some "null model" that describes baseline connectivity that can be construed to occur randomly. In the first part of the thesis, we discuss the incorporation of spatial information into null models for community detection. We develop a spatial null model based on the radiation model of mobility. We test different spatial null models using static and temporal (multilayer) spatial benchmarks with planted partitions that represent interactions between human populations. Our results indicate that it is important to incorporate spatial information into null models for community detection, but it is best to incorporate only relevant information into null models, as extraneous information can lower performance. In the second part of the thesis, we present the results of community detection with different null models on disease-correlation networks generated form real and synthetic time series of disease occurrence. We use data sets for endemic diseases (established in a region, with occasional epidemic outbreaks) and emerging diseases (newly-discovered or introduced into a region for the first time). We study the spatial and temporal organization of partitions. Finally, we apply community detection with different null models to synthetic time series generated from an agent-based model (ABM) simulating the spread of endemic and emerging diseases between spatially-embedded cities with a planted, transport-based community structure. We compare the findings on real and synthetic data sets, and we searched for model parameter regimes in which we are able to detect planted partitions or other interesting communities. For emerging diseases, we find spatial communities that are associated with the first times the infection reached a node in both ABM and disease data. For endemic diseases, we are unable to find planted or spatial communities in the ABM data, but we detect spatial communities for two of the three disease data sets. For these diseases, we also detect temporal communities corresponding to some of the important time points in disease history. We hope that these results show that community structure of disease correlation networks appears to be more complicated than simple spatial patterns and is a fascinating topic to study.

T1  - <b><i>Mapping the Global Black South:</i></b> Aesthetics, Labor, and Diaspora
AN  - 1720263968
AB  - Recent scholarship on black transnationalism and diaspora in the early twentieth century has largely focused on migration to the urban centers of the US North and Western Europe. “Mapping the Global Black South: Aesthetics, Labor, and Diaspora” revises this discourse by exploring the movement of people, cultural practices, and ideas between the US South and the Caribbean as an alternative network of African diasporic affiliation. According to Caribbean theorist Édouard Glissant, “the Plantation system” created a “rhythm of economic production” and a “style of life” that links the US South to the Caribbean and parts of Latin America. Building on Glissant’s geographic frame, this dissertation establishes the plantation—a fundamentally modern form of labor organization—as the figural and literal organizing principle of “the global black south”: a matrix of diasporic articulation, subject formation, and knowledge and cultural production. Through close readings of works by Booker T. Washington, Claude McKay, Zora Neale Hurston, and Jean Price-Mars, this study examines how African American and Caribbean writers and intellectuals mobilized aesthetics—literature, music, photographs, and performance—to imagine alternative futures within and against the legacy of the plantation.      By drawing on theories of the plantation in Caribbean and New Southern Studies, “Mapping the Global Black South” makes critical interventions in the field of African American Studies, where the plantation is almost exclusively regarded as a metonym for slavery and anti-modernity. In Caribbean Studies, by contrast, scholars have proposed a more nuanced rendering of the plantation as the genesis of black modern life and culture, and in New Southern Studies, it has been reconceived as the link that tethers the US South to the global south (based on similar patterns of underdevelopment). Through an interdisciplinary and multimedia methodology,  then, this study interrogates the paradox of the plantation as at once local and global, fecund and barren, static and fungible—as a site of agricultural production that animates the flow of global capital, on the one hand, and a modern technology of power that exploits the land and the bodies forced to work it, on the other. In so doing, it establishes the plantation as a matrix of global black south cultures that revises traditional understandings of black modernity and creates new systems of connectivity and legibility for contemporary scholarship.     Moreover, in reconsidering the plantation as a crucible of black modernity, “Mapping the Global Black South” reconstructs the historical significance of the Tuskegee Institute—a former plantation turned industrial school—as a nodal point of black diasporic affiliation and a model for resolving one of the fundamental predicaments of New World blackness: the problem of free labor. Given that slavery was a system of coerced and exploitative labor, the greatest challenge of emancipation throughout the global black south was transforming a mass of formerly enslaved persons into autonomous workers. Thus, by the turn of the twentieth century, black artists and intellectuals from across the region began to embrace (and adapt) Booker T. Washington’s vision of an agrarian and industrial future (by way of Tuskegee) as a strategy for racial uplift and self-determination. Whereas Washington’s reformism is commonly reduced to a foil for W.E.B. Du Bois’ radicalism, this dissertation resituates Washington within a hemispheric framework to reconsider how his theories contribute to a more capacious epistemology of the “plantation” in African American Studies.      “Mapping the Global Black South” is thus organized around two interrelated concerns: the plantation as an alternative framework of black transnationalism and a site of cultural production that evinces the persistence of black life within structures of social death; and Tuskegee’s significance as a symbol of modernity and a nodal point of diasporic articulation at the turn of the twentieth century. In so doing, it illuminates how the plantation shaped the new futures that emerged in the US South and the Caribbean in the aftermath of slavery.

T1  - Phylogeography of Southeast Asian flying foxes (Chiroptera: Pteropodidae: <i>Pteropus</i>)
AN  - 1705830614
AB  - Flying foxes (Pteropus) are a genus of Old World fruit bats that are important seed dispersers and pollinators for plants native to the 200,000+ islands in Southeast Asia, yet they are some of the most poorly known bats in the world. They comprise some of the largest known bat species, and are morphologically relatively conserved on the genus level.  Pteropus is the most species-rich genus within Pteropodidae, though the origin for this diversity remains incompletely understood. In Chapter 1, I discuss the importance of Pteropus to the ecosystem and as reservoir hosts. In Chapter 2, a molecular phylogeny is presented with  Pteropus species organized into fewer species groups than recognized from previous research that better reflected the comprehensive dataset. An increase in relative divergence rate was detected within Pteropus  during the Pliocene that led to rapid radiations in three species groups. Additionally, discordant signals from nuclear and mitochondrial genes suggested incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization were present, likely as a result of the young clade age, low genetic variability, and rapid diversification of the genus. In Chapter 3, using the species tree generated in Chapter 2, I tested biogeographic mechanisms and scenarios that resulted in current distributions of Pteropus species using several ancestral area reconstruction methods. Dispersal and founder-event speciation were both important mechanisms through which species expanded into new areas. Wallacea was an integral part of the evolutionary history of Pteropus, and likely the region of origin, a new result uncovered largely a product of the increased taxonomic and geographic sampling. I then used a combination of phylogenetics and population genetics to determine the population connectivity of two commonly studied  Pteropus hosts that are of interest to the disease ecology community,  P. vampyrus (Chapter 4) and P. alecto (Chapter 5). Host metapopulation dynamics are important for predictions of pathogen diversity, aggressiveness, and transmission. Pteropus vampyrus and  P. alecto highlight differences in management strategies needed and pathogen model predictions. Chapter 6 presents a general discussion regarding these findings and future directions for research.

T1  - Conditional inference tree-based analysis of hazardous traffic conditions for rear-end and sideswipe collisions with implications for control strategies on freeways
AN  - 1808120752; PQ0002959241
AB  - Identifying hazardous traffic conditions related to traffic collisions is important to the development of real-time traffic control measures for preventing collision occurrences. The primary objective of this study is to explore the hazardous traffic situations on freeways for rear-end and sideswipe collisions to assist the development of control strategies for mitigating collision risks using the conditional inference tree method. Based on the 3-year crash data and traffic data from a freeway corridor on the Interstate 880 in California, the conditional inference tree was developed and validated for each collision type separately. Results showed that the hazardous traffic conditions were different between different types of collisions. The occurrence of rear-end collision was mainly related to the magnitude of lengthwise traffic variation between upstream and downstream locations. The occurrence of sideswipe collision was related to the type of freeway segment as well as the crosswise traffic variation between adjacent lanes. The control strategies for the mitigation of collision potentials were discussed according to the appearances of the conditional inference trees developed in this study.

Based on the 3-year crash data and traffic data from a freeway corridor on the Interstate 880 in California, the conditional inference tree was developed and validated for each collision type separately. Results showed that the hazardous traffic conditions were different between different types of collisions. The occurrence of rear-end collision was mainly related to the magnitude of lengthwise traffic variation between upstream and downstream locations. The occurrence of sideswipe collision was related to the type of freeway segment as well as the crosswise traffic variation between adjacent lanes. The control strategies for the mitigation of collision potentials were discussed according to the appearances of the conditional inference trees developed in this study.

T1  - Behavior, ecology, and conservation of <i>Scaphirhynchus </i> sturgeon
AN  - 1660540369
AB  - Large rivers are perhaps the most modified ecosystems worldwide.  Natural flow regimes, ecosystem connectivity, and habitat have been modified for human interests, and poor water quality has resulted from urban settlement and agricultural practices.  Subsequently, such changes have had deleterious effects on riverine biota and many endemic species are of critical conservation concern.  Due to the inter-jurisdictional nature and economic importance of large rivers, conservation efforts must be realistic and recognize human interests.  To reach that point, however, we must understand behavioral and ecological patterns and processes at multiple scales, to ensure conservation strategies are successful.       Fishes have been particularly affected by modifications to large rivers.  Further, freshwater roe fisheries around the world have overfished several species to the brink of extinction; among the most notable are sturgeon populations.  Pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) and shovelnose sturgeon (S. platorynchus) are two species that occur in large rivers of the central United States.  Pallid sturgeon are primarily limited to the riverscapes of the Missouri and lower Mississippi Rivers, whereas shovelnose sturgeon are more widely distributed.  Pallid sturgeon are a federally endangered species in the United States and shovelnose sturgeon are federally threatened where they overlap in range with pallid sturgeon. Like other sturgeon species around the world, Scaphirhynchus sturgeon habitat has been modified and degraded by dams, extensive levee systems, and pollution.  To date, our understanding of habitat needs for Scaphirhynchus sturgeon—at multiple spatial scales—remains unknown.  Furthermore, basic behaviors, e.g. anti-predatory behavior or foraging behavior, have yet to be identified.       The goal of my dissertation was to fill knowledge gaps in Scaphirhynchus  sturgeon behavior, ecology, and conservation.  First, I identified a species-loss domino-effect, which may manifest from use of Similarity of Appearance Provisions in the U.S. Endangered Species Act.  The aim of the legislative action was to protect pallid sturgeon by closing the shovelnose sturgeon roe fishery where shovelnose overlap in range with pallid sturgeon (Chapter 1).  It was assumed that closing the shovelnose sturgeon roe fishery to prevent bycatch of pallid sturgeon would increase the number of reproductively viable females in the wild, thereby facilitating pallid sturgeon recovery.  However, I show that this response may have unintended consequences by diverting fishing effort to other economically viable species (e.g. paddlefish  Polyodon spathula) and increase poaching.  Further, I suggest that protecting the shovelnose sturgeon may increase the rate of hybridization and competitive interactions between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon.  I recommend such legislative action be followed by contingency plans for any unintended consequences and protections be ready for species which may experience diverted fishing effort.      Regarding sturgeon behavior, I used shovelnose sturgeon as a model species to test whether sturgeon exhibit predator avoidance behavior (Chapter 2), as predators, or interactions with predators, have strong regulatory effects on populations.  My experiment showed that shovelnose sturgeon do exhibit predator avoidance behavior when they encounter a catfish predator ( Ictalurus punctatus).  This was the first experiment to document such behavior in any sturgeon species and suggested that it was a learned, rather than an innate behavior.      The remaining chapters of my dissertation focus on the goals of elucidating the current status of Scaphirhynchus sturgeon and habitat selection at multiple spatial scales.  In Chapter 3, I estimated the population size of adult pallid sturgeon (N = 1,516) and shovelnose sturgeon (N = 82,336) in the free-flowing middle Mississippi River.  My estimates highlight the critical status of pallid sturgeon, and show that shovelnose sturgeon are faring comparatively well.  In the same study, I found both sturgeon species were most abundant at the downstream ends of alluvial islands.  I suggest restoration of alluvial islands, which were historically present in the Mississippi River, is a realistic goal to facilitate recovery of Scaphirhynchus  sturgeon.     Given pallid and shovelnose sturgeon were found in highest abundance around alluvial islands (Chapter 3), I wanted to understand the uniqueness of habitat surrounding alluvial islands (Chapter 4).  Hydroacoustic techniques were used to quantify the abiotic attributes, and variability in those attributes, around two alluvial island complexes.  At the same time, age-0 Scaphirhynchus  sturgeon were sampled to examine whether they used similar habitats as adults.  All sturgeon sampled were shovelnose sturgeon, but similar to Chapter 3, I found that the greatest abundance of age-0 sturgeon occurred at the downstream ends of the alluvial islands, particularly on the main channel side.  This area had intermediate variability in depth and velocity, and contained sand dunes.  I also found that vegetation was an important attribute of the islands, mostly when inundated by high spring flows.  I suggest that if island restoration is pursued, as in Chapter 3, abiotic attributes identified in Chapter 4 should be replicated.      Alluvial islands represent a coarse, albeit important, scale at which habitat is relevant to Scaphirhynchus sturgeon.  However, for several abiotic attributes and mesohabitats that affect habitat selection by sturgeon, it is difficult to elucidate their relevance at the individual scale due to high flows, turbidity, and depth of large riverscapes like those of the Mississippi River.  Therefore, carefully designed laboratory experiments are an alternative means of identifying pattern and process relevant to individuals.       Velocity is an important abiotic attribute that influences the distribution of individuals in lotic ecosystems (e.g., Chapter 4).  The goal of Chapter 5 was to evaluate how swimming behavior of Scaphirhynchus sturgeon was affected by velocity.  I designed an experiment to specifically test whether sturgeon swimming behavior evolved in a way that reduced the energetic cost of occupying river energy landscapes.  Further, a dynamic state variable model was developed to assess the optimal behavioral decision based on the expectation of food and energetic costs.  Both pallid and shovelnose sturgeon showed a tendency to occupy faster velocity, but their swimming behavior from the experiment was consistent with cost minimization.  The dynamic program revealed that the expectation of food and costs associated with the experimental energy landscape influenced the probability of a sturgeon moving upstream, downstream, or station holding.  It appears the suite of swimming behaviors exhibited by fluvial specialists like pallid and shovelnose sturgeon may have evolved to maximize net energy gain.     Lastly, I examined mesohabitat selection by age-0 Scaphirhynchus  sturgeon (Chapter 6).  Like velocity, substrates and other benthic structures can influence the distribution of individuals.  I tested selection of four common mesohabitat types nested within alluvial island complexes: 1) sand only substratum with no structure, 2) sand substratum with sand dune structure, 3) sand substratum with simulated vegetation, and 4) a gravel only substratum.  Sturgeon almost completely avoided gravel substrate and selected for the sand substratum, structure-less mesohabitat, followed by the mesohabitat with a sand dune.  Vegetated habitat retained less sturgeon than these two habitats but more than the gravel mesohabitat.  Scaled to the population level, the patterns revealed in Chapter 6 could have implications for the macro-distribution of both species.      In summary, I hope that the illustration of a species-loss domino-effect will be considered in the conservation of threatened and endangered species.  The issue of diverted effort, in particular, must be recognized when species are protected in a limited fashion to prevent or anticipate harvest cascading to other valuable and/or vulnerable species.  We must also consider acquiring basic knowledge of sturgeon behavior if we are to understand how best to conserve them.  Herein, the identification of predator avoidance behavior in shovelnose sturgeon suggests that predators in the wild may have regulatory effects on the distribution of young sturgeon.  I also identified how  Scaphirhynchus sturgeon—behaviorally—navigate large river velocity landscapes.  Such contributions regarding sturgeon behavior have largely gone undescribed—I hope the present work will provide a framework for future ethological study.  Lastly, my work has implications for the rehabilitation of large, sand-dominated rivers.  Specifically, my research suggests the restoration of alluvial islands in the free-flowing Mississippi River will contribute to the recovery of Scaphirhynchus sturgeon.  Restoration efforts should be mindful, though, of 1) the attributes that retain sturgeon, 2) habitat selection at multiple scales, and 3) selection differences among species at various scales.  These considerations will assist in facilitating the success of large-river conservation programs.

T1  - A comparative study: Utilizing data mining techniques to classify traffic congestion status
AN  - 1629025862
AB  - Performance measure is a process of evaluating and quantifying a system. Performance measure provides us with information about how good a system is working and how well the predefined goals are met. In order to analyze the performance of a transportation system, the traffic data such as speed, volume, occupancy and travel time of the system need to be collected. These data will generate valuable historical database that can be used to develop models to improve the quality of service of transportation system. The performance measures in transportation studies can be categorized to following main groups: Congestion, Mobility, Accessibility, Reliability, Safety and Environmental. Traffic congestion is one the important issues in any transportation system. Growing congestion in urban transportation network has enforced significant economic burdens to our current society. It causes waste of time, money, fuel and energy for the commuters and consequently impacting daily life of people in the society. Based on 2011 Congested Corridors Report presented by Texas A& M Transportation Institute, traffic congestion incurred $121 billion cost for drivers. Based on this report, 5.5 billion additional hours are wasted waiting in traffic in 2011. It means $818 additional fuel and time cost for each commuter. Being aware of the status of congestion in future can help, decision makers, intelligent systems and apps improve their accuracy and help commuters in their travel routing. To achieve these goals accurate traffic status classification techniques is required. Achieving higher accuracy is still one of the influential driving factor for research in this area. The objective of this thesis is to utilize data mining techniques to classify traffic status to congested or non-congested for some point of time in future based on historical traffic parameters (Vehicle Count, Occupancy, Speed). Moreover, to compare the performance of different data mining techniques on this problem. This dissertation examined several classification techniques including J48 Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector machine, PART and K-Nearest Neighborhood to classify future traffic status to Congested or Non-congested. The one minute traffic data from I-15 Northbound from I-215 up to Desert Inn, Las Vegas, NV were used to run these experiments. Based on the comparison of these algorithms, the J48 algorithm has the best performance.

T1  - Efficient message dissemination framework for diverse wireless networks
AN  - 1562239381
AB  - Wireless networks exhibit diversity, ranging from mostly disconnected delay tolerant networks and partially connected mobile ad hoc networks, to mostly connected cellular networks. Besides having useful applications, including, vehicular communications, emergency response networks, battlefield networks, and wildlife monitoring, wireless networks face numerous challenges, such as unreliable connectivity, bandwidth restrictions, interference, frequent disruptions and delays, power outages, message loss, and malicious attacks. Moreover, when nodes are mobile, communication may be disrupted frequently for longer time periods. Designing protocols to tolerate such disruptions is challenging because of the extreme uncertainty in mobile wireless environments. Most of the existing approaches either require exact knowledge about future connectivity schedules, or perform message flooding in an attempt to improve message delivery rate. However, message flooding results in an increased overhead and loss of messages in resource constrained environments. Moreover, it is almost impossible to acquire precise future contact schedules in real-life scenarios.   The goal of this dissertation is to architect robust protocols that overcome disruptions and enable applications in diverse wireless networks. We propose a suite of protocols for wireless environments where nodes transfer messages during opportunistic contacts. To conserve resources, the protocols control flooding by autonomously adapting to the changing network conditions, to find optimal temporal routes between source and destination nodes. Moreover, the dissertation presents novel approaches that utilize time-series forecasting on nodes' contact patterns. Such routing schemes learn from nodes' temporal contacts and mobility patterns, and forecasts the future contact opportunities among the nodes. By making precise predictions about future contacts, messages are forwarded to only those nodes that increase the message delivery likelihood. Simulation results proved that the proposed routing framework can be efficiently utilized in many real-life applications to disseminate delay tolerant data, such as electronic newspapers, weather forecasts, movie trailers, emergency information, and travel routes information in various parts of a city. The dissertation also proposes a novel application for mobile social networks that generates real-time recommendation of venues for a group of mobile users. The proposed framework utilizes Ant colony algorithm, social filtering, and hub and authority scores on the users' contextual information to produce optimal recommendations.

T1  - Optimal design of a sewer line using Linear Programming
AN  - 1315675238; 17625584
AB  - Wastewater collection systems greatly contribute to the cost of the overall municipal sewerage system; a cost-effective design of the collection system will provide significant savings towards the cost of wastewater services. It is impossible to evaluate the full impact that each pipe size and slope would have on the overall cost of the collection system with intuitive designs. However, these solutions generally satisfy the design objectives within the given constraints. A survey of the literature indicates that various optimisation techniques are being applied for least-cost solutions. In general these approaches provide continuous pipe sizes, which are converted to closest commercial sizes for adoption, which would heavily dilute the optimal outcome. Search methods are also adopted to obtain cost-effective design solutions using directly commercial pipe sizes, which are computationally expensive. In the design of a sewerage system, a sewer line is a basic unit occurring repeatedly in the design-process and finally the combinations of these basic units formulate the complete sewer system. However, the branch sewer lines, main sewers, trunk sewers, pumping stations, treatment plant and outfall sewers are in general the main components of an urban wastewater collection, treatment and disposal systems. A method has been developed to optimise this basic unit using Linear Programming technique without transforming nonlinear objective function or constraint equations into linear functions and incorporating commercially available pipe sizes directly in the problem formulation. The current research area of optimal sewer system design is focusing equally on economic considerations and hydraulic feasibility and moving away from conventional design guidelines based on only self cleaning velocity concepts for node to node sewer link hydraulic design. This paper is a step forward in developing optimal design approaches of sewer systems.

AB  - Wastewater collection systems greatly contribute to the cost of the overall municipal sewerage system; a cost-effective design of the collection system will provide significant savings towards the cost of wastewater services. It is impossible to evaluate the full impact that each pipe size and slope would have on the overall cost of the collection system with intuitive designs. However, these solutions generally satisfy the design objectives within the given constraints. A survey of the literature indicates that various optimisation techniques are being applied for least-cost solutions. In general these approaches provide continuous pipe sizes, which are converted to closest commercial sizes for adoption, which would heavily dilute the optimal outcome. Search methods are also adopted to obtain cost-effective design solutions using directly commercial pipe sizes, which are computationally expensive. In the design of a sewerage system, a sewer line is a basic unit occurring repeatedly in the design-process and finally the combinations of these basic units formulate the complete sewer system. However, the branch sewer lines, main sewers, trunk sewers, pumping stations, treatment plant and outfall sewers are in general the main components of an urban wastewater collection, treatment and disposal systems. A method has been developed to optimise this basic unit using Linear Programming technique without transforming nonlinear objective function or constraint equations into linear functions and incorporating commercially available pipe sizes directly in the problem formulation. The current research area of optimal sewer system design is focusing equally on economic considerations and hydraulic feasibility and moving away from conventional design guidelines based on only self cleaning velocity concepts for node to node sewer link hydraulic design. This paper is a step forward in developing optimal design approaches of sewer systems.

T1  - Ecophysiology of <i>Populus fremontii:</i> Effects of inundation, and interactions among nitrogen form, nutrient level, and water availability
AN  - 1417766854
AB  - As the climate changes and land continues to be developed for agricultural and urban use, ecosystems around the globe will experience shifts in hydrologic cycles, CO2 concentrations, water availability, and nutrient availability.  Semi-arid riparian forests in the North American West will be particularly affected by these changes since establishment of riparian vegetation depends on the river hydrograph, urban and agricultural runoff, water and air temperature, CO2 concentration, and soil nutrient availability.  Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii) is an early successional foundation species in these ecosystems that establishes along barren point bars and contributes many important ecosystem functions.  The three chapters of this dissertation investigate responses of P. fremontii  seedlings to 1) variation in inundation depth, duration, and temperature, 2) variation in atmospheric CO2 concentration and N form (NO3- and NH4+), and 3) variation in nutrient level, soil water availability, and N form.       Investigations of seedling tolerance of inundation showed that mortality increased linearly with days of complete shoot submergence (mortality % = 4.6 + (2.5 days)), resulting in greater than 60% mortality after four weeks of complete submergence.  Cooler water temperature (18/11°C day/night) during complete submergence positively affected seedling dry weight and survival resulting in 25% greater seedling survival than at warmer water temperatures (25/18°C day/night).  Results indicated that establishment of new  P. fremontii populations in the riparian corridor will be more successful when flows do not completely cover the shoots of seedlings for more than two weeks and if water temperatures during inundation are cool.       Investigations of seedling response to N form and CO2 level found that seedlings grown with NH4+ had 42% greater average dry weight than those grown with NO3-  regardless of CO2 level.  The lack of an interaction countered our hypotheses that inhibition of leaf NO3- reduction at elevated CO2 would lead to lower dry weights in NO3- fed plants at elevated CO2.  Instead we found that NO3 -  reduction occurred in roots and was not coupled to carbon metabolism in seedling leaves.  The observed differences in dry weight between NO 3- and NH4+ plants were likely due to the increased costs of NO3- reduction and maintenance of charge balance in P. fremontii seedling roots.  Regardless of form, there was no significant difference in average dry weights between plants grown at ambient and elevated CO2, and there was evidence of CO2 acclimation.     The final chapter quantified relative effects of water stress (stressed vs. well watered), nutrient level (low near field conditions, medium, and high non-limiting), and N form (NO3- vs. NH 4+) on growth.  Low nutrient level decreased average plant dry weight to a large extent.  Decreases caused by low nutrients were at least six-fold greater than any decrease in biomass resulting from water stress.  N form had little effect on plant dry weights.  Both water stress and N form interacted with nutrient level such that effects of either factor on growth and allocation were only observed at high and medium nutrient levels.  Thus, effects of water stress and N form are likely to affect plant growth and dry weight allocation only when high, non-limiting nutrients are present, whereas nutrient level consistently affects seedling growth and allocation and dampens effects of the other factors.    Together these chapters provide an assessment of the effects of inundation, nutrient level, CO2 level, N form, and intermittent, moderate water stress on the growth and survival of P. fremontii seedlings during their first season of growth.

T1  - The Application of LiDAR to Assessment of Rooftop Solar Photovoltaic Deployment Potential in a Municipal District Unit
AN  - 1323238344; 17762778
AB  - A methodology is provided for the application of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to automated solar photovoltaic (PV) deployment analysis on the regional scale. Challenges in urban information extraction and management for solar PV deployment assessment are determined and quantitative solutions are offered. This paper provides the following contributions: (i) a methodology that is consistent with recommendations from existing literature advocating the integration of cross-disciplinary competences in remote sensing (RS), GIS, computer vision and urban environmental studies; (ii) a robust methodology that can work with low-resolution, incomprehensive data and reconstruct vegetation and building separately, but concurrently; (iii) recommendations for future generation of software. A case study is presented as an example of the methodology. Experience from the case study such as the trade-off between time consumption and data quality are discussed to highlight a need for connectivity between demographic information, electrical engineering schemes and GIS and a typical factor of solar useful roofs extracted per method. Finally, conclusions are developed to provide a final methodology to extract the most useful information from the lowest resolution and least comprehensive data to provide solar electric assessments over large areas, which can be adapted anywhere in the world.

T1  - Observations of atmospheric reactive nitrogen species and nitrogen deposition in the Rocky Mountains
AN  - 1288863232
AB  - Many national parks are experiencing increased nitrogen deposition due to increased emissions of reactive nitrogen, especially in the western United States. Excess nitrogen deposition can adversely impact ecosystem function, in some cases leading to degradation of water quality and forest decline. One region of particular interest is the Rocky Mountains, where large increases in wet deposition of oxidized and reduced nitrogeN·have been observed in recent decades. Here we present results from several field campaigns in Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) and a field campaign in Grand Teton National Park (GTNP) focused on identifying important nitrogen deposition pathways and factors that are contributing to nitrogen deposition.    To understand nitrogen deposition in RMNP we focused on understanding the spatial variability of reactive nitrogen concentrations across the state of Colorado. We observed large gradients in the reactive nitrogen species that reflected the different source regions across the state. In eastern Colorado, home to large agricultural operations, we observed high concentrations of ammonia and ammonium. Concentrations decreased moving westward toward the Front Range urban corridor and the Rocky Mountains. Concentrations of nitric acid, an important oxidation product of nitrogen oxides emissions, were highest in the Front Range urban corridor. Concentrations of gaseous ammonia and nitric acid were much lower in RMNP than at the sites to the east. Particle concentrations of ammonium and nitrate were generally lower in RMNP as well; however, concentration gradients were sometimes not as strong as for the gas phase compounds.    Wet deposition of ammonium and nitrate were the two largest reactive nitrogen deposition pathways in RMNP, yielding inputs of 1.97 kg N·ha -1 or 56% of total nitrogen deposition. Dry deposition of ammonia and wet deposition of organic nitrogen were the next most important deposition pathways; together they accounted for 40% (1.37 kg N·ha-1) of annual total nitrogen deposition. These two pathways are of special interest because they have not historically been monitored as part of regional deposition budgets. The remaining deposition pathways (dry deposition of nitric acid, and PM2.5 ammonium, nitrate, and organic nitrogen) accounted for approximately 3% of total nitrogen deposition.    In GTNP there was a strong gradient in ammonia concentrations, with higher average concentrations to the west (0.6 µg/m3) and lower average concentrations to the east (0.3 µg/m3), consistent with the presence of large agricultural operations west of the park. Concentrations of nitric acid, nitrate, and ammonium did not exhibit any clear spatial trends. Ammonia concentrations were higher at GTNP than at RMNP while PM2.5 nitrate and ammonium concentrations were similar in the two regions. Average nitric acid concentrations were similar between the two parks as well, with the exception of one high elevation GTNP site where higher concentrations were observed. Wet deposition of ammonium and dry deposition of ammonia were the largest reactive nitrogen deposition pathways in GTNP followed by wet deposition of nitrate and wet deposition of organic nitrogen.    Previous ecological assessments have led to the establishment of a critical load for wet deposition of inorganic nitrogen to RMNP and GTNP. A critical load is the maximum level of nitrogen input that can be sustained by an ecosystem without irreversible damage like loss of biodiversity. Our observations reveal that the critical load is currently being exceeded in both RMNP and GTNP. It is important to recognize that substantial additional inputs of reactive nitrogen are occurring in both parks through dry deposition of ammonia and wet deposition of organic nitrogen. Neither pathway is currently considered in the U.S. critical load framework. In both RMNP and GTNP organic nitrogen was an important component of deposition.  (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

T1  - "Near-by Nature": A Logical Framework for Building Integrated Agriculture
AN  - 1095128040
AB  - Building Integrated Agriculture (BIA) aims to reduce the environmental footprint of food production and to improve the human condition. BIA places food producing plants into the everyday working/living environment. This study explored the intersection of the diverse BIA requirements (human, plant, and building) as established by the relevant literature from various disciplines. Kaplan (1992), and Ulrich (1984; 1986; 1992) established the restorative physiological and psychological effects of plants in non-natural settings. Kaplan deemed these settings “Near-by Nature.” In building interiors, “Near-by Nature” is achieved through interiorscaping, a design practice that incorporates plant, building and occupant requirements.   This study specifically investigated the implications of considering Building Integrated Agriculture as “Near-by Nature” while allowing for the diverse environmental requirements of the plants and building occupants. The environmental requirements considered were light, temperature and relative humidity. A synthesis of the requirements was applied to two theoretical redesigns of the Honors College dormitory at West Virginia University in Morgantown, WV.   This study used a design research approach and fell into the category of design phenomenology. A logical argumentation approach (Groat & Wang, 2002) was used to establish a framework of “Near-by Nature” in the context of interiorscapes. Analog simulation modeling was used to test the “Near-by Nature” structure in the context of BIA (Groat & Wang, 2002).   Analysis of interiorscape images was used to establish the structural framework of “Nearby-Nature”. Required crop yields were established using the U.S. Food Market Estimator developed by the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture. The existing baseline building and modified BIA version was modeled using Autodesk Revit 2011 software. Photorealistic images of the modified building with approximated crops provided the means to evaluate “Near-by Nature”.   There were two interiorscape categories: those that facilitate movement and those that provide a place for gathering. The “Near-by Nature” framework had three technical terms: pace, distinct and contrast. The framework was combined with the Honors Hall dormitory and crop production requirements. The existing dormitory was found unsuitable to provide “Near-by Nature and plant production. Concept ‘A’ was developed to facilitate movement. The result was an increased occupancy and Gross Square Footage. The vegetables crops created rhythm and established landmarks along the corridors. Concept ‘B’ was developed to provide a space for gathering. The result was a decreased occupancy but an increased Gross square footage. The vegetable crops generated rhythm, created a sense of enclosure and controlled vistas.    This study established a framework for designing “Near-by Nature”, developed parameters for further research and design investigations of BIA.

T1  - Riparian forest vegetation patterns and historic channel dynamics of the Big Sioux River, South Dakota
AN  - 1015007758
AB  - The Big Sioux River, a major tributary to the Missouri River, drains approximately 22,550 km2 in South Dakota, Iowa, and Minnesota.  Compared to many other Great Plains rivers, the Big Sioux is relatively natural and free-flowing, with a largely intact riparian corridor and little flow regulation.  Along its course, the river flows through a largely agriculturally dominated matrix that contains several major population centers.  The close proximity to these agricultural and urban land uses have contributed to a number of water quality problems during the last 50 years that have threatened the ecologically integrity of the Big Sioux.  In order to conserve and properly manage the Big Sioux corridor, it will be important to gain an improved scientific understanding of ecological patterns and their environmental correlatives along the river.  This thesis is an attempt to provide these data.      Using modern aerial imagery and ground-truthing techniques, I quantified the current extent of riparian forest communities along a 576 km stretch of the Big Sioux River.  In total, there were 7 dominant riparian forest community types along the river that contributed to 6.85% of the total Big Sioux basin land cover.  Riparian forest extent increased from north to south and was dominated by the Silver Maple-Elm-Cottonwood Forest community type (41% of total).  In addition, 35 riparian forest sites and 5 upland forest sites were sampled to examine the typical vegetative characteristics of forest within the basin.  In general, floristic quality and basal area decreased from south to north and % exotics increased.  These findings provided data on riparian forest habitats along the river and can be used to assess future forest restoration efforts.      Streamflow has increased dramatically over the last 30 years in the Big Sioux basin (122% increase in mean annual flow) resulting in a highly significant, 62% increase in channel planform area, a 4% decrease in channel length and sinuosity, and a 69% increase in channel width.  These channel adjustments were highly correlated with increasing mean annual flows and baseflow.  To examine why these increases have occurred, the relative effects of land use change and climatic variation were examined, with findings from these analyses lending support towards land use change, specifically agricultural intensification, being a more important driver of increased streamflow and channel adjustments than changes in the climatic regime.  These results are in line with findings from similar studies of agriculturally dominated basins throughout the Upper Midwest.      The final chapter examines potential pitfalls and uncertainties associated with using the Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) across state boundaries.  In total, results from 18 riparian and upland forest sites along the South Dakota/Iowa border were compared using Coefficients of Conservatism (C-values) from each state.  Findings indicated that for the 141 observed species, South Dakota mean C-values were higher (3.57) than Iowa (2.50) and that there were 98 C-value divergences between states with 20 being equal to ± 4.  FQA  values calculated using Iowa C-values were consistently lower than South Dakota and highlight the subjective nature of assigning  C-values at the individual state level. This thesis provides several recommendations that would improve the utility of the FQA and allow it to become more widely standardized as a valuable ecological assessment tool.      This thesis provides baseline data critical to targeting current and future management efforts along the Big Sioux and provides an improved scientific understanding of ecological patterns in habitats along this valuable watershed in eastern South Dakota and northwestern Iowa.

T1  - Air quality assessment in a highly industrialized area of Mexico: Concentrations and sources of volatile organic compounds
AN  - 1762123177; 15912312
AB  - Parallel to the economical benefits brought by the oil industry in Mexico, there have been some negative environmental effects due to emission of pollutants to the atmosphere. Salamanca, a city located inside one of the most important industrial corridors of the country, has been frequently affected by elevated concentrations of sulfur dioxide and particle matter. However, little is known about volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which in this study are analyzed along with criteria pollutants and meteorological parameters during February-March 2003 at urban, suburban and rural sites. Although sulfur dioxide average levels were [approx]0.017 ppm, a high concentration event ([approx]0.600 ppm), attributable to emissions from the oil refinery and the thermoelectric power plant, was observed at the urban site at night time. The VOCs concentration varied from 170 +/- 50 ppbC (rural) to 699 +/- 212 (urban) and were constituted by 40% alkanes, 13% aromatics, 11% olefins and 11% of halogenated. The most abundant species were propane (167 +/- 40 ppbC), n-butane (91 +/- 23 ppbC), toluene (51 +/- 10 ppbC) and i-pentane (44 +/- 7 ppbC), that are related to combustion processes. Freon-114, methyl bromide and 1,2-dichloroethane which are likely emitted by application of pesticides, soil fumigation and fabrication of chemicals, showed high concentrations (48 +/- 10, 50 +/- 10 and 32 +/- 6 ppbC respectively) in the rural sites, highlighting the importance of control measurements implementation for these species, as they represent a potential hazard for public health. Moreover, these halocarbons showed similar ratios regardless the monitoring site, suggesting same source. Modeling results indicated that meteorological conditions generally transport air masses to the northeast rural areas where the highest concentrations of ozone were calculated.

T1  - The Economically Important Nitrogen Pathways of Southwest Florida
AN  - 823697128
AB  - The global phenomenon of burgeoning coastal population growth has led to coastal watershed landscape transformation and ecosystem degradation, prompting policy-makers to set limits on freshwater withdrawals and labile nutrient loads. Important components of Florida's economies lie in the state's expansive coastal zone; the organisms driving the billion-dollar recreational fishing industry are rooted in coastal habitats, while the agriculture and real-estate industries sprawl throughout numerous coastal watersheds. This study aimed to identify the connections between anthropogenic land use and essential juvenile fish nursery habitats within the coastal zone, which is the first critical step for sustaining the ecology and related economies of the region.      The need for this study arises from the fact that these economies are interconnected through nitrogen, and therefore nitrogen management can influence their prosperity or collapse. Juvenile fish nursery habitats are located in waters that receive nitrogen from adjacent landscapes. Runoff delivers nitrogen derived from human nitrogen use and processing within the watersheds to the juvenile fish nursery habitats. Ecosystem managers must understand that although copious amounts of nitrogen applied to land may ultimately support nursery habitat foodwebs, overwhelming nitrogen loads may also create algal blooms that decay and cause lethal hypoxic events leading to ecosystem degradation. This study aims to pinpoint the specific nitrogen sources that support primary production and ultimately fish production in watersheds dominated by agricultural landscapes and residential neighborhoods.   Stable isotopes are versatile tools used to identify these connections. The nitrogen and carbon compounds that make up the moieties of an ecosystem inherently carry information on major nitrogen sources, trophic structure as well as the crucial information concerning dominant nitrogen removal and transformative processes that occur within sediments. Specifically in this study, the stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, primary producers, and fish were used to identify 1) the connections between urban and agricultural landscapes and the nutrients that percolate through the foodweb, 2) the primary producers that support fish biomass, 3) the origins of sedimentary organic matter that can provide new nitrogen via recycling, and 4) the heterogeneous function of fish nursery habitats in polluted systems. This study was conducted during the region's wet and dry seasons and in over thirty watersheds that differ from each other in terms of size and anthropogenic influence.     In agricultural watersheds, nitrogen derived from row crops and tree crops ultimately supported fish production during the wet season. Convective afternoon thunderstorms coupled with runoff delivered nitrogen from the landscape to receiving waters. These nutrients supported phytoplankton which deposited into the sediments and supported benthic foodwebs. During the dry season, nitrogen derived from row crops and nitrogen transformation in the sediments ultimately supported fish production. In this case, irrigation water used for agriculture delivered nitrogen from lands covered with row crops to the nursery habitats in receiving waters.      The dry season was characterized by the nitrogen transformation process known as dissimilatory nitrogen reduction to ammonium (DNRA), where biologically available nitrate is converted to biologically available ammonium. Phytoplankton deposits, most likely delivered during the wet season, were recycled through the slow burning DNRA processes, which provided nitrogen for the benthic microalgae that dominated in the dry season. These organisms in turn supported benthic communities which ultimately supported dry season fish production.      In small urban watersheds, nitrogen derived from septic tanks, lawn irrigation, leaky sewage pipes, and atmospheric deposition ultimately supported fish production via phytoplankton, but unlike the nitrogen sources in agricultural watersheds, these sources (with the exception of atmospheric deposition) were seasonally consistent because a mechanisms to deliver nitrogen derived from septic tanks, lawn fertilizer, and leaky sewage pipes were, at least to some extent, available during both seasons.     In polluted, tidal, fish-nursery habitats, the specific mechanism that allowed nursery habitats to decrease the ratio of mortality over growth rates of juvenile fish was not consistent among systems. These mechanisms were likely dependent on physical-chemical parameters and stream geomorphology. If the geomorphology or physical-chemical characteristics of nursery habitats are not adequate to set up an efficient nitrogen transfer process to fish, these habitats become more of a haven from predators rather than a source of food for fish.      This study has several implications for management. Managers must first recognize that microalgae are dominant supporters of tidal nursery foodwebs. Managers must define the relationship between nitrogen loads and fish abundance. If this relationship is unknown, the results of increasing nitrogen loads on fish production will remain uncertain; foodwebs in nursery habitats may collapse due to eutrophication, or fish abundance may increase due to increases in food supply. Connectivity factors derived from stable isotope mechanistic mass-balance models can be used as measurable targets for groups of watersheds. The use of wetlands as nitrogen remediation tools may not be effective at removing nitrogen; nitrogen transformation processes such as DNRA likely outweigh removal processes in wetland soils.

T1  - Land development in Massachusetts: Its effect on the environment within Essex and Middlesex counties from 1990 to 2007
AN  - 742597069
AB  - Since the 1970's urban centers in and surrounding Essex and Middlesex Counties in Massachusetts have expanded and proliferated into adjacent communities. This expansion has led to the conversion of land for housing, businesses, schools, recreation, and parks, placing significant strain on existing land cover, land use, and available natural resources. Mounting growth pressures and a reduction of undeveloped land have raised serious concerns as cropland and forest fragmentation, wetland destruction, protected open-space infringement, pollution, and systematic losses of rural conditions have become obvious. To monitor development, the post-classification change detection method was applied to Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite data and GIS was used to detect, quantity, and document the extent of development and its effect on the environment and to assess and quantify the demographic changes that occurred within the counties from 1990 to 2007.    Classification of the 1990 image resulted in 217 clusters and 214 clusters for the 2007 image The overall accuracy achieved for the 1990 image classification was 87.3% with a KHAT value of 0.848, and the overall accuracy for the 2007 classification was 86.27% with a KHAT value of 0.840. From 1990 to 2007 land cover change occurred primarily along major transportation corridors. The post-classification change detection results indicate that Essex and Middlesex County combined gained 23,435.66 "new" acres of land development from 1990 to 2007 through a loss and change in acreage from the Bareland, Forest, Grassland, Water, and Wetland land cover class categories. Results indicate that there was an approximate 0.56% overall (net) increase of newly developed land areas within the 1990 and 2007 image classifications from 415.46 acres or 0.64 square miles. In addition, there was a substantial decrease (-40.0%) within the grassland category. Land development was responsible for a portion of the decrease of grasslands (-13.63%), which occurred mostly within Middlesex County.    Results also indicate that "new" land development occurred within several Commonwealth of Massachusetts designated environmentally-sensitive areas: 722 acres in areas of critical environmental concern, 670 acres in priority habitats of rare species, 1,092 acres in living waters core habitats and critical supporting watersheds, 1,318 acres in protected and recreational open spaces, and within 0-1000 feet of 600 certified vernal pools. In addition, several rare or imperiled species inhabiting these areas may have been adversely affected by land development through habitat loss, change, or fragmentation, and/or passage corridor disruptions. A GIS comparison of the "new" land development acreages and census demographic statistics within Essex and Middlesex County cities and towns during this period indicate that communities with more families with children exhibited more land development, and communities with higher median household income exhibited less land development. Land change detection over the 17-year period indicated encroachment of development in areas of environmental concern, but level of development varied by socio-demographic factors.   This study also illustrated that the combined use of remotely sensed data, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology, and demographic data are effective for use as a diagnostic tool and/or base to be built upon to explore associations, indicators, or drivers which may influence land cover change and its effects on existing environmental conditions in areas exhibiting change. In addition, this study provided awareness to ancillary research where scientific guidelines were derived for the protection of specific wildlife habitats and resident species. Lastly, this study presented several land cover modeling and web deployed data dissemination tools for the dissertation results as well as provided a conceptual framework for the successful adoption and implementation of these tools for organizations engaged in natural resource planning and management.

T1  - Study on the relationship between the damage of callosciurus erythraeus and landscape pattern and human activities in artificial forest in hongya sichuan
AN  - 1873725627
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorCallosciurus erythraeus, also called red-bellied squirrel, belongs to Rodentia, Sciuridae and Callosciurus. During recent years, red-bellied squirrels(Callosciurus erythraeus) have made great damage to artificial forests in some regions of Sichuan by debarking trees, mainly including Crypotomeria fortunei and Cunninghami lanceolata. The debarking of Callosciurus erythraeus influences badly on trees' normal growth, and even causes trees dead. Hongya County of Sichuan has suffered from Callosciurus erythraeus damage for many years, which has become the premier forest diseases and pests of Hongya. In order to find out the relationship between Callosciurus erythraeus damage and the environment, and to explore the reason for squirrel damage, we have conducted 240 samples in Yupingshan Mountain and Caoyutan Village of Hongya from March to April in 2009. Based on the information of these samples, we studied the relationship between the damage and habitat factors in different aged forest respectively. Besides, by combing remote sense, GIS techniques and landscape pattern analysis software (Fragstates Version 3.3), we studied the characteristics of landscape patterns of the damaged regions in Hongya according to landscape metrics. We analyzed the fundamental information of Callosciurus erythraeus damage of the whole county which was provided by local forestry department, and the results showed that squirrel damage occurred in 12 towns of Hongya which governs 15 towns in total, and mostly distributed over Yuping Mountain District, Bamian Mountain District, Muchan Mountain District, Panjiaozui District. There are a significant positive correlation between each town's damaged forest area rate and it's population density(r=0.623, P<0.05) and a very significant negative correlation between each town's damaged forest area rate and it's percentage of forest cover(r=-0.762, P<0.01). The research on the landscape patterns of mainly damaged regions showed that: ⑴ the CLUMPY and COHESION of warm coniferous forest patch type in severely damaged areas and less severely damaged areas are not very different, which indicates that the damage degree of an area has no necessary connection with the clumpiness and connectivity of warm coniferous forest patch; ⑵ the fragmentation of severely damaged areas is a little higher compared to the less severely damaged areas and the area propotion of farmland and shrub patch types in severely damaged areas is larger than in less severely damaged areas. We supposed that when the warm coniferous forest patches are more fragmented and there is a larger propotion of farmland and shrub in a region, it will be more difficulty for the squirrels to transfer to another patch when they face the lack of food, so they are more inclined to debark trees repeatedly in the same patch, which results in more severe damage;⑶ for the whole landscape level, CONTAG (contagion index) of severely damaged areas is a little smaller than the less severely damaged areas, and SHDI(Shannon's Diversity Index) is a little larger compared to less severely damaged areas. It indicated that the distribution of different patch types in severely damaged areas was more mixed, and the heterogeneity of these areas are also a little higher. By studying the relationship between the squirrel damage in different aged coniferous forests and the habitat factors, we found that: ⑴ In mature forests and middle aged and young forests, three habitat factors(slope aspect, slope degree and whether Crypotomeria fortunei and Cunninghami lanceolata are mix-planted or not) is likely to have relations with the damage occurrence;⑵ In mature forests, the trees with high coverage is more easily damaged by Callosciurus erythraeus; in the middle aged and young forest, however, the coverage factor showed no significant difference between the damaged samples and undamaged samples. And It is the same case for another habitat factor distance from water;⑶ the two human disturbance factors(distance from residence and distance from road) have some influence on the squirrel damage of the middle aged and young forests, but the influence in the mature forests are not significant. We believed that the human activities' influence on the squirrel damage to coniferous trees will become much limited as the trees grow into

T1  - Study on riparian ecosystem degradation assessment of urban river in shanghai : a case study of suzhou creek
AN  - 1869982087
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorRiver degradation becoming the primary problem faced by the river ecosystem of countries all over the word. With the accelerating process of urbanization, riparian zone, especially urban riparian ecosystem suffers serious degradation because of human interference. Degradation assessment is not noly the important means of protect and repair the riparian zone ecosystem, but also is the effective proof of river regulation and sustainable management. Based on this background, try to study on riparian ecosystem degradation assessment of urban river is useful abstractly and practically for urban riparian zone for planning and management regulation. Literatures and references are complete studied, research progress and degradation mechanism of riparian zone at home and abroad are described. Based on which, connotation of urban riparian zone is showed. Practices on assessing riparian zone in Australia, United States, British, Sweden, South Africa and China are concluded from river health assessment, status assessment and ecological restoration and reconstruction after-assessment three aspects, and evaluation factor database is established. Based on horizontal structure of riparian zone, the paper try to characterization of riparian ecosystem degradation degree from waterfront zone, revetment zone, buffer zone and nearshore zone four aspects. With consideration of the characteristics of urban riparian zone in Shanghai, a degradation assessment system of riparian ecosystem of urban river is established with 4 first-grade indexes (including waterfront zone, revetment zone, buffer zone and nearshore zone) and 23 second-grade indexes after determining the assessment indicators, assessment principle, assessment standards and assessment model. Suzhou Creek in Shanghai is selected as the study case for practice, whose natural characteristics are under signiﬁcant destruction and degradation due to rapid urbanization. 43 reaches were selected as the assessment units on the main stream of Suzhou Creek, constructs indicators database using the method of remote sensing image interpretation and spot investigation, measures the Riparian Comprehensive Situation Index (RCSI). Then it identifies the level of degradation interprets and the RCSI response to reaches location, land use types and two banks on the basis of ANOVA analysis and Spearman correlation analysis, and put forward remediation planning and restoration strategies. Meanwhile, the paper preliminary discussed the scope of riparian zone of Suzhou Creek, and the environmental effects of riparian land-use change of urban river are studied on the basis of Pearson correlation analysis. The results show that: (i) The riparian comprehensive situation of Suzhou Creek is in the poor grade with RCSI distributing from 3.79 to 25.03, and no reach is in the minimal degradation, and 69.8% reaches belongs to serious and extreme degradation grade; (ii) River channelization and revetment hardening of Suzhou Creek result in more than 85% reaches of the waterfront and revetment zone status belonging to serious and extreme degradation grade, the width of waterfront zone and type of revetment are the key factors to the grade. Though 72.1% reaches of the buffer zone status belongs to slight and moderate degradation grade, irrational vegetation structure and single species problems are still remained. Rapid urbanization makes more than 50% reaches of the nearshore zone status belonging to serious and extreme degradation grade, and impervious area ratio and facilities richness degree are the crucial factors to the grade; (iii) The results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) reveal that human activity intensity and urbanization are the key forces to cause RCSI and most of other indexes having significant differences in reach location, land use types and two banks, while waterfront zone width, revetment slope, erosion degree, α diversity index and longitudinal connectivity have no significant differences; (iv) It has most significant correlation among RCSI, first-grade indexes and second-grade indexes. (v) The scope of riparian zone based on function of control point source pollution and provides biological corridor range of 5.19-30.00m. The scope of riparian zone based on function of the shipping dock or industrial land range of 0.00-7.00m, The scope of riparian zone based on function of open and public housing range of 6.00-30.00m; (vi) 100m buffer landscape corridor is better reflects the environmental effects of riparian land-use change of urban

T1  - Land use change in maasailand: drivers, dynamics and impacts on large herbivores and agro-pastoralism
AN  - 1124112082
AB  - The Maasailand of Kenya and Tanzania supports one of the richest wildlife populations remaining on Earth. However, over the last century, Maasailand has experienced land transformation notably through conversion of former rangelands to croplands. With the anticipated human population increase in East Africa, more impacts should be envisaged on these rangelands. This thesis investigates the root causes and underlying drivers of land-use change in the Maasai-Steppe ecosystems, stemming from historical, socio-cultural, political as well as the biophysical conditions. To analyse the different drivers of change, an integrated methodological approach was employed. This included a collation of historical data and information derived from both gray and published literature, analysis of remote sensing and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data, field surveys, workshops, observations, as well as personal communications. Observed land-use change from savannah rangelands to expansive croplands are mainly linked to government policies, land tenure, human population growth (which is also likely to be the largest future driver) and climatic conditions. Consequently these changes have impacted the agro-pastoralist community, whose main incomes for their livelihoods depend on pastoralism. Subsequent loss of formerly communal grazing lands to establish protected areas; large-scale farming and/or private ranches have aggravated the problems of sedentarization due to villagization and privatization policies of the formally mobile agro-pastoral communities. Land-use change also had negative impacts on migratory wildlife species, particularly those utilizing both protected areas and dispersal ranges in communal and/or private lands. The impacts ranged from loss of their migratory routes and corridors to massive declines of populations due to the loss of access to grazing resources. The study recommends government’s interventions for keeping the land open for access to grazing resources as well as opening up wildlife corridors, where it is deemed necessary for national interests.

T1  - Patterns and Elements Planning and Design for Linpan Rural Landscape in Longmen Mountain
TT  - 龙门山前山林盘乡村景观规划设计
AN  - 1026897643
AB  - Chinese agricultural civilization as well as the traditional rural landscape stranded a high position in the world history. Chengdu Longmen Mountain is located between the first steps (Tibet Plateau) with the second step (Sichuan Basin) of the Chinese geological steps. Because of the complexity of the natural resources, Longmen Mountain has the diversity of the rural landscape. Linpan sites in the Chengdu plain, the decentralized style shows the different with the normal Chinese centralized villages. This style is also chosen by the ancient Sichuan people, by the pattern of the local mountain and water system.
 After the 5.12 earth quake, the rural landscapes in Longmen Mountain have been greatly changed by the rebuilding and development projects. This research object tries to use the Linpan rural landscape style to change the future of some areas.
This paper chooses the Chengdu, Dayi, Sanba as the research area. We can find 6 typical rural landscape elements, by the ecological analyze of Point, Line, Area as well as the Patch, Corridor, Pattern in Sanba village. They are: Mountain, Water, Forest (Natural Oriented) and Farmland, Road, Village (Human Oriented). The Clips are also used as one research method to find the patterns in the Linpan for planning and design. The six rules are found in this research: Linpan centralization rules: Number, Area, Rate between trees and houses; Linpan decentralization rules: Water system, Distance, Classification. The way to plan and design the Sanba rural area uses both these centralization and decentralization rules to rebuild the new Sanba.
It can help the other researches to reorganize the village by local traditional landscape style and the method of downscaling, clips and elements and patterns.Alternate abstract:中国是农业文明古国，乡村景观之美自古流传。四川成都龙门山地区位于我国第一阶梯（青藏高原）与第二阶梯（四川盆地）的过渡区域，其显著的过渡特性为区域内诸多类型的乡村景观单元提供了丰富的天然载体。川西林盘分布于四川盆地西部的成都平原灌区，其随水而生的散居乡村与全国大部分聚居的乡村有着显著的区别，也是蜀地先民在长期的生产实践中利用成都平原的天然山水特征而寻找到的人与自然和谐共生的乡村形态。
在“5•12”地震之后，各种重建和发展工程正快速地改变着龙门山内部的乡村风貌。如何利用川西林盘这一成都地区传统的乡村景观模式更好的改造乡村是本论文的目的所在。
本论文将成都市大邑县出阝江镇三坝乡地区作为规划设计对象，聚焦于将传统乡村之美与现代生产生活之便紧密结合，发掘林盘乡村景观的要素格局特征，指导乡村改造。本文在乡村景观的要素选取中结合小流域单元的逐层划分，按面、线、点分类，围绕山水林（自然要素）、田路居（人工要素）的6项要素。配合切片的研究方法逐步分尺度，梳理出不同层次的研究对象和问题，探讨不同尺度中的问题和对策。在分析后初步得到6项格局导则：（1）水系导则，（2）距离导则，（3）数量导则，（4）比例导则，（5）分级导则，（6）面积导则，来指导三坝乡内新林盘的布局与规划设计。在规划设计中，将龙门山前山地区的过渡特性与平坝（平原）地区的林盘特征相结合，借鉴传统林盘乡村景观的要素格局，以有机集中和有机分散相结合的格局，重构大邑三坝乡的整体乡村景观。
本论文利用了景观学多尺度跨越的研究特性，完成了从1:10万~1:100的多重尺度推进，探讨了将传统乡村景观要素格局引入规划和设计当中，这种从要素和格局出发的思路对其他传统与现代结合的规划设计也具有一定的借鉴。

T1  - Using conditional inference forests to identify the factors affecting crash severity on arterial corridors
AN  - 622214880; 2009-15559-001
AB  - Introduction: The study aims at identifying traffic/highway design/driver-vehicle information significantly related with fatal/severe crashes on urban arterials for different crash types. Since the data used in this study are observational (i.e., collected outside the purview of a designed experiment), an information discovery approach is adopted for this study. Method: Random Forests, which are ensembles of individual trees grown by CART (Classification and Regression Tree) algorithm, are applied in numerous applications for this purpose. Specifically, conditional inference forests have been implemented. In each tree of the conditional inference forest, splits are based on how good the association is. Chi-square test statistics are used to measure the association. Apart from identifying the variables that improve classification accuracy, the methodology also clearly identifies the variables that are neutral to accuracy, and also those that decrease it. Results: The methodology is quite insightful in identifying the variables of interest in the database (e.g., alcohol/drug use and higher posted speed limits contribute to severe crashes). Failure to use safety equipment by all passengers and presence of driver/passenger in the vulnerable age group (more than 55 years or less than 3 years) increased the severity of injuries given a crash had occurred. A new variable, ‘element’ has been used in this study, which assigns crashes to segments, intersections, or access points based on the information from site location, traffic control, and presence of signals. Impact: The authors were able to identify roadway locations where severe crashes tend to occur. For example, segments and access points were found to be riskier for single vehicle crashes. Higher skid resistance and k-factor also contributed toward increased severity of injuries in crashes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Man Bites Mosquito: Understanding the Contribution of Human Movement to Vector-Borne Disease Dynamics
AN  - 1291080074
AB  - In metropolitan areas people travel frequently and extensively but often in highly structured commuting patterns. We investigate the role of this type of human movement in the epidemiology of vector-borne pathogens such as dengue. Analysis is based on a metapopulation model where mobile humans connect static mosquito subpopulations. We find that, due to frequency dependent biting, infection incidence in the human and mosquito populations is almost independent of the duration of contact. If the mosquito population is not uniformly distributed between patches the transmission potential of the pathogen at the metapopulation level, as summarized by the basic reproductive number, is determined by the size of the largest subpopulation and reduced by stronger connectivity. Global extinction of the pathogen is less likely when increased human movement enhances the rescue effect but, in contrast to classical theory, it is not minimized at an intermediate level of connectivity. We conclude that hubs and reservoirs of infection can be places people visit frequently but briefly and the relative importance of human and mosquito populations in maintaining the pathogen depends on the distribution of the mosquito population and the variability in human travel patterns. These results offer an insight in to the paradoxical observation of resurgent urban vector-borne disease despite increased investment in vector control and suggest that successful public health intervention may require a dual approach. Prospective studies can be used to identify areas with large mosquito populations that are also visited by a large fraction of the human population. Retrospective studies can be used to map recent movements of infected people, pinpointing the mosquito subpopulation from which they acquired the infection and others to which they may have transmitted it.

T1  - Animal movement in pelagic ecosystems: From communities to individuals
AN  - 304879939
AB  - Infusing models for animal movement with more behavioral realism has been a goal of movement ecologists for several years. As ecologists have begun to collect more and more data on animal distribution and abundance, a clear need has arisen for more sophisticated analysis. Such analysis could include more realistic movement behavior, more information on the organism-environment interaction, and more ways to separate observation error from process error. Because landscape ecologists and behavioral ecologists typically study these same themes at very different scales, it has been proposed that their union could be productive for all (Lima and Zollner, 1996).    By understanding how animals interact with their land- and seascapes, we can better understand how species partition up resources are large spatial scales. Accordingly I begin this dissertation with a large spatial scale analysis of distribution data for marine mammals from Nova Scotia through the Gulf of Mexico. I analyzed these data in three separate regions, and in the two data-rich regions, find compelling separation between the different communities. In the northernmost region, this separation is broadly along diet based partitions. This research provides a baseline for future study of marine mammal systems, and more importantly highlights several gaps in current data collections.    In the last 6 years several movement ecologists have begun to imbue sophisticated statistical analyses with increasing amounts of movement behavior. This has changed the way movement ecologists think about movement data and movement processes. In this dissertation I focus my research on continuing this trend. I reviewed the state of movement modeling and then proposed a new Bayesian movement model that builds on three questions of: behavior; organism-environment interaction; and process-based inference with noisy data.    Application of this model to two different datasets, migrating right whales in the NW Atlantic, and foraging monk seals in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands, provides for the first time estimates of how moving animals make choices about the suitability of patches within their perceptual range. By estimating parameters governing this suitability I provide right whale managers a clear depiction of the gaps in their protection in this vulnerable and understudied migratory corridor. For monk seals I provide a behaviorally based view into how animals in different colonies and age and sex groups move throughout their range. This information is crucial for managers who translocate individuals to new habitat as it provides them a quantitative glimpse of how members of certain groups perceive their landscape.    This model provides critical information about the behaviorally based movement choices animals make. Results can be used to understand the ecology of these patterns, and can be used to help inform conservation actions. Finally this modeling framework provides a way to unite fields of movement ecology and graph theory.

T1  - Systematics, population structure and demography of the African dwarf crocodile (<i>Osteolaemus</i> spp.): A perspective from multiple scales
AN  - 304866068
AB  - Wildlife harvest is the most geographically widespread form of resource extraction in equatorial forests. The illegal trade in wildlife is worth billions of dollars annually, with some estimates placing it second only to the global trafficking in illicit drugs. In competition with the commercial harvest, many rural inhabitants of tropical forests subsist on wildlife as a protein and economic resource. Lack of understanding of the biology of the system and the inability to implement management controls are cited as the two main impediments to sustainable-use practices in the tropics. To achieve long-term sustainability of wildlife resources, we seek an integrated understanding of the dynamics regulating resource populations and the dynamics of extractive activities influencing the fate of population trajectories. To pursue these goals, my research focuses on a poorly known reptile in tropical Africa that is widely consumed in rural diets but threatened by commercial hunting.    African dwarf crocodiles (Osteolaemus spp.) remain an important subsistence food resource throughout Central and West Africa, but are now threatened by overharvesting. The ability to address harvest issues and conservation priorities for crocodile populations is limited by a lack of knowledge of their biology, ecology and evolutionary history. My research approaches this problem from multiple perspectives. I first seek to resolve an 80-year-old debate on the taxonomy of the dwarf crocodile across its range, which has impeded our understanding of evolutionary significant units (ESUs) and the magnitude of the threats facing regional populations. Novel methods for monitoring the trade in crocodiles and other bushmeat species are needed to understand the magnitude of wildlife use in the tropics. I employed a molecular method to identify commonly hunted African wildlife species. I then attempt to gain inference on population genetic structure, connectivity and landscape factors influencing individual movements at the local and regional scales. At the population level, I used field surveys and capture-recapture methods to estimate demographic parameters and model population growth, incorporating empirical estimates of harvest rates and size-selection bias to evaluate their impact on long-term viability. I offer recommendations for new conservation management units, new techniques for monitoring the bushmeat trade and suggestions for spatial harvest management.

T1  - Determination of Sustainability of Aloe Harvesting Empowerment Project in the Emnambithi (Former Ladysmith) Municipality, Kwazulu Natal
AN  - 2564089953
AB  - Ladysmith is a town situated on the banks of the Klip River in the uThukela District of KwaZulu Natal, and falls into the Emnambithi-Ladysmith Local Municipality. The labour force of the Emnambithi-Ladysmith Local Municipality makes up 32.48 % of the population within the municipality, of which 16.49 % are employed, and 15.99 % are unemployed. A further 22.21 % of the total population in the municipality are not economically active, i.e. are students, homemakers, disabled, too ill to work, or are not seeking work. In an effort to address the poverty within KwaZulu Natal, the Department of Economic Development initiated a process which identified potential poverty-relieving initiatives and proposed to further investigate these development projects to establish which of the identified alternatives would be most feasible and beneficial to target communities. The areas where the poor communities are situated were identified based on the potential ability of the community to be able to support the required infrastructure investment and product development, which were in turn focussed on emerging economic growth points and development corridors (DEAT, 2001). One of the communities identified which could potentially benefit from one of the proposed development projects was that of the Emnambithi-Ladysmith Municipality, in KwaZulu Natal. Emnambithi-Ladysmith Local Municipality appointed a consultant to compile a Local Economic Regeneration Study for Ladysmith and the rural communities of the locality. The Study is aimed at analysing the local economy and thereby finding economic strategies that will make optimum use of local resources to create sustainable job opportunities and means of redressing economic challenges such as retrenchment and unemployment. A significant component of the Study is the identification of projects, which promote local ownership, local jobs and local reinvestment and illustrate the potential to revitalise the local economy of Emnambithi (Urban Econ, 2005). One of the alternative potentially sustainable poverty relief proposals put forward by the consultants, and other relevant parties, was that of harvesting the plant parts of the Aloes which appeared to be abundant within the Emnambithi-Ladysmith Municipality area. It was proposed that an Aloe pre-processing factory be established in a suitable location, which would provide employment opportunities for the local poor communities, who would either be directly employed by the pre-processing factory, or would be appropriately trained to harvest the required raw material from the natural Aloe populations. Similar operations have been initiatedin the Southern and Eastern Cape by formal sector businesses, which produce products made from Aloe ferox, which are then either sold locally or exported. The sustainability of the harvesting of these plants was determined based on the number of leaves which can be harvested per day by a tapper. It was possible to determine that the Aloe marlothii populations within the study area will not be able to support the harvesting of leaves, and as such, the harvesting thereof will not be sustainable. Several recommendations have been made which will further refine the results of this project. The main shortfall of this study was the limitation of the study area by political boundaries.

T1  - A vision-based autopilot for a miniature air vehicle: joint speed control and lateral obstacle avoidance
AN  - 2259062245
AB  - In our project on the autonomous guidance of Micro-Air Vehicles (MAVs) in confined indoor and outdoor environments, we have developed a vision based autopilot, with which a miniature hovercraft travels along a corridor by automatically controlling both its speed and its clearance from the walls. A hovercraft is an air vehicle endowed with natural roll and pitch stabilization characteristics, in which planar flight control systems can be developed conveniently. Our hovercraft is fully actuated by two rear and two lateral thrusters. It travels at a constant altitude (∼2 mm) and senses the environment by means of two lateral eyes that measure the right and left optic flows (OFs). The visuo-motor control system, which is called LORA III (Lateral Optic flow Regulation Autopilot, Mark III), is a dual OF regulator consisting of two intertwined feedback loops, each of which has its own OF set-point and controls the vehicle’s translation in one degree of freedom (surge or sway). Our computer-simulated experiments show that the hovercraft can navigate along a straight or tapered corridor at a relatively high speed (up to 1 m/s). It also reacts to any major step perturbations in the lateral OF (provided by a moving wall) and to any disturbances caused by a tapered corridor. The minimalistic visual system (comprised of only 4 pixels) suffices for the hovercraft to be able to control both its clearance from the walls and its forward speed jointly, without ever measuring speed and distance. The non-emissive visual sensors and the simple control system developed here are suitable for use on MAVs with a permissible avionic payload of only a few grams. This study also accounts quantitatively for previous ethological findings on honeybees flying freely in a straight or tapered corridor.

T1  - The utility of digital aerial surveys in censusing <i>Dipteryx panamensis</i>, the key food and nesting tree of the endangered great green macaw (<i>Ara ambigua</i>) in Costa Rica
AN  - 304635345
AB  - Remote sensing technologies offer an innovative way to study tropical forests and complement research from forest inventory plots. From a logistic standpoint, remote sensing mitigates some of the physical, political, and economic challenges that complicate terrestrial studies of tropical forests. From a biological standpoint, remotely sensed data can elucidate ecological phenomena and dynamics of tropical forests that may be challenging to observe on the ground. I conducted a digital aerial survey during the peak blooming period for Dipteryx panamensis. D. panamensis is a canopy-emergent, keystone tree species within the lowland Atlantic forests of Costa Rica. The aerial survey occurred over Maquenque National Wildlife Refuge, which is situated in the proposed San Juan-La Selva Biological Corridor. Maquenque was decreed in 2005 to protect the last breeding habitat for the endangered Great Green Macaw (Ara ambigua) in Costa Rica. The Great Green Macaw depends on D. panamensis as its primary food and nesting resource. However, because of Costa Rica's complex deforestation history, the Great Green Macaw remains imperiled due to habitat fragmentation, degradation, and loss. Only 25 to 35 breeding pairs and 250 individuals likely persist in the country. My research had three main objectives. First, I evaluated a classification technique that capitalized on the unique spectral signature of blooming D. panamensis in order to detect this species using a pattern recognition approach. Second, I determined the landscape density and distribution of this tree species using results from the aerial survey and classification. I also noted environmental factors predicting potential  D. panamensis habitat using a classification and regression tree (CART) model, and I subsequently calculated how much potential habitat exists in Costa Rica. Third, I identified environmental conditions that indicate potential breeding habitat for the Great Green Macaw using a CART model, and I calculated how much potential breeding habitat exists in Costa Rica. Results of the classification work indicate that D. panamensis can be identified based on its unique spectral signature. In particular, the IHS (intensity, hue, saturation) color space was effective at resolving this tree. Results of the density analysis suggest that canopy-emergent D. panamensis  trees occur at densities as high as 2 trees/hectare. This work demonstrates that D. panamensis exists in denser patches than previously determined from forest inventory plots. Environmental conditions that will support high densities of D. panamensis habitat occur between 45 and 125 meters in elevation and on soil with an acid and clay profile. Nearly 240,000 hectares could support high density patches of D. panamensis  in Costa Rica. Potential Great Green Macaw breeding habitat is defined by the density of D. panamensis trees within its 550-hectare breeding territory. Approximately 67,000 hectares of Great Green Macaw breeding territory exist in Costa Rica. Ultimately, the conservation of both  D. panamensis and the Great Green Macaw in Costa Rica may require a multinational partnership between Costa Rica and Nicaragua.

T1  - Preservation of the environment and open space through free market housing incentives (Illinois)
AN  - 59863206; 200912246
AB  - My analysis and evaluation of the conservation community policy model has shown it to be an effective and economically viable urban policy remedy for negative externalities inherent in urban sprawl development. Using surveys, interviews and election data in a case study analysis of Prairie Crossing, a private conservation community in Lake County, Illinois, I establish that the policy model, as defined in this case study, is a for-profit hydridization of the non-profit land trust model. Incorporating aspects of the New Urbanism movement, Prairie Crossing succeeded in the positive creation of place and community. Resident voting participation in local elections significantly exceeded county norms, and non-voting political participation significantly surpassed the national rates recorded in the ANES data. Community developers substantively created and restored valuable habitats, including the locally extirpated and regionally threatened tall-grass prairie ecosystem. Biotic corridors link the development's wetlands to the local watershed and provide for the exchange of genetic material between populations, mitigating the problem of island biogeography. Conservation homeowner association practices, including exotic invasive and pest species removal, wetland and prairie burning, place-based ecology, organic farming, renewable energy generation, the planting of native organisms, and the reintroduction of endangered fish, have mitigated regional environmental degradation, and have fostered altruistic eco-friendly behaviors within the housing community's residents. Residents self-reported increasing their conservation behavior one-half a point on a four-point conservation rubric. Residents failed to alter transportation-oriented behaviors firmly anchored in American culture, supporting prior research conclusions. Increased environmental awareness at the national and, particularly, the local level substantively contributed to the defeat of a long-time incumbent in the U.S. House of Representatives. Survey data suggests that self-selection of homebuyers did not undermine the policy model. Further resident association practices include education, both internally and externally, and financial and organizational support for outside organizations. The development was successful in competing in the free market with conventional sprawling development. The conservation community policy model offers policy makers an economically competitive alternative to conventional urban sprawl.

T1  - Understanding Anthropogenic Impacts on Air Quality at Rural Locations Using High Time Resolution Particle Composition Measurements
AN  - 29417063; 200702-26-026056 (CE); A06-46-007417 (AH); 200701476 (EQ)
AB  - Many of our nation's National Parks, wilderness areas and other visually protected environments are located in regions where urban, agricultural, and other anthropogenic emissions periodically exert strong impacts on local air quality. In this presentation we will use high time resolution (15 min) measurements of particle composition to examine the frequency and magnitude of these impacts and to elucidate changes in aerosol chemistry occurring during transitions between periods of strong anthropogenic impact and periods when atmospheric composition is more strongly influenced by natural emissions and/or regional air quality. Highlights will be drawn from a series of field campaigns at locations around the U.S., including Yosemite National Park (downwind of the Central Valley of California), San Gorgonio Wilderness Area (downwind of the Los Angeles basin), Bondville, Illinois (a rural Midwestern site), Great Smoky Mountains National Park (a rural, mountain location in the polluted southeast U.S.), Brigantine National Wildlife Refuge, New Jersey (a coastal site on the U.S. eastern seaboard), and Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado (located in the mountains west of the Colorado Front Range urban corridor). Particle composition measurements were made using a Particle Into Liquid Sampler (PILS) coupled to two on-line ion chromatographs. We will demonstrate how air quality at these locations is strongly influenced by local and regional transport phenomena and illustrate the influence of anthropogenic emissions on both fine and coarse particle concentrations and speciation.

T1  - Physical Monitoring of Flow Into and Within Great Salt Lake, Utah
AN  - 29415661; 200702-26-031168 (CE); A06-46-012529 (AH); 200706588 (EQ)
AB  - Great Salt Lake (GSL) is the hydrologic terminus for the eastern part of the Great Basin. As the largest inland waterbody in the Western United States, GSL plays a critical ecologic role for many migratory bird species. In terms of harvest quantity and quality, the brine shrimp (Artemia) fishery of GSL is among the strongest in the world. The characteristic of GSL as a hydrologic sink amplifies anthropogenic activities throughout the basin, most specifically activities that occur along its eastern and southern shores, the urban corridor of the Wasatch Front. In 1959 GSL was divided into north and south parts by a rock-fill railroad causeway. Since then, an extreme density gradient between the north and south part exists as a result of limited conveyance of water from the south part where more than 95 percent of the total freshwater input occurs (Loving, and others, 2000). To date, little is known about the loading and cycling of various chemical constituents associated with human activities including nutrients, selenium, and mercury. Hydroacoustic technology, specifically acoustic Doppler technology, is currently being used to obtain a better physical understanding of GSL. Since 1999, stratified bi- directional discharge has been measured at the causeway breach with an acoustic Doppler current profiler. From these measurements, net flow components to the north and south have been used to assess the movement of water and salt through the causeway. Low hydraulic gradients and variable backwater conditions at the two largest inflows to GSL required the deployment of in-situ acoustic Doppler velocity meters to accurately compute continuous discharge, critical for constituent loading analyses. These discharge records, computed using the index velocity method, show sensitivity to large wind events that can lead to a complete reversal of flow. Velocity profiles acquired during two multi-day water-quality synoptic sampling runs with acoustic Doppler current profilers have identified surface currents related to both freshwater inflow and wind throughout main body GSL. Velocity profiles have also determined the flow direction and magnitude of a persistent anoxic layer at depth in the south part of GSL. Movement of this layer between the two main basins of the south along a topographically high divide has also been documented (5 to 31 centimeters per second).

T1  - Abundance and Morphological Effects of Large Woody Debris in Forested Basins of Southern Andes
AN  - 29335920; 200702-26-030911 (CE); A06-46-012272 (AH); 200706331 (EQ)
AB  - The Southern Andes mountain range represents an ideal location for studying large woody debris (LWD) in streams draining forested basins thanks to the presence of both pristine and managed woodland, and to the general low level of human alteration of stream corridors. However, no published investigations have been performed so far in such a large region. The investigated sites of this research are three basins (9-13 km2 drainage area, third-order channels) covered by Nothofagus forests: two of them are located in the Southern Chilean Andes (the Tres Arroyos in the Malalcahuello National Reserve and the Rio Toro within the Malleco Natural Reserve) and one basin lies in the Argentinean Tierra del Fuego (the Buena Esperanza basin, near the city of Ushuaia). Measured LWD were all wood pieces larger than 10 cm in diameter and 1 m in length, both in the active channel and in the adjacent active floodplain. Pieces forming log jams were all measured and the geometrical dimensions of jams were taken. Jam type was defined based on Abbe and Montgomery (2003) classification. Sediment stored behind log-steps and valley jams was evaluated approximating the sediment accumulated to a solid wedge whose geometrical dimensions were measured. Additional information relative to each LWD piece were recorded during the field survey: type (log, rootwad, log with rootwads attached), orientation to flow, origin (floated, bank erosion, landslide, natural mortality, harvest residuals) and position (log-step, in-channel, channel-bridging, channel margins, bankfull edge). In the Tres Arroyos, the average LWD volume stored within the bankfull channel is 710 m3 ha-1. The average number of pieces is 1,004 per hectare of bankfull channel area. Log-steps represent about 22% of all steps, whereas the elevation loss due to LWD (log-steps and valley jams) results in 27% loss of the total stream potential energy. About 1,600 m3 of sediment (assuming a porosity of 20%) is stored in the main channel behind LWD structures approximately, i.e. 1,000 m3 per km of channel length, corresponding to approximately 150% of the annual sediment yield. In the Rio Toro, the average LWD volume and number of elements stored are much less, respectively 117 m3 ha- 1 and 215 pieces ha-1. Neither log-steps or valley jams were observed and the longitudinal profile appear not affected by LWD, and no sediment storage can be attributed to woody debris. The low LWD storage and impact in this channel is likely due to the general stability of its hillslopes, in contrast to the Tres Arroyos where extensive landslides and debris flows convey a great deal of wood into the stream. Finally, in the Buena Esperanza, the average LWD volume stored in the active channel is quite low (120 m3 ha-1), but the average number of pieces is the highest with 1,397 pieces ha-1. This is due to the smaller dimensions of LWD elements delivered by trees growing in a colder climate as that characterizing the Tierra del Fuego. The morphological influence of wood in this channel is however very important, with the presence of large valley jams and high log-steps imparting the channel a macro-scale stepped profile with a total energy dissipation due to LWD (log-steps and valley jams) of about 24 % of the stream potential energy. The sediment stored behind log- steps and valley jams results to be about 1,290 m3, i.e. 700 m3 km-1, but unfortunately no values of sediment yields are available for this basin.

T1  - Preservation of the environment and open space through free market housing incentives
AN  - 304947009
AB  - My analysis and evaluation of the conservation community policy model has shown it to be an effective and economically viable urban policy remedy for negative externalities inherent in urban sprawl development. Using surveys, interviews and election data in a case study analysis of Prairie Crossing, a private conservation community in Lake County, Illinois, I establish that the policy model, as defined in this case study, is a for-profit hydridization of the non-profit land trust model.    Incorporating aspects of the New Urbanism movement, Prairie Crossing succeeded in the positive creation of place and community. Resident voting participation in local elections significantly exceeded county norms, and non-voting political participation significantly surpassed the national rates recorded in the ANES data. Community developers substantively created and restored valuable habitats, including the locally extirpated and regionally threatened tall-grass prairie ecosystem. Biotic corridors link the development's wetlands to the local watershed and provide for the exchange of genetic material between populations, mitigating the problem of island biogeography. Conservation homeowner association practices, including exotic invasive and pest species removal, wetland and prairie burning, place-based ecology, organic farming, renewable energy generation, the planting of native organisms, and the reintroduction of endangered fish, have mitigated regional environmental degradation, and have fostered altruistic eco-friendly behaviors within the housing community's residents. Residents self-reported increasing their conservation behavior one-half a point on a four-point conservation rubric. Residents failed to alter transportation-oriented behaviors firmly anchored in American culture, supporting prior research conclusions. Increased environmental awareness at the national and, particularly, the local level substantively contributed to the defeat of a long-time incumbent in the U.S. House of Representatives. Survey data suggests that self-selection of homebuyers did not undermine the policy model. Further resident association practices include education, both internally and externally, and financial and organizational support for outside organizations. The development was successful in competing in the free market with conventional sprawling development. The conservation community policy model offers policy makers an economically competitive alternative to conventional urban sprawl.

T1  - There is life after GM: 'We have turned the page definitively'
AN  - 354884118
AB  - Last year, the city of Boisbriand did something that would have been unthinkable less than a decade ago: It bought two Toyota Echos for its inspectors. That's not the sort of thing a municipality does when its biggest tenant and employer is General Motors of Canada Ltd. For 37 years, GM built Pontiac Firebirds and Chevrolet Camaros at the plant, which opened in the mid-1960s with the signing of the Canada-U.S. Auto Pact. When Boisbriand needed a vehicle, it bought GM out of loyalty and pride. And GM paid back, its taxes covering 15% of the city's $8.8-million budget in 1985. But four years ago, GM said it was leaving town for good, after repeatedly threatening to do so. In August, 2002, the last car rolled off the line and 1,500 people -- less than half the peak level in the 1980s -- lost their jobs. Two years later, the plant, Quebec's last auto-assembly facility, was demolished. Across North America this week, many communities are coming to terms with the reality the world's largest automaker must shrink to survive. GM said on Monday it would shut 10 plants, cut production at two more and lay off 30,000 workers, including 3,900 in Canada. As areas from Ontario to Georgia mourn the loss of jobs and economic activity, some may wonder what life is like after GM. Three years ago, Boisbriand locals warned of devastation. That hasn't happened. Not only has the impact of GM's departure been minimal, it may be one of the best things that ever happened to the city of 27,000. The vast majority of GM employees were well looked after with good severance and retirement plans, while more jobs and residents have poured into the region, one of the fastest-growing destinations in Quebec for young families, with its diversified economic base and low unemployment level. Moreover, the city's post-GM experience offers a lesson about the necessity for corporate welfare to save a community. "For sure, we have turned the page definitively on GM. Voila. The page is turned," said Sylvie St-Jean, Boisbriand's Mayor. "We can't stop and bemoan our fate." A key reason Boisbriand isn't suffering is because GM occupied one of the most coveted pieces of real estate in Quebec. Eight bidders lined up for the 232-acre property, at the northwest corner of two of the busiest highways in the province: the 15, which runs from Montreal to ski country in the Laurentians; and the 640, Montreal's equivalent of Toronto's Highway 407 -- a major corridor that runs through the expanding suburbs north of the city, intersecting with two other highways leading to Montreal Island. "The location is tremendous," said Jack Klaiman, Montreal-based executive vice president of retail leasing firm Oberfeld Snowcap. If GM hadn't been there, he says, someone would have built a mall on the site 20 years ago. "It's very rare to see a property on two main highways. Where do you get that kind of traffic going past your door?" The winning bidder, Raleigh, N.C.-based Cherokee Investment Partners, paid GM $53-million last year for the site, and the developers have since been surprised at just how determined and co-operative city council has been to clear the way for shovels to get into the ground -- even as the city suffered a major scandal, with Ms.

T1  - Pool -breeding amphibian habitat use and conservation in southern Maine's urbanizing landscapes
AN  - 304992302
AB  - Pool-breeding amphibians utilize both wetland and terrestrial habitats, and thus are vulnerable to the combined threats of wetland and terrestrial habitat loss. Habitat loss and degradation are extreme in urbanizing areas, and in the rapidly-developing northeastern United States, pool-breeding amphibians including the wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) face loss of isolated wetland breeding sites and fragmentation of forested non-breeding habitat. More information on the biology of the species and systematic approaches to conservation are needed to address these threats. To add to the pool-breeding amphibian habitat literature and develop conservation methods, I studied association between breeding population size at 87 seasonal forest pools, and habitat conditions at the aquatic, local (150m) and landscape (500m) spatial scales, in rapidly developing southern Maine. I examined migratory movements and post-breeding habitat selection by 43 wood frogs April–November 2003, using radiotelemetry, and conducted conservation gap and threat analyses. Breeding populations of wood frogs and spotted salamanders were greater in long-hydroperiod seasonal pools (≥18 weeks), in relatively isolated upland settings (2–5 neighboring pools). Spotted salamander breeding populations were higher when also associated with late-successional forest conditions (Tsuga canadensis, Fagus grandifolia co-dominance). Radiotracked wood frogs migrated 102–340m (median 169m) from breeding pools through forested uplands to neighboring forested wetlands where they spent the summer months. Within wetland macrohabitats, wood frogs selected non-aquatic, moist, shaded microhabitats, primarily utilizing leaf and sphagnum structures as daytime refugia. Conservation GAP and threat analysis at the region (multi-township) scale revealed that nearly half of potential breeding sites receive no protection, and 1.5% of pool-breeding amphibian habitat in the region (453 ha) is immediately threatened by projected human population expansion. Furthermore, National Wetland Inventory maps omit 55% of potential breeding pools (1.77/km2), and thus many pools may be threatened by a lack of remote detection during delineation. To prioritize conservation of pool-breeding amphibian habitat, we recommend identifying (a) landscapes with high habitat value that are threatened by development and within those, (b) high-quality breeding (i.e. intermediate-long hydroperiod seasonal pools) and non-breeding (i.e. forested) habitat. A method to incorporate wetland habitat connectivity using a context-specific GIS is suggested.

T1  - The effect of urbanization on butterfly species diversity
AN  - 305049306
AB  - This dissertation investigates the impacts of urbanization on butterfly diversity in Washington, DC, northern Virginia, and Maryland and the role of butterfly gardens in butterfly conservation. Using weekly butterfly garden surveys from 135 gardens and 4th of July Butterfly Counts from 1990 to 2001, I investigated whether the matrix surrounding suitable butterfly habitat affects the diversity of the species found in this suitable habitat. The hypothesis of this study was that increasing levels of human development and population density in the matrix surrounding butterfly habitat will negatively affect the butterfly diversity found in the habitat. Results of this study indicate that local, not regional, butterfly diversity is negatively affected by increasing levels of human development (rural, suburban, or urban development) surrounding the habitat, but that the matrix is just one factor in generalist species diversity. Other factors include the size of the suitable habitat, the number of nectar plants blooming in the habitat, the use of pesticides in neighboring areas, and linkages to other suitable habitat. These results indicate that butterfly gardens do serve a purpose in butterfly conservation, most likely serving as stepping stones or corridors between larger tracts of habitat. Conservation efforts should include butterfly gardens, but larger tracts of natural habitat with less development or large gardens should also be included in any conservation plan. Future study should: (1) include species with more specific habitat needs than the twelve species used in the butterfly garden study, (2) more closely investigate the effects of pesticide use in neighboring areas, and (3) use mark-release-recapture techniques to study metapopulations in this area.

T1  - Searching for Richardson
AN  - 213953599
AB  - There are few places in the world in which technology is more reasonably equated with life than in Richardson, Texas, home of the Telecom Corridor - the largest concentration of telecom companies in the US. When telecom crashed, the city trembled. Nortel Networks cut almost half of the 900 people it employed there 2 years ago. Alcatel cut thousands of area jobs, shutting down much of its local research and development operations and moving most of what was left to France. Richardson's mayor and economic development team are visiting high-tech companies all over the US, marketing Richardson as a product and urging firms to come to the Telecom Corridor. Ironically, some of the damage done to the corridor even bolsters the pitch: Commercial real estate is now cheaper and more abundant, and the available talent pool is now much more available. The biggest economic development news for the region by far came in June, when microelectronics juggernaut Texas Instruments, which gave birth to the Telecom Corridor when it moved to Richardson in 1956, announced plans to build a $3 billion semiconductor manufacturing plant in the region. After it breaks ground in late 2005, the Texas Instruments plant should create 1000 new jobs and give the city a foothold in the next generation of chip technology-not to mention another cash cow.

T1  - Industrious Integration
AN  - 213332807
AB  - Two architecture firms worked with structural engineers Fast and Epp, whose four stations are testimony to that firm's creativity and versatility. Renfrew and Rupert, designed by Baker McGarva Hart Architects (now VIA Architecture) are located in a light industrial area of East Vancouver destined to become the city's new high-tech corridor. Conceived as sister stations, they are outwardly similar but differentiated in detail. Both draw their palette of materials from the industrial and railway-related heritage of the area. Hollow steel section columns support glulam ribbed roofs clad in profiled metal decking, while fully glazed double-height curtain wall ticket halls anticipate the future context of high-tech office development. Symbolizing the movement of passing trains, the wing-like platform canopies of both stations are offset in plan, giving a dynamic quality, whether approached by road or rail. But this is where the similarities end. Renfrew is a bold and muscular structure true to industrial tradition, whereas Rupert is delicate and more finely crafted--reflecting the texture of its site adjacent tree-lined Still Creek.

              
By contrast, at Rupert station the simple cylindrical perimeter columns are set at half the spacing used at Renfrew. They each support similarly curved but considerably shallower glulam ribs that in turn support glulam purlins and a standing seam metal roof. Above the tracks, the longitudinal opening that separates the two roof canopies is bridged by steel knife plates that connect the opposing pairs of glulam ribs. At the outside edges of the roof, diagonal glulam braces complete a moment frame system that is repeated along most of the platform. The architectural language is consistent throughout the building, with steel used where the structure is protected from weather, and wood used where it is not.

              
Where the canopies are offset in plan, the moment frames give way to a propped cantilever similar to that at Renfrew. Here the ribs are paired, and have a continuous steel flitch plate between them. The overall width of this composite glulam and steel rib is equal to that of the single glulams used elsewhere along the platform. For visual consistency, these single ribs have a reveal routed into their lower face. This reveal also provides a concealed suspension point for the platform lighting and signage. As at Renfrew, connections are designed for minimum visual impact, with concealed plates and custom narrow-head pins countersunk into the timber members. The glulams are spruce, chosen for its light appearance.

T1  - The new ruralism: A vision for exurban landscapes
AN  - 305337774
AB  - Residential development has become prevalent in the urban fringe of Canadian cities. This form of low-density growth impacts both the physical and cultural features that define rural landscapes. Preserving farmland, open space, wildlife habitat, natural resources and rural character have all become salient issues of regional significance. The sporadic nature of land subdivision and a ‘cookie-cutter’ approach to site design often fail to address these regional issues. The cumulative effects of these individual developments often result in a fragmented, contrasting and uninspired exurban landscape.    This master's degree project recognizes the inevitable growth of exurban development and uses a design-based approach to develop a concept for a residential community. A set of key principles and design process derived from ecological design and rural design precedents provide a framework to guide design decisions within exurban settings. A project site located west of Calgary is used to illustrate the principles and demonstrate a design strategy that responds to the local conditions of the site and its regional context.    Over 80% of the site is maintained as open space for agricultural uses, community uses and environmental protection. Houses are clustered to preserve wildlife habitat and movement corridors and to benefit from communal infrastructure. The concept design also establishes connections to its regional context, demonstrating its potential to serve as a building block for open space protection in the local area. The New Ruralism as a model for exurban growth represents a potential form of exurban development that is sustainable and logical in the rural landscape.

T1  - Flight characteristics of non-migrating and migrating populations of turkey vultures
AN  - 305314523
AB  - Flight altitude characteristics of non-migrating turkey vultures (Cathartes aura) were examined in Indiana and Ohio for future incorporation into aircraft/bird avoidance models. Vultures spent 74.3% of the day perched and 25.7% in flight. Of time in flight, 97.4% was at or below 151m (500 ft) above ground level (AGL), corroborating previous studies suggesting these birds fly primarily at low altitudes for foraging efficiency and energy conservation, even when available dynamic lift would allow flight at much higher altitudes. There was no significant difference in altitude band selection among 3 sites separated by >200km, demonstrating that altitude modeling is possible. Correlating weather variables with altitude selection proved difficult; regression analysis yielded mixed results, forcing a simplistic altitude model concept.    Turkey vultures do not move randomly across the landscape, but remain within annual home ranges that target specific habitat types. Average home range size for 3 separate populations from 1996–1998 ranged from 149km 2 at NPBRS (Ohio site) to 627km2 at CNSWC (south-central Indiana site); associated embedded 90% Kernel values for the same locations were 20km2 and 170km2. Turkey vultures spent 77.7% of the day perched in or flying over wooded habitat and spent much less time in other available habitats—agriculture (15.4%), landfills (6.1%), urban (0.6%) and wetlands (0.1%). Observations, averaged for each site, showed that the majority of movements within home ranges were within 15km of the primary roost—NPBRS (99%), PRFWA (97%), and CNSWC (92%). Data demonstrated that turkey vulture movements around primary roost sites could be modeled for inclusion into existing U.S. Air Force bird avoidance procedures. However, identification of primary roost sites within boundaries of low-level flight corridors is necessary to complete this task.    Satellite data were collected on 2 turkey vultures (1 immature and 1 adult) captured at the National Plum Brook Research Station, Ohio. Two additional birds tagged at Pigeon River Fish and Wildlife Area failed to provide data. The immature bird provided 107 locations and 7 migration movements; 5 of the 7 movements (71%) were associated with a weather-front passage. The bird migrated 289km southwest, and settled in spring in an area 211 km south of the initial trapping location. The mature bird provided 93 locations and 15 migration movements; 12 of the 15 movements (80%) were associated with a weather-front passage. The bird migrated 1287km southeast and returned to the trapping area <3 months later. The flight altitude and habitat association data on these birds proved unreliable. In order to attain critical flight altitude and habitat preference data, future bird avoidance research of migrating turkey vultures should utilize global positioning systems.

T1  - Identification of sources contributing to mid-Atlantic regional aerosol
AN  - 214227600; 12418730
AB  - Source types or source regions contributing to the concentration of atmospheric fine particles measured at Brigantine National Wildlife Refuge, NJ, were identified using a factor analysis model called Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF). Cluster analysis of backward air trajectories on days of high- and low-factor concentrations was used to link factors to potential source regions. Brigantine is a Class I visibility area with few local sources in the center of the eastern urban corridor and is therefore a good location to study Mid-Atlantic regional aerosol. Sulfate (expressed as ammonium sulfate) was the most abundant species, accounting for 49% of annual average fine mass. Organic compounds (22%; expressed as 1.4 x organic carbon) and ammonium nitrate (10%) were the next abundant species. Some evidence herein suggests that secondary organic aerosol formation is an important contributor to summertime regional aerosol. Nine factors were identified that contributed to PM2.5 mass concentrations: coal combustion factors (66%, summer and winter), sea salt factors (9%, fresh and aged), motor vehicle/mixed combustion (8%), diesel/Zn-Pb (6%), incinerator/industrial (5%), oil combustion (4%), and soil (2%). The aged sea salt concentrations were highest in springtime, when the land breeze-sea breeze cycle is strongest. Comparison of backward air trajectories of high- and low-concentration days suggests that Brigantine is surrounded by sources of oil combustion, motor vehicle/mixed combustion, and waste incinerator/industrial emissions that together account for 17% of PM2.5 mass. The diesel/Zn-Pb factor was associated with sources north and west of Brigantine. Coal combustion factors were associated with coal-fired power plants west and southwest of the site. Particulate carbon was associated not only with oil combustion, motor vehicle/mixed combustion, waste incinerator/industrial, and diesel/Pb-Zn, but also with the coal combustion factors, perhaps through common transport.

T1  - Greened acres: around every other corner, we bump into a patch of grass, some sad-sack trees, a few benches upon which no one ever sits. The last thing Toronto needs is another banal park [Wychwood streetcare barns]
AN  - 214372241
AB  - For five years, the city has been trying to formalize this status. But the surprisingly contentious process of turning the Wychwood yard into a neighbourhood park has degenerated into an ugly feud. The NIMBY side, mostly homeowners living adjacent to the site, wants to see most of the car barns demolished to make way for a city park with all the usual trappings: grass, a few trees, some benches and playground equipment, perhaps a pond. The rival faction, which includes area residents, academics, heritage aficionados and arts types, favours a more imaginative vision touted by Artscape, a not-for-profit agency that rents space to artists. A feasibility study released in May lays out a wholesale restoration of several of the barns into community arts facilities, affordable live-work lofts, greenhouses, an interior "covered street" and a rooftop garden. (An earlier version of the plan proposed an amphitheatre with on-site parking, but that suggestion aroused local opposition and was dropped from the final report.) Such a project would cost over $6 million, with the cash coming from the public sector, foundations, community fundraising and rental income. The plans for the open space around the barns have yet to be finalized, but the ideas that have come up include a soccer pitch, naturalized groves and other conventional park amenities.              While there have been a few recent success stories (the Yo-Yo Ma-designed Music Garden at Harbourfront, the naturalization project around the Don Valley Brickworks and the amazing momentum of the community gardening movement), much of the problem has to do with the fact that the city's parks budget is drastically overextended. There's scant funding for anything new, much less something innovative. Many councillors are now involved in fundraising for parks projects that stand little chance of winning in the budget sweepstakes. Some are even coming around to the idea that the future lies in flexible public-private partnerships. "As people see their parks deteriorating, you're going to see more 'citizens for vital parks' groups coming forward," predicts Mihevc. "You're going to see a lot more activism about public parks."              Robert Allsopp, a Toronto architect who describes the Olmsted style as "almost patronizing," agrees. He worked in Barcelona in the 1980s, when far-sighted planners seized upon the strategy of improving parks as a means of regenerating the city. In the same vein, Allsopp's firm has designed an open-space master plan for the Fort York-Garrison Creek area, with an eye to establishing a corridor of bike paths, land bridges and trails linking the parks north of the rail lines with the isolated historic fort precinct, the new condo projects on Lake Shore Boulevard and Coronation Park. It's an urban planning vision in which the emphasis isn't on creating pastoral landscapes divorced from the city, but rather active social ones that connect previously separated communities. The European approach to open space, says Allsopp, is "a happy mix" of public and commercial--not unlike Harbourfront, or what's envisioned for Wychwood. "We tend to think of parks as green stuff. But more and more, we should be thinking of them as a focal point for redevelopment."

T1  - Detroit's suburban office centres
AN  - 208716445
AB  - Troy and Southfield lead the City of Detroit in various measures of the 'good life'. In Detroit, where 36 percent of the houses are pre-1939, the housing market stagnates so that 1995 average house prices ranged from $22,000 to $77,000 in its twelve real estate districts. The average was $104,000 in Southfield and $171,000 in Troy, with less than 3 percent of these houses pre-1939. In 1990, 29 percent of Detroit's families were classified as low income compared to 3.5 percent in Southfield and 2.0 percent in Troy. The two suburbs' populations are also younger, with only 6.6 percent of the residents being over 65 years of age in 1990 compared to 20 percent in Detroit. These characteristics are reflected by the occupational profiles of the residents in the three municipalities and the way in which these have changed since 1960 (Table 6). The high proportions of production workers and labourers in Michigan, in Detroit and in Troy in 1960 reflected a reliance on manufacturing. As automation brought rising productivity between 1960 and 1990, this proportion shrank steadily in Michigan as a whole and in Detroit. In Southfield, with a proportion of blue collar workers already below average in 1960, it fell more rapidly while in Troy it dropped more rapidly yet, so that in 1990 the proportions of resident production workers and labourers in both Southfield and Troy were half that of Michigan and the City of Detroit. The proportion of managerial and professional workers in Michigan's workforce rose steadily between 1960 and 1990, but the proportion of such workers living in the City of Detroit remained almost unchanged. Meanwhile, in Southfield and Troy this segment of their resident workforces grew to more than double the proportion in Detroit.              Every office building in Troy and in Southfield's highway corridor was visited to interview front desk personnel in each establishment briefly to elicit objective data. A response rate of over 80 percent yielded 459 interviews. A random sample of the offices was then selected and all the offices with over 500 employees, that had not already been selected, were added to the sample. I attempted to interview executives in each of these offices about the factors that were considered in the decision to locate in that centre, and the advantages or disadvantages they had found after opening the offices. Some were reluctant to cooperate but 38 interviews were completed. Tables 7 and 8 show the centres' profiles in terms of objective data from the initial interviews. 26 percent of the office establishments in Southfield and 14 percent of those in Troy were law firms (Table 7). These firms were generally small, with a few medium-sized ones, and did not include the large, departmentally-specialized firms, with a hundred or more lawyers, that are still located downtown. Apart from the high proportions of law firms there is little similarity in the functional profiles of the offices in these centres, Troy being the more functionally diverse one. The high degree of specialization in one function resembled what had been found in two of the three Vancouver centres, but the specializations differed, and neither centre is as diversified as the three examined in Toronto. Also, 13 percent of the Southfield offices and only 3 percent of those in Troy were foreign owned, similar to Vancouver's but far lower than in the Toronto centres ([Matthew] 1996). This difference may be related to Detroit's role in the U.S. auto industry, with foreign car manufacturers preferring to locate most of their plants in more southern states, whereas Toronto has a diversified economy and has a growing role of linking Canada to the world's financial markets.              About 45 percent of the establishments in each of the two centres had ten or fewer employees (Table 8), which is significantly less than in Vancouver at 72 percent and Toronto at 65 percent ([Gad] 1975; Matthew 1993a, 1996). The head offices of two of the big three auto companies are in the suburbs, but not in either of the centres surveyed. However, Troy's Big Beaver strip has the head offices of KMart (the fifteenth largest U.S. company on the Fortune 500 list) and Kelly Services (ranked 476th), while Southfield had the head office of only one, Lear Seating (355th). There has been minimal physical movement of offices to either of these centres from outside the Detroit PMSA, and few of the offices in the suburban centres have moved there from the CBD. In fact, over 80 percent of the offices in each of the centres were born either in the centre or elsewhere within the Detroit suburbs, reinforcing findings in Toronto and Vancouver that the suburbs are self generators of offices, with little physical relocation of offices from the CBDs to suburban locations in the metropolitan areas.

T1  - A complex systems approach to dynamic spatial simulation modeling: LandUse and LandCover change in the Ecuadorian Amazon
AN  - 304713112
AB  - The Ecuadorian Amazon, lying in the headwaters of the Napo and Aguarico River valleys, is experiencing rapid change in LandUse and LandCover (LULC) conditions and regional landscape diversity uniquely tied to spontaneous agricultural colonization and oil exploration. Beginning in the early 1970s, spontaneous colonization occurred on squattered lands located adjacent to oil company roads and in government development sectors composed of multiple 50 ha land parcels organized into “piano key” shaped family farms or fincas. Since  fincas are managed at the household level as spatially discrete, temporally independent units, land conversion at the finca-level is recognized as the chief proximate cause of deforestation within the region. Focusing on the spatial and temporal dynamics of deforestation, agricultural extensification, and plant succession at the finca-level, and urbanization at the community-level, cell-based morphogenetic models of LandUse and LandCover Change (LULCC) were developed as the foundation for predictive models of regional LULCC dynamics and landscape diversity.    Two cellular automata models were developed and used to integrate biophysical, geographical, and social variables to characterize temporally dynamic landscapes. The human, geographical, and biophysical dimensions of land use and land cover change were examined, specifically deforestation, anthropogenic extensification, and reforestation. Remotely-sensed data ranging temporally from the 1970s through 1999, combined with thematic map coverages of biophysical gradients and geographical accessibility, were linked to household and community survey data collected in 1990 and 1999. Image processing techniques for LULC characterization and spatial analyses of landscape structure were used to assess the rate and nature of LULCC throughout the time-series. In addition, LULC and LULCC associated with secondary plant succession and agricultural extensification were assessed and simulated for specific landscape strata and study area locations related to development corridors along transportation networks and expanding urban environments. The presented research combines household survey data with biophysical and geographical data through a spatio-temporal modeling context that links complexity theory and landscape ecology to a GIS and remote sensing analytical framework to increase the understanding of landscape dynamics across time, space, and landscape strata.

T1  - Landscape ecology as a framework for woodland creation in Sherwood Forest using Geographic Information Systems (BL)
AN  - 301541012
AB  - The work described in this Thesis, develops a theoretical framework for the development of a spatial woodland creation strategy as a response to habitat fragmentation.The study produced a methodology that used the best available landscape ecological knowledge to generate a set of rules that enabled the creation of a landscape plan. The choice of a target species (the woodland bird, Redstart), which is sensitive to fragmentation effects, allowed precise parameters to be worked out as a framework for the woodland strategy.Two contrasting landscape types with different woodland cover were chosen as case studies for evaluating the success of the re-instating of a woodland framework. The use of a Geographic Information System (GIS) was an indispensable tool for the application of the method.The strategy first identified woods with the highest chances of being occupied: these were considered to be "source" woods, which provided colonizers for local populations in the remaining woods. With regard to the colonization potential of existing sites in relation to the sources, small woods with a low degree of isolation were identified for further expansion so as to satisfy the minimum area requirement for redstarts. Woodland corridors were created to promote dispersal to the isolated woods. In addition , the strategy also suggested planting on degraded areas of urban fringes and colliery sites, so that both visual and ecological benefits would be delivered.

T1  - Mixed Farming: Scope and Constraints in West African Savanna
AN  - 2564082430
AB  - Since colonial times the crop livestock integration concept has been a leading development model in francophone West Africa. So far, it has failed in certain aspects, such as cultivation of fodder crops, intensification of cereal production through animal traction, and sedentarisation of mobile livestock keepers. Three major flaws in the concept have been identified, that are partly responsible for the reported failure: neglect of the farm (household) context, neglect of the financing role of livestock, neglect of competition for land and labour. Whether crop livestock integration can remain the leading development model in a situation of high population growth, has been explored through the following research question:"Is crop livestock integration or mixed farming a suitable model for farming systems development, leading to guaranteed food security and socio-economic survival for all social entities of the rapidly increasing population in Sahelian countries, without endangering their resource basis? " The contextPhysical contextIn the study area, the village Ka'ibo Sud V5, Province Zoundweogo, Burkina Faso, resources and their use appeared to be heterogeneous. Scenario studies with SHARES, a model at the level of Ka'ibo Sud V5, and HOREB, a model at the level of an average farm in Zoundweogo province, indicated that self-sufficiency in grain can not be achieved under currently applied crop and animal production technology in average rainfall years. External inputs in the form of inorganic fertiliser and/or concentrate feed for livestock are needed to compensate unavoidable nutrient losses, and a cart is needed to allow intensive management of crop residues and manure.Agricultural knowledge systemIn Burkina Faso, policy makers, research and extension appear to follow the transfer of technology model, a top-down approach leading to development of technologies that are not necessarily addressing farmers' needs. Research is either curiosity-driven or guided by objectives of policy makers. Extension only reaches a limited number of farmers, hence the progressive farmers approach dominates their relations. Farmers generally adopt proposed technologies, either because they have the means to introduce the innovations or because the proposed innovation suits them best. Only farmers that adopted technologies were contacted subsequently, and in turn, those farmers actively asked research and extension for solutions to their problems. Only when they were recognised as a constituency of the policy makers, they could influence the research agenda. Resource-poor farmers and mobile livestock keepers are neither recognised as a constituency nor possessed the means to innovate, hence they hardly benefit from research and extension. Farming systems developmentA framework situating discrete farming systems in the development perspective of mixed farming, has been designed. The framework ranges from separate specialised low external input (LEIA) systems, through integrated and mixed farming systems without or with external inputs, to specialised high external inputs (HEIA) farming systems. Observed farming systems in Burkina Faso could be classified within the proposed framework. Policy makers, driven by the objective to settle and control mobile herdsmen and to constrain crop producers to permanent fields, aimed at mixed farming systems for everyone. The recent sustainability debate appears to support their promotion of mixed (LEIA) farming systems because they are assumed to reduce nutrient losses. Mobile Fulani herdsmen engage in crop production only, when forced by circumstances, such as drought or animal diseases, leading to severe losses in livestock, making continuation of their former way of life impossible. Mixed farming is a poverty-induced option for them and therefore not attractive. For Mossi crop producers, on the contrary, wealth is the drive towards mixed farming, cattle being needed to support the associated technologies, such as animal traction and use of manure. Resource-poor farmers going into mixed farming have to apply labour-intensive techniques (their only resource) and, because of their low purchasing power, they cannot afford external inputs and have no option but to (over) exploit the environment. High external input (HEIA) farming should avoid pollution of the environment. Ecologically, both HEIA and LEIA can have negative effects on natural resource quality. Socio-economically, high agricultural production per unit area, based on the use of external inputs will lead to larger scale production and lower prices. Resourcepoor farmers cannot follow this development and run the risk of being expelled from farming. Economically, HEIA farming is only sustainable when cash crops are cultivated or when high prices can be guaranteed. Around cities, capital intensive production systems can exist, because of the high purchasing power of the urban population and because of the short producer-consumer lines. In rural areas, farming systems that do not rely on high-quality infrastructure and use labour-intensive techniques, achieving moderate production levels are most suitable, guaranteeing local self-sufficiency in food. Production for export should be based on industrially organised systems using high levels of external inputs and capital. To aim at a variety of farming systems, each addressing specific societal needs, seems a more suitable strategy than to aim at the mixed farming system proposed in the model. Financing role of livestockIn the mixed farming model, the role of livestock was limited to the supply of manure and animal power for crop production, and to value crop residues. For farmers in Burkina Faso and elsewhere in West Africa, livestock plays an important role as capital asset, to cover (emergency) cash needs. In farming systems where crop production depends on erratic rainfall, as in West Africa, livestock can be used to transfer surpluses from years with abundant rainfall to years with deficiencies. Livestock production was negatively affected by this buffer function, because emergency (premature) sales are associated with losses due to  foregone offspring and foregone live weight. Emergency sales further restricted revenues, when livestock had to be sold in periods with low market prices. Sales of livestock for financing purposes also negatively affected performance of the farming system as a whole, in terms of foregone manure and animal traction, limiting crop production.For financing, farmers preferred livestock to other means, even though taking a loan with a savings and credit co-operative was cheaper. Accessibility, security, liquidity and profitability were all more favourable for livestock than for any of the alternatives examined. The fact that a pledge of 150 % of the credit is needed for a loan from a co-operative, was a major constraint for resource-poor farmers. Financing through livestock was therefore more attractive than taking a loan with a co-operative or any other source. Animal tractionAnimal traction has been presented as a key element of crop livestock integration. It appears to be associated with larger farm sizes, larger areas of cash crop and higher livestock numbers, hence with wealthier farmers. In Zoundweogo province and Ka'ibo village, animal traction could develop as there were sufficient animals to serve all households and to cultivate total current crop area. Additional efforts should be made to increase training of bullocks and transfer of bullocks from Fulani livestock keepers to Mossi crop producers is needed. Bullocks appeared too weak for the tasks asked from them, resulting in short working days of 2-3 hours. Output per animal might be increased through introduction of heavier animal breeds or additional animal feeding. Timeliness of seeding and weeding might also be improved by using additional bullocks. The scope for improvement is limited as any solution depends on purchasing power of the farmer and availability of inputs. Natural resource basisMossi and Fulani herds appeared to use the village territory in different ways, dictated by animal species, production objectives and season. Current high population growth leads to an expanded area under crops, for food production, and consequently reduced grazing area in the rainy season. Crop residue management, as proposed in the crop livestock integration model, leads to increased control over this feed resource by Mossi crop producers. As a result, room for the traditional feeding strategy, applied by Fulani and consisting of mobility and tracking changes in vegetation, becomes limited. The quantity (area) of animal feed becomes limiting, especially in the rainy season. In the post-harvest, dry season, both quantity and quality of animal feed becomes limiting because crop residues are no longer available and their animals thus have to rely on low quality grasses from the natural vegetation. Options for Fulani herds were further restricted by excluding them from the use of village wells in the dry season. Fulani have either to leave the village territory more often and for longer periods, or to accept lower animal production. When Mossi specialised crop producers become mixed farmers, the number of animals in their system increases. When Fulani become mixed farmers, their livestock will reside more permanently on the village territory. Larger livestock numbers and smaller grazing area increase risks of degradation, especially because specialist feeders such as goats and sheep will be forced to accept a more general diet, resulting in diet overlap between formerly complementary feeders. Population growth and subsequent urbanisation has been shown to lead to increased demands for firewood that has to be provided from village territories. Degradation of the natural resources in village territories and a decrease in feed resources for browsers can be the result. ConclusionThe crop livestock integration model, and especially the mixed farming model, has only limited applicability as goal for farming systems development. In Burkina Faso, the majority of the farming population consists of resource-poor farmers, incapable to adopt technologies associated with mixed farming, because they lack the purchasing power to acquire ploughs, draught bullocks, inorganic fertilisers, etc. Mixed farming as a comprehensive development model therefore fails, although several of its components are (at least partially) adopted by a variety of farmers. The concept of restricted nutrient losses through intensive management of manure and crop residues appeared, for instance, valid, but, because of unavoidable losses during (re-)cycling, external inputs are needed to guarantee sufficient food production for the rapidly growing population. Moreover, exchange of crop residues and manure between specialised farming systems, has the same potential for nutrient cycling as mixed farming, but may be preferred because of advantages associated with labour distribution. Constraints for farming system development, especially for crop farmers, can be alleviated by creation of an optimal farm environment, such as a sound financial infrastructure, an agricultural knowledge system addressing farmers needs, a professional infrastructure to provide inputs and to guarantee marketing of outputs, fair farm-gate prices for agricultural products, etc. Attractive prices for meat and milk, infrastructure for veterinary care, grazing rights protected by law and limiting crop production in designated grazing areas and corridors, etc. are needed to facilitate mobile animal production. Technology development should already take its impact on the environment into account. Research and extension should stimulate participation of resource-poor farmers and mobile livestock keepers in technology development and support development of a range of farming systems, in terms of inputs and outputs, because together they can address the variety of societal needs. Alternate abstract:In franstalig West Afrika is, sinds de koloniale tijd, integratie van akkerbouw en veehouderij in de vorm van een gemengd bedrijf het heersende ontwikkelingsmodel geweest. Dit model heeft gefaald in de teelt van voedergewassen, intensivering van voedselproductie door middel van dierlijke trekkracht en in het vestigen van rondtrekkende veehouders. Drie onvolkomenheden van het model liggen, voor een deel, ten grondslag aan dit falen: het buiten beschouwing laten van de omgeving van het boerenbedrijf, het verwaarlozen van de financieringsfunctie van vee en het verwaarlozen van de schaarste aan land en arbeid. Het belang van het model in een situatie van snelle bevolkingsgroei is onderzocht middels de volgende onderzoeksvraag:
"Is de integratie van akkerbouw en veehouderij oftewel het gemengd bedrijf een geschikt model voor ontwikkeling van bedrijfssystemen, leidend tot voedselveiligheid en biedt het een mogelijkheid tot overleven aan alle sociale groepen waaruit de snel groeiende bevolking van Sahellanden bestaat, zonder hun natuurlijke hulpbronnen in gevaar te brengen? "
De omgeving
Fysieke omgeving
In het onderzoeksgebied, het dorp Ka'ibo Sud V5, in de provincie Zoundweogo, Burkina Faso, bleken de natuurlijke hulpbronnen en hun gebruik zeer heterogeen. Scenariostudies zijn uitgevoerd met behulp van SHARES, een dorpsmodel, toegepast op Kaibo Sud V5, en HOREB, een bedrijfsmodel, toegepast op een gemiddeld boerenbedrijf in Zoundweogo. Uit beide modellen bleek dat, in een gemiddeld regenvaljaar, zelfvoorziening in graan onmogelijk was gebruik makend van de huidige productietechnieken. Externe inputs zoals kunstmest en krachtvoer zijn nodig om onvermijdbare verliezen van nutrienten tijdens recirculatie te compenseren en het bezit van een kar was onontbeerlijk voor intensief management van gewasresten en dierlijke mest.
Landbouwkundige kennissystemen
Beleid, onderzoek en voorlichting werken in Burkina Faso volgens het "technologie overdrachtsmodel" (Transfer of Technology), een top-down benadering, leidend tot ontwikkeling van technologieen die niet noodzakelijkerwijs aansluiten bij wat boeren nodig hebben. Onderzoek wordt gedreven door nieuwsgierigheid of aangestuurd door doelstellingen van beleidsmakers. In de voorlichting domineert de "vooruitstrevende-boeren aanpak". Boeren passen nieuwe technologieen toe, omdat ze de daarvoor benodigde middelen bezitten of omdat de technologie precies een van hun problemen oplost en goed past binnen hun bedrijfsvoering. In het vervolg worden alleen die boeren aangesproken die positief reageren op voorgestelde technologieen en omgekeerd zullen juist die boeren actief een beroep doen op ondersteuning door onderzoek en voorlichting. Wanneer zij deel uitmaken van de achterban of het electoraat van beleidsmakers, kunnen ze de onderzoeksagenda bei'nvloeden. Armere boeren en rondtrekkende veehouders zijn als achterban oninteressant en bezitten niet de middelen om te vernieuwen, terwijl veel voorgestelde technieken niet bij hun bedrijfsvoering aansluiten. Daardoor profiteren zij nauwelijks van onderzoek en voorlichting.
Ontwikkeling van bedrijfssystemen
Er is een raamwerk ontwikkeld waarin bedrijfstypen gerangschikt zijn volgens het heersende ontwikkelingsmodel richting gemengd bedrijf. Onderscheiden zijn gespecialiseerde lage input akkerbouw en veehouderij, gei'ntegreerde bedrijven, gemengde bedrijven met een hoog en laag niveau van externe inputs en gespecialiseerde bedrijven met een hoog input niveau. In het onderzoeksgebied in Burkina Faso bleken deze bedrijfssystemen inderdaad voor te komen en in dit raamwerk in te passen. Beleidsmakers, die streven naar vestiging van, en controle over voormalige rondtrekkende veehouders en permanente teelt van gewassen door akkerbouwers, propageren het gemengde bedrijf voor iedereen. Het recente debat over duurzaamheid sterkt ze in hun streven, omdat in gemengde bedrijfssystemen de kans op nutrientenverliezen kleiner zouden zijn. Rondtrekkende Fulani veehouders bleken echter slechts op akkerbouw over te gaan wanneer hun kuddes door calamiteiten zoals extreme droogte of besmettelijke dierziektes gedecimeerd waren, en ze niet in hun levensonderhoud konden voorzien op basis van de overgebleven dieren. Het gemengd bedrijf is voor hen een optie voortvloeiend uit armoede en daarom niet aantrekkelijk. Mossi akkerbouwers daarentegen kunnen pas overgaan op een gemengd bedrijf, wanneer ze voldoende rijkdom vergaard hebben om rundvee te kunnen kopen dat nodig is voor dierlijke trekkracht en mest. Armere boeren die op een gemengd bedrijf overgaan, zijn gedwongen arbeidsintensive technieken te gebruiken en hun omgeving te exploiteren, omdat ze nauwelijks koopkracht hebben om externe inputs te kopen. Boeren die een hoog niveau aan externe inputs gebruiken, moeten daarentegen oppassen voor vervuiling van hun omgeving. Ecologisch gezien, kunnen zowel bedrijven gebaseerd op lage als op hoge externe inputs, leiden tot schade aan natuurlijke hulpbronnen. Sociaal gezien, zal een hoge landbouwkundige productie per eenheid van oppervlak, gebaseerd op gebruik van externe inputs leiden tot schaalvergroting en lagere prijzen. Kleinere, armere boeren die niet kunnen aansluiten zullen uit de landbouw uitgestoten worden. Economisch gezien, kunnen externe inputs slechts toegepast worden wanneer handelsgewassen verbouwd worden of er een voldoende hoge prijs gegarandeerd is. Rond grotere steden kunnen kapitaalsintensieve bedrijven bestaan vanwege aanwezigheid van een koopkrachtige vraag en korte lijnen van producent naar consument. Op het platteland kunnen van infrastructuur onafhankelijke, arbeidsintensieve bedrijven met een betrekkelijk laag opbrengstniveau per eenheid oppervlak bestaan die met name zelfvoorziening in voedsel nastreven. Voor exportproducten kunnen bedrijven bestaan die industrieel produceren met hoge niveaus van externe inputs en kapitaal. Het streven naar variatie in bedrijfssystemen, elk gericht op het voldoen aan een vraag vanuit de samenleving, lijkt daarom effectiever dan het streven naar een standaard gemengd bedrijf.
Financieringsrol van vee
In het model van het gemengde bedrijf is de rol van vee beperkt tot het leveren van mest en trekkracht voor de akkerbouw en het benutten van gewasresten. Voor boeren in Burkina Faso en elders in West Afrika echter is vee belangrijk als middel om in verwachte en onverwachte uitgaven te kunnen voldoen. Wanneer akkerbouw plaats vindt onder omstandigheden van onregelmatige regenval, zoals in West Afrika, dan kunnen via vee de overschotten van een goed regenvaljaar overgedragen worden naar een jaar met tekorten. Deze bufferfunctie van vee kan echter negatieve effecten hebben op de productie van de veeteeltsector, omdat door noodverkoop de potentiele opbrengst van toekomstige nakomelingen en toekomstig lichaamsgewicht van het op jonge leeftijd verkochte dier wordt gemist. Daarnaast kan gedwongen verkoop in tijden van lage prijzen leiden tot lage opbrengsten. Noodgedwongen verkoop van vee uit een gemengd bedrijf heeft ook negatieve effecten op de bedrijfsvoering als geheel omdat de mest en de trekkracht van het verkochte dier wegvallen, hetgeen kan leiden tot een lagere akkerbouwproductie. Uit een aantal alternatieven kozen boeren vrijwel steeds voor vee als financieringsbron, hoewel bijvoorbeeld in Zoundweogo, lenen bij een cooperatie, in geld uitgedrukt, voordeliger bleek te zijn. Vee is voor iedereen toegankelijk, draagt een laag risico, is gemakkelijk te gelde te maken en levert een hoog rendement. Als voorwaarde voor een lening bij een cooperatie moest bijvoorbeeld een borg met een waarde van 150 % van de lening overlegd worden en armere boeren hebben zo'n borg niet. Om die redenen was financiering via vee aantrekkelijker dan sparen en lenen bij een cooperatie en dan elk andere onderzochte alternatieve financieringsbron. 
Dierlijke trekkracht
Dierlijke trekkracht wordt gepresenteerd als belangrijke bindende factor in de integratie van akkerbouw en veehouderij. Bezit van dierlijke tractie bleek samen te gaan met grotere bedrijven, een groter areaal aan handelsgewassen en hogere veebezetting, dus met rijkere boeren. In de provincie Zoundweogo en in het dorp Kaibo Sud V5 bleken voldoende dieren aanwezig te zijn om dierlijke trekkracht zodanig te ontwikkelen dat elk huishouden de beschikking zou kunnen krijgen over trekdieren en dat het totale akkerbouwareaal met behulp daarvan bewerkt zou kunnen worden. Om dit te bereiken zullen echter veej dieren getraind moeten worden en zal er overdracht van rundvee moeten plaatsvinden van Fulani veehouders naar Mossi akkerbouwers. De gebruikte ossen bleken relatief te zwak voor hun taken, hetgeen resulteerde in zeer korte werkdagen van 2 tot 3 uur. Werkdagen zouden verlengd kunnen worden door gebruik van zwaardere dieren, hetzij van andere rassen, hetzij beter gevoerd. Tijdigheid van zaaien en wieden kan ook bevorderd worden door meer ossen per span of meer spannen na elkaar te gebruiken. Verbetering zal echter moeilijk zijn, want elke mogelijkheid tot investering wordt beperkt door de koopkracht van de boeren en de beschikbaarheid van inputs. 
Natuurlijke hulpbronnen
Het vee van Mossi en dat van Fulani bleek het dorpsgebied van Kaibo Sud V5 op verschillende manieren te gebruiken, afhankelijk van diersoort, productiedoel en seizoen. De huidige snelle bevolkingsgroei leidt tot toename van het graan areaal en daarmee tot minder ruimte voor beweiding, met name in het regenseizoen. Het gebruik van gewasresten voor stalvoedering, zoals voorgesteld in het gemengd bedrijfsmodel, zal leiden tot monopolisering van deze bron van veevoer door Mossi boeren. Fulani herders hebben daardoor minder mogelijkheden om hun voederstrategie, gebaseerd op mobiliteit en het volgen van veranderingen in vegetatie, uit te voeren. De hoeveelheid beschikbaar voer in de regentijd neemt af, terwijl in de droge tijd, na de oogst, zowel kwaliteit als kwantiteit afhemen doordat hoogwaardige gewasresten onttrokken worden en het vee terug moet vallen op lagere kwaliteit grassen in de natuurlijke vegetatie. Daarnaast worden Fulani in de keuze van hun graasgebieden beperkt, omdat hun vee geen toegang krijgt tot waterputten op het dorpsgebied. Fulani moeten om al deze redenen vaker en langer van het dorpsgebied wegtrekken met hun vee of anders productieverlies accepteren. In het gemengde bedrijf, zoals voorgesteld in het model, hebben Mossi meer vee, dan wanneer ze gespecialiseerde akkerbouwers zouden zijn. Wanneer Fulani veehouders overgaan op productie in de vorm van een gemengd bedrijf, dan zal hun vee meer permanent in het dorpsgebied verblijven. De overgang naar gemengde bedrijven zal de veebezetting verhogen en voor beweiding beschikbaar areaal verkleinen, hetgeen een risico tot overbeweiding met zich meebrengt, met name omdat in situaties van voedselschaarste, veesoorten die normalerwijze een zeer gespecialiseerd dieet hebben, verplicht zijn meer plantensoorten in hun dieet op te nemen en daarmee in dieet meer gaan overlappen met andere grazers. Bevolkingsgroei en de daarmee gepaard gaande verstedelijking, zal leiden tot een toename in de vraag naar brandhout, waarin dan met name voorzien moet worden vanuit de dorpsgebieden. Degradatie van natuurlijke hulpbronnen van dorpsgebieden en afhame van de voedselbron voor "browsers" kunnen hiervan het gevolg zijn.
Conclusies
De rol van het gemengde bedrijf, gebaseerd op integratie van akkerbouw en veehouderij, als model en uiteindelijke doel van bedrijfsontwikkeling bleek beperkingen te hebben. De boerenbevolking in Burkina Faso bleek met name te bestaan uit boeren met zeer beperkte middelen, niet in staat om de technologieen waarop het gemengde bedrijf gebaeerd is in te voeren, met name omdat ze onvoldoende koopkracht hebben om ploegen, trekdieren, kunstmest, etc. aan te schaffen. Het gemengde bedrijf als ontwikkelingsmodel faalt daarom, hoewel diverse onderliggende concepten, in ieder geval gedeeltelijk, door boeren gebruikt worden. Het principe dat nutrientenverliezen beperkt worden door intensief management van gewasresten en dierlijke mest klopt, maar externe inputs zijn nodig om de onvermijdbare verliezen te compenseren en zodoende de nutrientenbeschikbaarheid op peil te houden nodig om voldoende voedsel te produceren voor de snel groeiende bevolking. Ook tussen gespecialiseerde bedrijven kan ruil van gewasresten tegen dierlijke mest plaatsvinden om verlies van nutrienten te beperken. Uit het oogpunt van arbeidsverdeling kan deze optie zelfs aantrekkelijker zijn dan de uitwisseling op een gemengd bedrijf. Veranderingen in de omgeving waarin bedrijfssystemen geacht worden zich te ontwikkelen, kunnen beperkingen voor bedrijfsontwikkeling voor akkerbouwers opheffen. Daarbij kan met name gedacht worden aan een gezonde financiele infrastructuur, een landbouwkundig kennissysteem dat zich richt op de behoeften van de boerenbevolking, een professionele inputvoorziening en vermarktingsstructuur, hogere en gegarandeerde prijzen voor landbouwproducten voor de boeren, enz. Aantrekkelijke prijzen voor vlees en melk, infrastructuur voor diergeneeskundige zorg, beschermde beweidingsrechten en beperking van akkerbouw productie in graasgebieden en op veeroutes zijn onder andere nodig om dierlijke productie te stimuleren. Technologieontwikkeling moet rekening houden met effecten op de natuurlijke hulpbronnen. Onderzoek en voorlichting zouden arme boeren en rondtrekkende veehouders moeten betrekken bij technologieontwikkeling en differentiatie in bedrijfssystemen moeten ondersteunen, zodat deze samen kunnen voldoen aan de totaliteit aan maatschappelijke vragen.Alternate abstract:Depuis le temps colonial, le concept qui a guide le developpement agricole de l'Afrique de l'Ouest est le concept de l'integration entre production vegetale et animale. Ce concept a echoue par rapport aux sujets comme les cultures fourrageres, 1'intensification de la production cerealiere a travers la traction animale, et la sedentarisation des pastoralistes. Le concept connait trois insuffisances qui sont en partie responsables de son echec: la negligence de l'environnement de la ferme, celle des fonctions du betail dans le financement des besoins de la famille, et enfin celle de la competition des facteurs de production notamment de la terre et de la main- d'oeuvre.
Nous avons explore l'importance du concept dans une situation de croissance de la population. La question a repondre etait: 
Est-ce que le concept de I 'integration entre production animale et vegetale convient comme ligne directrice pour le developpement des systemes de production, assurant la securite alimentaire et la survie de tous les groupes socio-economiques de la population croissante des pays Saheliens, sans degradation de leurs bases en ressources naturelles.
Le contexte 
Contexte physique
Dans la zone d'etude, le village Ka'ibo Sud V5, dans la province Zoundweogo, au Burkina Faso, les ressources naturelles et leur utilisation sont tres heterogenes. Les etudes de scenario, basees sur les modeles de l'echelle village et l'echelle ferme moyenne, ont montre que l'autosuffisance alimentaire ne peut pas etre achevee avec les techniques culturales actuelles dans une annee de pluviometrie moyenne. Des ressources externes comme l'engrais et le concentre pour le betail sont necessaires pour remplacer les pertes de nutriments, et les moyens de transport comme la charrette sont necessaires pour une gestion de residus de recoltes et de fumier. 
Structure de connaissance agricole
L'Etat, la recherche et la vulgarisation, suivent un modele de transfert de technologie, responsable du developpement des technologies qui ne repondent pas necessairement aux besoins des paysans. La recherche est dirigee par la curiosite du chercheur ou les objectifs des politiciens. La vulgarisation ne pouvant pas s'adresser a chaque paysan, se limite aux paysans progressifs, qui repondent bien aux techniques proposees parce qu'ils ont les moyens d'innover ou parce que la technique est parfaitement adaptee a leurs conditions de production. Ces memes paysans s'adressent a la recherche et a la vulgarisation pour d'autres solutions techniques. Quand ils forment la base electorale des politiciens ils peuvent influencer l'agenda de la recherche. Les paysans a faibles ressources et les pastoralistes ne forment pas une base electorale et n'ont pas les moyens d'innovation, done ils ne beneficient pas de la recherche ni de la vulgarisation. 
Evolution des systemes de production
Un cadre a ete developpe dans lequel des systemes de production differents ont ete places dans une sequence devolution. Les systemes distingues sont: 
- systeme specialise en production animale ou en production vegetale, chacun a faible utilisation des intrants, 
- systeme integre, 
- systeme mixte avec ou sans utilisation des intrants, 
- systeme specialise base sur l'utilisation des intrants. 
Au Burkina Faso, les systemes de production correspondaient aux systemes decrits. Les politiciens, motives par l'objectif de sedentariser et d'accroitre le controle des pastoralistes et de fixer les cultivateurs sur des champs permanents, visent au systeme de l'integration complete entre agriculture et elevage, c.a.d. le systeme mixte, comme solution pour chaque producteur. La discussion recente sur la durability, appuie la promotion de ce systeme mixte parce qu'il est suppose reduire les pertes de nutriments. Les pastoralistes n'acceptent pas la production de cultures sauf quand ils sont forces de chercher des alternatives pour la production animale parce qu'ils ont ete soumis a une perte importante de leurs animaux suite a une periode de secheresse ou a une maladie contagieuse. L'integration agriculture-elevage est une option de pauvrete pour eux. Pour le Mossi c'est le cas inverse. Les producteurs Mossi doivent avoir des moyens pour associer l'elevage a leurs systemes de production. Le betail est necessaire pour la traction et pour le fumier. Les paysans a faibles ressources doivent se baser sur les systemes de production intensifs en main-d'oeuvre. Leur pouvoir d'achat est trop faible pour l'acquisition des intrants et ils n'ont comme alternative que d'exploiter leur environnement. Le paysan engage dans 1'agriculture basee sur des intrants externes, doit etre prudent pour que leurs residus ne polluent pas Penvironnement. Du point de vue ecologique, l'agriculture peut done faire des degats aux ressources naturelles, n'importe quel niveau d'intrants est utilise (LEIA ou HEIA). Du point de vue social, une production elevee de cultures basee sur des intrants cree une production a grande echelle et a tendance a baisser les prix. Les paysans a faibles moyens qui ne peuvent pas suivre ce type de developpement risquent d'etre exclus de l'agriculture. Du point de vue economique, les intrants ne peuvent etre utilises que sur les cultures de rente ou dans le cas de prix eleves des produits cultives. Autour des grandes villes, une production basee sur une forte utilisation de capital est appropriee parce que le pouvoir d'achat des citadins permet des prix attractifs. A la campagne, les systemes de production independants des infrastructures et des marches, et bases sur la main-d'oeuvre locale, avec une faible production, sont appropries pour assurer la securite alimentaire locale. Les systemes qui sont bases sur les cultures de rente et 1'exportation, peuvent etre organises de facon industrielle avec un niveau d'intrants eleve. II semble done plus approprie de viser une gamme de systemes de production, chacun repondant a des demandes specifiques de la societe, que de viser au systeme unique, le systeme mixte. 
Roles du betail pour le financement 
Dans le modele propose, le role du betail est reduit a la traction animale, le fumier et la valorisation des residus de recolte. Les paysans du Burkina Faso et de l'Afrique de l'Ouest en general, utilisent leur betail pour financer des besoins imprevus. Leur systeme de production depend d'une pluviometrie irreguliere et le betail est un moyen de transfert des surplus d'une annee de pluviometrie abondante a une annee deficitaire. Cette fonction de betail est associee avec des ventes a jeune age et ainsi implique des couts ou des pertes notamment en potentiel de reproduction (manque des petits) et de croissance (manque de poids vifs). La vente forcee peut aussi coi'ncider avec une periode dans laquelle les prix sont bas. La vente forcee peut aussi affecter le systeme de production entier parce qu'avec l'animal, son fumier et son energie de traction sont enleves de la production vegetale. Une comparaison entre plusieurs alternatives pour financer des depenses imprevues a montre que le betail est l'option preferee, malgre le fait qu'un credit pris dans une cooperative d'epargne et de credit soit l'option la moins chere dans la province du Zoundweogo. La securite, la liquidite, l'accessibilite et la profitabilite sont plus elevees pour le betail que pour les alternatives explorees. L'acces au credit dans une cooperative est conditionnee par une garantie de 150 % de credit, ce qui est une contrainte pour les paysans a faible revenu. Financer a travers le betail est done plus interessant que de prendre un credit dans une cooperative.
La traction animale
La traction animale est presentee comme un element cle du modele de l'integration agriculture-elevage. L'utilisation de la traction animale est associee a des fermes de superficies totales elevees, de superficies en culture de rente elevees, et un nombre eleves de betail, done avec des paysans plus aises. Au Zoundweogo et au village Ka'ibo Sud V5, le nombre de betail deja sur place est suffisant en vue d'equiper toutes les families et de travailler la superficie totale en cultures. Dans cet objectif, un nombre additionnel de boeufs doit etre forme et transfere du Foulbe aux Mossi. Les boeufs utilises jusqu'a maintenant etaient faibles par rapport aux taches demandees, ce qui donnait lieu a des jours de travail de 2 a 3 heures, done tres courts. Leurs performances peuvent etre ameliorees quand des races plus lourdes seront utilisees ou lorsque la nutrition sera amelioree. L'utilisation de boeufs supplementaires peut avancer la date de semence et celle du desherbage. Chaque solution depend des ressources des paysans done les possibilites reelles d'amelioration sont limitees. 
Ressources naturelies 
Mossi et Foulbe utilisent le terroir villageois chacun a leur fa?on dependant des espeees de betail, des objectifs de production et de la saison. La croissance de la population humaine augmente la demande d'espace pour la production des cereales et diminue la superficie disponible pour le paturage, dans la saison de pluie. La gestion des residus de recolte, comme proposee dans le modele d'integration, augmente le controle des Mossi sur cette ressource. La strategie que les Foulbe appliquent pour nourrir leur betail est basee sur le concept de mobilite  du troupeau suivant les changements de qualite et quantite de la vegetation suite aux evenements climatiques. Cette strategic est en danger parce que la superficie (quantite) de paturage est limitee en saison de pluie, et la qualite des ressources est diminuee quand les residus de recolte ne sont plus disponibles en saison apres-recolte. En saison seche, les animaux sont obliges de manger des herbes naturelles qui sont de pauvre qualite. La mobilite des troupeaux des Foulbe est egalement limitee parce qu'ils sont exclus de l'utilisation des puits de village, pendant la saison seche. Finalement, les troupeaux des Foulbe doivent quitter le terroir villageois plus frequemment et plus longtemps, ou bien les Foulbe doivent accepter une baisse de production de leurs troupeaux. Quand les paysans Mossi transforment leur systeme de production vegetale en systeme mixte, le nombre de betail dans leur systeme doit augmenter. Quand le berger transforme son systeme de production de betail en systeme mixte la presence de son betail sur le terroir augmente. L'augmentation du nombre de betail et la limitation de superficie de paturage augmente le risque de degradation. Les especes animales, qui sont capables de bien selectionner dans la base fourragere, notamment les ovins et les caprins, et dont le choix de nourriture est complementaire, sont forcees d'accepter plus d'especes vegetales, et entrent ainsi en competition avec les especes animales qui acceptent toujours de grandes quantites d'une large gamme d'espece vegetale, comme la vache. La croissance de la population humaine et l'urbanisation augmentent la demande en bois de feu. Ce bois doit etre fourni par les terroirs villageois et peut causer une degradation des ressources de ces terroirs et une diminution des ressources fourrageres, notamment pour les caprins qui dependent largement des especes ligneuses pour leur nutrition.
Conclusion
Le modele de l'integration agriculture-elevage, et specialement le modele systeme mixte, n'a qu'un potentiel limite pour le developpement des systemes de production. Au Burkina Faso, la population rurale est dominee par un nombre eleve de paysans a faibles ressources qui sont incapables d'adopter des technologies associees a un systeme mixte parce qu'ils n'ont pas le pouvoir d'achat pour l'acquisition de charrues, de boeufs de labour, d'engrais, etc. C'est pourquoi le systeme mixte comme modele complet a echoue, malgre le fait que plusieurs de ses composantes ont ete acceptes par plusieurs paysans. Le concept de recyclage des nutriments a travers la gestion de residus et de fumier, en vue de la diminution des pertes, est valable, mais les intrants externes sont neanmoins necessaires pour garantir la production des cereales pour nourrir la population en croissance rapide. En principe l'echange entre residus de recolte et fumier entre systemes de production specialises a la meme potentialite que le recyclage a l'interieur d'un systeme mixte. L'echange entre les systemes separes, permettant une distribution de main-d'oeuvre entre les systemes, peut etre prefere. Le developpement des systemes de production, surtout pour la production vegetale, demande un contexte optimal concernant 1'infrastructure financiere, une structure de connaissance agricole qui s'adresse aux besoins des paysans, une infrastructure pour Fapprovisionnement en intrants et la vente des produits, des prix attractifs au niveau ferme, etc. La production animale peut etre facilitee a  travers des prix remunerateurs pour le lait et la viande, une infrastructure veterinaire, une protection des droits de paturage renforcee par la loi et limitant le droit d'agriculture dans les aires de paturages et les pistes de betail, etc. Le developpement de la technologie devrait deja prendre en compte les aspects d'environnement. La recherche et la vulgarisation devraient stimuler la participation des paysans a faibles ressources et les pastoralistes au developpement de la technologie et soutenir une large variation de systemes de production parce qu'ensemble ils peuvent satisfaire toutes les demandes de la societe.

T1  - Measurement of the polarisation state of satellite to mobile signals in scattering environments
AN  - 27009819; A00-11161 (AH)
AB  - This paper details a measurement campaign which was undertaken to investigate the effects of buildings and trees on signal depolarization within a personal satellite communications environment. The satellite environment was simulated using a circular polarized transmit antenna elevated above the buildings, with a dual linear polarized receive antenna with separate receivers for the vertical and horizontal components of the signal. The received signal was sampled and digitally stored for processing at a later stage. Data were collected at a number of different sites, such that the effects of diffraction and reflection from both buildings and trees were observed along with effects within urban corridor situations. The presented results show a clear indication that there is considerable potential diversity gain available in areas where the signal is greatly diffracted or where the main signal is a reflected one. Diversity gains of around 10 dB have been observed and are presented here. There is, however, an adverse effect of up to 3 dB due to the noise from the second receiver when comparing the SNRs from maximum ratio diversity combining with a standard circular polarized antenna in areas where the two signals are not decorrelated, such as line-of-sight situations or areas where there is little shadowing or multipath effect.

T1  - Trainspotting: opportunities in Canada's rail system
AN  - 208725825
AB  - With deregulation, both Canadian National (CN) and Canadian Pacific (CPR) generally vacated the unprofitable passenger rail services and left them to the crown corporation VIA Rail. Although recently there have been moves to start high speed passenger rail corridors in the Vancouver-Seattle and the Quebec City-Windsor corridors [see p. 42], the economic realities of these projects have little to do with the efficient movement of people. Similarly, notions of new 500 kph magnetically-levitated trains hold out a lot more promise for high-density passenger routes in Japan and western Europe than they do in Canada. While a Canadian high speed rail demonstration project might help Canadian rail technology suppliers better compete in the lucrative Japanese and European markets, or perhaps will provide a politically attractive national unity platform, such a project will succeed only with a massive investment of public money. The cost of the Quebec City-Windsor Lynx high-speed proposal made last May, for example, was estimated at $11 billion.

              
Both CN and CPR railways are involved in the competition to develop a major superport on the east coast of North America. Private carriers Maersk Line and Sea-Land Service Inc. are searching for an east coast terminal for their post-Panamax container fleet. [Post-Panamax vessels are up to 1,000 feet wide, about 50 feet too wide to pass through the Panama Canal. Future ships will be even bigger, exceeding 1,100 feet in width.] CN is betting heavily on Halifax with its natural deep water and ice-free port. CPR is betting that either the port of New York and New Jersey or Baltimore will be home to the majority of Maersk-Sea-Land business. Although both the Baltimore and New York ports will require dredging to accommodate post-Panamax vessels with drafts of 14-15 metres, their proximity to the major eastern markets makes them attractive.

              
Canadian railways are increasingly looking south to increase their business. It may surprise some readers, but Chicago is the key link needed to support continued growth of both major Canadian railways. Chicago is the most important connection node between the eastern and western U.S. railways, and almost 50 per cent of the country's intermodal rail shipments originate, terminate or connect there. It is home to 23 major truck-rail intermodal terminals, accounting for over 10,000 container transfers per day. Any major land bridge between the Pacific and the Atlantic is almost certain to pass through this city.

T1  - Structuring change: Exploring the potential of a greenway at Omand's Creek, Winnipeg
AN  - 304546775
AB  - Alternative open space design strategies need to be sought which work in concert with those qualities of a landscape which contribute to its inherent sense of place. Traditional planning strategies at Omand's Creek in Winnipeg have recently seen this area evolving from an industrial locale into a typical, big-box retail superstore site. Barely a shade of what it used to be, the waterway has become merely an industrial drainage ditch, with little benefit for wildlife or recreational opportunities. Traditional notions of park space development places islands of parks within the urban fabric, unconnected and unrelated to one another, few and far between.    Greenway design is a recent movement that brings together nature, recreation and the potential to re-think the way cities and green spaces are put together. Re-integrating nature as a greenway at Omand's Creek explores the exciting potential of the revitalisation of the creek, the reuse of the railway corridor, enhancement of the existing park spaces at Bluestem and Westview, and future linkages to the regional context. As well, as a means of urban design, a greenway may resolve the area's changing and temporal land uses and natural and pedestrian activities. A framework is illustrated which will allow for change to continue to occur on the site as it continues to evolve.

T1  - Banff town expansion rejected [as indicated in recommendations of Banff-Bow Valley Task Force]
AN  - 218748795
AB  - In the latest step in an ongoing struggle to maintain some ecological integrity in the popular core of Banff National Park, federal Heritage Minister Sheila Copps has blocked a proposal for significant expansion of Banff's town site. Banff town council had proposed a new Community Plan that would have allowed for an additional 80,000 square metres of commercial development -- equivalent to 25 percent of the town's present size. Copps instructed the council to create a new plan that solves housing shortages first. Copps' decision is consistent with a commitment made in October 1996 not to allow any further expansion of commercial development in the park. That commitment was made in response to the findings of the Banff recommendations on future protection and development in the Banff-Bow Valley corridor. The Banff town site on the Bow River is in the valley-bottom montane ecoregion. With a relatively mild climate, abundant vegetation and a great diversity of wildlife, the ecoregion is ecologically priceless but also especially attractive to humans.

T1  - Preserving while observing [at Banff, Jasper, Yoho and Kootenay parks]
AN  - 212917604
AB  - SAHA began by performing environmental audits of its hostels, noting where each one was meeting or falling short of the IYHF standards in each of these categories. SAHA also developed a list of short-, mid- and long-term actions that will reduce the hostels  impact on the environment of Banff park and help reduce visitors  impact as well. Karen Alexander, the Lake Louise hostel's person responsible for the environmental initiative, notes the hostel recently began using a worm-composting system to reduce organic waste (park regulations regarding feeding of animals make conventional composting almost impossible). The hostel also recycles all materials currently accepted in the town of Banff (and pays to have them shipped there), and regularly sets up car pools for the organized day hikes offered. In June 1997, an ecotourism management student studied the hostels on a three week work placement, offering suggestions and addressing the concerns of each hostel manager.              One of the most ambitious biodiversity preservation programs in North America is the Yellowstone to Yukon (Y2Y) project, a coalition of over 80 groups in Canada and the United States. Y2Y s plan is to build and maintain a life-sustaining series of key protected reserves and connecting wildlife movement corridors, using  informed advocacy and science with a mission,  in the words of Banff Y2Y member Bart Robinson, to accomplish this goal. This 1.2 million square kilometre area includes all four mountain parks plus many Alberta and British Columbia provincial parks, private lands and crown lands.

T1  - Riverine wetland function and human-induced ecological disturbance: A watershed perspective
AN  - 304404726
AB  - This dissertation evaluated the relationship between human-induced ecological disturbance and riverine wetland function at a watershed level. Specifically, it addressed the hypothesis that as human-induced ecological disturbance increases riverine wetland functional capacity decreases. The use of a watershed perspective was assessed, as was the Hydrogeomorphic Approach (HGM). The HGM method evaluates wetland function to meet the technical and programmatic requirements of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. HGM is based on the factors that influence how a wetland functions--geomorphic setting, water source, and hydrodynamics. Brinson et al.'s (1995) HGM guidebook for riverine wetlands (HGM-Riverine) was used as the framework for investigating the wetland functional capacity in two small watersheds located in eastern Missouri. HGM-Riverine defines fifteen functions that are categorized as hydrologic, biogeochemical, and habitat functions. It also determines the index of function for a riverine wetland based on the fifteen functions. Nine of the fifteen functions and the index of function proved significant. These functions were long-term surface water storage, moderation of groundwater flow or discharge, nutrient cycling, removal of elements and compounds, characteristic plant communities, spatial structure of habitat, interspersion and connectivity, distribution and abundance of invertebrates, distribution and abundance of vertebrates. For the ecological disturbance tests, the two watersheds were compared based on their population dynamics and land use. Wild Horse Creek watershed and Caulk's Creek watershed are of similar size and terrain, but have contrasting ecological disturbance regimes. Wild Horse Creek is relatively rural and undisturbed while Caulk's Creek is experiencing rapid urbanization as part of the westward expansion of the St. Louis metropolitan area into the City of Wildwood. The tests showed a significant difference in the ecological disturbance factors between the two watersheds. In sum, the research results revealed that Wild Horse Creek's watershed had greater riverine wetland functional capacity and less manifestation of human-induced ecological disturbance than Caulk's Creek's watershed. A watershed perspective enhanced the evaluation of wetland function and ecological disturbance by showing the trends among related wetlands and landscape features. While HGM was not intended to be a watershed-based technique, the results from this dissertation support its use in that capacity.

T1  - Parks and other heritage areas in Ontario's countryside
AN  - 207673525
AB  - As used in this paper, the terminology "parks and other heritage areas", or simply "heritage areas", corresponds generally with the definition for "protected areas" used by the World Conservation Union's Commission on National Parks and Protected Areas (IUCN/CNPPA). Essentially parks and heritage areas include all areas protected by legal or customary means "to fulfil private, local, national and international responsibilities in marine and terrestrial protection; and to recognize, protect and present, both directly and indirectly, places which are significant examples of the world's heritage in ways that encourage public understanding, appreciation, enjoyment and use of this heritage in a sustainable manner". (TFC/CNPPA 1990).

              
The evolution of this heritage estate, now combined with new ideas in conservation biology, landscape ecology and ecosystem management, is forcing recognition of the need to take a more comprehensive systemic view of the design and protection of parks and heritage areas. The ideas of representation and integrity, as promoted by the Canadian Council on Ecological Areas (Gauthier et al 1995; Gauthier 1992), World Wildlife Fund Canada (Noss 1995; Kavanagh and lacobelli no date), and others (Riley and [Pat Mohr] 1994; Noss 1992), offer cornerstones for protected area systems, that prompt a multi - jurisdictional view of parks and heritage areas based on a common framework to which all areas and all jurisdictions contribute. This multi jurisdictional view sees a network of parks and heritage areas carefully designed at a landscape scale to insure that all elements are adequately represented, and all ecological processes are maintained to sustain the system. Without losing sight of the core areas, today's perspective places equal attention on critical linkages, corridors and ecological processes. Figure 2 depicts one such systemic view, illustrating protected nodes linked by natural corridors, not unlike the connectivity of organs by pulmonary or circulatory system in an organism. Developed to this level, parks and heritage systems assume a central importance in defining and protecting what is colloquially recognized as "countryside" by local communities and citizens.

              
Today, in Ontario, different jurisdictions involved in parks and heritage areas are finding convergent paths that contribute to countryside conservation. On one front, the notion of greater park ecosystem, being advanced by Parks Canada and other conservation bodies, seeks to extend the influence of national parks and other protected areas through the mitigation of trans - boundary stressors and the maintenance of surrounding ecological features and processes essential to sustain an area's ecological integrity ([Bill Stephenson] 1996). From a provincial perspective, Ontario Parks and the Ministry of Natural Resources continue to utilize a complementary systems framework that seeks to represent the ecological diversity of 13 site regions and 65 site districts (Figure 3) within a system of parks and protected areas (McCleary et al 1992). And at a regional level, conservation authorities and municipalities apply planning and regulatory controls that help to protect heritage areas and maintain broader landscape integrity. Many of these regional authorities have instituted environmental advisory committees which solicit community - based input in the course of advising elected officials on environmental matters including heritage conservation. On the landscape, these efforts yield a mosaic of dedicated core areas, nested in larger heritage systems that are feathered into working landscapes (Figure 4).

T1  - [Riparian landscapes]
AN  - 207673181
AB  - [George O. Malanson]'s book is the more comprehensive and theoretical of the two. The focus is on the value of the ideas and method of landscape ecology in understanding and to a lesser extent, in planning and managing riparian areas. In the spirit of the Cambridge Studies in Ecology Series, Malanson presents a wide - ranging and relatively current review of the application of landscape ecology to riparian areas. In so doing he reviews the history of the development of landscape ecology, links the ideas and methods to riparian topics, structures and processes, and eventually to forest, grassland and other ecoregions, channel dynamics, community structure and patterns, edge effects, soil moisture, flooding and other relevant topics. Considerable space is devoted to disturbance and its effects on landforms, and biological communities. Sections of the book are also devoted to corridors, plant dispersal, landscape reproduction and modeling. Overall, the Malanson book is a good general introduction to riparian landscapes from the perspective of landscape ecology. However, it does not devote much attention to riparian wildlife and to the role of riparian areas and landscape ecology in wildlife conservation. In this sense the book is oriented more to the approaches that geographers usually take than to those of more wildlife or biologically oriented scientists, scholars and professionals.

T1  - Juvenile coho salmon habitat utilization and distribution in a suburban watershed: The Salmon River (Langley, British Columbia)
AN  - 231621316
AB  - I investigated juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) distribution and habitat utilization in an agricultural/urban watershed, the Salmon River, Langley, B.C. The results of my empirical work confirmed the importance of instream woody debris and undercut banks in coho distribution. I examined experimentally how juvenile coho select among patches that differ in foraging profitability and in cover availability. Ideal free distribution (IFD) models were used as the practical basis for hypotheses about habitat choice by coho salmon. My experiments were conducted in artificial stream channels and involved two different types of cover, instream and overhead, and two spatial scales. The two scales (patches within individual pools and pools within stream reaches) were used to detect the effect of different levels of sampling and information processing by the fish. Juvenile coho responded positively to food abundance both within and between pools, but they did not do it as predicted by the IFD model. Cover presence further deviated coho distribution from an IFD. Within pools, coho foraged in open patches away from cover, but preferred pools with cover when choosing between separate units. None of the alternative dispersion models that I considered, derived from the IFD, fully explained the observed dispersion patterns. Coho's ability to maximize food intake rate was not only affected by the physical complexity of their habitat, but also by intraspecific competition and interference. Subsequently, I investigated experimentally coho's response to food and different densities of woody debris in natural stream reaches. If food was abundant, coho favoured pools with sparse cover, which offers accessible refuge and leaves unobstructed foraging patches where prey and perhaps also predators are easy to detect. Pools with either high densities or total lack of woody debris attracted to proportionately less fish. Earlier in the summer, fry were indifferent towards cover, but as they became older their association with instream woody debris increased. Experiments I conducted during winter indicated that velocity and temperature affected juvenile coho downstream movement. The proportion of fish that tried to leave the experimental channel increased with water discharge and decreased with water temperature.    Based on the results of my empirical and experimental work, and on information derived from comparative case studies, I evaluated the potential impact of agriculture and urbanization on coho salmon habitat. Activities associated with these types of land developments tend to: (a) reduce stream channel complexity; (b) eliminate off-channel fish habitat; (c) increase both the magnitude and the frequency of peak flows; (d) augment water sediment transport; (e) alter riparian vegetation; and, (f) degrade water quality.    A multilayered management plan, aimed at increasing coho salmon production, was developed. The plan's management strategies were devised reflecting on the different spatial scales that watershed components have and on the connectivity processes that exist among them.

T1  - Changes in the landscape: Natives, Spaniards, and the ecological restructuration of central Veracruz, Mexico, during the sixteenth century
AN  - 304228761
AB  - The intersection of Old and New Worlds in 1492 rejoined two ecosystems, largely isolated for millennia, and resulted in ecological upheaval: a restructuration of environment, settlement, and land use. The detailed, spatial-temporal processes of that sixteenth-century, ecological restructuration remain manifest in the landscape of central Veracruz, Mexico, as revealed through a combination of geomorphological, palynological, and archival methods.    During the Prehispanic period, shifting cultivation contrasted with zones of more intensive land use. Wetland agriculture, terracing, and irrigation supported dense populations and surplus production for trade and tribute. Circa AD 500, more than four millennia of maize cultivation culminated in slope destabilization. By the Spaniards' arrival, the Natives had created a more open vegetation than the mix of savanna, shrubland, and woodland that characterizes these lowlands. The 1519 settlement pattern, comprising a population of some 500,000 people, its ethnic differentiation, and exploitation by highland states were the product of millennia of ecological processes.    By the end of the sixteenth century, Old World disease, war, and encomienda had reduced the Natives to less than one percent of the 1519 figure. The Spaniards and their African slaves occupied the central coast and a string of inns connecting the coastal entrepot to Mexico City, controlling the study region as a hinterland and transportation corridor for the Spanish state. After a transitional period of tribute extraction based on Native land uses, livestock ranching came to dominate the landscape. Despite exotic ruminants and high stocking rates, however, environmental restructuration attributable to colonial land use was limited to floristic change and some expansion of savanna at the expense of woodland. No soil erosion is evident which remotely equals that of the Prehispanic period.    Nonetheless, given the vastly different temporal scales, any comparison that might argue the relative sustainability of the sixteenth-century Spanish pastroecosystem versus several millennia of Prehispanic agroecosystems would be specious. Scholars, Natives, critical theorists, and environmentalists might still learn much about past ecologies, both Native and Spanish, in order to inform future ecological restructurations.

TT  - Landscape Ecology and Spatial Organization in River Systems: An Investigation Into the Landscape Ecology of River Systems and the Public Care Thereto in Planning and Policy
AN  - 2480830781
AB  - Landscape ecological research in the Netherlands has been fruitful because of the mutual exchange of ideas and results of fundamental and applied research. This research project has been focused on methodologies for application of fundamental landscape ecological research in planning for land use and water use with emphasis on nature conservation aspects. The object of research has been the river system, because the river system is both a fundamental landscape ecological unit and an administration unit. The theoretical concept of planning is based on the model of spatial organisation; this model has been worked out by differentiating the rather simple physical aspects into a 'spatial ecological structure'.This model is based on the idea that all species have an ecological web and that these webs together make the - natural - landscape. The main patterns and processes in the spatial ecological structure of river systems are climate and water discharge. Within this context organisms create their ecological webs and these webs together constitute the spatial ecological structure. This spatial ecological structure can be modified by man. Man-through his social organization has an important impact by ecological changes that modify the spatial ecological structure into a manmade physical organisation. It is a model of the interference between sustainability and dynamics. The spatial ecological structure has been used as the guiding principle for the landscape ecological analysis and the interference of landscape ecological processes with changes in society. Within this context the research questions have been formulated as:* the definition of the main processes in river systems that determine ecological development in time and space and its translation into guiding principles and constraints for nature conservation;* evaluation of planning and management of rivers and its related nature in the context of its objectives.To answer these questions several research projects have been carried out, that have all been published in the period 1990-1992. They concerned both questions and emphasised different aspects of the spatial ecological structure. The research projects are: Ecological classification of the climate of the Rhine catchment ( Int. J Biometeorology 1990, 34:194-203 ).In this research an ordination and classification has been carried out on the climate of the Rhine catchment based on data from meteorological stations. The objective of the classification is to provide an ecological interpretation of climate data. The climate of northern France, Belgium, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, The Federal Republic of Germany and northern Switzerland is divided into 5 classes, of which two, the atlantic and the subcontinental are subdivided further into subclasses. The climate classes can be interpreted ecologically and are correlated with floristic and vegetation data. The Rhine valley has a distinctive and characteristic climate. Interpolation of the classification has not been carried out, because of the uneven geographical spread of the sites in the dataset. The position of the Rhine valley as a separate subclass is striking. For the use of climatic data for modelling changes in climate in relation to hydrological effects, this will have minor implications, because the valley is just a section of the total drainage basin. For ecological interpretation of the Rhine catchment however, it will be of major importance, because also climatically the Rhine valley seems to function as a major ecological stream corridor in western Europe. Land use changes or climatic changes in this corridor might improve or hamper its functioning as such. Other rivers do not seem to be characterised by climatic differences in the same way and may not function as climate related stream corridors. They possibly do not have such pronounced effect on the surrounding landscape or insufficient climatic data are lacking to conclude on this.Vegetation, river management and land use in the Dutch Rhine floodplains (Regulated Rivers 1992 7(3):279-289. In this project the relation between vegetation and historical changes in ecological processes has been investigated. The floodplains of the Lower Rhine are situated in a densely populated area of The Netherlands. Although they are intensively used, the floodplains still fulfil important ecological functions. The lower Rhine is the downstream sedimentation zone of the River Rhine and its floodplains are characterised by river transported vascular flora originating from southern and eastern Europe. Using multivariate methods data from literature and field data on grasslands and former river beds have been analyzed to find trends in ecological changes. The consequence of continued sedimentation and diminished erosion is an increased drying out of the floodplains. Excavation and recultivation of former excavated land does not reverse the losses in flora and vegetation. Statistically there is a negative relationship between the characteristic dry fluvial flora and recultivated land. Also the natural transversal river gradient disappears together with its characteristic ecological diversity. Aquatic environments in the floodplains have been changed completely since the regulation works started in the 19th century. Most former river beds have disappeared by silting up. Data on short term vegetation succession confirm the long term analysis of map data.Dutch floodplain policy, regulation of landscape ecological processes ( Landschap 1992 9(l):17-29 ). In this project the relation between floodplain vegetation and the management of ecological processes has been investigated. Rivers are landscape ecological systems, characterised by dynamic processes. Floodplains are very important in the ecological functioning of the river system. The Rhine is a regulated river situated in a densely populated area. The Dutch Lower Rhine is the downstream sedimentation area of the river. Here the floodplains are strongly influenced by man during the last decades. In general there is a process of drying out going on in both the Upper Rhine and the Lower Rhine. River dynamics in the floodplains can be analyzed on basic processes as period and time of discharge, stream velocity, relative altitude and morphology. The importance of the floodplains has been recognised by all administrative levels and nature conservation and nature development has become a policy objective. To develop and execute a river floodplain policy translation of river dynamics into practical planning and management is needed. Little experience is available on the effectiveness of the means for policy execution. The available knowledge shows, that at this moment neither physical planning nor water management but only protection by Nature Conservation Law can be used to handle extreme cases.Conservation of brooks in small watersheds: a case for planning (Landscape and Urban Planning 1990 19:55-68). In this research project a simple regional water balance model has been made of the two regions in the Veluwe in order to qualify the consequences of adjacent land use and urban activities for the objectives of the National Park. Nature conservation is under stress in The Netherlands because of intensive land use and related water use. One of the main problems for the brook systems is planning of water use in order to maintain a locally high water-table. From a study of the water balance it is shown, that extraction in some parts of the research area causes water shortage for brook discharge. Water extraction is inevitable because of the dense population in the fringes of the national park. This leads to the conclusion that integration of research and co-ordination of physical planning and water use planning is needed to realise a sound nature conservation policy for this area.Landscape ecological and spatial impacts of climate change in two areas in the Netherlands (Earth surface processes and Landforms 1991 16:639-652). Possible impact of climatic change on the water balance has been analyzed for the river Dommel and the Veluwe, an area drained by many very small brooks. The water balance has been calculated for the winter and the summer period. With help of four scenarios, based on GCM's, climate data from the dry year 1976 and land use scenarios the impact of climatic change and a possible superposed effect of acid precipitation is analyzed. The results show that although the yearly changes in the water balance are small in some cases, in all cases the fluctuations in the water balance between winter and summer period increase. Changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration are multiplied in water storage and runoff. This will have an important impact on water use planning and management.River systems: a leading part in a changing climate (Milieu 1992 7(3):68-75). A review has been made of research carried out on the impact of climate change in rivers. Climate change will influence the environment in Europe not only by changes in CO 2 -content and temperature, but also by changes in hydrology. Rivers might appear to be very sensitive to climatic variability and climate change. Most important impact is expected to be a change in mean discharge, extreme events and seasonality of runoff, which can cause important changes in erosion and sedimentation in various parts of Europe, quality of both groundwater and surface water, functioning of the aquatic and semi-terrestrial ecosystems and the availability of water resources.Consequences of climate change combined with potential synergistic effects of acidification will be dealt with sooner or later through the water system in many parts of Europe. Wise use of water, based on thorough analysis of the hydrological system and international co-operation at the level of river catchments are of utmost importance for anticipation on possible changes. From this research it can be concluded, that the natural basis for planning can be considered as a spatial ecological structure made by natural ecological processes and related patterns. Such a framework can be used as a guiding principle for landscape ecological modelling and the analysis of the impact of land use changes.The concept of Ecological Main Structure as developed in The Netherlands is a policy concept. Its scientific basis can be found in the spatial ecological structure of catchments. However, for the pleistocene pail of the Netherlands it can be concluded from the analysis that the objectives of the Dutch Ecological Main Structure can only partly be reached. Natural development can best be achieved for whole catchments because of the strong interaction between all land use. A complicating factor is that all large Dutch rivers and many lowland streams originate from headwaters in other countries. This makes international co-ordination necessary. Dry grasslands in the floodplains of the major dutch rivers are significantly related with sites flooded less than two days a year and significantly not related with excavated and recultivated soils. They are severely under threat of extinction. Former river beds tend to silt up and especially the open oxbows and the tidal oxbows have disappeared. Both tendencies have important consequences for nature conservation strategy in the river area and especially for nature redevelopment projects.The use of physical planning regulations to maintain aquatic nature and wetlands has not yet been very successful, nor in planning nor in implementation and management. Intensive co-operation between the water boards and the municipalities is needed both in planning and in management of waters.The climate of the Rhine catchment can be differentiated into several types among which that of the Rhine valley. This can be of importance for research on the impact of climate change. However, it is not yet clear if other rivers have a comparable corridor.Consequences of climate change combined with potential synergistic effects of acidification will be dealt with sooner or later through the water system in many parts of Europe. Wise use of water, based on thorough analysis of the hydrological system and international co-operation at the level of river catchments are of utmost importance for anticipation on possible changes.

T1  - PROPOSED SUNRISE DOUGLAS GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT, SACRAMENTO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.
AN  - 29784935; 200704-32-080292 (CE); A06-99-023085 (AH)
AB  - PURPOSE: Rezoning 1,225 acres of land from agricultural to urban uses and filling 50.7 acres of seasonal drainages and vernal pools in Sacramento County, California, is proposed. The project site, referred to as the Sunrise Douglas site, occupies a 2.5-mile stretch along the east side of Sunrise Boulevard between Douglas Road and Kiefer Boulevard, adjacent to and east of Mather Air Force Base (AFB). Zoning for the site would provide for its development. Under the proposed project, 7,111 residential units would be constructed on 842.6 acres of land, while 42.5 acres would be dedicated to commercial use, 36.9 acres to industrial use, and 303.5 acres to open space. Activities pursuant to the rezoning plan would include major water system improvements, an amendment to the sphere of influence boundary to provide wastewater service to the site, construction of a new wastewater interceptor, financing of approximately four schools in the Elk Grove Unified School District, and modification of the Sacramento Regional Transit District boundaries. The impacts mitigation plan that would be implemented in association with the rezoning and development of the tract would include provisions for erosion and sediment control, runoff detention, landscaping, and the use of vegetated swales to convey drainage. Other mitigation measures would be provided to deal with hazardous wastes, climate and air quality, noise abatement, biological resources, land uses and aesthetics, public services and facilities, and transportation services management. POSITIVE IMPACTS: In addition to providing additional affordable housing and associated industrial and commercial employment opportunities in the Sacramento area, development of the tract would be consistent with the County of Sacramento General Plan as well as other building goals developed by the county. Residential use of the site would result in fewer traffic impacts than would residential development at other available sites. The project would allow for densities adequate to support mass transit facilities. NEGATIVE IMPACTS: Wetlands within the site would change from natural to artificial in character. The 50.7 acres of wetlands to be filled include 320 vernal pools covering 35.4 acres, 9.2 acres of wetland swales, 2.4 acres of intermittent streams, and 3.7 acres of artificial ponds. Approximately 922 acres of open space would be displaced, and ambient air quality would decline due to emissions from developed uses. Eleven special-status plant populations would be lost, and an American badger den would be eliminated. Developments at the site would generate traffic that would contribute to congestion along the Highway 50 corridor. The influx of population into the rezoned, developed area would require substantial commitment to providing public services and infrastructure to support residential, commercial, and industrial uses. The growth pattern would have no logical artificial or natural boundary and, hence, would be likely to proceed to the county border. Odors from the Sacramento Rendering Company would affect future residents, and the company would generally conflict with residential uses at the site. Noise generated by the operation of aircraft at nearby Mather AFB would also be incompatible with residential uses.

AB  - High-speed ground transportation requires new vehicles for movement of people and goods providing designers with opportunities for fresh concepts for containing and expediting this movement. Further evolution will require separation of bulk goods and people movement in high-density corridors where the air glide train will be introduced on its own special set of tracks. Even when new guideways must be built, the roadway width required will be limited, 40 feet in contrast to a minimum of 100 feet for a 4-lane superhighway of limited capacity and safety. Segmental precast concrete is the ideal material, textured and shaded to blend with the dominant natural or man-made color tones along the routes. Impacts of high-speed ground transportation will be felt in mountain areas in terms of wildlife disturbed, vegetation destroyed, land form scarred, and vistas intercepted. However, such a system will encourage the development of new communities and will provide a linkage between population centers which should improve the quality of life and its attendant mobility.
