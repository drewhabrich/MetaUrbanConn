T1  - Urban forest invertebrates: how they shape and respond to the urban environment
AN  - 2748911262
AB  - Invertebrates comprise the most diversified animal group on Earth. Due to their long evolutionary history and small size, invertebrates occupy a remarkable range of ecological niches, and play an important role as “ecosystem engineers” by structuring networks of mutualistic and antagonistic ecological interactions in almost all terrestrial ecosystems. Urban forests provide critical ecosystem services to humans, and, as in other systems, invertebrates are central to structuring and maintaining the functioning of urban forests. Identifying the role of invertebrates in urban forests can help elucidate their importance to practitioners and the public, not only to preserve biodiversity in urban environments, but also to make the public aware of their functional importance in maintaining healthy greenspaces. In this review, we examine the multiple functional roles that invertebrates play in urban forests that contribute to ecosystem service provisioning, including pollination, predation, herbivory, seed and microorganism dispersal and organic matter decomposition, but also those that lead to disservices, primarily from a public health perspective, e.g., transmission of invertebrate-borne diseases. We then identify a number of ecological filters that structure urban forest invertebrate communities, such as changes in habitat structure, increased landscape imperviousness, microclimatic changes and pollution. We also discuss the complexity of ways that forest invertebrates respond to urbanisation, including acclimation, local extinction and evolution. Finally, we present management recommendations to support and conserve viable and diverse urban forest invertebrate populations into the future.

T1  - Seasonal shedding of coronavirus by straw-colored fruit bats at urban roosts in Africa
AN  - 2714862066
AB  - The straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) is a pteropodid whose conservation is crucial for maintaining functional connectivity of plant populations in tropical Africa. Land conversion has pushed this species to adapt to roosting in urban centers across its range. These colonies often host millions of individuals, creating intensive human-bat contact interfaces that could facilitate the spillover of coronaviruses shed by these bats. A better understanding of coronavirus dynamics in these roosts is needed to identify peak times of exposure risk in order to propose evidence-based management that supports safe human-bat coexistence, as well as the conservation of this chiropteran. We studied the temporal patterns of coronavirus shedding in E. helvum, by testing thousands of longitudinally-collected fecal samples from two spatially distant urban roosts in Ghana and Tanzania. Shedding of coronaviruses peaked during the second part of pup weaning in both roosts. Assuming that coronavirus shedding is directly related to spillover risk, our results indicate that exposure mitigation should target reducing contact between people and E. helvum roosts during the pup “weaning” period. This recommendation can be applied across the many highly-populated urban sites occupied by E. helvum across Africa.

T1  - Density of marmosets in highly urbanised areas and the positive effect of arboreous vegetation
AN  - 2621425458
AB  - City life is harsh and inhospitable for many animal species, particularly for non-volant mammals that face increased mortality risks in urban settings. Yet, studies on non-volant city mammals are limited and mostly restricted to temperate regions. Here, I evaluated the density and adaptability of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a species with a series of advantageous pre-adaptations that could facilitate city life, in highly built up urban environments of a tropical city Joao Pessoa (>800,000 people), in NE Brazil. I surveyed a total of 56 streets from seven randomly chosen districts within the city. I used multiple linear regression to determine the factors that could influence marmoset abundance. I found a total of 53 tree species of which half could be used as food resources. To reach food resources marmosets moved along and crossed streets using insulated power lines and phone cables. Marmoset density (66.9 ind/km2) was significantly low compared to populations inhabiting forest remnants. Nevertheless, along streets with high canopy cover, their density was similar to that reported for forest fragments. Canopy cover and trees providing food resources were key predictors of marmoset abundance. The presence of an exotic tree species (Terminalia catappa) that provides gum, showed to be key for groups persisting in extremely urbanized areas. Planting more of this species and increasing connectivity between forested areas are management strategies that might help long term persistence of marmosets in highly built up areas. Marmosets are common in Brazilian cities and could provide opportunities for contact with nature and increased well-being of human urban dwellers.

T1  - What Is the Potential to Increase Local Biodiversity in Semi-Urban Amenity Grasslands Through Meadow Constructions?
AN  - 2685710200
AB  - The loss of biodiversity worldwide and methods of prevention are hot subjects receiving increased interest in todays’ research. Meadow construction in urban areas has been the focus of recent studies to increase both local and global biodiversity. In my report, I address potential analyses to conduct in advance before practical meadow constructions in a landscape. The subject I chose to focus on for this report was a LONA-project aimed to construct meadows on contemporary amenity grasslands in a semi-urban municipality. I used vegetation data from an inventory executed in 2021. Patches were in advance classified based on conditions observed during the inventory with class 1 obtaining the highest meadow potential, class 2 obtaining mediocre potential, and class 3 weak or no potential. I analysed vegetation data on species richness, environmental indicator values, and composition. Additionally, I analysed the soil types and historical land uses in the study area to display credible soil characteristics. The order of Lepidoptera was used as a model taxon for pollinators and the red-listed Marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia) was separately analysed for conservational purposes. To illustrate the landscapes’ ability to facilitate the dispersal of butterflies, connectivity analyses of varying meadow construction scenarios were executed. Results indicate higher species richness on average per patch and more indicator species in class 1, suggesting a better starting point and making quality assessments more credible in comparison to class 2. Underlaying soil type seems to some extent to influence the meadow potential by affecting vegetation composition and hence butterfly occurrence in terms of host plant distribution. I could however not draw any conclusions from the effect of historical land use on current patch classifications, and consequently meadow potential. To facilitate for E. aurinia to widen its distribution in the study area, and to avoid local extinction, further conservational efforts should focus on mimicking the conditions and current management of the powerline corridor, that currently yields high diversity of butterflies and abundance of E. aurinia, to other powerline corridors in the study area. To facilitate dispersal of butterflies and other pollinators, target meadow areas of both class 1 and class 2 patches should be constructed to avoid patch isolation, as illustrated in the connectivity analyses. Further research is needed to investigate other factors possibly affecting suitability of grasslands for meadow construction.

T1  - Nomadic animal movement and infectious disease in changing landscapes
AN  - 2582825014; 2021-80518-232
AB  - Animal movements are an essential component of individual fitness and population dynamics, and also affect species interactions, community composition, and ecosystem functioning. Long-distance animal movements, such as migration and nomadism, are particularly important for community and ecosystem processes, including the dispersal and transmission of infectious diseases. Spatio-temporal patterns in resources (e.g., food, water, habitat) are key drivers of these long-distance movements. Human activities such as urbanization, agricultural development, and climate change alter the quantity and stability of resources available to wildlife, which can in turn alter the distance and frequency of animal movements. Understanding the interactions between landscape change, animal movement, and infectious disease transmission is crucial for informing wildlife conservation and public health in changing landscapes. In this dissertation, I focus on nomadic animal movements, which are irregular long-distance movements with little seasonal signature. First, I review the literature on nomadic movements and describe their prevalence across space and taxa; their general patterns and drivers; and their potential impacts on communities and ecosystems. Next, I build a mathematical model of nomadic animal movements in both naturally-varying and human-altered landscapes to understand the rules that animals might use when deciding when to move, and the effects of urbanization on animals moving according to different rules. I then extend this model to explore the consequences of changing movement patterns for infectious disease transmission in urbanizing landscapes. Finally, I apply this framework to two real-world systems. I analyze GPS tracking data from American white ibis (Eudocimus albus) in South Florida, USA, to understand how individual movement patterns scale up to affect habitat connectivity between urban and nonurban patches. I also perform a comparative analysis using a database of host-parasite associations to understand the relationship between movement patterns (resident, nomadic, or migratory) and parasite diversity in ungulates. Collectively, this research demonstrates that, for nomadic animals, movement forms a crucial link between landscape change and infectious disease transmission in wildlife; however, these effects are complex and their direction depends on the drivers and cues of movement. This work also provides multiple frameworks and avenues for further understanding the ecological effects of wildlife responses to human development.

T1  - Parrots and the city: modeling potential corridors in an urban environment
AN  - 2586664111
AB  - Urbanization is a worldwide problem affecting wildlife negatively. Cities cause habitat suppression, fragmentation, among other disease spreading, suitable conditions for exotic species, and direct animal kills—consequently, local native species might be extinct. Still, urban areas can also provide biodiversity maintenance because some species can be adapted to the urban environment. Here, we assess how the urban environment influences the displacement of native turquoise-fronted Amazon (Amazona aestiva). We created a map of environmental suitability to modeling A. aestiva displacement routes among three protected areas in Brasilia, Brazil. We tested (1) if the modeled corridors tend to be near to the areas where A. aestiva occurs and (2) how landscape spatial heterogeneity influences those modeled routes. We expected to observe oriented routes in homogeneous areas (few pixels with high-frequency selection), and the opposite in heterogeneous areas. To test our hypotheses, we recorded A. aestiva and correlated its presence/absence with the modeled corridors and correlated the landscape spatial heterogeneity with different metrics of the modeled corridors. Our results indicate that at least one of the modeled routes was near to the points with parrots. In general, potential dispersal routes with little spatial variation occurred in homogeneous areas. In the urban matrix, potential routes were less oriented with more spatial variation. Our results suggest the adoption of different strategies to manage the natural environment in an urban matrix. By managing the spatial heterogeneity, it is possible to direct how the species use the space, promoting the displacement to desired areas, avoiding the more urbanized ones.

T1  - Gender differences in traditional knowledge of useful plants in a Brazilian community
AN  - 2555946153
AB  - Genders differ in traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) about plants, but how gender influences TEK sharing is still poorly understood. Here, we examined how gender is associated with the diversity, transmission, and structure of TEK. We tested whether women and men differ in terms of plant knowledge (species richness, α-diversity), knowledge heterogeneity (β-diversity), and in the structure of social-ecological networks they form. The study was carried out in a suburban community in the city of Ouro Preto, Southeastern, Brazil. Using the snow-ball technique, semi-structured interviews, guided tours, and participant observation, we gathered information from 33 women and 33 men in the community. We collected information about their culture, social-economic profiles, and plant knowledge from which we identified 291 plant species in 10 use categories. Overall, our results indicated that the cognition and sharing of ethnobotanical knowledge are structured by gender. Women rated better in their plant knowledge repertory (greater α-diversity), while plant knowledge among men was more heterogeneous (greater β-diversity), suggesting less information sharing among them. We observed that the network among women is more connected, exhibited greater information sharing, with a greater number of central individuals, who likely provide the cohesion and maintenance of TEK in the community. Our findings indicate how social-ecological networks can provide insights and information to unveil social patterns of knowledge transmission. Understanding how TEK is fostered and shared among community members will favor better planning of ethnobotanical studies, as well as inform decision-makers about strategies for the conservation of plant TEK.

T1  - Green infrastructures and ecological corridors shape avian biodiversity in a small French city
AN  - 2519144350
AB  - In the context of increasing urbanization, preserving urban biodiversity has become a priority because biodiversity appears to be a key element when evaluating the well-being of urban residents. Recently, urban management has relied on a ‘renaturing’ strategy to improve biodiversity, but the benefits of these policies remain debated. In this study, we evaluated the effects of urban land use and green corridors on (1) urban avian biodiversity, and (2) the presence of the most common (top 70%) and least common (bottom 30%) bird species. We surveyed bird diversity at 102 sites during the Spring in a small French city, and performed a PCA on several habitat structures (e.g. roads, houses, grassy areas) to determine the level of urbanization of each site. Then, we tested with GLMMs the effects of land use (PC1), distance to the edge of the city, and distance to the corridor on bird diversity. We found a positive effect of green infrastructures on bird species richness, and this effect was reinforced by the proximity to the green corridor. Thus, bird species richness and the presence of common species were positively impacted by the presence of green areas, the proximity to the city edge and the proximity to the green corridor. The presence of the green corridor contributed significantly to the presence of rare species, which emphasizes its role in promoting avian biodiversity. Green corridors are a key element of the urban landscape because they allow less common species to colonize cities, and thus enhance urban biodiversity.

T1  - The effects of water chemistry and lock-mediated connectivity on macroinvertebrate diversity and community structure in a canal in northern England
AN  - 2519143953
AB  - Freshwater ecosystems are under threat from habitat loss, partly due to urban expansion. However, some elements of urban freshwaters are already integral parts of the urban landscape and so are more resilient to loss, representing opportunities for the enhancement of freshwater resources within cities. This study investigated the biodiversity value of the Leeds-Liverpool Canal in Leeds, UK, in relation to its landscape context. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that (i) biodiversity value is lowest nearest to the urban core, and (ii) the pattern of canal locks structured ecological communities. Nutrients, metals and dissolved carbon all existed at relatively low concentrations, contrary to what is often seen in urban water bodies, although concentrations were higher in the urban core. This gradient of chemical stress was associated with a decline in macroinvertebrate diversity towards the city centre, which manifested as pollution-sensitive taxa being excluded from this area. Community structures were found to vary between groups of sampling sites separated by locks, suggesting that locks may act as barriers for aquatic invertebrates by restricting dispersal. The results in this study indicate that canals in urban areas can be high-quality habitats, despite the associated anthropogenic stressors, and locks may represent a unique model for researching relationships between connectivity and community structure.

T1  - Medium and large mammal conservation in the City of Cape Town: factors influencing species richness in urban nature reserves
AN  - 2507364863
AB  - Urbanisation is associated with the loss and fragmentation of natural land, the disruption of ecosystem functioning and services, and the loss of biodiversity. Cape Town is situated in a global biodiversity hotspot, with high rates of endemism, but both agricultural and housing demands are increasing pressure on remaining patches of natural land and consequently the biodiversity they support. The aims of this study were to use a standardised camera trap survey to determine which native medium and large mammal species still survive in 12 City of Cape Town (CCT) municipal reserves (range 32–8400 ha), and to understand how reserve size, area-perimeter ratio, connectivity, habitat heterogeneity and presence of permanent freshwater aquatic habitat might influence medium and large mammal (>0.5 kg) community composition. Cameras were placed at 151 locations across all reserves using a stratified placement protocol that resulted in 13,360 independent trigger events by targeted taxa. Nineteen native species (11 carnivores, 7 herbivores, 1 omnivore) were recorded, which is 49% of the 39 species believed to have been present historically. Species richness varied from 1 to 12 species (mean ± SD = 7 ± 3.6) across reserves, and linear models showed that higher species richness and the presence of large carnivores was best explained by improved connectivity to large amounts of natural habitat. It is recommended that maintaining biodiversity in urban reserves will be best achieved by preserving and establishing corridors of suitable habitat that allow for the movement of animals to and from other patches.

T1  - Essays in the Non-Separability Between Environmental Resources and Human Nutrition, and the Role of Markets in Mitigating the Linkage: Evidence from Malawi and Nepal
AN  - 2713237311
AB  - In these essays, I study the soil-to-human mineral transmission and the role of markets in mitigating the linkages in the context of Nepal and Malawi in the first two chapters. And, in the last chapter I explore the adverse impact of rural connectivity on children's unhealthy dietary habits in rural Nepal.
The first chapter examines the negative child health impacts of soil zinc (Zn) deficiency in Nepal. Soil Zn deficiency limits the Zn concentration in food crops, leading many to speculate that it underlies human Zn deficiency and child stunting, globally and particularly in South Asia. We find strong evidence that soil Zn deficiency does have a causal impact on child stunting in Nepal's Tarai region, the breadbasket of the country. Using conservative causal bounds, we find that a 1 part per million increase in plant-available soil Zn --- achievable with application of Zn-enriched fertilizer --- decreases child stunting by 9-10 percentage points in the long run, and 4-7 percentage points in the short run. Multiple statistical sensitivity tests indicate that these relationship are not manufactured by omitted, relevant variables. The association is strongest in the most isolated areas and in seasons where dependence on food crops is strongest, as expected if soil Zn deficiency reduces local crop Zn concentration and through that human Zn intake and status.
The second chapter investigates the linkage between human selenium (Se) status and the local vs nearby market Se environment, and the role of markets in mitigating the linkage in Malawi. Using nationally representative data on human micronutrient concentration and gridded data on soil characteristics, we find that local soil type (with implications for crop Se concentration) and proximity to Lake Malawi (which holds Se-rich fish) are strongly predictive of human Se status. Furthermore, markets seem to aggregate Se from their catchment area and supply that Se to nearby families. Human Se intake and status therefore appears to depend on both the hyper-local environmental availability of Se and the availability of Se around their nearest market.
The globalization of food markets is accompanied by a nutritional and epidemiological transition in developing countries — often manifest as increased dietary diversity but also increased consumption of sugars and fats and an accompanying increase in obesity and diabetes. The last chapter examines how improved rural connectivity catalyzes the nutritional transition among rural households in Nepal. Recent large-scale road and bridge construction concentrated in the urban areas has also dramatically connected rural with urban areas, historically isolated due to Nepal’s dramatic topography. Working with OpenStreetMap data, I identify plausibly exogenous reductions in travel time between rural communities and major cities due to the \textit{non-local} construction. I find that the improved rural connectivity to the closest food trading city or Kathmandu improves child dietary diversity score, mainly through increased consumption of legumes and nuts. At the same time, however, the rural connectivity to Kathmandu, the city where majority of junk foods are produced and distributed, rather increases child junk food consumption and child wasting accordingly, with no evidence on stunting. Therefore, the overall impact of the improved rural connectivity appears to be negative.

T1  - Resource Selection and Landscape Connectivity of the Ocelot <em>(Leopardus pardalis)</em> in Southern Texas
AN  - 2617045244
AB  - Wildlife species across the globe are faced with landscapes that are becoming increasingly difficult to traverse because of habitat loss and degradation. Roadway networks are widespread and significant anthropogenic influences on the landscape that can have profound impacts on wildlife populations. Understanding how organisms perceive barriers to movement, or landscape resistance, is important for the conservation and management of wildlife populations threatened by habitat fragmentation and loss. The ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) is an endangered felid in the United States, with remnant populations in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of southern Texas. An estimated 95% of native Tamaulipan thornshrub had been cleared for agriculture and urban development which has led to the LRGV being classified as one of the most rapidly developing urban areas in the United States today. This development corresponded to an increase in road collisions and a decrease in available habitat for ocelots. To guide efforts to mitigate ocelot road mortalities, I have modeled probability of landscape use by ocelots as a function of environmental resources (e.g., vegetation cover) and road characteristics at the individual and population level. I modeled resource selection from animal location data collected via VHF and GPS radio collars from 1982–2017. I quantified spatio-temporal consistent habitat for ocelots compared to land ownership. I evaluated differences in individual behavior to habitat and road variables using functional response analyses. I evaluated potential movement pathways between habitat patches and across roads based on landscape resistance scenarios using spatially absorbing Markov chains. This project will inform the placement of future road crossing structures to decrease ocelot-vehicle collisions and increase landscape permeability for this endangered species. This information will assist Texas Department of Transportation with ocelot conservation objectives.

T1  - Evolution and Ecology of Urban Pigeons (<em>Columba livia</em>) in Northeastern North America
AN  - 2572620583
AB  - Urbanization is drastically changing landscapes across the globe leading to changes in the ecological and evolutionary dynamics within cities. This urban landscape change may restrict, facilitate, or have no effect on gene flow, depending on the organism and extent of urbanization. In human commensals, with high dispersal ability, urbanization can facilitate gene flow by providing continuous suitable habitat across a wide range. Additionally, suburban or rural areas with lower human population density may act as a barrier to gene flow for these human commensals. Spatial population genetic approaches provide a means to understand genetic connectivity across geographically expansive areas that encompass multiple metropolitan areas. Here, I examined the spatial genetic patterns of feral pigeons (Columba livia) living in cities in the Northeastern United States. I focused my sampling on the Northeastern megacity, which is a region covering six large cities (Boston, Providence, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, DC). I performed ddRAD‐Seq on 473 samples. My analysis detected higher‐than‐expected gene flow under an isolation by distance model within each city. I conclude that the extreme urbanization characteristic of the Northeastern megacity is likely facilitating gene flow in pigeons. Additionally, spatial genetic patterns may diverge between cities as food accessibility, nesting site availability, and eradication policies differ. Pigeon hobbyists (people who collect, breed, trade, and race pigeons) also vary by region leading to differing degrees of public tolerance for pigeons and impacting the spatial genetic patterns. Fancy and racing pigeons display a variety of characters which are often seen in the feral population, suggesting that these breeds may partially contribute to feral populations. I found that pigeon population structure is influenced by continued introduction of racing/fancy pigeons and the local conditions including attitudes towards pigeons, management practices, and food availability. Furthermore, variation in behavioral traits is especially important in novel habitats where selection forces determine successful colonizers. Prey species must constantly balance the risk versus reward of remaining in an area with threats while gaining possible fitness benefits. Flight initiation distance, the distance at which an animal flees when approached by a human, is a common metric used to assess habituation to stressors and risk behavior. I examined the flight initiation distance of pigeons across New York City, USA. I then assessed this behavioral response across the landscape with respect to multiple urbanization factors related to human activity, the abiotic environment, and the ecological community. I found that flight initiation distance in pigeons decreased with increased human activity demonstrating that pigeon behavior varies with urbanization, human activity, and ecological attributes. Since behavioral changes are often the most rapid phenotypic response to change, this study demonstrates that pigeons are responding to anthropogenic stressors, which may set the stage for adaptive changes. Overall this research demonstrates that urban landscape heterogeneity may contribute to variable spatial genetic and behavioral responses across a single city, therefore researchers must examine patters at different spatial scales. Moreover, organisms such as pigeons that depend on humans, exhibit fine-scale spatial genetic structure that reflects human patterns and distributions, stressing the importance of sampling across urban areas.

T1  - Nomadic Animal Movement and Infectious Disease in Changing Landscapes
AN  - 2551569727
AB  - Animal movements are an essential component of individual fitness and population dynamics, and also affect species interactions, community composition, and ecosystem functioning. Long-distance animal movements, such as migration and nomadism, are particularly important for community and ecosystem processes, including the dispersal and transmission of infectious diseases. Spatio-temporal patterns in resources (e.g., food, water, habitat) are key drivers of these long-distance movements. Human activities such as urbanization, agricultural development, and climate change alter the quantity and stability of resources available to wildlife, which can in turn alter the distance and frequency of animal movements. Understanding the interactions between landscape change, animal movement, and infectious disease transmission is crucial for informing wildlife conservation and public health in changing landscapes. In this dissertation, I focus on nomadic animal movements, which are irregular long-distance movements with little seasonal signature. First, I review the literature on nomadic movements and describe their prevalence across space and taxa; their general patterns and drivers; and their potential impacts on communities and ecosystems. Next, I build a mathematical model of nomadic animal movements in both naturally-varying and human-altered landscapes to understand the rules that animals might use when deciding when to move, and the effects of urbanization on animals moving according to different rules. I then extend this model to explore the consequences of changing movement patterns for infectious disease transmission in urbanizing landscapes. Finally, I apply this framework to two real-world systems. I analyze GPS tracking data from American white ibis (Eudocimus albus) in South Florida, USA, to understand how individual movement patterns scale up to affect habitat connectivity between urban and nonurban patches. I also perform a comparative analysis using a database of host-parasite associations to understand the relationship between movement patterns (resident, nomadic, or migratory) and parasite diversity in ungulates. Collectively, this research demonstrates that, for nomadic animals, movement forms a crucial link between landscape change and infectious disease transmission in wildlife; however, these effects are complex and their direction depends on the drivers and cues of movement. This work also provides multiple frameworks and avenues for further understanding the ecological effects of wildlife responses to human development.

T1  - Connectivity assessment and prioritization of urban grasslands as a helpful tool for effective management of urban ecosystem services
AN  - 2473449793
AB  - Urban grasslands are usually managed as short-cut lawns and have limited biodiversity. Urban grasslands with low-intensity management are species rich and can perform numerous ecosystem services, but they are not accepted by citizens everywhere. Further, increasing and/or maintaining a relatively high level of plant species richness in an urban environment is limited by restricted plant dispersal. In this study, we examined the connectivity of urban grasslands and prioritized the grassland patches with regard to their role in connectivity in an urban landscape. We used high-resolution data from a land use system to map grassland patches in Wrocław city, Silesia, southwest Poland, Central Europe, and applied a graph theory approach to assess their connectivity and prioritization. We next constructed a model for several dispersal distance thresholds (2, 20, 44, 100, and 1000 m), reflecting plants with differing dispersal potential. Our results revealed low connectivity of urban grassland patches, especially for plants with low dispersal ability (2–20 m). The priority of patches was correlated with their area for all dispersal distance thresholds. Most of the large patches important to overall connectivity were located in urban peripheries, while in the city center, connectivity was more restricted and grassland area per capita was the lowest. The presence of a river created a corridor, allowing plants to migrate along watercourse, but it also created a barrier dividing the system. The results suggest that increasing the plant species richness in urban grasslands in the city center requires seed addition.

T1  - Spatial and temporal variation of potential resource availability provided by street trees in southeastern Brazil
AN  - 2440546648
AB  - Street trees provide several ecosystem services in urban areas, including food for fauna. Tree species richness, composition and the relative abundance of native vs. non-native species can affect the populations of pollinators and dispersers. This work aims to evaluate the potential availability of food resources provided by street trees, in space and time, considering different pollination and seed dispersal syndromes at Santo André city (Southeastern Brazil). The georeferenced data for all catalogued tree individuals in the Urban Macrozone constituted our sampling domain. The species were categorized according to its geographical origin, pollination and seed dispersal syndromes, flowering and fruiting season. We divided the study area into cells and calculated: number of individuals, species richness, species diversity; richness and diversity of potentially flowering and fruiting individuals in each season of the year. 38,379 trees were catalogued, representing 578 trees/km2, totalizing 230 species. Most individuals (73%) were non-native. The number of individuals, species richness and diversity varied spatially. The pollination syndrome with higher potential resources availability was melittophily (pollination by bees and wasps) has during spring whereas ornithochory (seed dispersal by birds) was the dispersal syndrome with higher potential resources availability which occurred in summer. Despite the dominance of exotic individuals, the most common syndromes are in accordance with what is expected for tropical Atlantic rainforest regions. However, some pollination and dispersal syndromes presented very low potential resource availability in different seasons and no availability in some regions. These results should be taken into account by stakeholders for a better planning of planting efforts, considering the distribution, in space and time, of the potential availability of resources provided by street trees to fauna in order to improve connectivity.

T1  - Urbanization homogenizes the interactions of plant-frugivore bird networks
AN  - 2399633120
AB  - Anthropogenic activities are the main cause of habitat loss and fragmentation, which directly affects biodiversity. Disruption in landscape connectivity among populations may affect complex interactions between species and ecosystem functions, such as pollination and seed dispersal, and ultimately result in secondary extinctions. Urbanization, one of the most intense forms of landscapes changes, has been reported to negatively affect bird and plant diversity. Still, little is known about the effects of urban landscapes on interaction networks. We investigated the relationship between urban landscape structure and plant-frugivore networks at different spatial scales. Coupling interaction data from urban areas and a model selection approach, we evaluated which landscape factors best explained the variation in urban networks properties. Our results indicate that urbanization decreases bird richness, mainly through the loss of habitat specialist species, which results in networks being composed mainly of birds well adapted to urban dwelling. We found that interaction evenness, a measure of homogeneity of interaction distribution between species, increases with urbanization. This is due to the strong dominance that generalist birds had in network composition because they foraged on all available fruits, including exotic plants. The ensuing homogenization of interactions can reduce the resilience of networks and affect the efficiency of ecosystems functions. Thus, urbanization plans should consider the proportion and distribution of green areas within cities, coupling human and ecosystem wellbeing.

T1  - Urbanization drivers differentially affect ground arthropod assemblages in the city of Turin (NW-Italy)
AN  - 2399632240
AB  - Urbanization is a complex process associated with environmental changes affecting many biotic and abiotic ecosystem components, which cause the alteration of biological communities, habitat features, connectivity and stability. In particular, the urbanization process is usually associated with a decrease in species richness that parallels a general increase in the overall abundance of individuals, mostly due to generalist and tolerant species taking advantage of the altered environmental conditions and outcompeting and excluding native species. We here adopted a hierarchically nested sampling design to investigate the response of ground arthropods to the combined effects of multiple facets of urbanization, namely increased impervious surface cover, temperature and patch isolation, measured at small, intermediate and large spatial scale. We studied 15 plots of 150 m in diameter located in the city of Turin (NW-Italy), along an urbanization-cover gradient ranging from suburbia to the city center. For each plot we considered the level of urbanization at three different scales (circular buffers with a 100, 400 and 1600 m radius). Within each plot, we identified a control and an isolated subplot, and in each subplot, we measured ground temperature using dataloggers and we sampled ground arthropods with pitfall traps. Firstly, by relating ground temperature and urbanization cover, we showed that temperature values reflected an Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, which indicates increasing values of temperature along the urbanization gradient. This trend was particularly evident at large scale regarding daily and diurnal temperature, and at small scale regarding nocturnal temperature. Secondly, we demonstrated that different groups of ground arthropods respond differently to urbanization cover, with major effects at the largest spatial scale. Finally, we extrapolated the differential contribution of urbanization cover, UHI-effect and patch isolation to the observed activity density of the investigated taxonomic groups: Coleoptera and Hemiptera were influenced by temperature, whereas Hymenoptera, Collembola, Acari and Araneae were mainly influenced by urbanization, especially in control subplots. Our results emphasize how a multitaxonomic approach can help unravel patterns of community assembly in urban areas.

T1  - Evaluating the Effectiveness of Established Wildlife Corridors in Southern Orange County, California
AN  - 2524385291
AB  - Intense road development and urbanization have fragmented the natural landscapeacross coastal Southern California since the middle of the 20th century. As mitigationefforts, in 1992 the Natural Community Conservation Plan and Habitat Conservation Plans Iand II (NCCP&HCP I and II) allocated reserves and non-reserve open spaces to connectthese fragmented natural habitats and foster the coexistence of wildlife and people inOrange County. Here, I aim to evaluate the effectiveness of two established wildlifecorridors (the Sand Canyon Wash Corridor and the Bonita Creek Corridor) in southernOrange County, linking two large reserve areas (Figure 1). I conducted camera trappingsurveys by using 11 cameras placed along these two linkage corridors. Additionally, Iobtained more photographic data at 10 different camera stations within the Irvine RanchWater District (IRWD) San Joaquin Marsh & Wildlife Sanctuary. Then, I calculated RelativeAbundance Index (RAI) values based on the photographic capture rates of key vertebratespecies of concern for each location. I compared the current RAI values with values from astudy by Lyren et al. (2008) to illustrate the changes over a decade at three subsets oflocations. I also obtained wildlife-vehicle collision (WVC) data from 2005 to 2019 from theCity of Irvine Local Animal Services. I found an average of two bobcat mortalities event peryear occurred until 2015. After 2015, no bobcat detection or roadkill mortality is observed.Additionally, the number of coyote detections has increased by almost 700% over a decadeat these locations. It is likely that this result reflects urban coyotes’ greater ability tofunction in a changing environment and (greater) resilience to anthropogenic effects. Thelong-term success of wildlife corridors requires understanding how the regional environment may influence species composition and potential use of these linkage elements reserve designs over extended periods.

T1  - Analyzing Vertebrate Movement in and Around Natural Areas Through Road Surveys
AN  - 2457700548
AB  - With the expansion of the human population, new roads are continually being built, leading to an increase in fragmentation or loss of natural habitats. These roads can act as corridors for vertebrates connecting natural habitats or aiding in migration, but they can also act as barriers or boundaries leading to fragmentation, isolation, and/or mortality on roadways. Research has focused mainly on larger highways, outside of the U.S., and away from larger urban areas. The Oak Openings Region, a biodiversity hot spot in northwestern Ohio, is a matrix of human dominated land use and remnant natural patches. This research focused on identifying vertebrate mortality hot spots and the spatial and temporal variables associated with vertebrate road mortality. From mid-April to the end of September 2019, we surveyed 38 road transects within and around three protected (natural) areas to record diversity, abundance, and distribution of roadkilled vertebrates and to identify influencing factors (e.g., land use, canopy cover, environmental data, road characteristics). We found an uneven spread of roadkill, with 45% of roadkill found on nine out of the 38 (24%) surveyed transects, highlighting potential areas to prioritize for mitigation. During the spring months (April 14 - June 20), nine of the transects had no roadkill, but in the summer months (June 21 - September 18), only one transect had no roadkill. This suggests that seasonality influenced the abundance and distribution of roadkill. As transects moved northward, there was a positive trend of more roadkill with increased developed land use. We found a total of 297 roadkill on or around the roads, with all vertebrate taxa included. Mammals made up 49.8% of the roadkill found. Mammal roadkill showed a significant positive trend with average canopy cover (p < 0.0001). Amphibians made up the second largest roadkill group, but showed a seasonal peak in August. These results can help land managers predict where animal dispersal is occurring, which roads negatively impact vertebrates, and identify where better connectivity of the landscape could improve conditions for vertebrate populations. This study suggests that human dominated land use increases mortality and seasonality influences roadkill abundance and distribution.

T1  - A Conceptual Approach to Modeling the Geospatial Impact of Typical Urban Threats on the Habitat Quality of River Corridors
AN  - 2395148699
AB  - While for most of a landscape, urbanization leads to a significant habitat loss, rivers in urban areas are usually maintained or developed for their drainage function. Rivers are often the most important biophysical and ecological connection of cities with their surrounding ecosystems, although usually heavily altered due to urban impacts. For the conservation of urban rivers as ecological corridors, it is important to assess the impact of typical urban threats on habitat quality. In this study, we used the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Trade-offs) habitat quality model to assess the individual and combined impacts of built-up areas, first- and second-order road and water pollution from urban drainage, and wastewater discharge on habitat quality within a 200 m wide river corridor. The Pochote River in León, Nicaragua, was used as a case study. Our results show the spatial distribution and magnitude of the individual threat impacts, as well as the respective contribution of each threat to the overall impact of urbanization on the habitat quality within the river corridor. While close to the city center, all threats almost equally contributed to severe habitat degradation, while further downstream, an individual threat influence became more distinct with only water pollution having a consistent negative impact. We concluded that the InVEST habitat quality model can be used to assess the impact of typical urban threats on habitat quality in river corridors at a high spatial resolution. The results can help to improve urban planning and development to improve habitat conservation along urban rivers.

T1  - Contributo Para a reabilitação De Bacias Hidrográficas. Caso De Estudo Do Rio Coina
AN  - 2586971444
AB  - As linhas de água são sistemas de drenagem natural e elementos integrantes da paisagem. A presença permanente ou temporária de água origina um desenvolvimento de sistemas bióticos de grande diversidade e riqueza, com grande interesse em conservar. É na proteção dos espaços próximos de água que maiores proveitos se conseguem obter para a saúde humana e para a própria saúde da vegetação e da vida animal, e ainda no contributo para uma maior qualidade do ar, da água e do clima em geral.Ao longo da história, o Homem tentou desde sempre tirar o máximo partido da utilização, mais ou menos intensa, dos recursos e vantagens oferecidas pela proximidade aos cursos de água. Porém, uso intensivo e abusivo destes recursos conduziu à degradação dos ecossistemas ribeirinhos levando a uma destruição dos sistemas de drenagem natural sobretudo em áreas urbanas, destruição da flora, poluição difusa devido à utilização de fertilizantes e pesticidas na agricultura, bem como o lançamento de efluentes domésticos e industriais. Face à importância dos recursos hídricos, surge então a necessidade de os reabilitar.Neste contexto, pretende-se com esta dissertação elaborar uma proposta ao nível da bacia hidrográfica do rio Coina, no âmbito do ordenamento do território, abordando alguns conceitos fundamentais relacionados com a reabilitação de rios e ribeiras com vista à valorização das linhas de água e galerias ribeirinhas, contribuindo para o melhoramento do ambiente, da qualidade de vida e segurança em meio urbano. Serão propostas medidas que levem a uma melhor consolidação das margens e proteção contra a erosão, a uma melhoria da drenagem e funcionalidade da corrente, a uma maior manutenção da diversidade, conservação da flora e consequentemente da fauna, bem como à minimização da artificialização das margens. Com isto, pretende-se contribuir para o desenvolvimento sustentável do ecossistema indo ao encontro do equilíbrio da vidaAlternate abstract:The water lines are natural drain systems and landscape elements. The permanent or temporary presence of water produces a development of great diversity and wealthy biotic systems, with great interest to preserve. It is in the protection of spaces next to the water that we can achieve more healthy life for humans, animals and vegetation, and get a bigger contribution to a better air, water and climate quality.During history, the Man ever tried to take maximum return from the resources and advantages offered by the proximity to the water courses. However, the intense and abusive use of these resources took us to the dilapidation of river ecosystems and by consequence to a destruction of the natural drain systems specially in urban areas, a destruction of the flora, diffuse pollution due to the using of fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture, as well the domestic and industrial discharges. Taking into consideration the importance of hydric resources, we must rehabilitate them.In this context, we want with this thesis to do a proposal at the level of hydrographic basin of the river Coina, in the scope of land management, approach some fundamental concepts related with river and creek rehabilitation looking to the water lines and river galleries valorisation, contributing to a better environment, quality of life and security of urban areas. Will be proposed measures that took to a better consolidation of the river margins and protection against the erosion, a better drainage and flow functionality, a better maintenance of diversity, flora and fauna preservation, as well the minimization of artificialization of the river margins. With this, the intention is to contribute to a sustainable development of the ecosystem and encountering the life balance.

T1  - Modelling of socio-ecological connectivity. The rural-urban network in the surroundings of Madrid (Central Spain)
AN  - 2092727656
AB  - As most of Europe’s metropolitan landscapes grow, a change is occurring in their surrounding rural environment. The consequences thereof mainly involve losses of traditional land uses and changes in the socioecomic structures of the local population. The lack of coupling ‘urban society-countryside’ can be considered to constitute a driving force of this process. The present paper focuses upon the rural-urban network around the metropolis of Madrid (Central Spain). We developed a quantitative model to explain the socio-ecological rural-urban linkages, taking into account the influence of the metropolis in the network of neighbouring municipalities. The results show a rural landscape gradient ranging from silvo-pastoral to agricultural land uses and maintaining different interactions with the local socioeconomy. Urban-rural polarisation of the territory and accessibility to the metropolis are the main factors influencing the landscape dynamics. Territorial cohesion among municipalities and connectivity with the metropolis are factors determining the socio-ecological structure. The agricultural area presents good social cohesion, but a weak connection with the City. The silvo-pastoral landscape, on the contrary, maintains prominent links with the metropolis, but a non-significant interconnection between the small towns. The model tested constitutes a useful tool for analysing socio-ecological connectivity and for quantifying, designing and promoting territorial cohesion policies.

T1  - Body-size shifts in aquatic and terrestrial urban communities
AN  - 2063813001
AB  - Body size is intrinsically linked to metabolic rate and life-history traits, and is a crucial determinant of food webs and community dynamics. The increased temperatures associated with the urban-heat-island effect result in increased metabolic costs and are expected to drive shifts to smaller body sizes. Urban environments are, however, also characterized by substantial habitat fragmentation, which favours mobile species. Here, using a replicated, spatially nested sampling design across ten animal taxonomic groups, we show that urban communities generally consist of smaller species. In addition, although we show urban warming for three habitat types and associated reduced community-weighted mean body sizes for four taxa, three taxa display a shift to larger species along the urbanization gradients. Our results show that the general trend towards smaller-sized species is overruled by filtering for larger species when there is positive covariation between size and dispersal, a process that can mitigate the low connectivity of ecological resources in urban settings. We thus demonstrate that the urban-heat-island effect and urban habitat fragmentation are associated with contrasting community-level shifts in body size that critically depend on the association between body size and dispersal. Because body size determines the structure and dynamics of ecological networks, such shifts may affect urban ecosystem function.

T1  - Does scale matter? The influence of three-level spatial scales on forest bird occurrence in a tropical landscape
AN  - 2056768627
AB  - Consequences of habitat fragmentation for species occurrence are amongst the most important issues in landscape and conservation ecology. Empirical and theoretical studies have demonstrated that the total amount of habitat, patch size and connectivity have nonlinear effects on species survival on multiple spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, population models need to incorporate multiple scales, which can be extremely valuable to prioritizing conservation efforts in these changing landscapes. We tested how the amount and configuration of habitat affect understory bird species occurrence using fine to broad-scale habitat features. We used playback to sample birds in 13 Atlantic Forest fragments in Southeast Brazil. Microhabitat, local and regional landscape variables were tested against bird occurrence. Our results demonstrate that different bird species respond to different habitat scales. Sclerurus scansor, Xiphorhynchus fuscus, Automolus leucophthalmus, Drymophila ochropyga, Mackenziaena leachii, and Chiroxiphia caudata were most influenced by tree height and diameter (microhabitat characteristics), S. scansor, F. serrana and Pyriglena leucoptera were most influenced by forest cover and red-edge reflectance(local-scale metrics) and S. scansor, X. fuscus, D. ochropyga, P. leucoptera, F. serrana and M. leachii had area, core area and functional connectivity index (landscape features) as stronger predictors of species occurrence. Small forest fragments acted as corridors and increased overall connectivity of the entire community. The most effective means of maintaining long-term population connectivity of understory birds involves retaining both large and small areas, including forests with different micro-habitat characteristics. No management approach based on a single-scale would benefit all species. Implementing multiscale conservation strategies are necessary for maintaining long-term viability of forest birds on tropical landscapes.

T1  - Evaluating the distribution of invasive woody vegetation around riparian corridors in relation to land use
AN  - 1992854379
AB  - Invasive species have been causing important and irreversible impacts to native species and communities of ecosystems. They distort ecosystem functions by degrading forest lands, wetlands, and agricultural habitats and replace the native vegetation and reduce biodiversity, forest productivity, and suitable wildlife habitat. To address disturbances caused by invasive species occurrence, further information is needed regarding the occurrence, extent, and dispersal of invasive species and how land use may increase the spread of these species. The objective of this study was to find the frequency and dominance of three invasive species common to riparian areas of east Alabama: Ligustrum sinense (Chinese privet), Elaeagnus pungens (silverthorn), and Triadica sebifera (Chinese tallow tree). Surveys of these species in riparian forests in and around Auburn, Alabama were conducted to show the relative extent of these shrubs and their relation to urban land use. It was expected to see the highest levels of invasive species in the city center with decreasing levels radiating outward into rural areas. Another objective was how urban land use may affect the presence-absence and prevalence of these non-native plant species within study sites. The results showed that around the city center and suburban lands, cover of both Chinese privet and silverthorn tended to increase. In contrast, Chinese tallow tree density percent cover showed an opposite trend with landscapes close to city center often having slightly less cover. This study shows that urban land use may be an important association with distribution of invasive plant species.

T1  - Demographic and genetic viability of a medium-sized ground-dwelling mammal in a fire prone, rapidly urbanizing landscape
AN  - 2021372998
AB  - The rapid and large-scale urbanization of peri-urban areas poses major and complex challenges for wildlife conservation. We used population viability analysis (PVA) to evaluate the influence of urban encroachment, fire, and fauna crossing structures, with and without accounting for inbreeding effects, on the metapopulation viability of a medium-sized ground-dwelling mammal, the southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus), in the rapidly expanding city of Perth, Australia. We surveyed two metapopulations over one and a half years, and parameterized the PVA models using largely field-collected data. The models revealed that spatial isolation imposed by housing and road encroachment has major impacts on I. obesulus. Although the species is known to persist in small metapopulations at moderate levels of habitat fragmentation, the models indicate that these populations become highly vulnerable to demographic decline, genetic deterioration, and local extinction under increasing habitat connectivity loss. Isolated metapopulations were also predicted to be highly sensitive to fire, with large-scale fires having greater negative impacts on population abundance than small-scale ones. To reduce the risk of decline and local extirpation of I. obesulus and other small- to medium-sized ground-dwelling mammals in urbanizing, fire prone landscapes, we recommend that remnant vegetation and vegetated, structurally-complex corridors between habitat patches be retained. Well-designed road underpasses can be effective to connect habitat patches and reduce the probability of inbreeding and genetic differentiation; however, adjustment of fire management practices to limit the size of unplanned fires and ensure the retention of long unburnt vegetation will also be required to ensure persistence. Our study supports the evidence that in rapidly urbanizing landscapes, a pro-active conservation approach is required that manages species at the metapopulation level and that prioritizes metapopulations and habitat with greater long-term probability of persistence and conservation capacity, respectively. This strategy may help us prevent future declines and local extirpations, and currently relatively common species from becoming rare.

T1  - Active Citizenship in Green Space Governance
AN  - 2567983731
AB  - BackgroundThe role of authorities in green space decision-making and management is increasingly supplemented with activities from citizens. Research has shown how citizens across Europe nowadays engage in a wide variety of practices to accomplish their green space-related objectives. In this way, citizens contribute to the management of protected natural areas, rural landscapes and urban green spaces.The current focus on active citizenship in green space governance brings about important debates. This includes discussions about how to best govern and protect our green spaces. There are also democratic debates about the roles and responsibilities of different actors in green space governance. While citizens potentially contribute towards the realization of public policy, their objectives can also clash with the formal responsibilities and preferences of authorities. There might also be tensions between and inequalities among citizens.Thesis aims and research questionsThis PhD-project specifically focuses on forms of governance in which active citizens play a leading role in realizing, protecting and/or managing public green space. The main research aim is to contribute to scientific and societal debates on active citizenship in green space by studying its relevance for the governance, management and protection of green space. For this purpose, four main research questions have been formulated to address four main knowledge gaps regarding the involvement of active citizens in green space governance:• What are the overall scope and key characteristics of active citizenship in green space governance?• What are the benefits and co-benefits of different types of active citizenship in green space governance?• What factors contribute to or constrain the long-term continuity of active citizenship in green space governance?• How can the transformative potential of active citizenship in green space governance be understood?Research approachThis PhD-research focuses on the study of daily practices that involve active citizens in green space governance. To do so, this thesis departs from the Policy Arrangement Approach (PAA) and enriches it with elements from practice theory in order to tailor it towards this study of daily practices.The Policy Arrangement Approach is an established analytical framework used to study the governance of natural resources through four analytical dimensions: actors (those involved in governance), discourse (the content and verbal aspects of governance), rules (guiding principles that govern actions of actors) and resources (tools and skills used to achieve certain outcomes). By adopting elements from practice theory this thesis adds a focus on human activities as a fifth dimension. It also adds a stronger recognition of the constitutive role of materiality in practices and an emphasis on the ends to which practitioners orient their activities.I argue that a deeper understanding of the role and relevance of active citizenship in green space governance requires both a broader overview of the scope of these practices and a deeper understanding of specific practices. In order to do so, I used a 3-layered framework for this thesis. This started with a broad inventory and analysis of 264 different practices in order to gain an overview of their characteristics and diversity. The second layer progressed upon this with a detailed qualitative analysis of a subsample of 50 practices in order to gain more reliable knowledge and a deeper understanding of these practices. In the third layer, four case studies have been conducted to gain in-depth knowledge on a number of specific issues.The scope and key characteristics of active citizenshipWhen I started with this thesis, there was a scarcity of good quality baseline data on the nature and diversity of active citizenship in green space governance. The analysis of 264 examples of active citizenship across the Netherlands in layer one of this thesis gives a good overview of the variety of ways in which active citizens engage in green space governance. They for example aim to protect the habitat of an endangered species or manage land within a nature reserve. However, improving social cohesion through community gardening or providing access to a woodland can be important objectives just as well. Active citizenship in the green domain thus often works across traditional policy silos and crosses borders between nature, culture and social domains.This study on the scope and key characteristics of active citizenship highlights that most of the practices in which citizens engage are small scale; they are usually limited to local areas spanning no more than a few hectares, and often much less. Most of the active citizenship in green space governance takes place outside of protected reserves, often in (peri-)urban areas. It also shows that citizens do not always engage in the actual management of green space. In contrast to most previous studies, this research highlights the additional relevance of political activities such as lobbying and protesting, as these activities are important means for citizens to accomplish their objectives.Active citizenship is often linked with other actors in the public domain. Citizens often cooperate with local authorities and NGOs, and occasionally also with business actors such as farmers. Funding from local authorities can be an important source of income, as well as sponsoring by companies and private donations. In many practices, involved citizens donate their own money and sometimes revenues are generated through delivering products and services.The benefits and co-benefits of active citizenshipThe detailed qualitative analysis in layer two addresses a lack of insight into the outcomes produced by active citizens. This makes it difficult to comprehend the implications of a shift towards active citizenship for the natural environment and the population.The analysis shows how the large majority of the 50 practices contribute towards ecological benefits, such as biodiversity, urban greening, landscape restoration, expansion of green space areas, or species protection. This large majority also contributes towards socio-economic co-benefits, such as environmental awareness and the use functions of green space (accessibility, recreation, amenity). Other cobenefits relate to social cohesion, food production, employment and the protection of cultural aspects of the landscape. The exact benefits and co-benefits strongly depend on the type of practice.The practices in this study generally generate benefits on a much smaller scale than those of authorities and large NGOs. While green self-governance does contribute towards realizing environmental and social objectives, this contribution is therefore mostly of local relevance. It is also important to be aware of potential tensions between benefits and co-benefits related to the activities of active citizens, for instance when an increase in recreation negatively affects biodiversity. Furthermore, citizens are not always successful in accomplishing their objectives and the activities of citizens can also produce outcomes considered as negative.The long-term continuity of active citizenshipIn the studies in layer one and two citizens expressed concerns about the longterm continuity of active citizenship in green space governance. This was an important motivation for me to conduct three European case studies into placekeeping, the long-term responsive management of places, in order to preserve the qualities and benefits that a place offers.These cases show how citizens can manage public green spaces over multiple decades. While similar examples are rare, such cases can provide important inspiration for other groups that aim to protect certain green values in the long term. They show how citizens can develop an inspiring idea, mobilize fellow citizens, realize a green space and maintain it over time. Even so, these studies also highlight how even after several decades, groups still struggle to continue their activities. Changing policies such as declining subsidies, urban development such as encroachment, and the ageing of volunteers all put pressure on the continuity of citizens’ activities.A number of important lessons for continuity can be distilled from these cases. First of all, long-term continuity is supported by a degree of formalization: established rules and internal procedures provide stability to citizens. Secondly, the importance of adaptive capacity is also underlined: citizens need to be able to respond and adapt to political, socio-economic and cultural developments over time. Third, authorities play a key role in place-keeping by citizens: their longterm support can provide stability to citizens, but they can also constrain citizens when they change their policies.The transformative potential of active citizenshipTensions between the activities of citizens and the role of authorities are manifest throughout this thesis. Prior research shows that active citizens are often hindered by institutions and often face difficulties in scaling up beyond the local level. I therefore conducted an in-depth case study on how citizens can transform practices in governance and reshape the relationship between citizens and (local) authorities.This fourth and final case study shows how discourses and activities promoted by citizens became embedded in spatial planning and green space management. This instigated institutional changes, and showcases a transformative potential in both substance (redevelopment of a green space) and governance (co-creation). Yet, this study also highlights the persisting influence of institutionalized rules and procedures. Institutional change in local governance is often a slow and complex process, in which citizens need to align with the institutions that they want to change in order to be able to instigate these changes. This conditions the activities of citizens, reducing their autonomy.Even so, transformation in governance is not necessarily a matter of citizens striving to realize their objectives vis-à-vis authorities trying to realize theirs. Instead, this study shows that when certain ways of working are under pressure, when motivations align towards a shared end-goal, and when there is a shared sense of urgency, transformation can take place through co-creation between citizens and authorities. In this, the success of practices that involve active citizens in governance can clear the way for involvement of citizens in other practices, eventually instigating a gradual rather than disruptive change in how society is locally governed.DiscussionThis thesis shows how citizens can make an important contribution to the governance and management of green space. Most practices are currently situated outside protected nature reserves, but they can enhance urban greening and biodiversity in the city or ensure the conservation of cultural elements in the landscape. Even so, the contribution of citizens to (inter)national policy goals and ecological networks is still relatively small, as the outcomes of active citizenship in green space governance are mostly limited to the local scale level.In the long run, co-benefits of active citizenship in green space may increase people’s connection and involvement with nature, leading to increased support for environmental protection. With this, co-benefits can provide a first step towards the realization of more direct benefits for nature conservation. After all, practices with an explicit focus on co-benefits often also produce benefits - and vice-versa. Relating to co-benefits can therefore be an effective strategy for governments or environmental NGOs aiming to involve active citizens in their work.From a democratic point of view, critical scholars have highlighted how authorities prefer to deal with citizens whose objectives correspond with their own policy aims. While authorities often aim to promote active citizenship in their discourse, this will sometimes put them at odds with citizens who pursue different goals. Conflicts between citizens and authorities often manifest themselves in my work, but such notions are often overlooked in the political discourse, which tends to focus on cooperative forms of active citizenship. My work also reiterates citizens’ dependency on authorities and shows how the continuity of their activities can depend on the role of local governments.Scholars have also been critical of the exclusion of non-active citizens in these debates. Previous research has shown how certain societal groups are less represented in active citizenship, and there are ongoing debates about how the costs and benefits of active citizenship in the green domain are spatially distributed. Authorities still have an important task to represent everyone, also disengaged or less successful citizens, to make sure that everyone has the chance to enjoy the benefits offered by green space. The fragmented nature and local scale of active citizenship also point towards a need for a continued central role of authorities in safeguarding green space values and realizing ecological networks.In this, active citizenship can offer a valuable addition to what governments do, contributing important benefits and co-benefits to the environment and the population. By strategically supporting or collaborating with active citizens, authorities can strengthen their contribution to policy objectives and stimulate direct forms of democracy. Over the long term, authorities can support placekeeping by citizens by providing security via stable policies, formally protecting the involved spaces, allowing long-term management contracts and contributing resources.In this context, the adoption of a more polycentric and context-sensitive approach to green space governance can help authorities in achieving their policy objectives. The diversity of active citizenship does not match with generic ‘one-size-fitsall’ policy and governing approaches of authorities. Rather, it calls for a flexible role of authorities in governance: in some instances authorities should have a leading role, in other instances an enabling or facilitating role, and sometimes a collaborative approach to governance is called for – all of this with sensitivity to the local context.

T1  - Conservation Genetics and Ecology of the Hazel Dormouse
AN  - 2410400563
AB  - Woodland species face a challenging future because of human activity and global climate change, as such it is vital to understand the ecology of species that inhabit these habitats in order to conduct effective conservation management. I describe the phylogeographic structure of the hazel dormouse within the UK, to identify post-glacial dispersal routes and to describe population units for conservation. I provide evidence for a single post-glacial colonization coincident with the start of the Holocene period, 7.5-11 Kya. I also demonstrate the utility of novel occupancy modelling techniques to determine dormouse presence with high probability of detection. I provide optimal survey guidelines for ecological practitioners to conduct rigorous statistically significant surveys. This species is known to be susceptible to habitat loss and fragmentation limiting dispersal and functional connectivity. I use a landscape genetics approach to characterize the genetic structure of populations of dormice from seven regions around the UK to explicitly test for the role of landscape heterogeneity and barriers to dispersal. The results suggests build-up of genetic structure amongst islands of fragmented habitat that is explained in part due to isolation-by-distance, and in part due to specific landscape features between different regions. The isolation-by-resistance analysis allows us to identify the landscape features, such as land cover, hedgerows and roads that facilitate or inhibit gene flow. Results suggest that dispersal in hazel dormice is strongly influenced by barriers in the landscape, with our main findings being that urban areas and roads are associated with decreased gene flow while habitat features such as hedgerows and forest cover are associated with increased gene flow. Finally, I investigated the effect of density dependence and climatic factors on the population demography of five marked hazel dormice populations in Europe (four in the UK and one in Lithuania). The results from the chapter have identified the environmental drivers of these population parameters on hibernating mammals whilst providing evidence that density dependence has the greatest effect on population dynamics in this species. The results provide information that variability in winter conditions can have serious consequences for individual fitness, decreasing the dormancy season and leading to an increased extinction risk in this species. I discuss the implications for hazel dormouse conservation in the UK, and make recommendations for conservation practitioners to ensure the future persistence of this species.

T1  - Differences in foliar endophyte communities of red alder (Alnus rubra) exposed to varying air pollutant levels
AN  - 2194568009
AB  - In the Pacific Northwest, Alnus rubra Bong. (red alder) is a common deciduous tree species especially prevalent in riparian corridors and disturbed sites, including metropolitan areas undergoing land use changes and development. Importantly, red alder is also considered a bioindicator for ozone pollution and, like all plants, harbors a diverse endophyte community that may interact with aerial pollutants. In this study, we surveyed foliar fungal endophyte communities (microfungi) in red alder leaves from the metropolitan area of Portland, Oregon, USA, using culture-based techniques, and found that communities differed significantly by site. Our results suggest that the fungal endophyte community composition in red alder leaves may be influenced in part by local air pollution sources, likely in conjunction with other site characteristics. As urban areas expand, more studies should focus on how the urban environment affects plant–microbe community ecology and endophyte–host interactions, as well as on the long-term consequences for other ecosystem processes such as leaf litter decomposition.Alternate abstract:Dans le Nord-Ouest Pacifique, Alnus rubra Bong. (aulne rouge) est une espèce fréquente d’arbre décidu, spécialement répandue dans les corridors riverains et les sites perturbés, y compris les agglomérations soumises à des changements ou à des développements en matière d’utilisation des sols. Fait important, l’aulne rouge est aussi considéré comme bio-indicateur de la pollution par l’ozone et, comme tous les végétaux, héberge une communauté d’endophytes divers qui peut interagir avec les polluants de l’air. Dans cette étude, les auteurs ont examiné les communautés d’endophytes fongiques foliaires (microchampignon) d’aulnes rouges de l’agglomération de Portland, Oregon, États-Unis, à l’aide de méthodes basées sur la culture, et trouvé que les communautés différaient significativement d’un site à l’autre. Leurs résultats suggèrent que la composition de la communauté d’endophytes fongiques de l’aulne rouge peut être influencée en partie par les sources de pollution atmosphérique locales, probablement conjuguées à d’autres caractéristiques du site. Au fur et à mesure de l’expansion des zones urbaines, un plus grand nombre d’études devraient se concentrer sur la manière par laquelle l’environnement urbain affecte l’écologie de la communauté plante–microbe et les interactions endophyte–hôte, de même que sur les conséquences à long terme d’autres processus écosystémiques comme la décomposition de la litière de feuille.

T1  - Bee Community Response to Local and Landscape Factors along an Urban-Rural Gradient
AN  - 2160960096
AB  - Over a third of the world’s crops—including fruits, vegetables, nuts, spices, and oilseed—require insect pollination. Reliance on the pollination services that promote these food products continues to rise due to increasing demands from growing human populations; therefore, it is imperative to understand the ecology of insect pollinators. While extensive research describes pollination services in both agricultural and urban settings, few studies examine pollinator activity along urban-rural gradients. Even fewer address how bees with different bee life history characteristics respond to urbanization, and to my knowledge, never from a high elevation semi-arid environment. This study documented different pollinator assemblages from 12 sites along an urban-rural gradient in Denver, Colorado, USA. Percent impervious surface was used define the extent of urbanization. Wild bees were collected in the summer of 2017 and local and landscape characteristics were estimated using field assessments and geospatial analysis. Bee species’ life history characteristics were assigned to ecological guilds, and the relationships between urbanization and bee communities were explored using linear modeling. Given findings from a similar study, I hypothesized that bee communities in urban landscapes would be dominated by smaller bees with more ecologically generalized characteristics (e.g., polylectic and eusocial) than bees in rural landscapes, which were hypothesized to contain bee communities with more specialized traits (e.g., oligolectic). Overall, bee abundance and diversity decreased with increasing urbanization, suggesting that urban areas negatively impact bee communities. Moreover, all bee guilds responded positively to local floral richness, and negatively to the degree of urbanization in the landscape, suggesting that urbanization in the Denver metropolitan area is detrimental to entire bee communities. For the Denver metropolitan area, the findings suggest incorporating a greater diversity of floral species and increasing pollinator resource corridors throughout the city of Denver.

T1  - Effects of habitat and landscape quality on amphibian assemblages of urban stormwater ponds
AN  - 1973806233
AB  - Urbanisation is one of the most severe drivers of current global biodiversity loss and has contributed to severe declines in many amphibian species. The aim of this study was to determine whether artificial stormwater ponds, designed to control water flow, can act as refuges for amphibians in urban areas. Moreover, we analysed the influence of habitat and landscape quality on amphibian species richness of 46 stormwater ponds (STOPON) in comparison to 46 control ponds (CONTROL).Our study revealed that environmental conditions clearly varied between STOPON and CONTROL. The most pronounced differences were that STOPON were larger, shallower, sunnier, more isolated by streets and had a greater cover of built-up area and lower cover of arable land surrounding them. Nevertheless, the amphibian assemblages of STOPON and CONTROL were very similar. All nine amphibian species (including three threatened species) detected in this study were found in both pond types. Moreover, species richness (2.8 ± 0.2 vs. 2.3 ± 0.2) and the frequency of each species did not differ between STOPON and CONTROL. The only exception was Pelophylax spp., which occurred more regularly in STOPON. Both habitat and landscape quality affected amphibian species richness; however, the explanatory power of the habitat models was about twice as high as those of the landscape models.In conclusion, stormwater ponds play an important role for amphibians in urban areas. In comparison to CONTROL, the low landscape quality in the surroundings of STOPON seemed to be compensated by a higher habitat quality due to regular management.

T1  - Does demolition improve biodiversity? Linking urban green space and socioeconomic characteristics to avian richness in a shrinking city
AN  - 1973805507
AB  - Anthropogenic change, specifically urbanization, has lasting impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Past work has linked green space variables and socioeconomic characteristics with biodiversity in urban areas. Shrinking cities present an interesting case for studying biodiversity because many of these places have implemented demolition policies to remove vacant buildings from the landscape, which returns previously urbanized land back into a “natural” state. The objective of this study is to investigate the multifaceted relationship among urban green space, socioeconomic characteristics, demolition activities, and avian species richness in the shrinking city of Buffalo, NY. We first establish a baseline understanding of how social and ecological factors are related to avian species richness through generalized linear models (GLM) and then incorporate a variable characterizing demolition to understand how the process of demolition may be impacting species richness relative to other factors. Second, since our analysis relies on “citizen science” data from eBird, we aim to better understand the factors driving eBird participation in Buffalo through zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression models to test how social and ecological characteristics and demolition affect checklists submission across the city. Our findings suggested that demolition activities do not increase species richness in Buffalo, indicating these sites may not be returning to a natural state that is usable by birds. We also found that areas that have undergone considerable demolition may be a potential deterrent to eBird participation, and eBird users may create bias by sampling areas with greater green space connectivity, and thus higher richness.

T1  - Multi-level, multi-scale resource selection functions and resistance surfaces for conservation planning: Pumas as a case study
AN  - 1909184926
AB  - The importance of examining multiple hierarchical levels when modeling resource use for wildlife has been acknowledged for decades. Multi-level resource selection functions have recently been promoted as a method to synthesize resource use across nested organizational levels into a single predictive surface. Analyzing multiple scales of selection within each hierarchical level further strengthens multi-level resource selection functions. We extend this multi-level, multi-scale framework to modeling resistance for wildlife by combining multi-scale resistance surfaces from two data types, genetic and movement. Resistance estimation has typically been conducted with one of these data types, or compared between the two. However, we contend it is not an either/or issue and that resistance may be better-modeled using a combination of resistance surfaces that represent processes at different hierarchical levels. Resistance surfaces estimated from genetic data characterize temporally broad-scale dispersal and successful breeding over generations, whereas resistance surfaces estimated from movement data represent fine-scale travel and contextualized movement decisions. We used telemetry and genetic data from a long-term study on pumas (Puma concolor) in a highly developed landscape in southern California to develop a multi-level, multi-scale resource selection function and a multi-level, multi-scale resistance surface. We used these multi-level, multi-scale surfaces to identify resource use patches and resistant kernel corridors. Across levels, we found puma avoided urban, agricultural areas, and roads and preferred riparian areas and more rugged terrain. For other landscape features, selection differed among levels, as did the scales of selection for each feature. With these results, we developed a conservation plan for one of the most isolated puma populations in the U.S. Our approach captured a wide spectrum of ecological relationships for a population, resulted in effective conservation planning, and can be readily applied to other wildlife species.

T1  - Bat boxes in urban non-native forests: a popular practice that should be reconsidered
AN  - 1865262267
AB  - Impact mitigation practices are currently one of the hottest topics in conservation and regarded as priorities worldwide. Forest bat populations are known to provide important ecosystem services such as pest control and bat boxes have become one of the most popular management options for counteracting the loss of roosts. However, bat boxes tend to be employed in non-native forests near highly humanized areas where human disturbance is higher. The aim of this study was to evaluate how the surrounding landscape composition affects bat box occupancy in urban non-native forests along the Mediterranean corridor in the Northeastern Iberian Peninsula. Two hundred wooden bat boxes were monitored in young non-native forests in the period 2004-2012. The influence of land cover on occupancy rate of bat boxes was analysed at the landscape level in a 5 km buffer around bat-box stations. In total, 1659 inspections were carried out, in which a 15 % occupancy rate was detected. Bat boxes hosted three different species (Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Pipistrellus kuhlii and Nyctalus leisleri). More than 70 % of the occupancy can be explained by habitat and spatial composition. The presence of urban areas around bat boxes tends to have a negative impact on bat occupation rates; by contrast, forest coverage has a positive effect, especially for the tree-dwelling bats. These patterns could be associated with the large number of available roosts in buildings, microhabitat or phylopatry. Thus, to increase success, we suggest that landscape composition should be considered when using bat boxes for conservation.

T1  - The Role of Aquatic Subsidies in Riparian Food Webs and the Effect of Urbanization on the Diet, Diversity and Web-Spinning Behavior of Riparian Spiders
AN  - 1978158736
AB  - The exchange of nutrients and organic material that occurs along the riparian zones of stream ecosystems has long been recognized to be vital in providing energetic subsidies for both aquatic and terrestrial food webs. Web-spinning spiders that inhabit stream channels are considered specialists of aquatic ecosystems and are major consumers of emerging aquatic insects, while other spider taxa are more commonly found in riparian forests and as a result may rely more heavily on terrestrial insects. The proportion aquatic insects in the diet of riparian spiders will most likely depend on factors such as spider taxa and prey diversity. However, the majority of studies focusing on the movement of subsidies between aquatic and riparian food webs have been conducted in non-urban areas and little is known about how human impact through urbanization may be affecting the transfer of energy between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The overall objective of this dissertation was to improve our understanding of how spider communities can be utilized in studying the connectivity between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. This objective was achieved by using a combination of stable isotope analyses along with measuring diversity and web-spinning behavior of riparian spiders. Results showed that spider assemblages are strongly associated with aquatic ecosystems due to their dependence on aquatic insects as a major energy source. In addition, results showed that urbanization can have a strong effect on the diet, web building behavior and body condition of riparian spiders and overall negatively affected spider diversity along an urban gradient. This study is of great importance because of the constant expansion of urban areas and as a result of this we need to have a better understanding how urbanization is impacting ecosystem interactions that are essential for sustaining complex food webs that could have negative effects for many aquatic and terrestrial organisms. In addition this dissertation has also provided evidence that spider communities should be included as part of integrated biotic indexes for stream ecosystems due to their ability to provide novel insights for more holistic analyses of the condition of the entire stream ecosystem, including the riparian areas.

T1  - Testing Biogeographic Predictions Derived from Quaternary Island Connectivity Using Genomic Data from Mammals in the Southern Philippines
AN  - 1964260802
AB  - Island archipelagos have long piqued the attention of evolutionary biologists interested in biogeographical patterns implying processes of diversification in terrestrial vertebrates. One model island archipelago, the Philippines, has emerged as an ideal geographical theater for testing hypotheses related to a 30 year biogeographical paradigm, derived from climatic oscillations of the Pleistocene and species pump expectations. To test predictions from the Pleistocene Aggregate Island Complex (PAIC) Paradigm, we generated the first ever Rad-seq datasets of thousands of genomewide loci from forest mammals restricted to the southern portions of the archipelago. We used genomic population-level statistics and demographic model selection techniques to test assumptions of the PAIC Paradigm and predicted differences among focal taxa based on life history and ecological preferences. Predictably, our analyses revealed pronounced differences in historical population demographics of forest rodents and understory bats in terms of geographical structure of populations and gene flow among populations, suggesting taxon-specific response to climatic and environmental variation across recent evolutionary timescales. In contrast to previous inferences derived from single-locus phylogeography of the same populations, our new genomic data warn against uncritical assumptions of highly divergent, geographically structured island populations. They also suggest that individual, species-specific, idiosyncratic response of small forest mammal lineages to the geographical and environmental template may become more prevalent in structured island systems, in strong contrast to the popularly hypothesized shared mechanisms of diversification that have been so prevalent over the last century.

T1  - Ecologies of the Passions in Early Modern English Tragedies
AN  - 1875605866
AB  - Ecologies of the Passions recovers a neglected model for understanding early modern relationality, one that turns the seemingly inward experience of emotion outward toward the environment. Drawing on early modern medical texts, I argue that the period’s dramatists imagine bodies as humorally vulnerable to other bodies, both human and nonhuman, within dynamically affective environments. As such, my project illustrates the intimate configurations of human and nonhuman life in early modern tragedies. Building upon recent work in the emerging fields of ecocriticism and affect theory, I argue that the period’s dramatic literature exposes the porous fluidity of the Galenic body—its embeddedness within ecologies composed of material objects, plant life, and other bodies. More specifically, through readings of tragedies by Thomas Kyd, William Shakespeare, John Webster, and John Ford, I show that early modern playwrights dramatize a bodily fragility that is simultaneously dangerous and productive. While scholars have drawn attention to the disciplinary and gendered implications of Galenic theories of embodiment, I argue that the period’s tragedies depict bodies extending beyond their contours and transforming through intimate entanglements with human and nonhuman life. As bodies open unto one another, forming affective channels through which the liquid passions move, they expose themselves to the sometimes tender and sometimes risky touches of the world and its inhabitants.   Each chapter focuses on a different arrangement of bodies and examines how private experience brings individuals into contact with larger social and ecological networks. At the same time, I argue that the period’s medical texts, including Helkiah Crooke’s Mikrokosmographia  and Thomas Wright’s The Passions of the Minde, present the body as precariously and productively open to the exterior world. My first chapter orbits around questions of itinerant passions and disembodied sorrow in Kyd’s The Spanish Tragedy. I suggest that a disembodied understanding of sorrow inspires empathetic bonds, allowing the bereaved to merge with the deceased. In my second chapter, I argue for a conception of ecological sympathy in Shakespeare’s Titus Andronicus  through a focus on the elements, sylvan life, and interpersonal relations. Through examining the play’s interspecies relationships, I consider the possibilities and limitations of feeling for and with nonhuman life. Chapter Three explores the generative effects of mobile organs and parts in Webster’s The Duchess of Malfi. While the play acknowledges the risks involved in the lovers’ exchange of bodily parts, Webster illustrates the productive fertility of such openness by suggesting that moving organs culminate in the creation of hybrid flesh. My final chapter on Ford’s  The Broken Heart focuses on the dangers of ecological invasion. I argue that Ford engages with theories of infection and emotional contagion by dramatizing the affective movement of melancholy and the threat of corporeal permeability.

T1  - Comparative Population Genetic Structure of the Endangered Southern Brown Bandicoot, Isoodon obesulus, in Fragmented Landscapes of Southern Australia
AN  - 1782830043
AB  - Genetic connectivity is a key factor for maintaining the persistence of populations in fragmented landscapes. In highly modified landscapes such us peri-urban areas, organisms’ dispersal among fragmented habitat patches can be reduced due to the surrounding matrix, leading to subsequent decreased gene flow and increased potential extinction risk in isolated sub-populations. However, few studies have compared within species how dispersal/gene flow varies between regions and among different forms of matrix that might be encountered. In the current study, we investigated gene flow and dispersal in an endangered marsupial, the southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus) in a heavily modified peri-urban landscape in South Australia, Australia. We used 14 microsatellite markers to genotype 254 individuals which were sampled from 15 sites. Analyses revealed significant genetic structure. Our analyses also indicated that dispersal was mostly limited to neighbouring sites. Comparisons of these results with analyses of a different population of the same species revealed that gene flow/dispersal was more limited in this peri-urban landscape than in a pine plantation landscape approximately 400 km to the south-east. These findings increase our understanding of how the nature of fragmentation can lead to profound differences in levels of genetic connectivity among populations of the same species.

T1  - The influence of urban green spaces on declining bumble bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae)
AN  - 1870784009
AB  - Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are adept pollinators of countless cultivated and wild flowering plants, but many species have experienced declines in recent decades. Though urban sprawl has been implicated as a driving force of such losses, urban green spaces hold the potential to serve as habitat islands for bumble bees. As human populations continue to grow and metropolitan areas become larger, the survival of many bumble bee species will hinge on the identification and implementation of appropriate conservation measures at regional and finer scales. North Texas is home to some the fastest-growing urban areas in the country, including Denton County, as well as at least two declining bumble bee species (B. pensylvanicus and  B. fraternus). Using a combination of field, molecular DNA and GIS methods I evaluated the persistence of historic bumble bee species in Denton County, and investigated the genetic structure and connectivity of the populations in these spaces. Field sampling resulted in the discovery of both  B. pensylvanicus and B. fraternus in Denton County's urban green spaces. While the relative abundance of B. fraternus in these spaces was significantly lower than historic levels gleaned from museum records, that of B. pensylvanicus was significantly higher. Statistical analyses found that both bare ground and tree cover surrounding sample sites were negatively associated with numbers of bumble bee individuals and hives detected in these green spaces. Additionally, limited genetic structuring of bumble bee populations was detected, leading to the conclusion that extensive gene flow is occurring across populations in Denton County.

T1  - Indicators for Assessing Habitat Values and Pressures for Protected Areas-An Integrated Habitat and Land Cover Change Approach for the Udzungwa Mountains National Park in Tanzania
AN  - 1855385247; PQ0003790700
AB  - Assessing the status and monitoring the trends of land cover dynamics in and around protected areas is of utmost importance for park managers and decision makers. Moreover, to support the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)'s Strategic Action Plan including the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, such efforts are necessary to set a framework to reach the agreed national, regional or global targets. The integration of land use/cover change (LULCC) data with information on habitats and population density provides the means to assess potential degradation and disturbance resulting from anthropogenic activities such as agriculture and urban area expansion. This study assesses the LULCC over a 20 year (1990-2000-2010) period using freely available Landsat imagery and a dedicated method and toolbox for the Udzungwa Mountains National Park (UMNP) and its surroundings (20 km buffer) in Tanzania. Habitat data gathered from the Digital Observatory for Protected Areas (DOPA)'s eHabitat+ Web service were used to perform ecological stratification of the study area and to develop similarity maps of the potential presence of comparable habitat types outside the protected area. Finally, integration of the habitat similarity maps with the LULCC data was applied in order to evaluate potential pressures on the different habitats within the national park and on the linking corridors between UMNP and other protected areas in the context of wildlife movement and migration. The results show that the UMNP has not suffered from relevant human activities during the study period. The natural vegetation area has remained stable around 1780 km2. In the surrounding 20 km buffer area and the connecting corridors, however, the anthropogenic impact has been strong. Artificially built up areas increased by 14.24% over the last 20 years and the agriculture area increased from 11% in 1990 to 30% in the year 2010. The habitat functional types and the similarity maps confirmed the importance of the buffer zone and the connecting corridors for wildlife movements, while the similarity maps detected other potential corridors for wildlife.

T1  - Temporal Patterns and Environmental Correlates of Macroinvertebrate Communities in Temporary Streams
AN  - 1732311519
AB  - Temporary streams are characterised by short periods of seasonal or annual stream flow after which streams contract into waterholes or pools of varying hydrological connectivity and permanence. Although these streams are widespread globally, temporal variability of their ecology is understudied, and understanding the processes that structure community composition in these systems is vital for predicting and managing the consequences of anthropogenic impacts. We used multivariate and univariate approaches to investigate temporal variability in macroinvertebrate compositional data from 13 years of sampling across multiple sites from autumn and spring, in South Australia, the driest state in the driest inhabited continent in the world. We examined the potential of land-use, geographic and environmental variables to predict the temporal variability in macroinvertebrate assemblages, and also identified indicator taxa, that is, those highly correlated with the most significantly associated physical variables. Temporal trajectories of macroinvertebrate communities varied within site in both seasons and across years. A combination of land-use, geographic and environmental variables accounted for 24% of the variation in community structure in autumn and 27% in spring. In autumn, community composition among sites were more closely clustered together relative to spring suggesting that communities were more similar in autumn than in spring. In both seasons, community structure was most strongly correlated with conductivity and latitude, and community structure was more associated with cover by agriculture than urban land-use. Maintaining temporary streams will require improved catchment management aimed at sustaining seasonal flows and critical refuge habitats, while also limiting the damaging effects from increased agriculture and urban developments.

T1  - Effects of habitat structure, human disturbance, and habitat connectivity on urban forest bird communities
AN  - 1705405786
AB  - As urbanization accelerates, urban biodiversity conservation is becoming a great concern for the maintenance of urban ecosystem functions. In particular, forest bird communities in urban areas have been recognized as a conservation target because of their functions in food webs and ecosystem services. But our understanding of which local- and landscape-scale factors influence native bird communities within urban green spaces is still insufficient to provide managers with information for effectively planning biodiversity management programs. Here we examine how local habitat characteristics, human disturbance, and habitat connectivity influence the diversity of forest bird communities in 44 small forest patches (0.5-20.0 ha) embedded in an urbanized landscape. Patch size exerted a positive influence on the diversity of most bird functional groups, and it had the greatest effects on total abundance and species richness. The second most important factor was human disturbance. Remnant patches with lower levels of human disturbance had higher diversity than newly established patches where intense human activities occurred more frequently. In addition, vegetation complexity and habitat connectivity were positively related to total species richness and abundance, respectively, but they were less important. Management strategies for the conservation of urban forest birds, therefore, should consider not only local improvements in habitat structure - through increased patch size, reduced human disturbance, and increased vegetation complexity - but also the maintenance of habitat connectivity.

T1  - Roadside and riverside green - urban corridors in the city of Vantaa, Finland
AN  - 1680398045
AB  - The spatial distribution of biodiversity has specific patterns in urban environments. The aim of this study was to compare the ecological profiles of plants in man-made traffic corridors and natural river corridors in the city of Vantaa. The number of corridor species represented 76.3 % of Vantaa's total flora, even though corridors covered only 2.7 % of the city area. Corridor plants are mostly generalist species with wide ecological niches, and have ruderal and competitor life-strategies, while plants without occurrences in corridors are habitat specialists and species with narrow ecological niches. The conservation value of non-corridor habitats arises from the rarity of species, and the representation of the original boreal nature, while corridors contribute to the total diversity of species. The potential of corridors in urban conservation has not been fully appreciated.

T1  - Aquatic macroinvertebrate biodiversity of lowland rural and urban ponds in Leicestershire
AN  - 2312380692
AB  - Ponds are common and abundant features in nearly all landscapes typical of European lowland landscapes yet research on freshwater biodiversity has traditionally focussed on larger waterbodies such as lakes and rivers. This has led to an increased need to understand and quantify the biodiversity associated with pond habitats to better inform the active conservation and management of these small waterbodies. This thesis examines the aquatic macroinvertebrate biodiversity (alpha, beta and gamma) and conservation value of 95 ponds in Leicestershire, UK, across a variety of urban and rural landscape types and at a range of spatial scales. In addition, the relative importance of local (physicochemical and biological) and spatial (connectivity) variables in structuring macroinvertebrate communities within ponds is investigated. At a regional scale, the greatest macroinvertebrate biodiversity and conservation value was recorded within meadow ponds compared to urban, agricultural and forest ponds. Spatially, ponds were highly physically and biologically heterogeneous. Temporally (seasonally), invertebrate communities were most dissimilar in meadow and agricultural ponds but assemblages were similar in urban and forest ponds. In urban landscapes, park ponds supported a greater diversity of invertebrates than other urban or garden ponds and typically had a greater conservation value. Garden ponds were the most taxon poor of those investigated. Perennial floodplain meadow ponds supported a greater biodiversity of invertebrates compared to ephemeral meadow ponds although conservation value was similar. Despite regular inundation from the River Soar, ephemeral ponds supported distinct communities compared to perennial meadow ponds. Aquatic macrophytes supported a higher diversity of taxa than other pond mesohabitats across all landscapes studied. Physicochemical factors were identified to be the dominant influence on macroinvertebrate assemblages although, a combination of local and spatial factors best explained the variation in community composition at a regional scale and for meadow ponds. Spatial factors were not identified to significantly influence urban pond communities. This study highlights the ecological importance and conservation value of ponds in rural and anthropogenically disturbed landscapes. Recognition of the significant contribution of ponds to freshwater biodiversity at regional and landscape scales is important for future conservation of pond habitats and will help focus and direct conservation strategies to where they are needed most.

T1  - Population genomic inference of ecology, conservation, evolution, and demographic history of Atlantic seahorses and pipefishes (Syngnathidae)
AN  - 1660199883
AB  - In the Atlantic Ocean powerful directional ocean currents can play a significant role in the formation and persistence of marine species. Syngnathidae fishes have a sparse fossil record, high morphological plasticity, and many of these species are difficult to observe in the wild, therefore they frequently lack life history information and the status of regional lineages and species designations are often obscure. In this dissertation I explore the ecology, evolution, and conservation of primarily Atlantic seahorses (Hippocampus) and pipefish (Syngnathus) in four core chapters, using differing genetic datasets ranging from mitochondrial DNA to genome-wide RAD sequences. Most Synganthids have the potential to disperse passively by rafting on floating vegetation, and are direct developers, which is thought to limit their active mobility, yet many species have widespread distributions. The majority of genetic research on Syngnathids fishes has focused on Indo-Pacific species, however the Atlantic Ocean is home to dozens of species of pipefishes from nine genera and roughly 1/5th of the world's seahorses species. In Chapter 1, I use six loci to infer the species tree for all Atlantic seahorses and infer the demographic history and evolution of the "Hippocampus erectus complex." The results of this study support the establishment of an ancestral population of the H. erectus complex in the Americas, followed by the Amazon River outflow splitting it into Caribbean/North American H. erectus and South American H. patagonicus at a time of increased sedimentation and outflow. Following this split, colonization occurred across the Atlantic via the Gulf Stream currents with subsequent trans-Atlantic isolation. Based on the results of Chapter 1, the species H. erectus exhibited a panmictic genetic structure from Latin America to temperate New York waters. However, inhabitants of the temperate region are considered by some ecologists to be tropical vagrants that only arrive during warm seasons from the southern provinces and perish as temperatures decline. Contrary to the findings of Chapter 1, in Chapter 2, I use thousands of RADseq loci and show strong support that temperate inhabitants are genetically diverged from southern populations and are composed of an isolated and persistent ancestral gene pool. The aim of Chapter 3 is to investigate how major current forces as well as climatic and geographic processes have shaped the evolutionary and demographic history of western Atlantic seahorses (Hippocampus) and pipefishes (Syngnathus). This Chapter takes a comparative approach across five codistributed species (two seahorses and three pipefishes). Genomic patterns of subpopulation divergence and post-divergence gene flow may be shared amongst fish species with similar life history traits, however ecological differences (i.e., macroclimatic tolerance and rafting propensity) may impact the rates of gene exchange and/or isolation times between subpopulations. The result of this study show how directional ocean currents and the life history trait of rafting propensity impacts population divergence and connectivity, and predicts gene flow directionality and magnitude in four out of five of the focal taxa. Lastly in Chapter 4, I use a molecular forensics approach to track the U.S. dried seahorse trade. Due to global exploitation, the genus Hippocampus are the only fish to have all species listed under the Convention of International trade of endangered species (CITES). Millions of individuals are traded each year for the use in traditional Chinese medicine as well as for souvenirs and crafts. Using "DNA barcoding," while mentoring high school and undergraduate students, we identified and compared specimens collected from two primary U.S. dried seahorse end-markets: 1) traditional Chinese medicine and, 2) Internet and coastal souvenir retailers. The results of this study found a significant contrast in both the species composition and size of individuals being sold between each market.

T1  - A survey of vascular epiphyte species of the urban area of Palmeira das Miss?es, RS, Brazil
AN  - 1673125456
AB  - Wooded parks and squares are refuges of nature in urban areas, which contribute to the conservation of biodiversity, working frequently as small ecological corridors. The presence of certain epiphytic species in the urban area assists in the evaluation of the environmental quality of both the city and its surroundings. We conducted a qualitative survey of species vascular epiphytes in urban areas of Palmeira das Missões, Rio Grande do Sul State, including the main squares, the Municipal Park and the campus of the Universidade Federal de Santa Maria. We found eight species of angiosperms and six species of pteridophytes, mostly species of broad ecological spectrum. A rare species in the State was recorded in the study. These results represent a contribution to knowledge of plant biodiversity in urban areas and forest fragments in the Northern of Rio Grande do Sul

T1  - Triangle Communications Issues Community Challenge
AN  - 1540736658
AB  - All it takes sometimes is a conversation to plant a seed and start a movement. In the case of Triangle Communications, that seed was an industry conference on broadband and economic development that led the company earlier this year to issue a Connected Community Challenge aimed at local business leaders. The initiative was designed to generate a discussion on the role of broadband in rural Montana. Triangle Communications offered two, one-time $2,500 grants as incentive to get community partners to sit down and talk about broadband technology and its role in economic development. According to the program rules, the awards can be used to cover some of the costs associated with hosting a technology fair or conference; marketing that promotes broadband connectivity using digital media or community signage; expanded public access and computer centers; digital literacy opportunities and technology use for business and community members; or other locally identified actions.

T1  - Identifying Man-Made Objects Along Urban Road Corridors From Mobile LiDAR Data
AN  - 1467624975
AB  - This letter is dedicated to a generic approach for the automated detection and classification of man-made objects in urban corridors from point clouds acquired by vehicle-borne mobile laser scanning (MLS). The approach is designed based on a priori knowledge in urban areas: 1) man-made objects feature geometric regularity such as vertical planar structures (e.g., building facades), whereas vegetation reveals huge diversity in shape and point distribution and 2) different types of urban man-made objects can be characterized by the point extension and the height above the ground level. Therefore, MLS-based point clouds are first divided into three layers with respect to the vertical height. In each layer, seed points of man-made objects are indicated by a line filter in the footprints of off-ground objects, which is generated by binarizing the spatial accumulation map of the point clouds. These seed points are further classified by examining in which layers the seed points of objects are found. Finally, points belonging to respective objects can be retrieved based on the classified seed points. The experiments show that various man-made objects on both sides of the street can be well detected, with a detection rate of up to 83%. For the classification of detected urban objects, overall accuracy of 92.37% can be achieved. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Consequences of landscape change on riverine food webs and aquatic-terrestrial linkages
AN  - 1764436787
AB  - River ecosystems are composed of a spatially and temporally heterogeneous matrix of aquatic, semi-aquatic, and terrestrial elements that are highly coupled via physical, chemical, and biotic linkages. Food webs in river ecosystems reflect this complexity as they can be highly variable over space and time and are characterized by longitudinal (upstream-downstream) and lateral (aquatic-terrestrial) connectivity, which provides energetic resources (e.g., nutrients, organic matter) to consumers in adjacent habitats. Food webs relate information about diversity, community composition, and ecosystem function. However, spatially-explicit food-web data remain scarce for river ecosystems and, thus, environmental determinants of food-web structure remain largely unresolved. In particular, anthropogenic gradients relating to river regulation and land-cover change disrupt hydrogeomorphic regimes, influence water quality, and alter fundamental properties of river ecosystems with potential consequences for cross-boundary linkages and food-web dynamics. At 12 riverine landscape study sites distributed along an urban-rural gradient of the Scioto River system, Ohio, I investigated the influence of anthropogenic and natural environmental factors on (1) reciprocal aquatic-terrestrial invertebrate flux dynamics, (2) trophic structure and food-chain length (FCL) of fish food webs, and (3) the contribution of aquatically-derived energy to terrestrial food webs.   Anthropogenic impacts relating to modified riparian landscape composition, water quality, and dams, as well as natural gradients in river size exerted strong influences on river food webs. A landscape composition gradient from urbanization to grassland-dominated riparian land cover explained patterns in aquatic insect emergence and terrestrial invertebrate inputs to the river. In particular, urban landscapes were positively associated with reduced emergence flux density and biomass and reduced biomass of terrestrial inputs, whereas riparian grasslands were negatively associated with these factors. Fish food webs were characterized by fewer predator species and smaller-bodied prey above dams than below while FCL was shorter above dammed reaches (3.88) than below (4.19). Fish FCL also responded positively to natural gradients in river size (e.g., channel width) ranging from 3.66 -4.13 at narrower reaches to 4.24 - 4.35 at the widest reaches. Aquatic energy represented a considerable contribution to terrestrial consumers that forage across different spatial scales ranging from sedentary shoreline tetragnathid spiders (76% from aquatic) to riparian swallows (67% from aquatic) and raccoons (59%) that forage over 100s to 1000s of meters. Moreover, terrestrial consumers relied on both benthic algae (33% reliance across all consumers) and phytoplankton (32% reliance), highlighting the importance of separate aquatic energy pathways to terrestrial food webs in mid-size river systems.   Collectively, my results indicate that anthropogenic changes to rivers can have appreciable impacts on riverine food webs. Additionally, I have shown that aquatic energy, in addition to terrestrially-derived energy, can fuel terrestrial food webs in mid-sized rivers and that the aquatic energetic signature can extend further from the river than previously considered. Finally, because of the inherent relationship between food webs and ecosystem function and stability, I anticipate results from this research will contribute to the ongoing development of a more holistic and functional approach to management and conservation of river-riparian ecosystems in the face of increasing anthropogenic influences.

T1  - Maximizing ecological and social benefits of habitat restoration in the Lower Duwamish River: A spatial framework for site selection
AN  - 1621408750
AB  - The Lower Duwamish River (LDR) estuary is an 11-mile stretch of river that contains the core of industrial activity in the Seattle area. As the city's only river, the LDR also provides important habitat for many of the region's valued fish and wildlife species. However, its long history of urban development and industrial activity has polluted and degraded the river, and significant habitat restoration is now required under federal and state law. Given the highly developed urban industrial setting of the LDR, habitat restoration projects tend to be small and opportunistic, with limited ecological value. At the same time, the LDR is home to several underserved urban neighborhoods, and restoration projects have the potential to bring significant social value to these communities. Maximizing this potential value together with ecological value requires a more strategic approach to restoration. Through a review of local and regional planning documents, I developed a list of community-defined characteristics that contribute to a restoration project's potential ecological and social value in the LDR. I then used these characteristics to explore the spatial distribution of potential restoration value in the river, creating a series of heat maps of potential value for each characteristic, and for overall potential ecological and social value. I developed six ecological metrics and eight social metrics, which I calculated for 511 waterfront parcels in the LDR. Results show more variability with positive skewness in the ecological index, and a more normal distribution with higher average values in the social index. Spatial analysis revealed higher ecological value in the northern, industrial section of the LDR, with particular dependence on the existing habitat network. Social value was higher in the southern section and as the river passes through residential neighborhoods. These results can inform site selection for future restoration projects in the LDR. Methodologies and results for individual metrics can be used to address project-specific objectives, while use of the complete collection can inform those restoration projects that seek to maximize overall ecological and social benefits in the LDR.

T1  - Performance Analysis of Random Waypoint Mobile Model Based on Asymptotic Spatial Distribution Theory
AN  - 1551049183; 20049177
AB  - This study analyses the performance of the random waypoint mobile model in mobile sensor network based on asymptotic spatial distribution theory, which is mainly aimed at analyzing the connectivity and coverage performances of the network, in order to obtain the maximized coverage with connectivity performance. Meanwhile, it also analyses the relationship between the length of the longest edge of the Minimum Spanning Tree and the minimum transmission distance of node in Geometric Random Graphs and provides the minimum transmission distance of mobile sensor network for ensuring connectivity. Finally, the theoretical analysis results are verified based on the method of experimental simulation, which shows that, the bigger the number of the node, the more consistent the results of theoretical analysis and experimental result, higher reliability.

T1  - Ecological corridors also operate in an urban matrix: A test case with garden shrews
AN  - 1419027314
AB  - The fragmentation of landscapes, induced by the growing urbanisation, is a major cause of biodiversity loss. Ecological corridors are landscape elements that make up for the negative effects of habitat fragmentation in agricultural or natural landscapes. However, their effectiveness have been rarely assess in an urban context. To do so, we analysed shrews in woodlots, corridors and domestic gardens that are connected or disconnected from a corridor. Indeed, these mammals are very sensitive to fragmentation and could play an important ecological role even in small and isolated areas such as domestic gardens. Ninety-seven shrews, from three species were trapped. In our study, Sorex coronatus, Sorex minutus and Crocidura russula were not widely distributed and mainly occurred in woodlots, corridors and connected gardens. In gardens, shrew occurrences were mainly determined by landscape configuration with negative effects of the distance to the corridor and the distance to the woodlot, stronger for C.russula than Sorex species. At the local scale, garden management and vegetation showed a positive effect mainly for Sorex species. The quality of gardens seems good enough to permit the co-occurrence of several species of shrews and thus competition was not identified as a major process for determining the occurrence. We showed that, as in other ecosystems, ecological corridors in urban context can play an effective role for the distribution of organisms with low dispersal capabilities and should be develop in planning strategies.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Influence of human population size and the built environment on avian assemblages in urban green spaces
AN  - 1419027200
AB  - While studies of how habitat patch dynamics structures avian communities in urban environments has received some attention, there is considerably less known of how the built environment and human population size may influence the structuring of urban bird communities. We investigated bird populations in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (U.S.A.) through replicated point count surveys of breeding birds in 50 parks and cemeteries of varying sizes. We counted 4,435 individual birds in 441 counts. Of the 61 species detected, 27 were rare (detected at <8 points). Migratory species accounted for 46.1 % of all individuals, while 23.2 % of all individuals were of introduced species. Species richness increased significantly with green area size, as did the number of rare species. Species diversity decreased significantly with an increase in the proportion of individuals of introduced species; in particular, cavity nesters were less abundant when introduced species were present. Elements of the built urban environment including commercial development and transportation corridors were associated with significant reductions in park-wide species richness, mean number of species per point, and mean number of individual birds recorded per point. Human population size was positively related to increased numbers of individuals of introduced species, but a lower mean number of species per point. Ours is among the first to identify specific relationships between avian population characteristics and human population size, as few other studies have specifically incorporated human population size into a local, fine grain study design. Our data suggest that human population size is an important parameter that can be measured independently of characteristics of the built environment and the physical characteristics of the park itself as a correlate of avian diversity and abundance. Our study points to a variety of trade-offs needed to manage habitat for birds in urban settings.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Limited Urban Growth: London's Street Network Dynamics since the 18th Century
AN  - 1430257496
AB  - We investigate the growth dynamics of Greater London defined by the administrative boundary of the Greater London Authority, based on the evolution of its street network during the last two centuries. This is done by employing a unique dataset, consisting of the planar graph representation of nine time slices of Greater London's road network spanning 224 years, from 1786 to 2010. Within this time-frame, we address the concept of the metropolitan area or city in physical terms, in that urban evolution reveals observable transitions in the distribution of relevant geometrical properties. Given that London has a hard boundary enforced by its long standing green belt, we show that its street network dynamics can be described as a fractal space-filling phenomena up to a capacitated limit, whence its growth can be predicted with a striking level of accuracy. This observation is confirmed by the analytical calculation of key topological properties of the planar graph, such as the topological growth of the network and its average connectivity. This study thus represents an example of a strong violation of Gibrat's law. In particular, we are able to show analytically how London evolves from a more loop-like structure, typical of planned cities, toward a more tree-like structure, typical of self-organized cities. These observations are relevant to the discourse on sustainable urban planning with respect to the control of urban sprawl in many large cities which have developed under the conditions of spatial constraints imposed by green belts and hard urban boundaries.

T1  - Water quality, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in ponds across an urban land-use gradient in birmingham, u.k
AN  - 1512400480
AB  - The ecology of ponds is threatened by urbanisation and as cities expand pond habitats are disappearing at an alarming rate. Pond communities are structured by local (water quality, physical) and regional (land-use, connectivity) processes. Since ca1904 >80% of ponds in Birmingham, U.K., have been lost due to land-use intensification, resulting in an increasingly diffuse network. A survey of thirty urban ponds revealed high spatial and temporal variability in water quality, which frequently failed environmental standards. Most were eutrophic, although macrophyte-rich, well connected ponds supported macroinvertebrate assemblages of high conservation value. Statistically, local physical variables (e.g. shading) explained more variation, both in water quality and macroinvertebrate community composition than regional factors. Nonetheless, habitat availability within the wider landscape was important. Ecosystem functioning (leaf-litter breakdown) along a rural-urban gradient was confounded by habitat area, despite a decrease in functional redundancy. Ponds are identified that promote network connectivity and management of land-use within 100m may buffer against diffuse pollution with reductions in riparian shading required to improve growth conditions for oxygenating vegetation and to reduce nutrient levels. The results indicate that many urban ponds are threatened habitats that require active management to protect and restore water quality, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

T1  - Uncorrected land-use planning highlighted by flooding: the Alba case study (Piedmont, Italy)
AN  - 1033206141
AB  - Alba is a town of over 30 000 inhabitants located along the Tanaro River (Piedmont, northwestern Italy) and is famous for its wine and white truffles. Many important industries and companies are based in Alba, including the famous confectionery group Ferrero.

              
The town suffered considerably from a flood that occurred on 5-6 November 1994. Forty-eight percent of the urban area was inundated, causing severe damage and killing nine people. After the flood, the Alba area was analysed in detail to determine the reasons for its vulnerability.

              
Information on serious floods in this area since 1800 was gathered from official records, state technical office reports, unpublished documents in the municipal archives, and articles published in local and national newspapers. Maps, plans and aerial photographs (since 1954) were examined to reconstruct Alba's urban development over the last two centuries and the planform changes of the Tanaro River.

              
The results were compared with the effects of the November 1994 flood, which was mapped from aerial photographs taken immediately after the flood, field surveys and eyewitness reports.

              
The territory of Alba was subdivided into six categories: residential; public service; industrial, commercial and hotels; sports areas, utilities and standards (public gardens, parks, athletics grounds, private and public sport clubs); aggregate plants and dumps; and agriculture and riverine strip. The six categories were then grouped into three classes with different flooding-vulnerability levels according to various parameters. Using GIS, the three river corridors along the Tanaro identified by the Autorità di Bacino del Fiume Po were overlaid on the three classes to produce a final map of the risk areas.

              
This study shows that the historic floods and their dynamics have not been duly considered in the land-use planning of Alba. The zones that were most heavily damaged in the 1994 flood were those that were frequently affected in the past and sites of more recent urbanisation. Despite recurrent severe flooding of the Tanaro River and its tributaries, areas along the riverbed and its paleochannels have been increasingly used for infrastructure and building (e.g., roads, a municipal dump, a prison, natural aggregate plants, a nomad camp), which has often interfered with the natural spread of the floodwaters. Since the 1994 flood, many remedial projects have been completed along the Tanaro and its tributaries, including levees, bank protection, concrete walls and floodway channels. In spite of these costly projects, some areas remain at high risk for flooding.

              
The method used, which considered historical data, river corridors identified by hydraulic calculations, geomorphological aspects and land-use planning, can indicate with good accuracy flood-prone areas and in consequence to be an useful tool for the coherent planning of urban expansion and the mitigation of flood risk.

T1  - Urban impacts on tropical island streams: Some key aspects influencing ecosystem response
AN  - 1015638999
AB  - Issue Title: Special Section: Urban Rivers              Improving our understanding of the impacts of urbanization on tropical island streams is critical as urbanization becomes a dominant feature in tropical areas. Although the "urban stream syndrome" has been successful in summarizing urban impacts on streams, the response of some island streams is different to that expected. Here we review available information on urban impacts to tropical island streams and describe unique responses to urbanization. We identified three key aspects that play particularly important or unique roles in determining tropical-island stream integrity: biotic response to water pollution, movement barriers along the stream network, and altered geomorphology that results in habitat loss. As expected, water pollution negatively impacts stream ecosystems in tropical islands and in some regions impacts can be severe, as untreated wastewaters are directly discharged into streams. While aquatic insects show the expected responses to pollution, other native fauna (e.g., shrimps and fishes) appear to be less impacted by moderate levels of pollution. Movement barriers along the stream network are especially important as much of the tropical island fauna have diadromous (either amphidromous or catadromous) life histories. Most native freshwater mollusks, shrimps, and fishes inhabiting tropical islands are diadromous and depend on unimpeded connections between freshwater and marine environments to complete their life cycles. The presence of these species in urban streams is best explained by longitudinal connectivity rather than by the degree of urban impact. Finally, in streams that remain connected to marine environments, the presence of native shrimps and fishes is strongly related to the physical habitat. Fish assemblages in channelized and severely altered stream reaches are almost completely devoid of native fauna and tend to be dominated by non-native species. In contrast, relatively diverse shrimp and fish assemblages can be found in reaches that retain their physical habitat complexity, even when they are impacted by urbanization. Our understanding of urban impacts on tropical island streams remains limited. However, the identification of key aspects can help us better understand urban impacts on streams in tropical islands, and best focus our management and research efforts to protect these unique ecosystems.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Population dynamics and occupancy patterns of Eastern screech owls (<i>Megascops asio</i>) in New York City parks and adjacent suburbs
AN  - 931548247
AB  - Eastern screech owls (Megascops asio) are one of the few raptor species that permanently reside in New York City (NYC).  To better inform management of this charismatic species in urban parks, I sought to determine the present status and future viability of existing screech owl populations in NYC and identify potential landscape characteristics that affect park occupancy by screech owls.  Using captive, non-releasable owls and isolated free-living owls, I developed a method of identifying individual screech owls via vocalization analysis.  Using call-broadcast surveys and subsequent recording of owl responses, I gathered capture-recapture histories of urban owls in three NYC parks and one comparison nature preserve, the Mianus River Gorge Preserve (MRGP), a rural/suburban nature preserve in Bedford, NY.  These histories were used to estimate abundance and survival rate in each of the parks.  I then projected simulated populations using my estimated adult survival and previously published yearling survival and reproductive rates.  I built my projection model to include density dependence based on park area, realistic sex ratio fluctuations, and periodic drops in survival rate due to hypothetical environmental events.  Survival in urban parks was 0.98–1.0, much greater than in the MRGP, 0.57 ± 0.15.  Despite the high adult survival, populations in parks could be extirpated within 10–20 years by severe drops in survival rate (e.g., extreme winters, storms, or secondary poisoning) if such conditions occurred more often than once every ten years or if parks were smaller than 1.0km2.       In 2008 and 2009, my colleagues and I conducted a citizen science-based study on screech owl occupancy patterns across three counties adjacent to NYC: Westchester and Putnam, NY, and Fairfield, CT.  Volunteers conducted call-broadcast surveys on their own properties and sent my colleagues and me the results in 2008 and 2009.  Occupancy and detection were modeled as functions of the amount of forest cover and impervious surface cover at each survey point.  These models were validated against an independent dataset collected by myself and other trained scientists.  Validated models indicated a negative association between occupancy and percent forest cover or, similarly, a positive association with percent impervious cover. Both the citizen science and the systematic datasets supported similar owl-habitat patterns of higher occupancy probabilities in developed areas compared to rural.     The above patterns described eastern screech owl habitat use in rural and suburban areas outside of NYC.  I hypothesized that at some point urbanization would become too intense for owls to tolerate,  and they would be primarily relegated to protected greenspaces in extremely urbanized cities, as I observed in NYC.  In 2010, I surveyed 13 additional parks in NYC and the more urban southern sections of Westchester to characterize occupancy patterns in highly urban areas.  I used similar landscape measurements as in the citizen science study, only these measurements were taken across the entire park.  Occupancy appeared to decline sharply if the percent impervious cover surrounding a park rose above 50–60%.  I interpreted this pattern as evidence that high urbanization around a park acts primarily as a barrier to immigration.  It is also possible that high urbanization around a park leads to higher mortality from vehicles.           In terms of management, my work has indicated that in large parks (e.g., >1km2), extinction probability is relatively low, but parks larger than 3km2 may be less suitable if big parks allow the establishment of larger raptors such as barred (Strix varia ) or great horned owls (Bubo virginianus).  Managers can enhance population persistence by increasing the amount of available habitat via habitat restoration and reforesting or re-meadowing developed but unused parks (e.g., large lawns and paved areas) and increasing over-winter survival and reproductive rates by installing nest boxes.  However, frequent chance events can extirpate any park-bound population, and thus managers and city planners should also look to enhance the probability of dispersal and recolonization via corridors or reducing the general level of urbanization around protected parks.

T1  - Long-term Effects of Fire Hazard Reduction Treatments in the Southern Cascades and Northern Sierra Nevada, California
AN  - 1322974496
AB  - Treating wildland fuels to reduce wildfire hazards has become a primary focus of contemporary forest management, particularly in the wildland-urban interface. The specific objectives of treatment are diverse, but in general, treatments address accumulated surface fuels, the fuel ladders that carry fire into the forest canopy, and surface and canopy fuel continuity.  This dissertation uses a chronosequence of treated stands to examine the temporal influence of treatment on forest structure, the understory plant community, and wildfire hazard.     The first chapter examines the effects of fuels reduction treatment on stand structure, overstory species composition, and ground and surface fuels. The stand structures and reduced surface fuel loads created by fuels modification are temporary, yet few studies have assessed the lifespan of treatment effects. The structural legacies of treatment were still present in the oldest treatment sites. Treatments reduced site occupancy (stand density and basal area) and increased quadratic mean diameter by approximately 50%. The contribution of shade-tolerant true firs to stand density was also reduced by treatment. Other stand characteristics, particularly timelag fuel loads, seedling density, and shrub cover, exhibited substantial variability, and differences between treatment age classes and between treatment and control groups were not statistically significant.      The second chapter evaluates fuel treatment longevity based on potential wildfire behavior and effects on vegetation. Forest managers must divide scarce resources between fuel treatment maintenance, which is necessary to retain low hazard conditions in treated stands, and the construction of new treatments. Yet the most basic questions concerning the lifespan of treatment effectiveness have rarely been engaged in the literature. In this study, field-gathered fuels and vegetation data were used to aid fuel model selection and to parameterize a fire behavior and effects model, Fuels Management Analyst Plus. In addition, a semi-qualitative, semi-quantitative protocol was applied to assess ladder fuel hazard in field sampling plots. Untreated sites exhibited fire behavior that would challenge wildfire suppression efforts, and projected overstory mortality was considerable. In contrast, estimated fire behavior and severity were low to moderate in even the oldest fuel treatments, those sampled 8-26 years after treatment implementation. Findings indicate that in the forest types characteristic of the northern Sierra Nevada and southern Cascades, treatments for wildfire hazard reduction retain their effectiveness for more than 10-15 years and possibly beyond a quarter century.     Fuel treatment activities disturb the forest floor, increase resource availability, and may introduce non-native plant propagules to forest stands. Non-native plant invasions can have profound consequences for ecosystem structure and function. For these reasons, there is concern that treatment for fire hazard reduction may promote invasion by exotic species. Several short-term studies have shown small increases in non-native abundance as a result of treatment, but the long-term effects have rarely been addressed in the literature. The final chapter examines treatment effects on the understory plant community and on cover of the forest floor, as mineral soil exposure has been linked to invasion. Regression tree analysis provided insights into the influence of treatment and site characteristics on these variables. Treatments increased forb and graminoid cover, but temporal trends in abundance were opposite. An initial increase in forb cover in the most recently treated sites was followed by a gradual decline, while mean graminoid cover was highest in the oldest treatments. Shrubs dominated live plant abundance. Shrub cover showed few temporal trends, but was negatively associated with canopy cover. Mineral soil exposure was increased by treatment and declined slowly over time, remaining elevated in the oldest treatments. Non-native plant species were very rare in the treatment sites sampled in this study. Despite the availability of bare mineral soil and the proximity of transportation corridors, a source of non-native propagules, non-natives were recorded in only 2% of sampling plots. This study suggests that forest disturbance associated with treatment for hazardous fuels reduction may not produce significant invasions in these forest types.  (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

T1  - Bat ecology and public health surveillance for rabies in an urbanizing region of Colorado
AN  - 1012762559
AB  - We describe use of Fort Collins, Colorado, and nearby areas by bats in 2001-2005, and link patterns in bat ecology with concurrent public health surveillance for rabies. Our analyses are based on evaluation of summary statistics, and information-theoretic support for results of simple logistic regression. Based on captures in mist nets, the city bat fauna differed from that of the adjacent mountains, and was dominated by big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus). Species, age, and sex composition of bats submitted for rabies testing locally and along the urbanizing Front Range Corridor were similar to those of the mist-net captures and reflected the annual cycle of reproduction and activity of big brown bats. Few submissions occurred November- March, when these bats hibernated elsewhere. In summer females roosted in buildings in colonies and dominated health samples; fledging of young corresponded to a summer peak in health submissions with no increase in rabies prevalence. Roosting ecology of big brown bats in buildings was similar to that reported for natural sites, including colony size, roost-switching behavior, fidelity to roosts in a small area, and attributes important for roost selection. Attrition in roosts occurred from structural modifications of buildings to exclude colonies by citizens, but without major effects on long-term bat reproduction or survival. Bats foraged in areas set aside for nature conservation. A pattern of lower diversity in urban bat communities with dominance by big brown bats may occur widely in the USA, and is consistent with national public health records for rabies surveillance.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Forest soils adjacent to urban interstates: Soil physical and chemical properties, heavy metals, disturbance legacies, and relationships with woody vegetation
AN  - 1012762439
AB  - While urban ecology is an expanding field of study, some natural areas within the urban environment remain under-examined. These include naturally regenerating forest communities adjacent to urban interstates. In addition, the status of interstate soils and their relationships with the community composition of forested interstate verges has received little ecological study. The purpose of this study was to examine variation in soil conditions along forested interstate corridors in Louisville, KY and to explore the extent to which soil characteristics (e.g., bulk density, pH) and heavy metals (e.g., Pb, Zn) vary with respect to three factors: interstate (e.g., traffic density), surrounding urban environment (e.g., industrial land use), and interstate construction legacies. Additionally, we explored the relationships between several edaphic factors and woody vegetation structure in these forested verges. We found that the degree and direction of the slope of land towards the interstate and the distance to the interstate pavement were strong determinants of soil characteristics and heavy metal concentrations, suggesting that the movement of de-icing salts, heavy metals, and other pollutants from the interstate was important in determining forest soil conditions along urban interstates. Since within our study area these highways did not extend into rural lands, variation in urban land uses and cover within 26 km of the city center was not large enough to explain variation in soil characteristics or heavy metals, except for a positive correlation between chromium and surrounding industrial land use. We did find that past physical soil disturbance caused by interstate construction (e.g., imported fill) left an important legacy on soil characteristics, heavy metal retention, and woody plant growth patterns in forests adjacent to urban interstates. The legacy of interstate construction on the current forest community structure (e.g., lower species richness) and the future forest (e.g., reduced tree regeneration) may further alter ecosystem productivity and ecosystem services provided by these forests and their soils.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Impact of Upstream Urbanization on the Urban Heat Island Effects along the Washington-Baltimore Corridor
AN  - 905849908
AB  - Although there has been considerable research on urban heat island (UHI) effects, most of the previous studies have attributed UHI effects to localized, surface processes. In this study, the impact of upstream urbanization on enhanced UHI effects is examined using surface observations and numerical simulations of an extreme UHI event that occurred on 9 July 2007 over Baltimore, Maryland. Under southwesterly wind, Baltimore experienced higher peak surface temperatures and higher pollution concentrations than did the larger urban area of Washington, D.C. Results from a coupled ultrahigh-resolution mesoscale-urban canopy model with 2001 National Land Cover Data showan advective contribution from upstream urbanization to the UHI event. This dynamical process is demonstrated by replacing Baltimore or its upstream urban areas by natural vegetation (in the model), indicating that the UHI effects could be reduced by as much as 25%. An analysis of the urban-bay interaction reveals the importance of horizontal wind direction in determining the intensity of bay breezes and the urban boundary layer structures. In addition, the vertical growth and structures of UHI effects are shown as layered "hot plumes" in the mixed layer with pronounced rising motions, and these plumes can be advected many kilometers downstream. These findings suggest that judicious land use and urban planning, especially in rapidly developing countries, could help to alleviate UHI consequences, including heat stress and smog. They also have important implications for improving the prediction of urban weather, including the initiation of moist convection, air quality, and other environment-related problems.

T1  - Stormwater basins of the New Jersey coastal plain: Subsidies or sinks for frogs and toads?
AN  - 884901231
AB  - Stormwater basins are commonly employed structures designed to mitigate the negative effects of urban runoff. They are ubiquitous in the urbanized landscape; yet the effect of these basins on anurans has only recently been addressed. Stormwater basins have the potential to influence the breeding distribution of anurans by being sources for some species and sinks for others. Our study aims to determine which species benefit from the existence of stormwater basins, which species are negatively impacted, and what variables are the best predictors of these effects. We monitored thirty-six permanently-ponded basins in southern New Jersey for the presence of anuran larvae and calling males by aural surveys, dip-netting and trapping. We assessed fish presence by interviews, visual encounters, dip-netting, and traps. We divided near shore buffer areas into impervious surface and managed or unmanaged categories for both grass and woody vegetation. Two connectivity metrics, distance to canopied corridor and percent of undeveloped upland were analyzed with ArcGIS. Fish were detected in 92% of the basins. Resistance to fish predation distinguished successful species, those with larvae present, from unsuccessful species, those with calling activity but no larval presence. Connectivity to and availability of terrestrial habitat were significant predictors of the breeding species richness at the basins. Number of calling species increased as access to and amount of terrestrial habitat increased. Therefore, design, management, and placement of permanently-ponded basins can impact anuran communities. Additionally, as wet basins are sources for Rana catesbeiana, where bullfrogs are invasive, basins will likely increase propagule pressure.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The influence of riparian corridor width on ant and plant assemblages in northern Sydney, Australia
AN  - 853047260
AB  - Protecting riparian corridors is a commonly applied environmental policy in urban landscapes. However, empirical data demonstrating their efficacy for biodiversity conservation outcomes is scarce. In this study we investigated whether riparian corridor width influences the diversity and community structure of ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and vascular plant assemblages therein. Eighteen corridors of differing widths were selected from within the Ku-ring-gai Local Government Area, Sydney Australia. Ants were sampled using pitfall traps positioned within rectangular vegetation transects (30×10 m). Both ant and plant species richness, when standardised for sampling effort, were unrelated to riparian corridor width. However, significant compositional differences between sites were evident with increased width up to ~50 m. Narrow corridors contained greater abundances of opportunistic ant species and higher proportions of exotic plants. We interpret this to be the result of the greater disturbance/edge influence derived from adjacent upland urban environments. Site beta diversity did not increase with corridor width, suggesting that the exclusion of novel upslope habitats in narrow riparian corridors is not a significant cause of community assemblage modification at these sites. To minimise the impact of deleterious edge effects on ant fauna, environmental managers should seek to retain riparian corridors wider than ~50 m. However, we observed substantial between-site variability of biotic assemblages, irrespective of corridor width. Therefore we recommend that environmental management practice needs to take a catchment-wide approach and consider other parameters that may contribute to riparian health so as to optimise the protection of riparian biodiversity.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Survival and recruitment of semi-aquatic turtles in an urbanized region
AN  - 613356478
AB  - Turtles are long-lived organisms that require high survivorship to maintain stable populations. Additionally, turtles are thought to be particularly susceptible to negative effects associated with anthropogenic habitat modification such as increased presence of human-subsidized predators and increased road mortality. Recruitment may also be reduced in populations surrounded by developed landscapes because of high road densities which limits connectivity among habitats or because of limited nesting sites. To address the impacts of habitat development on turtle vital rates, we studied three species of semi-aquatic turtles, yellowbelly sliders (Trachemys scripta), eastern mud turtles (Kinosternon subrubrum), and common snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina), in the urbanized Charlotte-metropolitan area of North Carolina. Mark-recapture data were analyzed in Program MARK using AIC model selection methods to evaluate models analyzing the effects of pond, sex, and time on both survivorship and recruitment rates. Our results yielded high survivorship estimates for sliders and snapping turtles (73-92.5% and 91.4-99.4%, respectively), indicating that these species were likely not severely affected by habitat modification. In contrast, mud turtles exhibited lower survivorship estimates (56.8-73.6%) than have been previously documented for this species, an observation we attribute to their reliance on terrestrial habitats where they may encounter greater densities of mesopredators in developed areas. Recruitment estimates indicated that most populations were subsidized by sizable additions each year, with the notable exception of snapping turtles whose movement may be limited by increased road densities. Our results suggest that anthropogenic habitat modification has species-specific effects and could imperil certain populations in urbanized areas. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - <em>Musca domestica</em> L. (Diptera: Muscidae) Dispersal from and <em>Escherichia coli</em> O157:H7 Prevalence on Dairies in North-central Florida
AN  - 911740792
AB  - House fly, Musca domestica L., dispersal up to 3 km from a dairy release site into a nearby town was documented in this study. Dispersal occurred by both direct flight across multiple, mixed habitat types including open fields with interspersed tree copses, and by corridors and edges provided by local roads. Marked flies were collected at an adjacent dairy, and at most traps that were set along two well-travelled roads connecting the dairies and the town. Additionally, one marked fly was captured on a trap that was placed outside of a restaurant in town 3 km from the release site. In total, 0.67% (250) of marked house flies were recaptured from a total release of 37,200 marked flies over 11 wk.Escherichia coli O157:H7 was isolated from two dairies in north-central Florida using immunomagnetic separation followed by direct culture plating onto CHROMAgar and sorbitol MacConkey agar supplemented with potassium tellurite and cefixime (CT-SMAC) selective media. Presumptive identification of E. coli O157:H7 was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the fliCH7 and rfbEO157 gene amplification.Dairy samples that were tested included pools of house flies, spilled grain, and fresh dairy cattle manure. Forty-two percent (24/57) of samples were positive by direct-culture using both CHROMAgar and CT-SMAC agar, with 11 positive samples from CHROMAgar and 13 positive samples from CT-SMAC agar. The 24 positive samples were submitted to PCR; of those 24 samples, 14 (58%) were confirmed by PCR. Two of the PCR-confirmed samples were false-negatives on CHROMAgar media, but presumptive positive on CT-SMAC media, indicating the importance of analyzing samples by more than one method, and demonstrating the sensitivity of PCR.Direct culture prevalence rates from CHROMAgar were 14.0% (8/57) for house flies, 5.3% (3/57) for grain, and 0% (0/57) for manure. The rate of CHROMAgar isolation of E. coli O157:H7 from house flies was 2.6 times greater than from grain. The PCR confirmation rates were 67% (8/12) for house flies, 56% (5/9) for grain and 33% (1/3) for manure. These data suggest that detection of E. coli O157:H7 on dairies might be more accurately determined by testing house flies instead of grain or manure samples, regardless of which isolation method is utilized.Flies are easy to collect and process, and because they disperse into urban areas, they provide valuable information regarding a mobile element for pathogen transmission that is lacking in grain and manure samples. House flies should be an important consideration in the design of a pathogen monitoring program on dairies.

T1  - Movement behaviour and distribution of forest songbirds in an expanding urban landscape
AN  - 816282147
AB  - Urbanization is viewed as a major threat to global biodiversity because of its role in the loss and fragmentation of low-lying, productive habitats associated with coastal plains and river valleys. My study examines the effects of urbanization on the movements and distribution of songbirds in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. I conducted playback and translocation experiments to assess the permeability of small-scale (e.g. transportation corridors, rivers) and large-scale (e.g. multi-lane expressways, areas of urban development) features of the urban landscape, respectively. I then used these empirical data to parameterize spatially explicit models and determine functional landscape connectivity across the study area. Finally, using point surveys conducted at 183 sites across the urban matrix, I examined the role of land cover type, local vegetation characteristics, landscape-level forest cover, and isolation from natural features on the distribution of songbirds. In 563 playback trials involving the responses of 2241 birds, I found that the size of the gap in vegetation was the most important determinant of movement across linear features; the likelihood of movement sharply decreasing as the gap in vegetation exceeded 30 m. The results of 176 translocation trials provided further evidence of the barrier effect of gaps. Multiple gaps, in particular, constrained the movements of both yellow warblers (Dendroica petechia) and black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus). The bird surveys revealed that natural forest stands played a critical role in sustaining regional avian diversity in the study area. Moreover, functional distance to the nearest forested natural area or water body often explained more variation in the probability of occurrence of focal species than straight-line distance, suggesting that barriers identified from the permeability experiments may have affected not only the movements of songbirds but their settlement patterns as well. Taken together, my results suggest that preserving a functionally connected network of natural areas is vital to conserving avian biodiversity in cities. My research describes novel methodologies for characterizing the composition and configuration of highly heterogeneous and fragmented landscapes. It also provides a unique examination of the link between the movement behaviour of individual birds and population-level distribution patterns within this context.

T1  - Nutrient cycling in impacted stream ecosystems: From microbes to watersheds
AN  - 757731949
AB  - his dissertation explores the effects of disturbance on nutrient cycling in stream ecosystems at three spatial scales: the patch scale includes localized processes and assemblages, the reach scale encompasses tens to hundreds of meters of stream length, and the watershed scale consists of the hierarchical network of stream orders found in catchments. Additionally, the gut bacterial communities of three freshwater snail species were investigated to better understand the ecology and physiology of this important group of aquatic grazers. Snails are important regulators of periphyton growth, which plays an integral role in nutrient cycling in stream ecosystems. Freshwater snails are also intermediate hosts for a variety of parasites of medical and veterinary significance.    Biofilm assemblages are patch scale communities which dominate the metabolism and biogeochemical cycles in stream ecosystems. To determine the effects of eutrophication, one of the most common disturbances to stream ecosystems, on the structure and function of heterotrophic stream biofilms, we created an enrichment gradient by amending darkened stream channel mesocosms with a stochiometrically balanced solution of sucrose, NH4, and PO 4.  Biofilm community productivity and function responded exponentially to enrichment. The observed nonlinear increase in functional capacity suggests biofilms are highly responsive to resource availability likely due to the physical structures and synergistic social interactions found in biofilm assemblages.    Domestic and native ungulate grazers significantly alter riparian areas, stream reaches, and catchment characteristics. We examined nutrient cycling linkages between riparian soils and adjacent streams and the impacts of ungulate grazing on these ecosystems and processes at six grazing exclosure sites in the Valles Caldera National Preserve, NM, USA.  The results suggest ungulate grazing impacts terrestrial characteristics which are linked to ecosystem services provided by adjacent aquatic ecosystems. Management plans should carefully balance the positive effect of grazing on stream nutrient processing and retention reported here with the well documented grazing related loss of other ecosystem services such as decreased fish and aquatic invertebrate habitat and effects on water quality parameters such as turbidity and water temperature.   Nutrient cycling in aridland catchments and rivers is controlled by a unique set of inputs and retention mechanisms. We investigated spatial and temporal variation in the sources and sinks of nutrients in the middle Rio Grande (MRG), a 300 km reach of aridland river in the southwestern United States that drains an agro-urban catchment experiencing rapid population growth. Wastewater treatment plant inputs were the dominant source of nutrients to the MRG, increasing loads of NO3-N, SRP, and NH4-N by 1000-2000% relative to upstream loading. The total retention of NO3-N and SRP inputs in the MRG corridor ranged from 6-99% and 34-99%, respectively. Retention was strongly and positively correlated with the percentage of water diverted from the MRG for agricultural irrigation.    Little is known about the microbial gut flora of freshwater snails in spite of the important role gastropod mollusks play as grazers in freshwater ecosystems. This study used culture independent methods to describe the community composition and the variability of gut microbes within and among three species of planorbid snails, Helisoma duryi (North American species),  Bulinus africanus (African species), and Biomphalaria pfeifferi  (African species). Three hundred and fourteen unique bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs, DNA sequences with <98% similarity) were found in the guts of the three snail species. The results suggest the presence of highly diverse and relatively similar gut microbial communities in the three snail species in spite of varying levels of phylogenetic and geographic separation, and highlight the need for additional study to determine the roles gut microbes play in the physiology of these important intermediate hosts for digenetic trematodes of medical and veterinary significance.

T1  - The forgotten forest: Ecosystem structure, function, and services of forested verges along interstates in Louisville, KY
AN  - 613775647
AB  - Cities, and the interstates that connect them, alter the local environment by changing the microclimate, elevating pollutant deposition, introducing species, and disturbing ecosystems. How these multiple factors interact to affect natural areas within the urban environment and adjacent to interstates is important to understand. However, the vegetation communities along urban interstates are forgotten in urban and road ecology studies. In previously forested landscapes, remnant vegetation alongside urban interstates are "forgotten forests" that may be extremely beneficial in providing ecosystem services to society and habitat corridors for plant and animal species in the urban environment.    I examined forested verges along interstates in Louisville, KY and determined whether introduced plant species, disturbance legacy from interstate construction, current interstate impacts, or the surrounding urban context explained variation in woody plant composition and the underlying soil matrix. A primary production study and a decomposition experiment were conducted to assess the ecosystem function of these forests. The UFORE and CENTURY models were used to estimate ecosystem services (i.e., carbon storage and accumulation, pollutant removal) provided by these forest verges.    The tree species composition of these forests was almost entirely native whereas exotic invasive species were more frequent in the understory (i.e., shrubs and vines). An exotic invasive shrub, Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii), was the most important species explaining variation in woody vegetation composition. Amur honeysuckle may further enhance its own establishment by reducing native tree regeneration via lower light levels below honeysuckle shrubs, by increasing carbon reserves through an extended growing season, and by increasing nitrogen release from decaying honeysuckle litter during early spring before other species may access the nitrogen. The legacy of planting honeysuckle post-construction and disturbing soils during construction has lasting effects on the forest composition. Exotic species, including honeysuckle, were more prevalent and native tree regeneration was lower on disturbed soils. The combined impact of honeysuckle presence and soil disturbance diminished ecosystem services provided by these forests and the future ability of these forests to provide ecosystem services is expected to decline over time with the continued dominance of honeysuckle.    Altered forest composition and diminished ecosystem services in locations where interstate construction activities occurred demonstrates the lasting effects of past human activity on forest composition. However, the existence of native stands along urban interstates provides hope that naturally regenerating forests can persist in the urban environment along interstate corridors. To promote the ability of native woody species to maintain their populations along forested highway verges, management needs to reduce exotic invasive species and to plant native species. These "forgotten forests" contribute many ecological services and they deserve recognition for their value.

T1  - Breeding success, prey use, and mark-resight estimation of burrowing owls nesting on black-tailed prairie dog towns: Plague affects a non-susceptible raptor
AN  - 503281389
AB  - Introduced pathogens such as the bacterium (Yersinia pestis) that causes plague can have far-reaching effects on native ecosystems that go beyond the mortality of infected individuals. We investigated the effects of plague, prairie dog town dynamics, and rainfall on burrowing owls ( Athene cunicularia) nesting in black-tailed prairie dog ( Cynomys ludovicianus) burrows in the shortgrass steppe of northern Colorado. We examined effects on prey use, nest density, and breeding success, and used mark-resight methods for owl population estimation. Prairie dogs experience high mortality from plague, and their colonies are periodically extirpated by outbreaks. Plague does not make owls sick, but they may be affected as unmaintained burrows collapse, vegetation grows taller, and the anti-predator benefits of prairie dog association are lost.    From 2005–2008, we monitored 322 nest attempts by 311 burrowing owl pairs on the Pawnee National Grassland and collected regurgitated pellets and prey remains. We banded owlets in 2007, and our first objective was to use a mark-resight protocol to estimate abundance, apparent survival, and temporary emigration. The Poisson-log normal mark-resight model (McClintock and White 2009) has recently been implemented in Program MARK (White and Burnham 1999). This model improves upon previous mark-resight models because individual identifications are not required 100% of the time, and individuals may die or be temporarily unobservable. Modeling showed that owlets in better condition that weighed more at first capture had higher survival throughout the summer and were more likely to be above ground. Our suggested improvements to field protocols should improve abundance estimation in the future.    Our second objective was to examine the effects of precipitation, nest density, and plague on prey use and to determine whether prey composition influenced nest or fledging success. We quantified prey use and then analyzed diet composition using multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP) and indicator species analysis. Burrowing owls ate a huge variety of prey dominated by beetles, grasshoppers, ants, rodents, and songbirds. Insects comprised 95% of their diet by number, but only 11% by biomass. Owls in the driest year of our study and those at successful and very productive nests ate fewer birds and more mammals. Owl diet was unchanged by plague outbreaks, except that several bird species were less commonly eaten following epizootics. It appears that burrowing owls often forage outside of prairie dog towns, making town-level differences less relevant to owl diets.    Our third objective was to determine the effects of plague, prairie dog town dynamics, and rainfall on nest fate, fledging success, and distances from each nest to its three nearest neighbors. Generalized linear modeling showed that rainfall was the strongest predictor of nest and fledging success, with higher rainfall associated with lower breeding success. Nests were more likely to succeed when plague events were more recent, and they produced more fledglings on towns where any extirpation was brief, and prairie dogs were otherwise resident on site for a longer time. Nests were closest together on recently plagued towns where prairie dog activity had been nearly continuous for a long time and recolonization was rapid. Although ubiquitous on active prairie dog towns, burrowing owls were nearly absent from towns that were not recolonized after plague epizootics.    Both precipitation and plague influenced population dynamics of breeding burrowing owls. We found strong relationships among rainfall, prey species composition, and owl breeding success, and only half the owlets that emerged from burrows survived to fledge during the wettest July of our study. Precipitation regimes are expected to become more extreme in the future, which will likely have consequences for burrowing owls and other dryland species and may affect the size and frequency of plague outbreaks (Stapp et al. 2004). Although owls were absent from towns that were not recolonized after plague epizootics, it appears that burrowing owls can adapt to plague and even benefit in some cases. If conservation of burrowing owls is a primary goal, our results suggest that it will be more useful to preserve prairie dog habitat and connectivity between towns at a landscape scale than to intensively manage plague.

T1  - Management of <i>Puma concolor</i> in Southern California using genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction
AN  - 304735639
AB  - The puma (Puma concolor), a generalist species, have a realized niche that is constantly changing due to new urban development and management strategies. They have an extensive geographic range, from northern British Columbia down to Patagonia, and from sea level up to an elevation of 4,500 m, which is currently highly fragmented in many key areas. Using historic occurrence points, Genetic Algorithm for Rule set Prediction (GARP) is used to model the potential living area for pumas at the contiguous United States, California, and then southern California regional scales. Then post processing will separate urban areas, roads, and other non-suitable living areas from the model. An analysis of these model results with current conservation strategies and wildlife corridor locations will determine their effectiveness, and allow new strategies to be recommended.

T1  - Analysis of the non-native flora of Ensenada, a fast growing city in northwestern Baja California
AN  - 226846717
AB  - Urbanized areas show a high proportion of non-native plants and can work as dispersal points to the surrounding areas. Ensenada is a fast growing city located in the northwestern peninsula of Baja California (Mexico). It is the southern extreme of a bi-national, coastal urban corridor that extends from Los Angeles, California south to Ensenada. This corridor is part of the biodiversity hotspot of the California Floristic Province. The aim of this study was to analyze the composition and distribution of the spontaneous flora in the city of Ensenada. We systematically sampled two differentiated urban environments, vacant lots and arroyos, in 2006 and 2007. We found a total of 158 plant species, 61% of them were non-native species. Arroyo areas showed higher non-native species richness than vacant lots (21.9 vs. 13.6 species/transect) and could be potential dispersal vectors for non-native species to natural areas outside of the city, or in the reverse direction also.

T1  - An impact analysis of future human settlements on biological resources and greenhouse gas emissions in California, and on wildlife corridors in a Maasai group ranch in Kenya
AN  - 304838358
AB  - Patterns of human settlement can have profound effects on the natural environment and biological resources, including direct habitat destruction, contribution to greenhouse gases, and obstruction of animal movement. Over half the world's population live in urban areas, which are experiencing tremendous growth rates. Planners and scientists are struggling to accommodate urban growth while conserving natural resources. UPlan, a spatially-explicit urban growth model, was developed to help decision-makers quantify and visualize the potential implications of land use decisions by modeling patterns of future human settlement and measuring their relative impacts.   In chapter one, I apply UPlan to the San Joaquin Valley, California, to model urban growth impacts from land use policy scenarios on conservation priority lands. Results indicate that the least detrimental impacts are from the growth scenario that emphasizes higher housing densities and a smaller human settlement footprint. To better understand the relative contribution of urban growth to California's greenhouse gas emissions, in chapter two I use UPlan's greenhouse gas (GHG) calculator to estimate emissions from buildings accommodating new growth through the year 2050 in California. The GHG calculator can test alternative emission-reducing measures to help determine what actions will be needed to achieve the 2050 reduction targets. Reducing very low residential housing lowers emissions by 1%, suggesting targets cannot be met without a higher percentage of renewable energy sources and/or implementing conservation measures.   Kenyan Maasai pastoralists are transitioning from communal land tenure to individual parcel ownership, leading to a sedentary, agriculture-based livelihood with more fenced land. Effects of land subdivision include landscape-scale habitat fragmentation and decreased wildlife populations. To date, there has been no systematic way of estimating longer-term impacts of differing growth scenarios on wildlife and other environmental resources in Africa. Chapter three explores whether UPlan can be adapted to the Kenyan policy framework. I test the feasibility of using UPlan in rural Kenya by applying it to the Mbirikani Group Ranch. The modeled pattern of human settlement from each policy scenario is combined with wildlife routes across Mbirikani. Findings indicate that the scenario with the highest level of fencing has the most detrimental effects on migratory corridors.

T1  - The importance of traffic corridors as urban habitats for plants in Finland
AN  - 226846087
AB  - Traffic corridors have been recognized as floristically rich with endangered and rare species included. The aim of this study is to treat traffic corridors as habitats and estimate their importance for diversity of vascular plants on municipal level. The material is derived from the comprehensive studies of urban floras in the cities of Vantaa, Kerava and Järvenpää during the 1990s in southern Finland. The material consists of over 190,000 species records (704-771 species). The material was divided in two groups: the ones with occurrences in traffic corridors (TC) and the others with no occurrences (NTC). The percentage of the traffic corridor plants of the total flora is almost the same in all the three cities: two thirds in traffic corridors and one third not in traffic corridors. The explanation may be the general floristic similarity of the cities. The two groups differ ecologically from each other. The association of plants with traffic corridors varies according to the ecology of the species. About 100 plants have more than 50% of their occurrences in traffic corridors. In Järvenpää, a group of four Carex-species was intensively mapped. 46 occurrences out of 50 were found in traffic corridors. A case study showed the difficulties in management of endangered species on a roadside site. The usual extensive management techniques were not sustainable for the survival of the species. Instead, a much more intensive management was needed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Using false rings to reconstruct local drought severity patterns on a semiarid river
AN  - 304684478
AB  - In this research, I describe the use of false rings to reconstruct local histories of seasonal drought in riparian ecosystems in semiarid regions. In tree-ring analysis, false rings are boundary-like features often formed as a response to drought within the growing season. Drought can be a common feature in hydrologic regimes of dryland rivers but in recent decades drought has been intensifying due to climate change and increasing water use by cities, agriculture and industry. Identifying when and where water availability has decreased along the river course is critical for understanding, and therefore managing, these generally endangered ecosystems. The higher density of trees compared to instrumental data make them ideal candidates for reconstructing site-specific drought patterns.    The first part of this dissertation is an observational study conducted on the San Pedro River in southeastern Arizona during 2002. I used dendrometer data and local hydrological data to show that a period of negligible radial growth in cottonwood during the middle of the growing season coincided with a channel drying event. Tree-ring core samples confirmed that false-rings had formed in each of the instrumented trees. The second part of this dissertation is an experimental study designed to evaluate the effect of different levels of water stress on false-ring formation in cottonwood and willow. I showed that experimental decreases in water availability for periods as short as ten days were enough to induce false-ring formation in willow. Longer periods of reduced water availability were generally required to induce false-ring formation in cottonwood. In the final part of this dissertation, I reconstructed false-ring occurrence in Fremont cottonwoods at three sites along the San Pedro River. I infer from false-ring frequencies that the severity of summer drought has been increasing over the last four to six decades but that the drought severity varies along a hydrological gradient. Overall, the findings in this body of research confirm that false rings in riparian tree species can be used as indicators of seasonal drought and underscore the importance of identifying site-specific responses to reduced water availability along the riparian corridor.

T1  - A study on urban circle: spatial scale analysis and evolution
AN  - 1873864938
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorAs a complicated system, the urban spatial structure is influenced by natural, social and economic factors on its formation and development. By making use of modern information technology and the multiple-discipline-crossing method to research spatial distribution of all component elements of the urban spatial structure and interrelationship and interaction among these elements in space and time, in different spatial scales, it can provide scientific basis and technical support for building organic urban spatial structure and formulating appropriate development strategies, which is very significant to maintain sustainable urban development. Due to above-mentioned significance, this paper systematically analyzes characteristics and evolutions of the spatial structure of Wuhan urban circle in different spatial scales through modern information technology and by establishing effective methods to analyze the urban spatial structure, and acquires major research results as following: (1)On the basis of describing concepts, component elements and scale compositions of the urban spatial structure, commenting on urban spatial structural modes, and summing up quantitative research methods of urban spatial structure in different spatial scales, it establishes the hierarchical analytical method of urban spatial structure, which is based on remote sensing image and can be used in different spatial scales, according to the relationship between remote sensing image and geographical spatial information. This method explains distribution characteristics of thermal-environment-based urban thematic information and connectivity of areas covered by this information by extracting urban thematic information from multi-source remote sensing image, defining multiple distribution modes for thermal-environment-based urban thematic information and constructing topological structure diagram made up of areas covered by urban thematic information and ways to connect these areas. (2)On the basis of analyzing characteristics of multi-source remote sensing data and qualitative and quantitative concepts involved in applying these characteristic to urban research, it realizes extraction of urban thematic information based on remote sensing image through extraction and quantification of concepts about urban building and vegetation coverage in remote sensing image by using the cloud model, which can be used to converse qualitative concepts into quantitative expression. It proves that this method is effective to extract urban thematic information through precision comparison with the maximum likelihood method. During researching distribution characteristics of thermal-environment-based urban thematic information, it recognizes distribution modes of thermal environment of urban thematic information through quantitative definition, and also analyzes characteristics and reasons of distribution of thermal environment of urban thematic information according to recognized results. (3)On the basis of discussing evolution rules of urban spatial structure, it analyzes application superiority and range of modern information technology in the research of evolution rules, and also describes change patterns of urban spatial structure and quantitative analytical method. Besides, it further analyzes characteristics and evolution of Wuhan urban road network by introducing into the complex network theory, mapping the urban road network, which represents the basic framework of urban spatial structure, as complex network, and using statistical characteristics parameters of complex network. (4)This paper systematically analyzes spatial structure and evolution of Wuhan urban circle in different spatial scales by using multi-source remote sensing image and various research methods. A number of suggestions have been proposed according to the above anaylsis results. Within the spatial scale of urban circle, it adopts models of economic relation intensity and strength to divide spatial levels of Wuhan urban circle, and also incorporates the complex network theory to analyze network characteristics of constructed economic relation network of urban circle. Besides, it uses the fractal theory to analyze spatial fractal characteristics of the urban system of Wuhan urban circle from two aspects, namely, rank-scale structure and spatial distribution. In addition, it makes use of MODIS remote sensing image and the hierarchical analytical method to research spatial structural characteristics of Wuhan urban circle. Within the city-wide spatial scale, it performs qualitative analysis to change patterns of Wuhan urban spatial structure since 1949, and also uses two-period TM/ETM+ remote sensing images and corresponding social and economic data to perform quantitative analysis to changes of time and space during 1991-2002, and further compares changes on distribution modes of thermal environment in areas covered by urban buildings and urban and rural topological structure diagrams of these two periods. Within the spatial scale of main city zone, it adopts the landscape index method to analyze composition and spatial allocation of urban greenland landscape pattern in the main city zone, and also uses ASTER image and the hierarchical analytical method to research distribution characteristics and connectivity of thermal environment through extraction of urban greenland in the Wuhan main city

T1  - Landbird demography and community structure along an urbanization gradient in the Lake Tahoe basin
AN  - 304900787
AB  - Urbanization has profound effects on biodiversity, but few studies have addressed the consequences of multiple stressors along urbanization gradients on both populations and communities. I conducted three studies of urbanization effects on landbird demography and community structure, sampling landbird abundance and diversity at 375 sample points and monitoring 494 nests of 10 focal species at 97 points along a development gradient in the Lake Tahoe basin, California and Nevada. First, I examined effects of nesting strategy and body size on some key demographic parameters: abundance, nest success, and finite growth rate. Abundance of large-bodied species and nest success of cavity nesters stayed constant or increased as urban development increased, whereas abundance of most small-bodied species and nest success of open nesters declined. For some species, the entire basin was a population sink, and for others, points along the development gradient may be ecological traps. Identifying sinks and traps along gradients rather than assuming discrete subpopulations is a superior approach for many landscapes and can highlight opportunities for habitat restoration. Second, I used model selection to determine the relative importance of development, human activity, local and landscape vegetation, topography, and location in explaining richness, abundance, and dominance. Urbanization stressors were consistently among the principal forces structuring the community, and disturbance from human activity was often the most important factor, surpassing even habitat loss from development. My results suggest likely consequences for urban ecosystem function that call for local- and landscape-scale management, focused research, and long-term monitoring to retain biodiversity in urban areas. Third, I used metacommunity theory to guide a variation-partitioning analysis of the spatial and environmental structuring of the landbird community. Environmental variation generally exceeded spatial variation, but all groups displayed a significant component of spatial variation, demonstrating a likely mix of dispersal limitation with niche-based and source-sink processes. Structuring of urban avoiders, adapters, and exploiters differed in interesting ways. Substantial roles of space, habitat, and landscape configuration illustrated the value of retaining native vegetation, the need to consider connectivity in managing biodiversity in urbanizing landscapes, and the value of a metacommunity approach for addressing urbanization's multifaceted effects on biodiversity.

T1  - Ecological evaluation on and plant disposition characteristics of the green lands of parks in Shanghai
TT  - 上海市公园绿地的生态学评价与植物配置特征分析
AN  - 1026575199
AB  - Based on theoretical analysis and argumentation, comprehensive principles for evaluating the green land of parks and the plant disposition were established, including high biodiversity, harmonious intra-species and interspecies relationship with reasonable ecological structure, multiple functions of ecological service, harmonious human-nature relationship, and the self-maintenance, self-adjustment, self-cycling, self-renewal, self-perfection and self-upgrading. Seven principles were put forward for evaluating the plant disposition, including paying attentions to the habits and interspecific relationship of plants, spatial disposition of plants, temporal disposition of plants, aesthetic effects of plant disposition, comprehensive application of pose, texture, color, aroma, sound, light and so on, humanities and artistic conception, and the harmony between plants and other landscape elements.
According to the field investigations in the green lands of 80 parks in Shanghai, and the theoretical analysis, the characteristics of the green lands of parks in Shanghai was discussed, which included the following aspects: the inheritance of plant disposition techniques of classical Chinese gardens, the absorption of advanced theories of modern western parks, the contemporary developments in the design of green lands of parks in Shanghai, and the scarcity of animal biodiversity. As to the third characteristic, the developments referred to the increase of plant biodiversity, the changes in life form spectrum, and the diversity of ecological structure and functions. 
The flora and species composition of trees, the frequency of commonly used trees and the applications of native trees in the green lands of parks in Shanghai were analyzed. The composition of native species in the green lands of parks in Shanghai according to families and genera was analyzed and compared with those in the whole area in Shanghai. The current situation of life form spectrum in the green lands of parks in Shanghai was analyzed and compared with that in the regional vegetation in Tiantong National Forest Park. The variety of structure and function of plant disposition in the green lands of parks in Shanghai was analyzed in terms of  tree height, light and soil requirements, resistibility to poisonous air. To solve the scarcity of animal biodiversity, some suggestions for the attraction and protection of wild animals were put forward, and the disposition of bird plants and nectar plants in the community were recommended.
Some ecological countermeasures for the future development in the green lands of parks in Shanghai were discussed. Parks as the pool of biodiversity and the place for animal, plant and microbe to rest, reproduce, assembly and diffuse, should act as nodes of urban landscape ecosystem, so as to maximize the ecological effects at the scale of urban landscape ecosystem. Outside the parks, the other green lands in the city should serve as the corridors between the landscape nodes, the biodiversity patches.Alternate abstract:本研究通过深入的理论分析和论证，确立了对公园绿地及其群落植物配置进行生态评价的综合性的理念与原则。认为丰富的生物多样性、协调的种内、种间关系与合理的生态结构、多样化的生态服务功能、和谐的人与自然环境关系、自我维持和调节、自我循环和更新、自我完善和提升等5个方面可以作为对公园绿地进行生态评价的理念与原则。植物配置应注重植物的生态习性和植物间的生态关系、植物间的空间配置关系、植物间的时间配置关系、植物配置的美学效果、植物配置时姿态、色彩、质感、芳香、声韵、光影等的综合运用、植物配置时注重体现人文精神和文化意境、植物造景突出与园林景物与建筑的映衬等7个方面。
基于对上海市80个公园绿地的实地调查和深入的理论分析，探讨了上海市公园绿地的主要特征，并对其植物配置格局进行了生态学分析。上海市公园绿地的主要特征表现在：对中国古典园林的植物配置格局的继承；对现代西方园林中先进思想的吸收；当代上海公园绿地的新发展；动物多样性不足并有待加强等4个方面。当代上海公园绿地的新发展具体体现在：种类多样性的提升、生活型谱的变化、结构和功能的多样化。
根据实地调查结果，分析了上海市公园绿地树种的区系成分和科属组成、常见树种的出现频率和园林绿化中乡土树种的应用情况，并与从文献中统计得到的上海地区乡土树种的科属种组成做了比较分析。在生活型谱方面，除分析了上海公园绿地的生活型谱现状外，还通过对比分析了其与天童国家森林公园地带性植被生活型谱的关系。同时，从植株高度、对光照和土壤等的需求、对有毒气体的抗性等方面分析了植物配置的结构和功能的多样化。针对上海公园绿地动物多样性的不足，提出了在城市公园绿地中招引和保护野生动物的方法，并推荐了较适宜上海城市绿化的鸟嗜植物和蜜源植物及群落配置。
最后，从生态学角度讨论了上海市公园绿地未来发展的对策。提出了以公园绿地为城市景观生态系统的景观节点的构想，使之成为生物多样性的集中地和扩散地，并成为动物、植物、微生物等各类生物组分休憩、繁衍、扩散、汇集的场所和大本营。从而使公园绿地在城市景观生态系统的宏观尺度上发挥最大的生态效益。除此之外的各种城市绿地则作为联系各生物多样性斑块（公园绿地）的廊道。

T1  - Extreme Makeover: Bay Street edition
AN  - 347691461
AB  - Retirees who have downsized to these downtown high-rises have been trying to bring life to Bay's denuded streetscape, planting donated flowers and shrubs, and nursing the spindly street trees inserted into the sidewalk.  Eric Pedersen, Toronto's program manager for urban design, agrees that the Bay corridor would benefit from the sort of facelift that occurred on St. George Street when the city, University of Toronto and a private donor invested $5-million in an impressive landscaping strategy extending from Bloor to College.

T1  - Riparian woody plant diversity, composition, and structure across an urban-rural land use gradient in the Piedmont of Georgia, United States
AN  - 305360244
AB  - Riparian forests are increasingly threatened by urban expansion and land use change worldwide. Understanding the impacts of urbanization on riparian forests is critical because riparian areas provide a variety of important ecological services and are biological hotspots for species diversity. The overall goal of this work was to describe the relationships among landscape characteristics and woody plant diversity, structure, species composition, and plant functional traits of small order riparian corridors along an urban-rural land use gradient in the Georgia Piedmont, US. The objectives were to: (1) examine the influence of land use and urbanization indices on riparian woody plant species diversity and composition, (2) quantify changes in riparian forest structure across an urban-rural gradient, (3) elucidate changes in woody plant functional traits along an urban-rural gradient, and (4) compare trends in diversity, composition, structure, and trait characteristics in the mature forest stand and forest tree regeneration. This work demonstrates that changes in species diversity, composition, and structure are occurring in response to land use and the surrounding landscape matrix. Non-native invasive species appear to be driving many of the changes, specifically the shrub,  Ligustrum sinense. Species richness was positively correlated to rural landscape characteristics and negatively related to urban characteristics. Shannon diversity was negatively associated with dominance of non-native species, especially for the forest regeneration layer. Urban sites were characterized by high richness of non-native species and several pioneer species. Developing sites were dominated by the non-native shrub, Ligustrum sinense, and several native overstory trees, mainly Acer negundo. While agricultural and managed forest sites were composed of ubiquitous species, the unmanaged forest type exhibited a structurally distinct midstory. Midstory tree biomass was positively related to forest cover and negatively related to impervious surface cover and shrub biomass was positively related to patch density. Urban and agriculture sites showed signs of recruitment failure. Species functional traits also varied across the gradient. Specifically, differences in leaf type, plant form, flood and shade tolerance, seed dispersal, pollination, growth rate, rooting characteristics, and life span were found. Flood tolerance was strongly reduced in the regeneration layer in urban riparian areas suggesting a potential shift in hydrologic function. Results from this study highlight the impact of urbanization on riparian forest plant biodiversity and structure.

T1  - The effects of urbanization on the behavior, distribution, and conservation of forest birds
AN  - 305327008
AB  - Urbanization is occurring rapidly around the world, but ecologists are just beginning to realize the effects on birds and other wildlife. This dissertation has two major goals: (1) to document some of the effects of human development on bird distributions and movement in the North Carolina Piedmont, and (2) to test and develop graph theory as a tool that can be used for habitat assessment and conservation in fragmented habitats. These issues are critical to explaining and predicting bird occurrences in today's landscapes and are important for both basic ecological research and management.    The first portion of this dissertation uses empirical data collected from 272 point counts to quantify the effects of urbanization on forest songbirds. Initial results indicate that avian community composition varies across the study area with urban land cover and road density. However, an in-depth examination of the effects of roads on species abundance revealed that the importance of roads is simply an artifact of the vegetation and land cover changes that typically accompany them rather than a direct effect of the roads themselves. A final analysis of the field data considered the importance of roads and other land cover classes to bird movement in fragmented landscapes. Using alternative representations of bird dispersal behavior to predict species abundance, I showed that forest interior birds experience high dispersal cost through non-forest habitat but no cost of dispersing over roads.    The second portion of this dissertation presents graph theory as a tool for understanding bird movement, distribution, and conservation in fragmented landscapes. I compare the performance of graph theory to a more computationallyand data-intense spatially explicit population model (SEPM) in selecting important habitat patches for conservation, and show that graph theory makes very similar predictions in some cases and in other cases offers insight not available from the SEPM. In addition, I use graph theory to make inferences about movement, disturbance, and conservation strategies across the entire study area, concluding that the study area displays an intermediate level of connectivity and should be fairly resilient to development and disturbance.

T1  - Law, culture, and landscape architecture: Defining the sidewalk landscape in downtown Winnipeg
AN  - 305373131
AB  - This research examines the space currently protected for the movement of pedestrians within the downtown of Winnipeg as a  sidewalk landscape. This complex landscape contains both cultural and ecological systems which need to be considered holistically in order to maintain a healthy sidewalk landscape. As an application of the United Nations' ‘Healthy City’ principles, a healthy sidewalk landscape includes healthy vegetation, ecologically responsible design and maintenance, and a safe, economically sustainable, and contextual experience for pedestrians.    The sidewalk landscape of downtown Winnipeg is well used as a functional corridor, but its systemic health is suffering. The growing requirements for urban vegetation, the climatic and experiential effects upon pedestrians, and the lack of an ethical approach toward groundwater and wind are examined by looking at this landscape as a right of way, a private and public sector investment, a public space, and as an ecological network. These perceptions of the sidewalk space are a translation of cultural values into the planning and regulatory legal documents written for this landscape.    In order to understand this landscape, this research examines the sidewalk as a product of cultural values serving many cultural purposes, and an evolving landscape affected by emerging civic goals and priorities expressed in provincial legislation, and municipal by-laws and planning policy. Two goals of this research were to educate landscape architects about the sidewalk as a cultural and outdoor landscape, and to prepare a framework for sidewalk design as a form of applied landscape theory. Landscape architects as teachers and designers can provide leadership toward a review of the practices and legal documents shaping the sidewalk landscape.

T1  - Study on the Frameworks, the Functions and the Landscape Ecology Planning Methods of Urban Green Corridors―A Case Study of Wuhan
TT  - 城市绿色廊道的结构与功能及景观生态规划方法研究——以武汉市为例
AN  - 1027911982
AB  - As an important aspect of landscape ecology, the studies on corridors are permeating urban ecology and urban landscape planning. Green corridor is a key landscape type. This paper communicates clearly about the definition and the classification of green corridor. Additionally, it analyses urban green corridor’s structure, pattern and function. Applying the method for landscape ecology planning to urban green corridor planning, this study notes five steps of green corridor planning, which are as follows, first, investigating basic data, secondly confirming targets and functions, thirdly ecology planning, fourthly implementing plans and designs and last, managing planning projects, and the former three stages are analyzed clearly. The four scales of green corridor planning and the methods for data analyzing, confirming functions, targets, width of various kinds of urban green corridors are studied.  
This paper notes that according to the model of vehicle emission dispersion and the model of noises dispersion, the width of green road-side corridor can be confirmed exactly. The results show that when downwind distance is   meters, the surface pollution concentration is the max. Arranging green road-side corridor before this distance can effectively decrease the max concentration and the concentrations at different distance. When there isn’t enough room to arrange dividing strips, we can assume the pollution origin as the midline of road. If the half width of road is shorter than   meters, the sum of green road-side corridor width and half road width ought to be equal to or greater than   meters, and the greater the green road-side corridor width is, the better effect is. If the half width of road is greater than   meters, green road-side corridor should be arranged from roadside and the greater the green road-side corridor width is, the better effect is. If roads have dividing strips, and there is enough room to arrange diving strips, green road-side corridor should be arranged according to the above principles regarding each slab as a road. Considering its function of reducing traffic noises, green road-side corridor should cling to the roadside, and the wider the green road-side corridor is, the better effect is.
The environments along the roads comprise six categories. The first category is shopping center, the second one is culture and education, habitation, the third one is heavy industry, the fourth is water area, the fifth is farmland and the last one is natural vegetation, mountain and park. The methods for planning green road-side corridors along different roads with different environments are studied exhaustively.
This paper applies the above principles and methods to Wuhan’s green corridor planning, points out the problems of its green corridors by analyzing its corridors’ form, network, the relationship between green focuses and green corridors, the relationship between heat island effects and green corridors. The results show that Wuhan’s all kind of green corridors in each district, especially the green belts, are very scanty. The connectivity of green corridor network is so low, the width is so narrow, and inside environments can not be formed. Some of green focuses don’t be connected each other by green corridors. 
Considering Wuhan’s natural resources, regional status and the problems of its green corridors, the targets and the functions of Wuhan’s green corridors planning are pointed out and confirmed, which are as follows, building ecological network connecting each urban green focuses, urban and rural green focuses; conserving and improving the diversity of species and habitats, the quality of atmosphere, the productivity of agricultural and horticultural acts adjacent to green corridors; development controlling and urban containment; improving urban microclimate, reducing heat island effects.
Lastly, this paper plans and confirms the width, the direction and the pattern of Wuhan’s green corridors. It points out that green network should be uninterrupted on the region scale, the urban scale and the district scale. When green corridors go through the thermal area, and their trends parallel the dominant wind direction, heat island effects can be alleviated greatly.Alternate abstract:廊道作为景观生态研究的一个重要的课题，目前已渗透到城市生态、城市景观规划与研究之中。绿色廊道是廊道系统中的关键类型。本文阐述了绿色廊道的概念涵义及分类方法；分析了城市绿色廊道的结构与功能；并将景观生态规划的方法应用于城市绿色廊道的规划上，提出了绿色廊道景观生态规划的5个步骤：基础资料调查——确定规划目标及功能——生态规划——规划与设计的实施——规划项目管理；对前三步进行了详细说明。阐述了绿色廊道分析尺度的4个等级，基础资料的分析方法，功能及规划目标的确定方法和城市各类型绿色廊道布局及宽度的确定方法。
在对城市绿色廊道规划方法进行研究时，提出了依据汽车尾气扩散模型和噪声扩散模型确定绿色道路廊道基本宽度的方法。结果表明：当下风向距离为 m时，地面污染物浓度取最大值，可以认为，在此距离之前安排绿色道路廊道，可以有效的减小污染物浓度的最大值，也可减少以后各距离污染物浓度。当道路无分车带或者布置分车带的空间不足时，假定线源在道路中线处，当道路中线距路边的距离小于 m时，绿色道路廊道的宽度应该满足与道路半宽之和大于等于 m，并且在此基础上越宽越好；当道路中线距路边的距离大于等于 m时，绿色道路廊道越宽越好。当道路有分车带，且布置分车带的空间充足时，依据以上原理将每一板块视为单独道路进行绿色道路廊道的布置。在考虑到最大限度减少交通噪音的功能时，绿色道路廊道距离道路越近越好，且越宽越好。
将道路背景环境分为了商业区、文教区和居住区、重工业区、水域、农田和自然植被、山体及公园6大类，分别对其绿色道路廊道绿化带的布置方法进行了详细研究。
将这些理论及方法应用到武汉市绿色廊道的规划中，通过对武汉市廊道景观构成分析、绿色廊道网络结构分析、绿心与绿色廊道的关系分析及热岛效应与绿色廊道的关系分析提出了武汉市绿色廊道存在的问题及不足：各行政区各类型绿色廊道缺乏，特别是绿带；绿色廊道网络连通性较低，间断点太多，绿色廊道不连续；绿色廊道宽度太窄，不足以形成内部环境；部分城市绿心没有通过绿色廊道连接。
依据武汉市的自然资源特点和区位特征，结合考虑现有绿色廊道的不足，提出了武汉市绿色廊道景观生态规划的目标与功能：构成生态网络，连接城市各个绿心，城市与郊区的绿心，保存、保护并提高动植物及其栖息环境的多样性；保存、保护并提高现有的空气质量；保护与绿色廊道毗邻的农业和园艺活动的长期经济活力；控制城市形态，防止城市无节制的扩张；促进城乡一体化发展，保证城乡合理过渡；改善城市小气候，降低热岛效应。
最后，对武汉市绿色廊道的宽度、走向及布局进行了确定与规划。认为绿色网络在区域尺度上、城市尺度上和行政区等各级尺度上都应保持完整的连续性。穿过城市高热地区，且走向与城市主导风向平行的绿色廊道布局最有益于热岛效应的降低。

T1  - Annual and seasonal habitat use of Columbian black-tailed deer in urban Vancouver, Washington
AN  - 758398650
AB  - We investigated habitat use of Columbian black-tailed deer in urban Vancouver, Clark County, Washington, at 3 spatial scales: (1) placement of the annual home range within the landscape mosaic, (2) annual and seasonal locations of deer within the annual home range, and (3) short-term use of critical habitats (fawning areas) within seasonal ranges. Annual home range sizes of deer were 162 ha (SD = 133; 95% minimum convex polygon; MCP) and 266 ha (SD = 228; 95% adaptive kernel; AK) for does, and 756 ha (SD = 290; MCP) and 1,235 ha (SD = 382; AK) for bucks. Home range composition of does did not differ from the study area; home ranges of bucks contained more Natural ecological land-use cover types (ELUs) than did the study area. Within home ranges, both does and bucks used Natural ELUs more often than expected by their occurrence in the home range, both annually and seasonally. During the fawning season, does were also found in Natural ELUs more often than expected. Clark County-designated habitat corridors differed from both the study area and deer home ranges in habitat composition, primarily by containing more Natural and other undeveloped ELUs. Deer were located in habitat corridors more than expected. Deer in urban areas appear to use undeveloped habitat types for security. Management that maintains Natural ELUs, such as establishment of wildlife corridors, can provide important habitat components for black-tailed deer in urban habitats.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Clinch and powell rivers watershed ecological risk assessment.
AN  - 23902595; 200804-10-503705 (MT); N08-99-489975 (AH)
AB  - A watershed ecological risk assessment of the unique Clinch and Powell river system in southwestern Virginia strongly suggests that (1) coal mining activities and agricultural practices, past and present, are having adverse impacts on stream habitats, resulting in unacceptable losses of valuable and rare native fish and mussels and (2) prompt implementation of practical risk-lowering actions, such as reclaiming abandoned mines, spill prevention, excluding livestock from streams, and establishing riparian vegetation zones, can mitigate these adverse effects in the future. The free-flowing Clinch and Powell Valley watershed, which drains into Norris Lake in northeastern Tennessee, has historically had one of the richest assemblages of native fish and freshwater mussels in the world. Nearly half of the species historically present are now extinct, threatened, or endangered. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys ecological risk assessment framework was used to structure a watershed-scale analysis of associations between land use and in-stream habitat and their effects on fish and mussels. Percent pasture area, percent crop land, and proximity to active mining, urban areas, or major transportation routes accounted for more than half of the variance in fish IBI scores, with coal mining having the most impact. Native fish and mussel populations appeared to be at greatest risk as more stressors co-occurred. Our results indicate that a number of sources and stressors are responsible for the decline in native species in the Clinch and Powell Valley watershed, but naturally vegetated riparian corridors may help mitigate some of these effects.

T1  - Spatial models of morning commute consistent with realistic traffic behavior
AN  - 305341295
AB  - Urban planners are increasingly concerned about the sprawling suburban development in metropolitan areas around the world, which they often blame for growing traffic congestion and excessive highway investment needs. This dissertation seeks to shed light on this issue by studying the relationship between morning commute congestion and urban form.    The causes and consequences of traffic congestion have been extensively studied in the economics and engineering literatures. Unfortunately, most conclusions have been drawn from very idealized models, which either fail to consider adequately the spatial nature of congestion, by neglecting the effects of physical queues and merging interactions, or overlook dynamic aspects, such as commuters' departure time adaptation during the rush-hour.    To better capture the spatial-dynamic nature of morning commute traffic, this dissertation proposes a new analytical framework that explicitly incorporates  spatially distributed commuter origins, realistic traffic behavior and commuter timing decisions. The work combines the departure-time equilibrium theory (as first proposed by Vickrey [1969]) with the spatial model of traffic dynamics of Newell [1993] and the model of merge traffic interactions of Daganzo [1994, 1995a].    Focus is placed on idealized urban configurations, where traffic behavior can be studied analytically and general insights can be gained. We first study the equilibrium problem in a stylized two-origin network. This enables us to understand the fundamental role of merging bottlenecks and queue spillovers when commuters have different origins. The analysis is then extended to model congestion behavior in long freeway corridors and monocentric cities. We develop an exact procedure to solve the dynamic departure-time equilibrium for single-destination freeway tree networks. Solutions are characterized for cases with and without an alternative street network. The results show that the location-based congestion cost is very dependent on the spatial behavior of queues and that congestion can be reduced by altering the freeway access priorities given to different origins. At the same time, urban sprawl is shown to contribute not only to larger travelled distances but also to increased overall delays. Sprawl effects, however, are not as severe as often assumed.    We finally propose some closed-form continuous approximations for the location-based congestion cost. These formulae provide an improved and simple representation of the dependence of congestion on the spatial distribution of population that can be easily incorporated to study policy issues. The design of more effective measures to reduce congestion and control urban development is an immediate example.

T1  - Carbon in conurbations: Afforestation and carbon storage as consequences of urban sprawl in Colorado's Front Range
AN  - 305334578
AB  - In the arid western United States, urbanization transforms landscapes from sparsely vegetated grasslands with tree-lined riparian corridors into matrices of asphalt, concrete, turf grass, and multi-strata wooded stands. This research sought to understand the consequences of urbanization upon carbon pools in the Front Range of Colorado, a metropolitan area undergoing expansive urban transformation.    Vegetative and edaphic C, as well as biomass and other soil physical/chemical properties, were measured throughout the Denver-Boulder metropolitan area in 2000 and 2001. Anthropogenic activities leave clear signatures on all three C compartments measured. The comparison of C storage in the vegetated spaces of urban areas to that in grasslands and agricultural fields reveals a marked increase as well as a proportional shift in storage from belowground to aboveground. Lawn grass produces more biomass and stores more C than local prairie or agricultural fields. Introduced woody vegetation comprises a substantial C pool in urban greenspaces and represents a wholly new ecosystem feature. Established urban greenspaces harbor larger C pools than native grasslands on a per area basis.    Rather than map the urban land-cover types, regional detection of the proportion of the urbanized landscape occupied by vegetated and anthropogenic components extracted biophysical information of the urban/rural matrix. Convex geometry and partial unmixing algorithms were used to extract major landscape elements from an AVIRIS image of Boulder, including six vegetation endmembers. Other scene components were also identified, including soil, water, and five impervious surfaces. The fractional abundance of urban vegetation equaled or exceeded that of vegetation in surrounding areas.    In order to understand the effect of the per-area C increase in anthropogenic landscapes regionally, the distribution of carbon in land covers across the landscape was investigated. Regional C estimates were based on both fractional abundances and land-use/land-cover categories. A carbon hotspot exists in the urbanized areas where well-established urban vegetation occupies residential neighborhoods, urban greenspaces, and city streets. Other hotspots exist along riparian corridors and on vegetated foothills. Between 1930 and 1990, developed land almost quintupled in area in the Front Range of Colorado. During the same time period, estimates of the carbon pool trajectory range from −3% to +18%. The true direction, given the local context, is surmised to be neutral or positive.

T1  - Can urban greenways provide high-quality avian habitat?
AN  - 305312942
AB  - I investigated how forested corridor width, land use context, and greenway composition and vegetation structure affected avian community composition in urban greenways in Raleigh and Cary, North Carolina, USA. I surveyed breeding bird communities at 34 greenway study sites using 50-m fixed-radius point counts located at the center of 300m long greenway segments. Each greenway segment's forested corridor width and surrounding land use were determined in ArcGIS. Greenway composition (proportion of mature forest, young forest, managed area, and stream in the greenway study site) and vegetation structure were measured in the field.    Landscape and urban planners can maximize native bird diversity and abundance by minimizing the width of the greenway trail and associated mowed and landscaped surfaces adjacent to the trail, maintaining vegetative structure within the greenway, and giving priority to the protection of greenways in areas of lower development intensity. Greenways wider than 50m provide habitat for a diversity of bird species, but many species of conservation concern require much wider greenways. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

T1  - The study of associations between Maryland's amphibian species and habitat parameters at local and landscape scales
AN  - 288071950
AB  - The relationship between amphibians and their surrounding habitat was examined at local and landscape levels. Amphibian species presence and richness information and measurements of local habitat conditions were obtained for 1000 stream segments sampled during the Maryland Biological Stream Survey. Landscape metrics were determined from the National Land Cover Data set for varying extent landscapes around each sampling segment.    Anura species richness was higher at typical pristine lowland streams, often in the presence of instream structures. If compact large forests were close by or if large and many wetlands were in the far reach, more anuran species were encountered. Caudata species richness was generally higher west, in small, relatively steep, pristine mountain streams with high forest proportion. Wetlands, agriculture and urban features showed negative relationships with Caudata richness.    Most individual species followed these trends set by their respective richness group. Exceptions were northern two-lined salamanders and red-backed salamanders, which seemed more tolerant of lower habitat quality. For red salamanders the absence of urban areas seemed highest priority.    The optimum map extents that were closely associated with species presence were species and land cover type specific. Generally, negative associations with urban cover were strongest at the smallest map extent.    Multivariate linear models predicting encounter probabilities of a species from local and/or landscape parameters showed less fit for anuran species than for Caudata. More frequently encountered species were more difficult to predict, possibly because they are less specialized than others.    Changes in association strength due to changes in age, resolution or processing of landuse data sets were evaluated. Fluctuations in association strength was species and/or cover type specific. Sources of fluctuations were data origin and resolution. The finest resolution was rarely the best. However, wetlands are a limiting factor when reducing the resolution, due to their small size.    In order to measure landscape connectivity, a hypothetical species was released at the center of each landscape map with dispersal simulated at varying step sizes. After hypothetical riparian zones were added, connectivity increased with greater improvements in landscapes of lower initial connectivity.

T1  - Clinch and Powell Rivers Watershed Ecological Risk Assessment
AN  - 27059369; N03-16539 (AH)
AB  - A watershed ecological risk assessment of the unique Clinch and Powell river system in southwestern Virginia strongly suggests that (1) coal mining activities and agricultural practices, past and present, are having adverse impacts on stream habitats, resulting in unacceptable losses of valuable and rare native fish and mussels and (2) prompt implementation of practical risk-lowering actions, such as reclaiming abandoned mines, spill prevention, excluding livestock from streams, and establishing riparian vegetation zones, can mitigate these adverse effects in the future. The free-flowing Clinch and Powell Valley watershed, which drains into Norris Lake in northeastern Tennessee, has historically had one of the richest assemblages of native fish and freshwater mussels in the world. Nearly half of the species historically present are now extinct, threatened, or endangered. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys ecological risk assessment framework was used to structure a watershed-scale analysis of associations between land use and in-stream habitat and their effects on fish and mussels. Percent pasture area, percent crop land, and proximity to active mining, urban areas, or major transportation routes accounted for more than half of the variance in fish IBI scores, with coal mining having the most impact. Native fish and mussel populations appeared to be at greatest risk as more stressors co-occurred. Our results indicate that a number of sources and stressors are responsible for the decline in native species in the Clinch and Powell Valley watershed, but naturally vegetated riparian corridors may help mitigate some of these effects.

T1  - Landscape ecology study on ditch-net system in Yangtze river delta--a case study of Yangzhong city, Jiangsu province
TT  - 长江三角洲地区渠网系统的景观生态学研究——以江苏省扬中市为例
AN  - 1027142490
AB  - Based on multi-temporal images and social-economic data, a case study was carried out firstly on Dyked fields (low-lying paddy fields surrounding by dykes) landscape and ditch-net system in Yangzhong City, Yangtze River Delta, using landscape ecological approach. The major conclusions are summarized as follows: l. The landscape unit of "field----ditch--village-road" is the dominant feature of the dyked fields landscape. Ditch-net system plays an important role in this kind of landscape, which pattern determines the distribution of the paddy fields and villages. 2. At present, the ditch-net system consists mainly of three components: river reaches, ditches and ponds. As the backbone of ditch-net system, the pattern of the river reaches determines the pattern of the whole system. It has a distinguished feature of artificial river system. Under the impact of urbanization, the ditches and ponds in urban area are decreasing gradually. The widespread herbaceous is the major component of the vegetation in the ditch-net system and the riparian areas. Compared with the plants around ditches and ponds, the species abundance in river riparian is greater. 3. The ditch-net system in Yangzhong has been changed dramatically since the last one hundred years. Images from l935 to l958 indicate that Yangzhong still enjoyed a river system of natural dendritic pattern in that time. Since l980 the river net pattern began to show typical features of artificial river system with straight watercourse, low curvilinearity. The river network  was improved during l980-l994, both of the quantity and the length of the river reaches have increased remarkably The ditches and the ponds near the urban areas show a trend of decrease,. The connectivity and the fluidity of the rivers has declined, the environment of the ditch-net deteriorated, and the ecological security also decreased. 4. Economy development, particularly, industrialization is the major impetus for the reconstruction of river reaches in Yangzhong. The river network in the agricu1tural age is characterized by the dentritic river system, which has been changed to straight watercourse after l970's in the industrial age. After all, the essential cause for these transformations is the change of the relationship between human and the environment. 5. The spatial expansion pattern of Yangzhong city and its ecological reservation area is simulated by the Minimum Cumulative Resistance Model. Through scenario analysis, three scenarios, i.e., "no intervention", "current situation adjustment", and "optima1 pattern", are set up to forecast the development of ditch-net pattern in Yangzhong. A.Alternate abstract:本文利用多时段的图象和社会经济资料，以江苏省扬中市为例，首次从景观生态学角度对长江三角洲地区渠网圩田景观和渠网系统进行了深入研究。研究得出以下结论：1）农田一渠道一村落一道路的模式为长江三角洲渠同圩田景观的主要特征。渠网系统在景观中起着重要作用，是构架渠网圩田景观的关键要素。2）扬中的渠网系统主要包括人工修建的河港、渠道和池塘三部分，河港为骨架。河港网络明显具有人工水系的特征。扬中渠同及沿岸以易传播的草本植物种类为主。河港两岸植物种类最丰富。3）近百年来扬中的渠网系统发生了显著变化。 1935年和 1958年河港为近于自然树枝状水系。1980后河港格局表现出典型的人工水系特征，到1994年河港数量和长度明显增加，网络的结构趋于复杂，河港网络趋于完善。但城镇及其附近的渠道和池塘逐渐减少。改造后渠网系统防洪能力大幅度提高，但河水的连通性和流动性下降，生态安全水平下降。4）经济的发展，特别是工业化的进展，为河港的改造主要动力。工业化越快的地区河港的变化也越快。而扬中渠网格局变化根本原因则是人与环境之间关系的变化。引通过最小累积阻力模型模拟，确定扬中城市发展和生态保护用地扩展的空间形态，并利用情景分析方法，设计“放任”、“现状调整”和“最优格局”三种情景，预测扬中渠网系统的发展。

T1  - Study on the potential landscape safety pattern of urban air environment and ecological regulation of green spaces : case study of Shanghai
TT  - 城市空气环境的潜在景观安全格局与绿地的生态调控途径研究 : 以上海为例
AN  - 1024557256
AB  - In this paper, based on analysis of potential landscape safety pattern and urban greenspaces layout, Shanghai metropolitan area, one of the highly urbanized zone at the East China coast, were taken for a example to discuss how to construct and maintain the ecologically sound urban greenspaces system, which is aimed to organized and layout the self-purification components of the urban ecosystem and build up urban landscape safety pattern with the primary intention to improve the air environment. Thus, in this paper, focused on air environment, the potential safety pattern of Shanghai metropolitan area was discussed at 3 different dimensions, and further, suggestions were put forward to build up the ecological regulative function of urban greenspaces with the aim to improve the urban air environment. Firstly, on the base of comparative analysis of regional land use dynamics, air quality situation and urbanization trend, at the regional scale the possible impact of urbanization on the potential landscape pattern focused on air environment was studied. The results showed that air quality were better during the recent years, however, according to the current situation of urbanization, there is still a possible existence that the potential landscape pattern will get worse. Secondly, aided with the remote sensing interpretion of SPOT satellite map of Shanghai metropolitan area, the classification of landscape taxa was performed, and a ecological safety index(ESI) was composed and used for the further geostatistical analysis on potential landscape safety pattern based on landscape structure, the result showed along the urban-rural gradient, the ESI level varied significantly from low value to high value and in summary, the safety level of rural landscape type of low density is much better than that of urban landscape type of high density. Thirdly, based on responses of two common urban plants to air pollution stress, the local air environment safety level was performed. The results showed along the stress gradient from clean sites to the heavily polluted sites, the stomatal density tended to increase while the stomatal length tended to decrease, and the fluctuating asymmetry index shared the similar tendency with stomatal density, however, the spatial pattern of stomata maintained the mean distribution pattern, which showed the constant feature. In summary, stomatal density, stomatal length and fluctuating asymmetry index were appropriate to measure the relative air stress level. Finally, based on theories and principles of urban planning and landscape ecology, some discussional suggestions were put forward on building up the ecologically sound regulation of urban greenspaces on air environment as followings: (1) based on the regional ecological demands, rationalizing the layout of urban greenspaces in metropolitan area; and (2)building up the connectivity of greenspaces and constructing the continuous landscape pattern; and (3)constructing ecological sound urban greenspaces.Alternate abstract:现代城市的通病之一是大量的人工建筑物和基础设施过度地挤占了原有的森林、草地、湿地等自然景观中具有生态安全维护功能的要素所应占有的空间，而仅由都市区域若干残存的次生植被或在被强烈改造的土地上重新营建的绿地构成了城市及其周边区域主要的自然要素，长期以来，人类这种高强度的开发活动强烈地改变了地表覆盖，割裂了高度的人工环境与自然景观的生态联系，从而导致了区域性的环境衰退。同时，由于城市用地比例严重失衡，绿地已成为一种稀缺的景观资源，世界上许多城市目前都面临着绿地定额不足的难题，这种情况在我国尤为突出，特别是在人口稠密、经济发达的大、中城市，城市植被和植物群落的类型、结构与种类成分大多以人的使用目的为决定因素，长期以来城市建设过程中实行“规划开头、建筑紧跟、园林扫尾”的发展方式，导致城市绿地建设普遍存在着规模偏小、结构简化、连结度较低等问题，绿地未能形成完整的生态网络调控体系，从而极大地削弱了对城市环境的调控功能。然而，城市绿地是城市各种人造景观中具有负反馈功能的子系统，就减轻城市空气污染而言，绿地作为一种重要的生态调控因素，只要能维持必要的规模和适当的比例，绿地这种相当重要的生态调控因素就能有效地发挥城市“绿肺”的功能，从而有效地去除部分气态污染物质，从而起到一定程度的环境改善作用，降低人类开发活动所导致的区域生态风险。虽然有众多学者和规划师从不同角度提出了通过绿地建设以改善城市环境的建议和对策，他们都肯定了绿地对城市生态环境的改善具有不可或缺的调控功能，但是并未将问题提升至景观生态安全格局这个层次来探讨如何增强绿地对城市环境尤其是对空气环境的生态调控功能以改善城市整体环境。正是由于规划界和学术界缺乏深层次沟通的原因，使运用绿地系统来构建以改善空气环境为目的的城市景观生态安全格局的观点未能得到应有的重视，然而这正是21世纪建设生态学意义上可持续的人类栖境所必须予以特别关注的重要问题之一。本文以人类活动比较强烈的典型城市区域——上海为研究对象，在研究典型城市潜在景观生态安全格局与绿地系统布局的基础上，探讨如何建设和维持结构完善、综合生态效益显著的城市绿地，旨在合理组织与布局城市的生态自净功能组分，增强以改善空气环境为主要目标的城市景观生态安全格局。本文主要从三个不同层次探讨了城市空气环境的潜在景观安全格局，并在此基础上提出了旨在加强绿地的生态调控功能以改善城市空气环境安全格局的建议与对策。本文首先通过研究区域的土地利用演变趋势、区域空气环境状况及城市化发展趋势的比较分析，探讨了城市化对区域空气环境潜在景观安全水平的可能影响，指出近年来虽然通过产业改造和工业布局调整，上海城市化区域空气环境状况较以往有所改善，然而根据上海城市化发展趋势，基本上可以认为，即使目前城市化区域内主要空气污染物都实现了“零排放”，但是随着城市化区域的扩张和城市热岛水平的加剧，仍不能排除城市化区域空气环境的潜在安全水平仍有继续降低的可能。其次，对以上海市区为代表的高度城市化区域的SPOT卫星遥感图片进行了各类景观类型的解译与识别，在此基础上对于不同下垫面性质的景观单元类型，根据其能耗方式对空气污染的潜在贡献程度确定相应的风险程度等级值，构造了景观生态安全指数（ESI），并运用地统计学方法上海城市空气环境的潜在景观安全格局进行了分析，研究结果表明，基本上沿着建成区的轮廓，城市化区域空气环境的潜在安全水平从中心城区向远郊推移过程中呈现出由低至高的变化趋势。从下垫面类型来看，以零星分散的小村落为主的景观单元、具有一定集聚规模的村镇的景观单元、中心城区外圈以一般建筑物为主的景观单元、中心城区内圈以一般建筑物为主的景观单元、中心城区外圈的以工业区为主的景观单元的空气环境的潜在安全水平表现出显著的变化梯度，总的看来集聚化程度较低的村镇景观类型的潜在安全水平明显优于城市化区域。再者，由于空间尺度的关系，基于景观结构的反映空气环境潜在安全水平的研究有可能掩盖了局地空气环境的差异，因而通过常见园林植物的气孔响应指标和叶片发育稳定性指标进行了基于植物受损响应的局地空气环境安全水平分析，研究结果表明，从较清洁的样点至污染较严重的环境变化梯度上，叶片气孔密度倾向于逐渐增加，而气孔长径则趋于减小；叶片非稳态不对称性指数（FA1）亦趋于增加，而叶片气孔空间分布格局均呈均匀型，似乎未受空气污染胁迫的影响；总的说来，植物气孔和叶片发育稳定性指标均是与植物形态及发育有关的指标，它们对指示环境胁迫尤其是空气污染胁迫的相对严重程度是比较稳定而适合的，它们具有测量简便的优点，尤其适合于多个样点的调查研究，本文只是进行了初步的尝试，还有待于进一步深入研究。最后，本文试图从城市规划和景观生态学角度提出一些探讨性的措施和对策，旨在加强绿地对城市空气环境的生态调控功能，即：（1）根据区域生态需求，合理城区绿地布局；（2）以绿地为纽带，形成连续的景观格局；（3）营建生态型城市绿地。

T1  - A regional restoration grants program to promote preservation and enhancement of urban natural areasr
AN  - 758392301
AB  - The Greenspaces Habitat Restoration Program, a partnership between Metro and US Fish and Wildlife Service in Portland, Oregon was created in 1992, as a component of The Metro Greenspaces and Open Spaces Program--A Regional System of Natural Areas, Open Space, Trails and Greenspaces for Wildlife and People. The goal of the restoration grants program is to fund restoration and enhancement of urban natural areas, with emphasis on opportunities for re-establishment of corridors and consolidation of fragments.              Since 1992, more than 91 small citizen or local park agency restoration projects have been funded. Projects have ranged from small replantings to large scale stream restoration or meadow enhancements.              An additional objective of the program and this paper is to document true costs, resources and volunteers required to conduct a community based urban restoration project. While the enhancements of each project alone will probably not significantly increase species numbers and diversity in the urban area, each project's value may be the introduction of people to the concepts of biodiversity, landscape ecology and each participant's role as a steward.              The Sandee Palisades and Mill Creek restoration projects describe goals, successes, lessons learned and costs of citizen-based restoration projects.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Multiple-scale approaches to the restoration of deciduous forest in southwestern Ontario, Canada
AN  - 304375861
AB  - Intense agricultural and urban land-use has reduced forest cover to 3% in Essex county, southwestern Ontario, Canada. The remaining forest has been degraded by over-grazing, non-native species, recreational use, and, in some cases, poor management. From 1994 to 1996, field studies were conducted in and around Point Pelee National Park (PPNP) with the overall objective of assessing various approaches to habitat restoration.    A preliminary landscape-level analysis of three areas near to PPNP used satellite imagery and geographical information systems (GIS). Forest cover in the area directly north of PPNP (Pelee-north) was less than 3%, while that of nearby Cedar Creek and Pelee Island was 9% and 14%, respectively. The relatively large number of forest patches $<$10ha and great inter-patch distances in Pelee-north suggested that the management focus in this area should be on habitat protection. In contrast, restoration efforts might be more effective elsewhere, where land values are lower and possibilities of increasing the connectivity between the forest remnants are greater.    Since the 1960s, cottages and roads in PPNP have been removed and these sites allowed to regenerate (passive restoration). Since 1988, many sites have been actively restored. Although actively-restored sites were still dominated by ruderal non-natives, results suggested that passively restored sites increased in similarity to relatively undisturbed reference sites as time-since restoration increased. After 35 years, some mesic sites seemed to have recovered completely. In addition, there was no overall difference in native diversity between restored and reference sites. However, multivariate analyses showed significant differences in native species composition between reference and restored sites. Spring ephemerals with restricted seed dispersal were highly vulnerable and will likely have to be reintroduced. Non-native species diversity showed a significant decline over time, especially in wet/mesic sites. Ruderal non-natives declined most rapidly as time-since-restoration increased, while regeneration-inhibiting non-natives showed a less rapid decline. The non-native garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) had little longterm effect on the native understorey plant community.    The success of agroforestry and afforestation was examined in a post-agricultural field outside of PPNP. The effects of fertilisation, weed control, and corn shelter treatments on the growth of three native deciduous tree species was studied from 1994 to 1996. Fertiliser significantly increased tree growth, but only when weeds were adequately controlled. Trees in clover treatments had less growth than those in either full-weed or mown-weed treatments, while trees in weed-free and inter-weed treatments had the greatest growth. Silver maple (Acer saccharinum) and green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) growth was greatest under the corn shelter when plots were fertilised and controlled for weeds. In contrast, growth of bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa) was adversely affected by the corn.    The restoration of deciduous forest holds great promise for this region, whether it create new natural habitat or accelerate the recovery of existing but degraded habitat. However, this region is so highly fragmented that restoration should be co-ordinated at the landscape level if generations of neglect are to be successfully reversed.

T1  - A landscape ecological model for wildlife enhancement of urban stormwater management practices
AN  - 304061410
AB  - A spatial distribution model was developed to predict the pattern of stormwater catchment facilities in developing urban areas. The model was validated through comparison of predicted results with historical data in Guelph, Canada, using nearest neighbour analysis. The validated model has been applied to developing urban-rural fringe lands in Guelph to illustrate land use patterns likely to occur under different scenarios. Simulations of various scenarios for incorporating stormwater catchment facilities into greenways have been tested with the model and the resultant land use patterns compared to the status quo, through measures of landscape ecological integrity such as connectivity and porosity.    The results demonstrated that landscape integrity could be increased, urban wildlife habitat enhanced, and opportunities for residential non-consumptive wildlife recreation improved through integration of the evolving 'blue-green' open space provided by urban stormwater management facilities into existing greenways.
