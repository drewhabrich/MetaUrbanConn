TI  - A Plastic Visual Pathway Regulates Cooperative Behavior in Drosophila Larvae

AB  - Cooperative behavior emerges in biological systems through coordinated actions among individuals [1, 2]. Although widely observed across animal species, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the establishment and maintenance of cooperative behaviors remain largely unknown [3]. To characterize the circuit mechanisms serving the needs of independent individuals and social groups, we investigated cooperative digging behavior in Drosophila larvae [4-6]. Although chemical and mechanical sensations are important for larval aggregation at specific sites [229], an individual larva's ability to participate in a cooperative burrowing cluster relies on direct visual input as well as visual and social experience during development. In addition, vision modulates cluster dynamics by promoting coordinated movements between pairs of larvae [5]. To determine the specific pathways within the larval visual circuit underlying cooperative social clustering, we examined larval photoreceptors (PRs) and the downstream local interneurons (lOLPs) using anatomical and functional studies [10, 11]. Our results indicate that rhodopsin-6-expressing-PRs (Rh6-PRs) and lOLPs are required for both cooperative clustering and movement detection. Remarkably, visual deprivation and social isolation strongly impact the structural and functional connectivity between Rh6-PRs and lOLPs, while at the same time having no effect on the adjacent rhodopsin-5-expressing PRs (Rh5-PRs). Together, our findings demonstrate that a specific larval visual pathway involved in social interactions undergoes experience-dependent modifications during development, suggesting that plasticity in sensory circuits could act as the cellular substrate for social learning, a possible mechanism allowing an animal to integrate into a malleable social environment and engage in complex social behaviors.

AB  - American wildcelery (Vallisneria americana Michx.) is a valuable submersed aquatic plant that was negatively affected by pollution and urban runoff in the lower Detroit River for much of the 20th century. Following 25 years of water-pollution and urban- runoff abatement initiated in the early 1970s, we postulated that water clarity had increased and that this would allow restoration of wildcelery in the lower Detroit River. In addition, water clarity increased in the late 1980s due to waterfiltration and particulate removal by exotic dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis), which could contribute to potential wildcelery restoration. We sampled wildcelery in 1996-97 and compared these data to wildcelery data from 1950-51 and 1984-85. Over the 48-year period of comparison, areal density of wildcelery tubers decreased 72% (from 51.2 million to 14.4 million tubers) between 1950-51 and 1984-85 then increased 251% (from 14.4 million to 50.5 million tubers) between 1984-85 and 1996-97. As a result, overall areal abundance was about the same in 1950-51 as in fall 1996-97. However, tuber densities in spring 1996 were similar to historical low abundances in springs of 1984-85. Then between spring and fall 1996, tuber densities increased 333% and remained relatively abundant through October 1997 indicating the beginning of the restoration of wildcelery in the lower Detroit River. In addition, we believe further reductions of turbidity through continued pollution-abatement programs and water filtration by dreissenid mussels combined with habitat protection and active management of wildcelery will contribute even further to the restoration of wildcelery in the Detroit River in the 21st century.

AB  - Abundance estimation of carnivore populations is difficult and has prompted the use of non-invasive detection methods, such as remotely-triggered cameras, to collect data. To analyze photo data, studies focusing on carnivores with unique pelage patterns have utilized a mark-recapture framework and studies of carnivores without unique pelage patterns have used a mark-resight framework. We compared mark-resight and mark-recapture estimation methods to estimate bobcat (Lynx rufus) population sizes, which motivated the development of a new "hybrid" mark-resight model as an alternative to traditional methods. We deployed a sampling grid of 30 cameras throughout the urban southern California study area. Additionally, we physically captured and marked a subset of the bobcat population with GPS telemetry collars. Since we could identify individual bobcats with photos of unique pelage patterns and a subset of the population was physically marked, we were able to use traditional mark-recapture and mark-resight methods, as well as the new "hybrid" mark-resight model we developed to estimate bobcat abundance. We recorded 109 bobcat photos during 4,669 camera nights and physically marked 27 bobcats with GPS telemetry collars. Abundance estimates produced by the traditional mark-recapture, traditional mark-resight, and "hybrid" mark-resight methods were similar, however precision differed depending on the models used. Traditional mark-recapture and mark-resight estimates were relatively imprecise with percent confidence interval lengths exceeding 100% of point estimates. Hybrid mark-resight models produced better precision with percent confidence intervals not exceeding 57%. The increased precision of the hybrid mark-resight method stems from utilizing the complete encounter histories of physically marked individuals (including those never detected by a camera trap) and the encounter histories of naturally marked individuals detected at camera traps. This new estimator may be particularly useful for estimating abundance of uniquely identifiable species that are difficult to sample using camera traps alone.

AB  - The feasibility of reintroducing anadromous salmonids into reservoirs above high-head dams is affected by the suitability of the reservoir habitat for rearing and the interactions of the resident fish with introduced fish. We evaluated the predation risk to anadromous salmonids considered for reintroduction in Merwin Reservoir on the North Fork Lewis River in Washington State for two reservoir use-scenarios: year-round rearing and smolt migration. We characterized the role of the primary predators, Northern Pikeminnow Ptychocheilus oregonensis and tiger muskellunge (Northern Pike Esox lucius x Muskellunge E. masquinongy), by using stable isotopes and stomach content analysis, quantified seasonal, per capita predation using bioenergetics modeling, and evaluated the size and age structures of the populations. We then combined these inputs to estimate predation rates of size-structured population units. Northern Pikeminnow of FL >= 300 mm were highly cannibalistic and exhibited modest, seasonal, per capita predation on salmonids, but they were disproportionately much less abundant than smaller, less piscivorous, conspecifics. The annual predation on kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka (in biomass) by a size-structured unit of 1,000 Northern Pikeminnow having a FL >= 300 mm was analogous to 16,000-40,000 age-0 spring Chinook Salmon O. tshawytscha rearing year-round, or 400-1,000 age-1 smolts migrating April-June. The per capita consumption of salmonids by Northern Pikeminnow having a FL >= 200 mm was relatively low, due in large part to spatial segregation during the summer and the skewed size distribution of the predator population. Tiger muskellunge fed heavily on Northern Pikeminnow, other nonsalmonids, and minimally on salmonids. In addition to cannibalism within the Northern Pikeminnow population, predation by tiger muskellunge likely contributed to the low recruitment of larger (more piscivorous) Northern Pikeminnow, thereby decreasing the risk of predation to salmonids. This study highlights the importance of evaluating trophic interactions within reservoirs slated for reintroduction with anadromous salmonids, as they can be functional migration corridors and may offer profitable juvenile-rearing habitats despite hosting abundant predator populations.

AB  - Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) have a global distribution, but the population inhabiting the Gulf of California (GoC) is thought to be geographically and genetically isolated. However, their distribution and movements are poorly known. The goal of this study was to describe fin whale movements for the first time from 11 Argos satellite tags deployed in the southwest GoC in March 2001. A Bayesian Switching State-Space Model was applied to obtain improved locations and to characterize movement behavior as either "area-restricted searching" (indicative of patch residence, ARS) or "transiting" (indicative of moving between patches). Model performance was assessed with convergence diagnostics and by examining the distribution of the deviance and the behavioral parameters from Markov Chain Monte Carlo models. ARS was the predominant mode behavior 83% of the time during both the cool (December-May) and warm seasons (June-November), with slower travel speeds (mean = 0.84 km/h) than during transiting mode (mean = 3.38 km/h). We suggest ARS mode indicates either foraging activities (year around) or reproductive activities during the winter (cool season). We tagged during the cool season, when the whales were located in the Loreto-La Paz Corridor in the southwestern GoC, close to the shoreline. As the season progressed, individuals moved northward to the Midriff Islands and the upper gulf for the warm season, much farther from shore. One tag lasted long enough to document a whale's return to Loreto the following cool season. One whale that was originally of undetermined sex, was tagged in the Bay of La Paz and was photographed 10 years later with a calf in the nearby San Jose Channel, suggesting seasonal site fidelity. The tagged whales moved along the western GoC to the upper gulf seasonally and did not transit to the eastern GoC south of the Midriff Islands. No tagged whales left the GoC, providing supporting evidence that these fin whales are a resident population.

AB  - The Lesser White-fronted Goose Anser erythropus, which breeds across northern Eurasia from Norway to Chukotka, is globally threatened and is currently classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The Eastern Palearctic population of the species was thought to breed in arctic Russia, from east of the Taimyr Peninsula to Chukotka, and to winter in East Asia, but its precise status, abundance, breeding and wintering ranges, and migration routes were largely unknown, reducing the effectiveness of conservation efforts. In this paper, we combined results from satellite tracking, field surveys, a literature review and expert knowledge, to present an updated overview of the winter distribution and abundance of Lesser White-fronted Geese in the Eastern Palearctic, highlighting their migration corridors, habitat use and the conservation status of the key sites used throughout the annual cycle. Improved count coverage puts the Eastern Palearctic Lesser White-fronted Geese population at c. 6,800 birds in 2020, which represents a rapid and worrying decline since the estimate of 16,000 in 2015, as it suggests at least a halving of numbers in just five years. East Dongting Lake (Hunan Province) in China is the most important wintering site for the species in East Asia, followed by Poyang Lake (Jiangxi Province) and Caizi Lake (Anhui Province), with one key wintering site in Miyagi County in Japan. Satellite tracking showed that eight individuals captured during summer on the Rauchua River, Chukotka, Russia wintered in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River floodplain in China. Their migration speed was slower in spring than in autumn, mainly because of longer stopover duration at staging sites in spring. The tracked geese mainly used cultivated land on migration stopovers (52% in spring; 45% in autumn), tundra habitat in summer (63%), and wetlands (66%) in winter. Overall, 87% of the GPS fixes were in protected areas during the winter, far greater than in spring (37%), autumn (28%) and summer (7%). We urge more tracking of birds of differing wintering and breeding provenance to provide a fuller understanding of the migration routes, staging sites and breeding areas used by the geese, including for the birds wintering in Japan. The most urgent requirement is to enhance effective conservation and long-term monitoring of Lesser White-fronted Geese across sites within China, and particularly to improve our understanding of the management actions needed to maintain the species. Collaboration between East Asian countries also is essential, to coordinate monitoring and to formulate effective protection measures for safeguarding this population in the future.

AB  - This paper brings together a multidisciplinary initiative to develop advanced statistical and computational techniques for analyzing, assessing, and extracting information from raster maps. This information will provide a rigorous foundation to address a wide range of applications including disease mapping, emerging infectious diseases, landscape ecological assessment, land cover trends and change detection, watershed assessment, and map accuracy assessment. It will develop an advanced map analysis system that integrates these techniques with an advanced visualization toolbox, and use the system to conduct large case studies using rich sets of raster data, primarily from remotely sensed imagery. As a result, it will be possible to study and evaluate raster maps of societal, ecological, and environmental variables to facilitate quantitative characterization and comparative analysis of geospatial trends, patterns, and phenomena. In addition to environmental and ecological studies, these techniques and tools can be used for policy decisions at national, state, and local levels, crisis management, and protection of infrastructure.
   Geospatial data form the foundation of an information-based society. Remote sensing has been a vastly under-utilized resource involving a multi-million dollar investment at the national levels. Even when utilized, the credibility has been at stake, largely because of lack of tools that can assess, visualize, and communicate accuracy and reliability in timely manner and at desired confidence levels.
   Consider an imminent 21st century scenario: What message does a multi-categorical map have about the large landscape it represents? And at what scale, and at what level of detail? Does the spatial pattern of the map reveal any societal, ecological, environmental condition of the landscape? And therefore can it be an indicator of change? How do you automate the assessment of the spatial structure and behavior of change to discover critical areas, hot spots, and their corridors? Is the map accurate? How accurate is it? How do you assess the accuracy of the map? How do we evaluate a temporal change map for change detection? What are the implications of the kind and amount of change and accuracy on what matters, whether climate change, carbon emission, water resources, urban sprawl, biodiversity, indicator species, human health, or early warning? And with what confidence? The proposed research initiative is expected to find answers to these questions and a few more that involve multi-categorical raster maps based on remote sensing and other geospatial data. It includes the development of techniques for map modeling and analysis using Markov Random Fields, geospatial statistics, accuracy assessment and change detection, upper echelons of surfaces, advanced computational techniques for geospatial data mining, and advanced visualization techniques.

AB  - Simulations of the continuous felling of trees in boom-corridors have suggested that it may be possible to increase harvester productivity by a factor of 2.4 when thinning young dense stands. A prototype boom-tip mounted felling head for harvesting in this fashion was therefore built and tested in the field. Using the new head, stands with a density of 10,000 trees ha(-1) and a mean diameter at breast height (dbh) of 7 cm were felled at a speed of 0.4 m s(-1), with an efficiency of 3.5 s tree(-1). The felling speed was limited by the speed of movement of the harvester crane's boom. However, additional tests suggested that the new head could be operated at felling speeds of up to 1.3 m s(-1) when cutting trees with dbh values of up to 8 cm. The simulation that prompted this study focused on multiple felling with the crane in continuous motion at speeds of 1 m s(-1); the results obtained in this work suggest that the new felling head is capable of sustaining these speeds and so further technical development of the design (e.g. to incorporate accumulating functionality) is warranted.

AB  - The lowland forests of western and central tropical Africa are separated by several potential biogeographic barriers to dispersal for forest adapted vertebrates. The two primary barriers are (1) the Dahomey Gap, a savanna corridor that reaches the coast of southern Ghana, Togo and Benin, and separates the West African rainforest into the Upper (Ghana west to Guinea) and Lower Guinea (Nigeria to Uganda and Angola) forest blocks, and (2) the Lower Niger River, a large delta that separates Western and Eastern Nigeria. Previous studies on terrestrial vertebrates (lizards, mammals and birds) have highlighted a genetic break in the Dahomey Gap/Lower Niger River area although the relative importance of each barrier has not been assessed due to limitations in geographic sampling. We compared the phylogeographic history of two co-distributed sister-species of woodpeckers (Campethera caroli and C nivosa) using data from three loci representing all inheritance modes. Our analyses revealed that both the Dahomey Gap and possibly the Lower Niger River acted as strong biogeographic barriers for the two woodpecker species, with the Lower Niger River being the first barrier to have formed, leading to three distinct populations of C nivosa. Our divergence time analyses revealed that both these biogeographic barriers formed during the Pleistocene, supporting the Pleistocene refuge hypothesis, with the Dahomey Gap likely appearing about 0.5 myr BP. No genetic structure was recovered among sampled populations in either the Upper or the Lower Guinea Forest Block for both species, despite the considerable geographic area covered.

AB  - The Philippine archipelago hosts an exceptional diversity of murid rodents that have diversified following several independent colonization events. Here, we report the discovery of a new species of rodent from Mt. Kampalili on eastern Mindanao Island. Molecular and craniodental analyses reveal this species as a member of a Philippine "New Endemic" clade consisting of Tarsomys, Limnomys, and Rattus everetti (tribe Rattini). This new species of "shrew-mouse" is easily distinguished from its relatives in both craniodental and external characteristics including a long, narrow snout; small eyes and ears; short, dark, dense fur dorsally and ventrally; stout body with a tapering, visibly haired tail shorter than head and body length; stout forepaws; bulbous and nearly smooth braincase; narrow, tapering rostrum; short incisive foramina; slender mandible; and narrow, slightly opisthodont incisors. This new genus and species of murid rodent illustrates that murids of the tribe Rattini have exhibited greater species and morphological diversification within the Philippines than previously known and provides evidence that Mt. Kampalili represents a previously unrecognized center of mammalian endemism on Mindanao Island that is deserving of conservation action.

AB  - Fishes that evolutionarily demonstrated a fluvial life history expression and migrated to spawning and rearing habitat by using lotic corridors are increasingly impacted by fragmentation. The overall goal of this study was to identify the contemporary importance of main-stem connectivity and tributaries for maintaining life history expression, population structure, and viability of a large metapopulation of Bonneville Cutthroat Trout (BCT)Oncorhynchus clarkii utahpersisting in the highly fragmented Weber River, Utah. We used a multifaceted approach, including active sampling, mark-recapture, passive PIT tag detection, otolith microchemistry, and genetics. We collected BCT in all tributaries and the main stem, encountering age-0 fish in three tributaries, indicating successful reproduction. In tributaries, the size structure was bimodal and consisted of smaller fish that were classified as resident and larger fish that were deemed to be fluvial, whereas all sizes and ages (age >= 1) were present in the main stem. We identified up to eight age-classes; tributaries were dominated by ages 2 and 8, and the main stem was dominated by ages 2, 5, 6, and 7. Tributary BCT had lower growth rates than BCT in the main stem. We observed a surprising degree of fluvial life history expression, and fish also demonstrated very complex movement patterns across their life span. Average apparent survival (33%) was within the range estimated in similar studies for BCT, and the resight rate was best explained by angler management regulations. The fact that BCT in the Weber River and tributaries still reproduce successfully in most years and are still able to grow into large, fluvial fish suggests that connectivity must be occasionally available despite considerable fragmentation. Therefore, this metapopulation may need little further human intervention if barriers to fish passage can be removed, thereby improving connectivity, and it represents a high-priority metapopulation for conservation, thus highlighting the utility of our approach.

AB  - The extent of home ranges of griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus) was studied on Crete (Greece) during 2005-2015 by monitoring 27 individuals with very high frequency radio-telemetry. Radio-tagged birds were followed for an average period of 13.1 months (n = 7-22), where a total of 1615 days of fieldwork produced 4420 radiolocations (x = 163.5 radiolocations per tagged bird, n = 142-328). Overall, the mean home range and mean core area of griffon vultures were estimated at 1560 +/- 140 km(2) (KDE 95%) and 373 +/- 36 km(2) (KDE 50%) respectively with significant age-related differences within seasons. Immature griffon vultures ranged on average about double the area ranged by adults in winter and occupied significantly larger core areas. The home range overlap in per cent and utilization distribution between adult and immature birds was also significantly less in winter than in summer. Foraging griffon vultures avoided northern slopes with unfavourable flight conditions and selected sites within rangelands with low diurnal temperature variations where overwintering livestock and suitable nesting cliffs occur. Foraging adults were restricted to the vicinity of the breeding colonies and favoured sites away from urban zones. In contrast, immature griffon vultures selected pastoral zones in marginal areas with mild winters and rugged terrain. The existence of predictable food sources in combination with suitable roosting sites and favourable flight conditions were the main factors differentiating the space-use pattern between the two age classes. We recommend that apart from the maintenance of traditional farming practices, sites, such as large communal roosts and flight corridors or entire 'hotspot' activity zones of immature birds, should be taken into account in conservation planning and sensitivity mapping for the species.

AB  - Stream conservation and restoration strategies commonly focus on preserving extant riparian forest and restoring riparian habitat. Though these practices are beneficial to stream habitat, they may not suffice to restore stream condition in catchments heavily influenced by intensive land use. To evaluate this hypothesis, we measured invertebrate populations in 12 streams affected by different land-use types (cultivated, developed, forested and grassland). Within each stream, we compared reaches with and without riparian buffers of remnant mature forest. Within each reach, we calculated the relative abundance of individuals from the insect orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (%EPT) and assessed specific conductance, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature and substratum composition. Forested catchments had the highest %EPT (average 23.8) followed by grassland (16.1), cultivated (1.96) and developed (0.31). Reaches with forested buffers present were not associated with higher %EPT in forested, cultivated or developed catchments. In grassland catchments, however, %EPT was about eightfold higher in reaches with forested buffers than those without. High values of %EPT were associated with large stream substratum and low specific conductance and temperature, which were most common in forested catchments. Developed and cultivated catchments did not follow this pattern, %EPT being uniformly low, even where abiotic conditions were similar to forested catchments. These results confirm that intensive urban and cultivated land uses at the catchment scale degrade stream biological communities. They also indicate that patchy forested riparian corridors, as found in many restoration projects, are probably insufficient to mitigate severe, large-scale biological degradation.

AB  - Although many important prehistoric sites are known from South Africa, few comparable contexts have been discovered and documented in the northern Namibia and southern Angola borderlands. During a geomorphic assessment of riparian corridors in Namibia's Kaokoveld region, Middle Stone Age (MSA in Africa; broadly correlative with European Paleolithic) lithic artifacts were found preserved in unstratified plein air sites located atop a terrace adjacent to the perennial Cunene River. These remains attest to hominin activities along the northern edge of the modern hyperarid Namib Desert, which receives less than 100 mm of rainfall in a year. The location of the archaeological site is quite remote, and is along the eastern perimeter of the hyperarid Cunene erg (sandsea), and downstream of the Marienfluss-Hartmann Valley near Serra Cafema, At the Cafema site (as it is known), more than 30 lithic artifacts are preserved in the Cunene River valley, in context of a former river terrace. The artifacts discovered by a walking survey include quartzite flakes, cores, and points with some edge abrasion and varnish, including the first Levallois-Mousterian points found in this region of Africa. Since the archaeology of this area is poorly known, these cultural assemblages enable initial correlations across the continent, and provide a basis for reconstructing provenience, procurement and tool manufacture during the Middle Pleistocene, the time frame marked by the first appearance and the dispersal of the modern human species Homo sapiens.
   To assess the potential source areas for lithic raw materials in this region, pebble counting methods and compositional assessment were conducted on the artifacts and Quaternary alluvium (Qal) of the relict river terrace at Cafema. Based on the composition of the artifacts found on the surface, siliceous rock was an important resource for lithic manufacture during the MSA; this is reflected in the observation that quartzite was overwhelmingly the dominant material used in the stone tool manufacture. Quartzite is generally known to be a preferred material for making tools of consistent size, ease of knapping, quality of form-shape, and persistence of edge retention.
   To define regional procurement areas where hominin may have acquired quartzite raw materials at local (0-5 km), regional (6-20 km) and supra-regional (21-100 km) scales, we examined the geological outcrops in the region to identify potential sources. Due to its remoteness, the geology of this region of southern Africa is not well known, and the available maps are only available at coarse scales of resolution. Geologic outcrops along the Cunene River include some of the world's oldest rocks dating to the Vaalian similar to 1760 Ma, and comprise part of a Large Igneous Province (LIP) that stretches across the African continent. The local bedrock outcrops near Cafema include a medium-to-high grade metamorphic complex, granitoids, and surrounding country rock - these rocks comprise the rugged mountainous terrain incised by the Cunene River.
   Since quartzite is the dominant clast type occurring as raw material in the river terrace where the MSA artifacts themselves were found, we can conclude that river terrace materials (Qal) themselves were among the likely raw material sources exploited during antiquity. Rounded quartzite boulders and cobbles are present as surface lag, along with the artifacts in the Qal within the relict river terrace at the plein air site. The river terrace itself is the closest source to the observed artifacts. If the raw material source was alluvial (i.e., within the Qal unit), quartzite river cobbles may have been derived from outcrops located further upstream the Cunene system, which is a large river network that drains a diversity of geologic units. Although it is not possible to identify the precise formation and procurement area of origin, we offer some relative assessments about likely source areas within the region, based on the geology. The specific geologic units that may have contributed quartzite clasts to the Qal river terrace include the (1) Damara Sequence (Nda); and (2) lithologies within the undifferentiated Mokolian unit, which are not well mapped in detail. The closest potential primary sources of quartzite raw materials in Nda rock outcrops (i.e., not alluvium within the Qal terrace at the site) are located within 2 km of the Cafema site. However, confirmed source locales in the past could not be specifically identified in the field.
   The hypothesis offered is that the Qal alluvial components within the relict terrace of the Cunene River was a preferred source for quartzite lithic raw materials used by mobile hunter-gatherers to make tools during the MSA, sometime after similar to 225 kya. Cafema is the first MSA site in northern Namibia that is in direct stratigraphic context with a securely dated unit. A replicate OSL-SAR date similar to 220 kyr has provided initial age constraints on a sandy unit preserved within the cobble-boulder Qal terrace fill, and constrains the maximum age for the overlying archaeological assemblage. These findings advance the reconstruction of this cultural landscape through a geoarchaeological lens, and form a basis for understanding the relict Pleistocene landscape and environment, its plant resources, and proximity to raw material sources within the riparian corridor of the perennial Cunene River.

AB  - Roads and powerline corridors destroy canopy connectivity in the rainforest of north- east Australia. We tested the hypotheses that linear barriers affect ( a) the alignment of home ranges, ( b) use of habitat either side of linear barriers, and ( c) the crossing of them by the strictly arboreal lemuroid ringtail possum ( Hemibelideus lemuroides), which is known to be vulnerable to habitat fragmentation. Radio- tracking and a translocation experiment were conducted at a narrow 7- m- wide road and an 80- m- wide powerline. Homes ranges of lemuroid ringtails ranged from 0.15 to 1.67 ha ( minimum convex polygon) and were aligned with the road but not powerline corridors. When lemuroid ringtails were experimentally translocated, wider canopy clearings over roads reduced their capacity to return to their original home range, and the powerline corridor was a nearly insurmountable barrier. No possums were observed crossing roads or the powerline corridor at ground level or residing in the intervening matrix, indicating that loss of canopy connectivity has a negative impact on their movements.

AB  - Reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) and portland cement concrete (RPCC) are abundant and available substitutes for natural aggregate in many areas. This paper presents an overview of factors that affect recycled aggregate cost, availability, and engineering performance, and the results of a survey of business practices in the Mid-Atlantic region. For RAP, processing costs are less than those for virgin natural aggregate. Use of efficient asphalt pavement stripping technology, on-site reclamation, and linked two-way transport of asphalt debris and processed asphalt paving mix between asphalt mix plants and paving sites has led to extensive recycling of asphalt pavement in the Mid-Atlantic region of the US. Most of the sites that recycle asphalt pavement (RAP) are located in or near urban areas close to important transportation corridors. RPCC is a viable aggregate source in urban settings where unit costs for processed aggregate from RPCC and natural aggregate are comparable. Disposal fees charged at RPCC recycling sites help defray processing costs and the significantly lower tipping fees at recycling sites versus landfill disposal sites encourage recycling of construction debris as aggregate. Construction contractors and construction debris recycling centers, many of which have the ability to crush and process concrete debris at the job site, produce most RPCC. Production of RPCC aggregate from construction debris that is processed on site using portable equipment moved to the construction site eliminates transportation costs for aggregate and provides an economic incentive for RPCC use. Processing costs, quality and performance issues, and lack of large quantities where needed limit RPCC use. Most RPCC suppliers in the Mid-Atlantic area are located in counties with population densities greater than 400 people/km(2) (1036 people/mile(2)) and that have high unit-value costs and limited local availability of natural aggregate.

AB  - We examined why the lower Little Colorado River (LCR), Arizona continues to be dominated by four native fish species despite decades of encroachment by nine nonnative species. Most perennial flow begins at Blue Spring. located at river kilometer (RKM) 20.74 above the LCR's mouth, which is supplemented downriver by other springs. Blue Spring's water is extremely supersaturated with dissolved CO2 (658 mg/L), and at baseflow the CO2 concentrations apparently functioned as a fish-barrier for about 1 km further downriver until it outgassed to 288 mg/L. Thereafter, CO2 outgassed to 202 mg/L by the top of Chute Falls (RKM 14.20) and 76 mg/L near the river's mouth. Chute Falls, and high CO2 levels above it, obstruct upriver. hut not downriver, fish movements; however, we still captured fishes from eight nonnative species above this falls. Our findings indicate most warmwater nonnative fishes in the LCR were immigrants from upriver sources within and bordering the intermittent corridor that invaded the system during floods, while most coldwater trout invaded limn the Colorado River. Most nonnative species failed or were severely limited at reproducing progeny in the LCR, except occasionally by channel catfish Ictaluncs punctatus and fathead minnow Pimephales promelas in the lower 13.57 km corridor, which was likely related to CO2. Correlation tests suggested severe flood and/or suspended sediment regimes reduced populations of fathead minnows, red shiners Cyprinella lutrensis, and plains killifish Fundulus zebrinus in the LCR. Conversely, severe suspended sediment regimes (especially >= 60,000 mg/L) increased channel catfish, black bullhead Awnings melas, and common carp Cyprinus carpio, hypothetically by paralyzing these fishes upriver, whereby many drifted downstream and recovered in the lower LCR; however, their abundances decreased after prolonged periods of high CO2. Nonnative fishes are controlled in the LCR by the system's endemic abiotic conditions.

AB  - We present the results of a compliance-based excavation on the banks of Peach Tree Creek within the alluvial margin of the Nepean River, Penrith, NSW. The excavations consisted of (i) two mechanically excavated trenches (3 x 1 m) in controlled 20cm spits to depths of 4 m below surface, and (ii) a subsequent stage of manual salvage excavation (6 m(2)) focussing on the artefact-bearing levels indicated by the testing phase. The excavations identified two sedimentary deposits, with the lowest being part of the Cranebrook Formation, a deep alluvial deposit within which artefacts dating to >40 ka have been previously reported. We recovered four indurated mudstone/tuff and two coarse silcrete artefacts, all having characteristics of the late Pleistocene/early Holocene, and which we have OSL dated to >9.5 ka from the upper portion of the Richmond Unit of the Cranebrook Formation (3.5-3.9 m below the surface). Along with a greater understanding of the formation (only a part of which was deposited during the last 50 ka) and recent archaeological discoveries, our results lend increasing support for visitation of the Nepean river corridor by Aboriginal people as a part of the initial colonisation of Australia. It remained a key locale for occupation and visitation throughout the late Pleistocene. Finally, we discuss the current NSW State government guidelines for investigating archaeological deposits and identify concerns about their effectiveness and applicability when investigating areas of potentially deep stratigraphy along the banks of the Nepean River.

AB  - Diachronic analysis with a GIS-based classification of land-use changes based on aerial photographs, orthophotos, topographic maps, geotechnical reports, urban plans, and using landscape metrics has permitted insight into the driving forces responsible for landscape fragmentation in the Mont Saint-Hilaire (MSH) Biosphere Reserve over the period 1958-2015. Although the occurrence of exogenous factors, such as extreme weather and fires, can have a significant influence on the fragmentation of the territory in time and space, the accelerated development of the built environment (+470%) is nevertheless found to be primarily responsible for landscape fragmentation and the loss of areas formerly occupied by orchards, agriculture, and woodlands. The landscape metrics used corroborate these results, with a simplification of the shape of polygons, and once again reveal the difficulties of harmonizing different land uses. MSH has become somewhat of a forest island in a sea of residential development and agriculture. To counter this isolation of fragmented habitat components, forest corridors have been proposed and developed for the Biosphere Reserve and particularly for the core area. Two corridors, to the north and south, are used to connect the protected area and other wooded areas at the regional scale, in order to promote genetic exchange between populations of various species. In that regard, the forest buffer zone around the hill continues to play a key role and has great ecological value for species and ecological preservation and conservation. However, appropriate management and landscape preservation actions should recognize and focus on landscape composition and the associated geographical configuration.

AB  - This review examines available published information on ethylene emission sources, emission magnitudes, and inhalation exposures in order to assess those factors and circumstances that can affect human contact with this omnipresent gas. The results reveal that airborne ethylene concentrations at the ppb levels are commonplace and can arise in the vicinity of traffic corridors, forest fires, indoor kitchens, horticultural areas, oil fields, house fires, and petrochemical sites. The primary biogenic sources of ethylene derive from microbial activity in most soil and marine environments as well as its biological formation in wide variety of plant species. Sizable amounts of ethylene can also result from the burning of fossil fuels, forest and savanna fires, and crop residue combustion. Motor vehicle exhaust is the largest contributor to urban ethylene levels under most circumstances, but industrial flare releases and fugitive emissions may also be of relevance. Occupational exposures generally range up to about 50-100 ppm and have been documented for those working in the horticultural, petrochemical, and fire and rescue industries. Continuous personal monitoring at the community level has documented exposures of 3-4 ppb. These levels are more closely associated with the ethylene concentrations found indoors rather than outdoors indicating the importance of exposure sources found within the home. Indoor air sources of ethylene are associated with environmental tobacco smoke, wood or propane fuel use, fruit and vegetable storage, and cooking. Ethylene is not found in any consumer or commercial products and does not off-gas from building products to any appreciable extent. The review indicates that outdoor sources located some distance from the home do not make an appreciable contribution to personal exposures given the strength and variety of sources found in the immediate living environment.

AB  - Using process thinking and an eye to movement, I argue that the Canadian First Nations people of Wemindji, James Bay, Quebec modify their environment much more than physical landscape measures show. Wemindji Cree live in a dynamic coastal setting where land rises up having been weighed down during the last glaciation. Rising land causes plant and animal habitats to shift and with them, prime goose hunting locations. As part of their resource management system, Cree cut large forest corridors, dike wetlands, and are experimenting with prescribed burnings to facilitate hunting geese, an important subsistence and cultural resource. While large by any reasonable definition (some corridors are a kilometre long), these changes pale against the vast boreal forest. Through corridor cutting, Cree modify, by rough calculation, less than 1 percent of the coast. Seen this way, Wemindji may look to some like an unused wilderness, ripe for development. But Cree affect geese, the target resource, dramatically more than land-change metrics show by altering key nodes that reverberate through the goose-scape. My analysis provides a novel view of Cree land and resource use and helps affirm Cree stewardship and occupation of their territory against Quebec's development plans.

AB  - In this study, we present new records of the extinct South American proboscidean Notiomastodon platensis from three new fossiliferous sites in the riverbed of Cauca River, in the department of Valle del Cauca, Colombia. The fossil specimens were found in late Pleistocene deposits and include immature to senile Notiomastodon platensis individuals, comprising abundant dental and post-cranial materials. A review of the geographic distribution of the Notiomastodon platensis records in Colombia suggests that this giant mammal used the inter-Andean valleys as migratory corridors, possibly due to the presence of more suitable environmental conditions (lower temperatures and dry-forest) and energy-saving terrains, avoiding more prominent Andean hills. In addition, the Cauca Valley deposits stand out as having palaeontological significance to the comprehension of the late Pleistocene of the western region of South America.

AB  - The polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) composition of the mammalian central nervous system is almost wholly composed of two long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA). docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA). PUFA are dietarily essential, thus normal infant/neonatal brain, intellectual growth and development cannot be accomplished if they are deficient during pregnancy and lactation. Uniquely in the human species, the fetal brain consumes 70% of the energy delivered to it by mother. DHA and AA are needed to construct placental and fetal tissues for cell membrane growth, structure and function, Contemporary evidence shows that the maternal circulation is depleted of AA and DHA during fetal growth. Sustaining normal adult human brain function also requires LC-PUFA.
   Homo sapiens is unlikely to have evolved a large, complex, metabolically expensive brain in an environment which did not provide abundant dietary LC-PUFA. Conversion of 18-carbon PUFA from vegetation to AA and DHA is considered quantitatively insufficient due to a combination of high rates of PUFA oxidation for energy, inefficient and rate limited enzymatic conversion and substrate recycling. The littoral marine and lacustrine food chains provide consistently greater amounts of pre-formed LC-PUFA than the terrestrial food chain. Dietary levels of DHA are 2.5-100 fold higher for equivalent weights of marine fish or shellfish vs. lean or fat terrestrial meats. Mammalian brain tissue and bird egg yolks, especially from marine birds, are the richest terrestrial sources of LC-PUFA. However, land animal adipose fats have been linked to vascular disease and mental ill-health. whereas marine lipids have been demonstrated to be protective. At South African Capesites, large shell middens and fish remains are associated with evidence for some of the earliest modern humans. Cape sites dating from 100 to 18 kya cluster within 200 km of the present coast. Evidence of early H. sapiens is also found around the Rift Valley lakes and up the Nile Corridor into the Middle East; in some cases there is an association with the use of littoral resources. Exploitation of river, estuarine, stranded and spawning fish, shellfish and sea bird nestlings and eggs by Homo could have provided essential dietary LC-PUFA for men, women, and children without requiring organized hunting/fishing, or sophisticated social behavior. It is however, predictable from the present evidence that exploitation of this food resource Would have provided the advantage in multi-generational. brain development which would have made possible the advent of H. sapiens. Restriction to land based foods as postulated by the savannah and other hypotheses would have led to degeneration of the brain and vascular system as happened without exception in all other land based apes and mammals as they evolved larger bodies.

AB  - At present, only a small proportion of the potential extractable bioenergy from young dense forests in Sweden is utilized. The conventional mechanized first thinning systems used in such stands suffer from low productivity, so the operation is only profitable in stands with bigger trees and high standing volumes. Conventional harvesters are used for this operation equipped with accumulating felling heads designed for handling several trees during each crane cycle. In thinning from below the felling and bunching work requires many time-consuming nonlinear crane movements to avoid felling or damaging of future crop trees. However, higher productivity can be achieved when trees between strip roads are harvested in about 1 m-wide corridors with a length corresponding to the reach of the crane. We refer to this operation as boom-corridor thinning. The objective of this study was to compare felling and bunching productivity in young dense stands when employing thinning from below or boom-corridor thinning. Experiments were performed using a randomized block design involving between 4400 and 18600 treesxha(-1) with a corresponding average tree size of 7.2 and 3.2 cm dbh, respectively. Based on the average tree being removed at a dbh of 5.7 cm, the productivity (ODtxPW-hour(-1)) was significant (almost 16%) higher for the boom-corridor thinning than for thinning from below treatment. At the same time, the time taken for the work element "Crane in-between" (the period between the loaded crane starting to move towards a tree and the felling head rapidly slowing down for positioning) was significantly reduced, by almost 17%. The positive results were achieved even though the operator was new to the method. To achieve a significantly higher efficiency during the felling and bunching operation, development of new harvesting equipment and operating techniques seems crucial.

AB  - There is a growing concern about continued impairment of aquatic ecosystems resulting from increasing population size, land use, climate change, and the feedbacks that may harm human well-being. We describe a 100 year multi-disciplinary overview of changes in Lake St. Clair, North America to identify knowledge gaps and needs to build the foundation for creating coupled human and natural system models. Our historical analysis indicates that the socioeconomic dynamics are inextricably linked to the urban dynamics of the Detroit metropolitan area. Environmental degradation and human health issues led to the adoption of relevant policies, including construction of wastewater treatment facilities by the 1960s. Climate trends during the 100-year period indicate a wetter region, which is influencing lake levels. Since the mid-1980s and 90s invasive zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena rostriformis bugenis) have significantly altered the ecological. structure and function of the lake. Waterborne illnesses due to contaminated drinking water were once an issue but current human health risks have shifted to contaminated recreational waters and coastal pollution. Key research needs for building coupled models include geo-referencing socioeconomic and ecological data to accurately represent the processes occurring within the political and watershed boundaries; assessing ecosystem services for human well-being; and developing research hypotheses and management options regarding interactions among land use, people and the lake. Lake St. Clair has gone through extensive changes, both socioeconomically and ecologically over the last 100 years and we suggest that it serves as a useful case study for the larger Great Lakes region.

AB  - Broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum) is a key domesticated cereal that has been associated with the north China centre of agricultural origins. Early archaeobotanical evidence for this crop has generated two major debates. First, its contested presence in pre-7000 cal. BP sites in eastern Europe has admitted the possibility of a western origin. Second, its occurrence in the 7th and 8th millennia cal. BP in diverse regions of northern China is consistent with several possible origin foci, associated with different Neolithic cultures. We used microsatellite and granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) genotype data from 341 landrace samples across Eurasia, including 195 newly genotyped samples from China, to address these questions. A spatially explicit discriminative modelling approach favours an eastern Eurasian origin for the expansion of broomcorn millet. This is consistent with recent archaeobotanical and chronological re-evaluations, and stable isotopic data. The same approach, together with the distribution of GBSSI alleles, is also suggestive that the origin of broomcorn millet expansion was in western China. This second unexpected finding stimulates new questions regarding the ecology of wild millet and vegetation dynamics in China prior to the mid-Holocene domestication of millet. The chronological relationship between population expansion and domestication is unclear, but our analyses are consistent with the western Loess Plateau being at least one region of primary domestication of broomcorn millet. Patterns of genetic variation indicate that this region was the source of populations to the west in Eurasia, which broomcorn probably reached via the Inner Asia Mountain Corridor from the 3rd millennium BC. A secondary westward expansion along the steppe may have taken place from the 2nd millennium BC.

AB  - The Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) comprising the coasts of Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and Ecuador, represents an area of high marine biodiversity that supports productive fisheries and acts as an important migratory corridor for many marine species. Despite its biological importance, the ETP is understudied and lacks sufficient data for science-based fisheries management and conservation decision-making. This study aims to consolidate understanding of the current and historical distribution of sharks and mobulid rays in the ETP. We used interviews of coastal community stakeholders to document local fishers' knowledge of shark and mobulid ray species and distributions. We also analysed small-scale fisheries landings data, where available, to quantify local exploitation patterns and the importance of sharks and rays in small-scale fisheries catches. All shark species landed in the dominant nearshore gillnet fishery show very low mean individuals weights (<5 kg), indicating that catches are dominated by juveniles. Aside from smooth-hounds (Mustelus spp.), the scalloped hammerhead shark, Sphyrna lewini, is the most frequently landed shark species in the region by weight and number, with peaks in abundance between April-July. From 132 interviews in 51 communities across the three countries, and landings data from two small-scale fisheries sites, we identified 41 sites in 12 broad geographical zones as important shark nursery habitats. Of these sites, 68% were associated closely with large mangrove systems of the ETP, highlighting the importance of this habitat for shark life history. No patterns were seen in the occurrence or distribution of mobulid rays in coastal areas. Marine protected areas and responsible fishing zones covered 37% of identified nursery habitats in the ETP, 30% in Costa Rica, 48% in Panama and 30% in Colombia. These findings provide an important benchmark for shark conservation in the ETP and allow for the prioritisation of research and management.

AB  - In our project on the autonomous guidance of Micro-Air Vehicles (MAVs) in confined indoor and outdoor environments, we have developed a bio-inspired optic flow based autopilot with which the speed of a miniature hovercraft is controlled and the walls of a straight or tapered corridor are safely avoided. A hovercraft is an air vehicle endowed with natural roll and pitch stabilization characteristics, in which planar flight control can be developed conveniently. Our own hovercraft is fully actuated by two rear and two lateral thrusters. It travels at a constant ground height (similar to 2mm) and senses the environment by means of two lateral eyes that measure the right and left optic flows (OFs). The complete visuo-motor control system, which is called LORA(2) (Lateral Optic flow Regulation Autopflot), consists of a system of two lateral OF regulators with a single OF set-point:
   (i) the first lateral OF regulator adjusts the hovercraft's forward thrust (which determines the forward airspeed V-x) so as to maintain the mean value of the two (right and left) OFs measured equal to a set-point.
   (ii) the second lateral OF regulator controls the hovercraft's side-slip thrust (which determines the side-slip airspeed V-y) so as to maintain the OF measured equal to the same set-point as in (i). Interestingly, this makes the distance to the left (D-L) or right (D-R) wall proportional to the forward airspeed V-x. determined in (i): the faster the hovercraft is travelling, the further away from the walls it will be.
   Simulations have shown that the hovercraft manages to navigate in a straight or tapered corridor at speeds of up to 1m/s although it has only a minimalistic visual system (it is equipped with only two pixels in each eye). The passive visual sensors and the simple control system used here are suitable for use on MAVs with an avionic payload of only a few grams.
   A major outcome of this work is that the LORA(2) autopilot makes the hovercraft navigate without any need for range sensors or speed sensors.

AB  - Ocelot Leopardus pardons is one of the most widespread species in America. Nevertheless, its ecology, distribution and population status are not well known in several countries, including Costa Rica. Here we present the first published population density estimations in Costa Rica and the first effort for the Caribbean slope of the country. Using camera-trapping, we estimated ocelot density through capture-recapture analysis within the Talamanca-Caribbean Biological Corridor. An abundance of 8 and 5 individuals were estimated by Mo and Mh models, respectively. Based on previous home-range studies, three Effective Sampling Areas (ESA) were used to estimate absolute density. Density was calculated in 8.95, 10.33 and 11.61 individuals (Mo model) and 5.59, 6.45 and 7.25 (Mh model) individuals x 100 km(-2) for the maximum, mean and minimum ESA estimates, respectively. Gross extrapolations of the expected population size indicate a low abundance and co-dependence between the corridor and surrounding areas for the long term maintenance of the species in the region.

AB  - How guidance cues are integrated during the formation of complex axonal tracts remains largely unknown. Thalamocortical axons (TCAs), which convey sensory and motor information to the neocortex, have a rostrocaudal topographic organization initially established within the ventral telencephalon [1-3]. Here, we show that this topography is set in a small hub, the corridor, which contains matching rostrocaudal gradients of Slit1 and Netrin 1. Using in vitro and in vivo experiments, we show that Slit1 is a rostral repellent that positions intermediate axons. For rostral axons, although Slit1 is also repulsive and Netrin 1 has no chemotactic activity, the two factors combined generate attraction. These results show that Slit1 has a dual context-dependent role in TCA pathfinding and furthermore reveal that a combination of cues produces an emergent activity that neither of them has alone. Our study thus provides a novel framework to explain how a limited set of guidance cues can generate a vast diversity of axonal responses necessary for proper wiring of the nervous system.

AB  - We investigated whether woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) would remain in a 2772 km(2) area in eastern Quebec where the forest management plan included the preservation of large forest blocks (35-182 km(2)) linked with >400 m wide corridors and where cuts were amalgamated in large zones. To evaluate changes in caribou abundance and habitat selection, we conducted five aerial surveys and followed by telemetry 13 to 22 female caribou each year, from March 1998 to March 2005. Caribou numbers declined by 59% between 1999 and 2001 but gradually recovered to initial abundance. Female survival increased from 73.3% in 1999 to 87.3%-93.4% in 2004 and 2005. Caribou selected protected blocks, used corridors in proportion to their availability, and avoided logged areas. They preferred closed conifer stands without terrestrial lichens and open conifer stands with or without terrestrial lichens throughout the study. Open habitats (clearcuts and burns), regenerating sites, mixed and deciduous stands, and water bodies were avoided. The main zones used by caribou gradually shifted towards the southwest of the study area, likely as a result of disturbance and habitat loss due to logging of mature conifers in the east. We conclude that caribou numbers were maintained within the managed area as a result of the presence of protected blocks and uncut continuous forest.

AB  - Cape Hatteras is a major topographic feature on the continental shelf of the U.S. eastern seaboard that changes the dynamics of nearshore large ocean currents, including the Labrador Current and Gulf Stream. Cape Hatteras constricts shelf habitat and restricts the migratory corridors of highly migratory species through this area. Our objective was to describe the seasonal patterns of presence for three species-the Spiny Dogfish Squalus acanthias, Atlantic Sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus, and Sandbar Shark Carcharhinus plumbeus-and analyze environmental conditions associated with fish presence near this feature. These species are managed under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, and two of them are also listed as species of concern under the Endangered Species Act. Transmitter detections from tagged fish recorded by the Cape Hatteras acoustic array, which was deployed just south of the cape, indicated that these species are present year-round. The greatest number of detections occurred from November through April. This simple baseline of seasonal presence can provide insights for regional offshore development activities, which have the potential to affect movement patterns of migratory species through the Cape Hatteras constriction. Our results show the value of strategically placed acoustic arrays for observing fish habitat use and provide presence/absence data to enhance our understanding of species ecology and distribution.

AB  - In our project on the autonomous guidance of Micro-Air Vehicles (MAVs) in confined indoor and outdoor environments, we have developed a vision based autopilot, with which a miniature hovercraft travels along a corridor by automatically controlling both its speed and its clearance from the walls. A hovercraft is an air vehicle endowed with natural roll and pitch stabilization characteristics, in which planar flight control systems can be developed conveniently. Our hovercraft is fully actuated by two rear and two lateral thrusters. It travels at a constant altitude (similar to 2 mm) and senses the environment by means of two lateral eyes that measure the right and left optic flows (OFs). The visuo-motor control system, which is called LORA III (Lateral Optic flow Regulation Autopilot, Mark III), is a dual OF regulator consisting of two intertwined feedback loops, each of which has its own OF set-point and controls the vehicle's translation in one degree of freedom (surge or sway). Our computer-simulated experiments show that the hovercraft can navigate along a straight or tapered corridor at a relatively high speed (up to 1 m/s). It also reacts to any major step perturbations in the lateral OF (provided by a moving wall) and to any disturbances caused by a tapered corridor. The minimalistic visual system (comprised of only 4 pixels) suffices for the hovercraft to be able to control both its clearance from the walls and its forward speed jointly, without ever measuring speed and distance. The non-emissive visual sensors and the simple control system developed here are suitable for use on MAVs with a permissible avionic payload of only a few grams. This study also accounts quantitatively for previous ethological findings on honeybees flying freely in a straight or tapered corridor.

AB  - This paper provides the first geological and paleontological data of Yosobe and La Lobera, two Late Jurassic vertebrate localities; both localities are part of the marine deposits of the Tlaxiaco Basin, near Tlaxiaco, Oaxaca, Mexico. La Lobera may be included in Cerro de Titania, a historical invertebrate locality inaccurately described, whose Oxfordian-Early Kimmeridgian limestone and marl strata are informally known as "Caliza con Cidaris." La Lobera contains the typical "Caliza con Cidaris" fossils and the remains of a single fish attributable to the genus Scheenstia. Yosobe is a fossiliferous outcrop belonging in the Late Jurassic (Kimmeridgian-Tithonian) bituminous shale strata informally known as Sabinal formation. The fossil assemblage from Yosobe includes microfossils, plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates, many of which are totally or partially tridimensionally preserved within nodules. Yosobe is the most important vertebrate locality along the entire Tlaxiaco Basin due to a highly abundant and diverse grouping of fishes and reptiles. The fossil assemblage from Yosobe reported in this paper includes the first and most inclusive regional record of taxa such as the first North American Pleuropholidae fish, the first Mexican Jurassic Planohybodus shark, the most complete specimens of the pycnodont Gyrodus in Mexico and the Caribbean, ichthyosaurs, thalattosuchian crocodyliforms, turtles, and pliosaurids in a single locality at the Western Tethys Sea Domain and the Hispanic Corridor. Present and future descriptive and systematic studies on some fossils from these localities may have important paleobiogeographic and phylogenetic implications worldwide.

AB  - Tropical forests store large amounts of carbon in tree biomass, although the environmental controls on forest carbon stocks remain poorly resolved. Emerging airborne remote sensing techniques offer a powerful approach to understand how aboveground carbon density (ACD) varies across tropical landscapes. In this study, we evaluate the accuracy of the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system to detect top-of-canopy tree height (TCH) and ACD across the Osa Peninsula, Costa Rica. LiDAR and field-estimated TCH and ACD were highly correlated across a wide range of forest ages and types. Top-of-canopy height (TCH) reached 67 m, and ACD surpassed 225 Mg C ha(-1), indicating both that airborne CAO LiDAR-based estimates of ACD are accurate in tall, high-biomass forests and that the Osa Peninsula harbors some of the most carbon-rich forests in the Neotropics. We also examined the relative influence of lithologic, topoedaphic and climatic factors on regional patterns in ACD, which are known to influence ACD by regulating forest productivity and turnover. Analyses revealed a spatially nested set of factors controlling ACD patterns, with geologic variation explaining up to 16% of the mapped ACD variation at the regional scale, while local variation in topographic slope explained an additional 18%. Lithologic and topoedaphic factors also explained more ACD variation at 30-m than at 100-m spatial resolution, suggesting that environmental filtering depends on the spatial scale of terrain variation. Our result indicate that patterns in ACD are partially controlled by spatial variation in geologic history and geomorphic processes underpinning topographic diversity across landscapes. ACD also exhibited spatial autocorrelation, which may reflect biological processes that influence ACD, such as the assembly of species or phenotypes across the landscape, but additional research is needed to resolve how abiotic and biotic factors contribute to ACD variation across high biomass, high diversity tropical landscapes.

AB  - 1. Targeted enrichment of conserved genomic regions (e.g. ultraconserved elements or UCEs) has emerged as a promising tool for inferring evolutionary history in many organismal groups. Because the UCE approach is still relatively new, much remains to be learned about how best to identify UCE loci and design baits to enrich them.
   2. We test an updated UCE identification and bait design workflow for the insect order Hymenoptera, with a particular focus on ants. The new strategy augments a previous bait design for Hymenoptera by (i) changing the parameters by which conserved genomic regions are identified and retained, and (ii) increasing the number of genomes used for locus identification and bait design. We perform in vitro validation of the approach in ants by synthesizing an ant-specific bait set that targets UCE loci and a set of 'legacy' phylogenetic markers. Using this bait set, we generate new data for 84 taxa (16/17 ant subfamilies) and extract loci from an additional 17 genome-enabled taxa. We then use these data to examine UCE capture success and phylogenetic performance across ants. We also test the workability of extracting legacy markers from enriched samples and combining the data with published datasets.
   3. The updated bait design (hym-v2) contained a total of 2590-targeted UCE loci for Hymenoptera, significantly increasing the number of loci relative to the original bait set (hym-v1; 1510 loci). Across 38 genome-enabled Hymenoptera and 84 enriched samples, experiments demonstrated a high and unbiased capture success rate, with the mean locus enrichment rate being 2214 loci per sample. Phylogenomic analyses of ants produced a robust tree that included strong support for previously uncertain relationships. Complementing the UCE results, we successfully enriched legacy markers, combined the data with published Sanger datasets and generated a comprehensive ant phylogeny containing 1060 terminals.
   4. Overall, the new UCE bait design strategy resulted in an enhanced bait set for genome-scale phylogenetics in ants and other Hymenoptera. Our in vitro tests demonstrate the utility of the updated design workflow, providing evidence that this approach could be applied to any organismal group with available genomic information.

AB  - Landscapes can influence the distribution of harvesting by influencing animal distribution and hunter access. For species like caribou, Rangifer tarandus, decades-long shifts in abundance and distribution might alter such relationships, but few studies have been conducted at such scales. We examined relationships between landscape features and 21,380 harvest records of migratory caribou in Newfoundland during caribou population growth (1980s), cessation of growth (1990s), and decline (2000s). We focused on features hypothesized to influence the distributions of caribou and hunters: lichen landcover, roads, cutblocks, outfitter camps, power lines, and towns. We uncovered larger harvests by resident hunters of male and female caribou among lichen landcover, likely providing preferred caribou forage, and larger harvests by non-resident hunters of male caribou away from towns, reflecting the locations of outfitter camps. Only during later decades, resident harvests occurred nearer power lines and cutblocks, likely providing hunter access and reflecting risk-prone foraging by caribou. We surmise that the harvest was facilitated by open habitats, preferred by caribou, and anthropogenic features leading to hunter access, especially as the caribou population declined. Such knowledge at broad scales is increasingly important in an era of widespread disruption to landscapes.

AB  - A multi-wavelength lidar system was used to detect free-flying birds passing over Athens, Greece. The location is strategically located in one of the important migratory corridors for birds migrating between Europe and Africa. Multi wavelength aerosol lidars are operated regularly across Europe in the frame of EARLINET. Here, the feasibility of using this existing infrastructure for assessing fluxes of migratory birds is explored. The backscattered lidar signals were detected at three elastic bands and one Raman band. The monitoring was extended over a period of three months covering predominantly the summer and early autumn period during which approximately 100 hours of lidar data was gathered.

AB  - Present woodfuel usage in Britain is negligible. Historically, Britain has been fortunate in having abundant coal, oil and gas.
   At an EU level, biomass is seen as an important element of energy, environment and agriculture/forestry policy. In the European context, biomass is taken to include agricultural and industrial wastes in addition to forest woodfuel, and it is regarded as a potential source of heat, fuels and electricity. In the UK, energy policy as a whole is based on four considerations-environment, energy reliability and security, affordability for the poorest in society and competitive pricing for businesses, industries and households. Within UK policy, the dominant driver for greater use of biomass as a renewable source of energy is climate change mitigation; energy security is an emerging driver; all other potential benefits of biomass as a renewable resource are of limited significance. At the moment, the UK focus is narrower than in Europe. National targets are set only for electricity generation. Furthermore, expansion of energy crops, which are defined in the major regulations as 'crops planted since 1989 and grown primarily for the purpose of being used as a fuel' and, therefore, do not include material from extant forests, is seen as the main way to ensure energy security and minimise carbon expended to transport the raw material to the point of end use. Nevertheless, woody biomass from forests, sawmills, urban areas and transportation corridors is already available in vastly greater quantities than 'energy crops'.
   At a regional and local scale, global environmental issues are of lower relative importance and a much wider range of potential benefits tend to be taken into consideration. For example, the economic benefits of woodfuel heating in areas without connections to the gas grid have been an important consideration in the steady increase in woodheat developments. In other areas where there is a less obvious financial driver, rural development is a powerful determinant of support for woodfuel projects. Crown Copyright (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - It is becoming increasingly evident that many species can tolerate different degrees of habitat perturbation and that we often underestimate the capacity of some human-modified landscapes to support populations of declining species. We provide new insights into the distribution of the endangered Central American squirrel monkey and habitat changed over the last 20 years. The species has shown an approximate 60% decrease between the historic and the present extent of occurrence, with an area of occupancy of also about 60% of the present extent of occurrence. Despite the large habitat alteration, our results show surprisingly that this endangered monkey can persist in highly perturbed landscapes. This offers opportunities to improve its long-term chances of survival through conservation actions to protect and restore its habitat on the one hand, and to reduce the monkey's direct mortality on the other. Surprisingly we found several troops in 16 localities in a large area along the Rio Coto Brus where the Central American squirrel monkey was previously unrecorded. Some of our observations were made in cloud forests at a record high altitude for this species. We speculate the monkeys are using these highland areas as a corridor between suitable lowland habitats in the Coto Brus and the Rio Slerpe-Osa Peninsula regions. In response, we suggest strategies to help in the monkey's long-term conservation, that can be used as an example for other endangered species.

AB  - Aim
   Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, Walbaum 1792) is an exotic salmonid invading eastern Canada. First introduced for recreational fishing in Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime provinces, the species is now spreading in salmon rivers located in Eastern Quebec, where its stocking is strictly forbidden. Newly established populations have been found along the St Lawrence Estuary. To effectively mitigate the potential threat the invasion poses to native salmonids, we aimed to document the invasion's origin and progress in the St Lawrence River and estuary. We first determined genetic origins among several potential wild and cultured source populations, found at the upstream and downstream extremities of the St Lawrence system. Thereafter, we studied the range expansion, predicting that the invasion process conforms to a one-dimensional stepping-stone dispersion model.
   Location
   Recently invaded salmon rivers that flow into the Estuary and Gulf of St Lawrence in Quebec, and watercourses supporting naturalized populations (Lake Ontario, Lake Memphremagog and Prince-Edward-Island rivers).
   Methods
   Rainbow trout from 10 potential source populations (wild and domestic strains) and 243 specimens captured in salmon rivers were genotyped at 10 microsatellite loci. Genetic origins of specimens and relationship between colonies were assessed using assignment analyses based on individuals and clusters.
   Results
   Invasion of rainbow trout in Eastern Quebec is directed downstream, driven by migrants from upstream naturalized populations, found in the Ganaraska River (Lake Ontario), and, to a lesser extent, in Lake Memphremagog. Populations from the Maritime provinces and domestic strains do not contribute to the colonisation process. A recently established population in Charlevoix (Eastern Quebec) supplies other downstream colonies.
   Main conclusions
   Rainbow trout is spreading from Lake Ontario downstream to Eastern Quebec using the St Lawrence River system as an invasion corridor. Range expansion in a downstream direction is driven by a more complex stepping-stone dispersion model than predicted. Management options to protect native salmonids include reducing the effective size of the Charlevoix population, impeding reproduction in recently colonized rivers, halting the upstream migration of anadromous spawners, and curtailing stocking events inside the stocking area.

AB  - The Yukon River is the fourth largest river in North America, yet the ecology of its fishes has not been well described. During the spring and summer of 2002-04, we sampled the downstream migrations of fishes in the Yukon River mainstem near the Canada-U.S. border, using a rotary auger trap. Age-0 juvenile chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, were the most common fish in the catch, and they peaked in abundance in mid-June. Smaller numbers of age-1 chinook salmon and age-0 chum salmon, O. keta, were caught earlier in the season. Over 80% of the remaining catch consisted of young-of-the-year Coregoninae (whitefish), presumably moving from natal areas to summer rearing habitats. Few adult whitefish were captured, probably because our sampling terminated before fall spawning migrations began. Both juveniles and adults were captured for six other winter or spring spawning species that we encountered. Our results indicate that the Yukon River mainstem is used extensively as a migration corridor. This reach of the mainstem has very high suspended sediment levels in summer; its significance as rearing habitat remains unknown. Further studies are required to delineate the extent of migrations and the population structure for the non-anadromous species.

AB  - Specialized pastoralism developed similar to 3 kya among Pastoral Neolithic Elmenteitan herders in eastern Africa. During this time, a mosaic of hunters and herders using diverse economic strategies flourished in southern Kenya. It has been argued that the risk for trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), carried by tsetse flies in bushy environments, had a significant influence on pastoral diversification and migration out of eastern Africa toward southern Africa similar to 2 kya. Elmenteitan levels at Gogo Falls (ca. 1.9-1.6 kya) preserve a unique faunal record, including wild mammalian herbivores, domestic cattle and caprines, fish, and birds. It has been suggested that a bushy/woodland habitat that harbored tsetse fly constrained production of domestic herds and resulted in subsistence diversification. Stable isotope analysis of herbivore tooth enamel (n = 86) from this site reveals, instead, extensive C-4 grazing by both domesticates and the majority of wild herbivores. Integrated with other ecological proxies (pollen and leaf wax biomarkers), these data imply an abundance of C-4 grasses in the Lake Victoria basin at this time, and thus little risk for tsetse-related barriers to specialized pastoralism. These data provide empirical evidence for the existence of a grassy corridor through which small groups of herders could have passed to reach southern Africa.

AB  - We investigated patterns of moth occurrence among habitats in two different landscapes surrounding roosts of the endangered Ozark big-eared bat (Corynorhinus townsendii ingens) from May to August 2005, and compared these data with published results on the diet of this subspecies. Landscapes were situated in the Ozark Mountains, USA, and consisted of a fragmented, agricultural landscape and a contiguous national forest. We captured 8720 moths constituting >= 314 species and 22 families. Pastures demonstrated a lower abundance and richness of moths than other habitats in the fragmented landscape (p < 0.05). Neither abundance nor richness of moths varied by habitat in the forested landscape, but we did observe variation among roost locations (p < 0.05). Abundant families of moths (n >= 100 specimens captured) did vary in abundance among habitats in both landscapes (p < 0.05), with poletimber stands, riparian forest and upland forest selected, and pasture, forest edge, sawtimber and sapling stands avoided by at least one family of moths. Density and richness of woody plant species were correlated with the occurrence of moths at sampling sites. We recommend maintaining habitat heterogeneity around roosts of the Ozark big-eared bat to encourage an abundance and richness of moth prey, and suggest that forested riparian corridors are important habitat elements for Ozark big-eared bats foraging in fragmented landscapes.

TI  - Spatial Ecology of Armenian Vipers, Montivipera raddei, in a Human-Modified Landscape
T2  - COPEIA
LA  - English
AB  - Armenian vipers (Montivipera raddei) have a restricted and fragmented distribution throughout portions of Armenia, eastern Turkey, and northwestern Iran. Over the past 40 years their population numbers have dropped by nearly 88% due to a combination of over-collection for the pet trade, conversion of habitat to agriculture, and overgrazing by livestock. While a few studies have examined aspects of their reproductive biology, we know very little about the spatial ecology of this species. We used radiotelemetry to study the spatial ecology and habitat use of Armenian vipers inhabiting a landscape modified by human use in Kotayk Province, Armenia during the spring 2007-2009 (17 males, 11 females) and for complete active seasons 2008-2009 (8 males, 6 females). We found no significant difference between sexes for home range size, average movements, or movement rates through areas involving cropland versus strictly steppe. Home ranges were significantly larger for males whose spring core area included some cropland. Both sexes showed significant preference for mountain steppe over cropland. Despite these differences, the interspersing of cropland among steppe habitat does not appear to impede the snakes' movements and seasonal use of the available habitat. While conservation of intact mountain steppe habitat is the ultimate goal, providing corridors of habitat in areas of agricultural development should be considered a high priority for managing this viper population into the future.

AB  - In Fennoscandia, large areas that have not been subjected to pre-commercial thinning (PUT), and thus support dense stands, are becoming suitable for harvesting biomass. However, efficient systems for harvesting biomass from young stands have not yet been developed. In order to optimise biomass harvesting it is here hypothesized that the handling unit should not be a single tree but a corridor area, i.e., all trees in a specific area should be harvested in the same crane movement cycle. Three types of corridor harvesting approaches (using accumulating felling heads for geometric harvesting in two different patterns) were compared in terms of time required to fell a corridor of standardised size. Corridors are defined as strips of harvested areas between conventional strip-roads. Harvests were simulated in two types of stands, first thinning (FT) and delayed PCT stands, in which the spatial positions of the trees had been mapped. The differences in simulated time consumption per corridor were minor when the only variable changed was the corridor pattern. However, there were ca. 2-fold and 3-fold differences in simulated time consumption per corridor between the harvesting approaches for the FT stand and the PCT-stand, respectively. Furthermore, area handling (felling head accumulating all trees corridor-wise, with no restrictions on the accumulated number of trees except for a certain load limit) was found to give up to 2.4-told increases in productivity compared to a single-tree (reference) approach for the FT stand.
   In conclusion, the simulation results clearly show the benefits of applying area-harvesting systems in young, dense stands.

AB  - Incidental capture in fishing gear is the most serious threat to the survival of many species of marine mammals. Fisheries closures developed to protect marine mammals have tended to concentrate on areas of high marine mammal density. Movement corridors have generally been less protected because they are often unknown and difficult to detect. Seagrass meadows in Moreton and Hervey Bays in south-eastern Queensland support significant populations of dugongs Dugong dugon. Pedigree analysis based on genetic and ancillary biological data indicates that there is substantial movement of dugongs between these bays, which are separated by open surf coasts where dugongs are occasionally caught in inshore shark nets set for the protection of bathers. This bycatch suggests that the dugong movement corridor between Moreton and Hervey Bays is close to the coast, a hypothesis not confirmed by nearly 30 yr of dugong satellite tracking using platform transmitter terminal (PTT) technology. Twenty-nine dugongs were captured in seagrass habitats on the eastern banks of Moreton Bay in 2012-2014 and were fitted with Quick Fix GPS and acoustic transmitters. One animal was captured and tracked twice. Four dugongs were tracked moving from Moreton Bay to Hervey Bay covering distances of 278-338 km over 5-9 d; 1 dugong made the return journey. Three of the 4 animals travelled along and very close to the coast; the exact track of the fourth animal is uncertain. These results suggest that dugongs would benefit from netting closures that extend beyond seagrass meadows.

AB  - The use of bio-indicators is an emerging, cost-effective alternative approach to identifying air pollution and assessing the need for additional air monitoring. This community science project explores the use of moss samples as bio-indicators of the distribution of metal air particulates in two residential neighborhoods of the industrial Duwamish Val-ley located in Seattle, WA (USA). We applied geographically weighted regression to data from 61 youth-collected sam-ples to assess the location-specific area-level spatial predictors of the concentrations of 25 elements with focus on five heavy metals of concern due to health and environmental considerations. Spatial predictors included traffic volume, industrial land uses, major roadways, the airport, dirt roads, the Duwamish River, impervious surfaces, tree canopy cover, and sociodemographics. Traffic volume surrounding sample locations was the most consistent positive predictor of increasing heavy metal concentration. Greater distance from the heavy-industry corridor surrounding the Duwamish River predicted lower concentrations of all metals, with statistically significant associations for chromium and lead in some areas. As the distance from dirt roads increased, the concentration of arsenic and chromium de-creased significantly. Percent tree canopy within 200 m of sample locations was a significant protective factor for cad-mium concentrations. In addition, percent people of color was significantly positively associated with increasing lead, chromium and nickel concentrations. Our findings underscore the potential influence of heavy industry and mobile sources on heavy metal concentrations, the buffering potential of trees in local environments, and persistent opportu-nity to improve environmental justice.

AB  - Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) from a breeding ground off Gabon (0-4 degrees S) and a migratory corridor/feeding ground on the west coast of South Africa (WSA; 33 degrees S) differ genetically and in catch histories. Interpretation of the population structure is hampered by the lack of data from the intervening 3,500 km of coastline or to the north of Gabon. Here we collate all relevant nongenetic data on humpback whales from Namibia (similar to 23 degrees S) from 2005 to 2012 and compare these with corresponding data from Gabon (2000-2006) and WSA (1983-2008). Data from Namibia include photographic catalogs of dorsal fin and tail fluke images, seasonal presence, and a photographic assessment of scarring and wounds from cookiecutter sharks (Isistius sp.). No confirmed photographic identification matches could be made between Namibia and Gabon and only 2 potential matches were made between Namibia and WSA from dorsal fins. Humpback whales in Namibia show a bimodal seasonality in occurrence, with a primary peak in austral winter (July) and a secondary peak in spring (September), but generally low directionality of movement. Whales were never recorded to sing, competitive groups were rarely sighted, and very few calves were observed, making it unlikely that this is a breeding area. The prevalence of killer whale bite scars on flukes was similar at all sites. Fresh bites from cookiecutter sharks were highest in Namibia, intermediate in Gabon, but almost nonexistent in WSA. We propose that animals seen in Namibia in winter are on their northward migration and have intercepted the coast from farther offshore (where cookiecutter sharks occur), whereas animals seen in WSA in spring summer, where they are feeding during their southward migration, have followed a slow coastwise route within the cold Benguela Ecosystem, thus allowing time for cookiecutter bites to heal.

AB  - Understanding how large felids use space is essential for the design of conservation plans that are required for their survival. Jaguars (Panthera onca) and pumas (Puma concolor) are the largest felids in the Neotropics, and they are sympatric throughout the entire range of the jaguar. However, there is very little information about the spatial requirements of these two species in the tropical rainforests of Central America. Using satellite GPS collars, we compared the spatial ecology of jaguars and pumas in a tropical rainforest in southern Mexico. We found that jaguars had home ranges that were 2-6 times larger than those of pumas. The mean annual home range was 181.4 +/- 4.0 km(2) for female jaguars and 431.6 +/- 152.6 km(2) for males. Annual home range for the only female puma tracked was 34.3 km(2), and 72.0 +/- 85.2 km(2) for males. Jaguars and pumas with overlapping home ranges showed little overlap of core areas and avoided using the same sites at the same time, which suggested that territoriality and avoidance were in play. Further evidence of avoidance was derived from our observation that pumas exhibited greater movement during the lightest periods of the day and jaguars moved most during the darkest. This temporal separation probably facilitates coexistence. Our data suggest that habitat destruction and fragmentation has more severe effects on jaguars than on pumas. According to our estimates, patches of at least 180 km(2) of primary forest are required to meet the annual spatial requirements of female jaguars. Thus, to conserve jaguars in this region, large tracts of primary forest should be preserved. Importantly, this population of jaguars depends on the adequate preservation of connectivity between natural reserves in Mexico and Guatemala. (C) 2017 Deutsche Gesellschaft far Saugetierkunde.

AB  - Harnessing the economic potential of the oceans is key to combating poverty, enhancing food security, and strengthening economies. But the concomitant risk of intensified resource extraction to migratory species is worrying given these species contribute to important ecological processes, often underpin alternative livelihoods, and are mostly already threatened. We thus sought to quantify the potential conflict between key economic activities (5 fisheries and hydrocarbon exploitation) and sea turtle migration corridors in a region with rapid economic development: southern and eastern Africa. We satellite tracked the movement of 20 loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and 14 leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) turtles during their postnesting migrations. We used movement-based kernel density estimation to identify migration corridors for each species. We overlaid these corridors on maps of the distribution and intensity of economic activities, quantified the extent of overlap and threat posed by each activity on each species, and compared the effects of activities. These results were compared with annual bycatch rates in the respective fisheries. Both species' 3 corridors overlapped most with longline fishing, but the effect was worse for leatherbacks: their bycatch rates of approximately 1500/year were substantial relative to the regional population size of < 100 nesting females/annum. This bycatch rate is likely slowing population growth. Artisanal fisheries may be of greater concern for loggerheads than for leatherbacks, but the population appears to be withstanding the high bycatch rates because it is increasing exponentially. The hydrocarbon industry currently has a moderately low impact on both species, but mining in key areas (e.g., Southern Mozambique) may undermine > 50 years of conservation, potentially affecting > 80% of loggerheads, 33% of the (critically endangered) leatherbacks, and their nesting beaches. We support establishing blue economies (i.e., generating wealth from the ocean), but oceans need to be carefully zoned and responsibly managed in both space and time to achieve economic (resource extraction), ecological (conservation, maintenance of processes), and social (maintenance of alternative livelihood opportunities, alleviate poverty) objectives.

KW  - DESIGN
AB  - A Methodology for designing a layout for factories, office buildings or homes is presented based on a new metric SPAAC (shortest path along aisles and corridors). The metric represents the correct movement of a fork truck or an AGV along aisles from door to door. Floyd's algorithm is used to compute the metric. Optimization is based on fundamental work by Drezner (1987) implemented by Tretheway (1992). Linear programming and genetic algorithms are used to optimize door placement based on the overall metric for the layout. Department size is explicitly included in the cost model. An expert system rule for plant layout is suggested based on test rules.

AB  - What is currently known about Mexico paleontology and specifically the proboscideans has centered in the central and southern states, with much of the north largely unknown. Here we report on Cuvieronius (Gomphotheriidae) and Mammuthus (Elephantidae) recovered from Terapa, a Late Pleistocene site in east-central Sonora. The local fauna reflects a badlands environment along the Rio Moctezuma, 183 km (114 mi) south of the Arizona border. The recovery of Bison places the locality within the Rancholabrean Land Mammal Age. Chronological analyses confirm that impounding basalt and fossiliferous sediments were deposited 43,000 to 40,000 years ago (MIS 3). Cuvieronius and Mammuthus are found throughout the stratigraphic profile. A review of Late Pleistocene collections indicates that Mammuthus, Cuvieronius, and one location of Mammut are known from Sonora. The Late Pleistocene along the Terapa river valley is reconstructed as cooler, with a more equable, less seasonal environment than today. The corridor was wetter, more tropical and included a riparian forest, ponding water, marsh, and savanna grassland. The area west of Terapa in western Sonora had a cooler summer climate, more winter rains and less summer rains. Woodlands and shrub communities occupied the upper bajadas and rocky hills, areas possibly where Mammut ranged more commonly. Valleys contained more grasslands than they do today. The environments and climates of valleys permitted Cynomys, Mammuthus, and Cuvieronius to exist over most of western Sonora where they are extinct today. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We reconstructed the geological evolution and the history of the fluvial network in the central part of the Po Plain in Lombardy, northern Italy, since the Middle Wurm. We focused on evidences of dissection and incision of former rivers into the large outwash fans originating from piedmont glaciers of the southern Alps in the Last Glacial Maximum. The studied area is located between the Po River and the Alps north of the Adda/Serio river confluence, around the town of Crema. Morphometric analysis and stratigraphic investigation were carried out, supported by palaeobotany, sand petrography and radiometric dating. The obtained stratigraphic framework is presented by cross sections and by a geological map. During the Middle Wurm, an alluvial fan of the Adda River oriented NWN-SSE occupied the area, feeding south and west the Romanengo hill. A substantial reorganisation of the fluvial network occurred during the Last Glacial Maximum. Since 32-30 ka cal. BP, the area was fed by two outwash rivers, originated from the Adda and the Oglio piedmont glaciers, both characterised by a prevalent southward drainage, 160 degrees-170 degrees S in the LGM. After the LGM the fan-head was dissected by trunk channels and, at the downslope fan limit, the southward flow shifted to a southeastern direction. Thereafter, major dissection and downcutting occurred in the Lateglacial, confining the major rivers into large alluvial corridors, further shaped by lateral erosion during the Holocene. The Late Holocene history of the Serio River is marked by fluvial floods during the late Roman Age, and by a capture of the lower reach by the Adda River. The geomorphological evidence supports the historically inferred age assignment of the diversion to 12th-14th c. AD.

AB  - Robots are becoming increasingly relevant to neurosurgeons, extending a neurosurgeon's physical capabilities, improving navigation within the surgical landscape when combined with advanced imaging, and propelling the movement toward minimally invasive surgery. Most surgical robots, however, isolate surgeons from the full range of human senses during a procedure. This forces surgeons to rely on vision alone for guidance through the surgical corridor, which limits the capabilities of the system, requires significant operator training, and increases the surgeon's workload. Incorporating haptics into these systems, ie, enabling the surgeon to "feel" forces experienced by the tool tip of the robot, could render these limitations obsolete by making the robot feel more like an extension of the surgeon's own body. Although the use of haptics in neurosurgical robots is still mostly the domain of research, neurosurgeons who keep abreast of this emerging field will be more prepared to take advantage of it as it becomes more prevalent in operating theaters. Thus, this article serves as an introduction to the field of haptics for neurosurgeons. We not only outline the current and future benefits of haptics but also introduce concepts in the fields of robotic technology and computer control. This knowledge will allow readers to be better aware of limitations in the technology that can affect performance and surgical outcomes, and "knowing the right questions to ask" will be invaluable for surgeons who have purchasing power within their departments.

AB  - The excavation of Manot Cave (Israel) reveals intensive occupation during the Early Upper Paleolithic and provides the first continuous set of anthracological data available for the Ahmarian, Levantine Aurignacian and post-Levantine Aurignacian periods. The paper aims to study the vegetal landscape around Manot Cave in the context of climate changes that characterized the last part of the Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3) and to address the issue of firewood and food procurement among Paleolithic hunter-gatherers. Charcoal samples recovered from the archaeological layers at Manot Cave shed light on the fuel and food procurement strategies while radiocarbon dating and stable carbon isotope analysis (Delta C-13) of selected charcoals provide information about the ancient climate. The results show that five woody taxa were exploited at the site; Amygdalus sp. was the most common species, whereas Quercus ithaburensis, Tamarix sp., Pomoideae indet., and Pistacia atlantica were relatively rare. The representations of the recovered wooden species suggest that an open forest of almonds and oaks existed in the area during MIS 3. Radiocarbon dating of Amygdalus sp. charcoals, coupled with stable carbon isotope analysis (Delta C-13) of modern and archaeological Amygdalus sp. clearly indicate variations in rainfall that could have decreased the density of tree cover. These analyses provide high-resolution data on the climate changes affecting the surroundings of Manot Cave between similar to 46 and 28 ka cal BP and indicate two drier phases corresponding to the Ahmarian and post-Levantine Aurignacian cultures while a more humid period identified during the Levantine Aurignacian.

AB  - Background As a widely distributed and aerial migratory bird, the Common Swift (Apus apus) flies over a wide geographic range in Eurasia and Africa during migration. Although some studies have revealed the migration routes and phenology of European populations, A. a. apus (from hereon the nominate apus), the route used by its East Asian counterpart A. a. pekinensis (from hereon pekinensis) remained a mystery. Methods Using light level geolocators, we studied the migration of adult pekinensis breeding in Beijing from 2014 to 2018, and analysed full annual tracks obtained from 25 individuals. In addition, we used the mean monthly precipitation to assess the seasonal variations in humidity for the distribution ranges of the nominate apus and pekinensis. This environmental variable is considered to be critically relevant to their migratory phenology and food resource abundance. Results Our results show that the swifts perform a round-trip journey of ca 30,000 km each year, representing a detour of 26% in autumn and 15% in spring compared to the shortest route between the breeding site in Beijing and wintering areas in semi-arid south-western Africa. Compared to the nominate apus, pekinensis experiences drier conditions for longer periods of time. Remarkably, individuals from our study population tracked arid habitat along the entire migration corridor leading from a breeding site in Beijing to at least central Africa. In Africa, they explored more arid habitats during non-breeding than the nominate apus. Conclusions The migration route followed by pekinensis breeding in Beijing might suggest an adaptation to semi-arid habitat and dry climatic zones during non-breeding periods, and provides a piece of correlative evidence indicating the historical range expansion of the subspecies. This study highlights that the Common Swift may prove invaluable as a model species for studies of migration route formation and population divergence.

AB  - Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values were measured from bone collagen extracted from archaeological Nubian human (n=54) and faunal (n=61) populations from the site of Kerma, Sudan. Collagen suitable for isotopic analysis was extracted from 22 faunal and 48 human samples from the Eastern cemetery site, dated to the Middle Kerma (c. 2050 - 1750 BC) and Classic Kerma (c. 1750 - 1500 BC) periods respectively. The isotopic data indicate that the human dietary regimen included a mix of C-3 and C-4 plant-derived components, with a larger C-4 component than previously reported in archaeological Egyptian Nile Valley populations. Elevated delta N-15 values are attributed to consumption of dietary resources from a N-15-enriched terrestrial ecosystem. The faunal isotope data also indicate the consumption of C-3 and C4 plants. The large range of delta C-13 values measured in both the human and faunal samples supports previous work suggesting that a significant portion of the populations buried at Kerma may have originated elsewhere, further confirming the Nile Valley as a major corridor for population movement in the region.

AB  - In this study we compared the wing kinematics of 27 bats representing six pteropodid species ranging more than 40 times in body mass (M(b)=0.0278-1.152.kg), to determine whether wing posture and overall wing kinematics scaled as predicted according to theory. The smallest species flew in a wind tunnel and the other five species in a flight corridor. Seventeen kinematic markers on the midline and left side of the body were tracked in three dimensions. We used phylogenetically informed reduced major axis regression to test for allometry. We found that maximum wingspan (b(max)) and maximum wing area (S(max)) scaled with more positive allometry, and wing loading (Q(s)) with more negative allometry (b(max)alpha M(b)(0.423); S(max)alpha M(b)(0.768); Q(s)alpha M(b)(0.233)) than has been reported in previous studies that were based on measurements from specimens stretched out flat on a horizontal surface. Our results suggest that larger bats open their wings more fully than small bats do in flight, and that for bats, body measurements alone cannot be used to predict the conformation of the wings in flight. Several kinematic variables, including downstroke ratio, wing stroke amplitude, stroke plane angle, wing camber and Strouhal number, did not change significantly with body size, demonstrating that many aspects of wing kinematics are similar across this range of body sizes. Whereas aerodynamic theory suggests that preferred flight speed should increase with mass, we did not observe an increase in preferred flight speed with mass. Instead, larger bats had higher lift coefficients (C(L)) than did small bats (C(L)alpha M(b)(0.170)). Also, the slope of the wingbeat period (T) to body mass regression was significantly more shallow than expected under isometry (T alpha M(b)(0.180)), and angle of attack (alpha) increased significantly with body mass [a alpha log(M(b))7.738]. None of the bats in our study flew at constant speed, so we used multiple regression to isolate the changes in wing kinematics that correlated with changes in flight speed, horizontal acceleration and vertical acceleration. We uncovered several significant trends that were consistent among species. Our results demonstrate that for medium- to large-sized bats, the ways that bats modulate their wing kinematics to produce thrust and lift over the course of a wingbeat cycle are independent of body size.

AB  - Channelization for navigation and flood control has altered the hydrology and bathymetry of many large rivers with unknown consequences for fish species that undergo riverine migrations. In this study, we investigated whether altered flow distributions and bathymetry associated with channelization attracted migrating Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) into commercial navigation channels, potentially increasing their exposure to ship strikes. To address this question, we quantified and compared Lake Sturgeon selection for navigation channels vs. alternative pathways in two multi-channel rivers differentially affected by channelization, but free of barriers to sturgeon movement. Acoustic telemetry was used to quantify Lake Sturgeon movements. Under the assumption that Lake Sturgeon navigate by following primary flow paths, acoustic-tagged Lake Sturgeon in the more-channelized lower Detroit River were expected to choose navigation channels over alternative pathways and to exhibit greater selection for navigation channels than conspecifics in the less-channelized lower St. Clair River. Consistent with these predictions, acoustic-tagged Lake Sturgeon in the more-channelized lower Detroit River selected the higher-flow and deeper navigation channels over alternative migration pathways, whereas in the less-channelized lower St. Clair River, individuals primarily used pathways alternative to navigation channels. Lake Sturgeon selection for navigation channels as migratory pathways also was significantly higher in the more-channelized lower Detroit River than in the less-channelized lower St. Clair River. We speculated that use of navigation channels over alternative pathways would increase the spatial overlap of commercial vessels and migrating Lake Sturgeon, potentially enhancing their vulnerability to ship strikes. Results of our study thus demonstrated an association between channelization and the path use of migrating Lake Sturgeon that could prove important for predicting sturgeon-vessel interactions in navigable rivers as well as for understanding how fish interact with their habitat in landscapes altered by human activity.

AB  - The SPLASH project (2004-2006) revealed complex population structure and migratory connections, but no regional effort was made along the southern Mexican Pacific coast until dedicated research was initiated in 2010. It is unclear whether humpback whales documented in this region belong to the Mexican or Central American population units. This study aimed to establish the relationship between humpback whales of southern Mexico and those of the surrounding population units. Humpback whale photo-identification images were compared from multiple locations in north, central, and southern Mexico and Central America. Whales' movements among regions were estimated using the Interchange Index (InI) and the Movement Index (MI). The results showed higher movements among the southern sampling areas, suggesting that whales from southern Mexico belong to the "Central American population unit." This population unit migrates north to the feeding areas of the US West Coast using a migratory corridor along mainland Mexico to the mouth of the Gulf of California along the Baja California Peninsula. The degree of interaction with humpback whales from other population units is unknown. More studies are needed to understand population structure and disentangle photographic capture of whales on migration from whales where this is their main wintering area.

AB  - A new species of Pristimantis is described from an Andean cloud forest at 2650 m in the Cordillera Oriental of Colombia. Pristimantis dorado sp. nov. is similar to and could be closely related to P. acutirostris, but can be readily distinguished from this latter species by the absence of a tympanic annulus, vocal slits, vocal sac and reticulations on concealed surfaces, and by having a metallic gold iris with a brown horizontal streak. The phylogenetic position of the new species is recovered and we provide its advertisement call, which this species manages to emit despite lacking a vocal sac and vocal slits. This discovery reminds us that despite the extensive research on the alpha-taxonomy of Pristimantis in Colombia, fieldwork in high montane forests continues to yield previously unknown species.

AB  - Invasive species are known to influence the structure and function of invaded ecological communities, and preventive measures appear to be the most efficient means of controlling these effects. However, management of biological invasions requires use of adequate tools to understand and predict invasion patterns in recently introduced areas. The present study: (1) estimates the potential geographic distribution and ecological requirements of the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile Mayr), one of the most conspicuous invasive species throughout the world, in the Iberian Peninsula using ecological niche modeling, and (2) provides new insights into the process of selection of consensual areas among predictions from several modeling methodologies. Ecological niche models were developed using 5 modeling techniques: generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM), generalized boosted models (GBM), Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP), and Maximum Entropy (Maxent). Models for the eastern and western portions of the Iberian Peninsula were built using subsets of occurrence and environmental data to investigate the potential for ecological niche differences between the invading populations. Our results indicate geographic differences between predictions of different approaches, and the utility of ensemble predictions in identifying areas of uncertainty regarding the species' invasive potential. More generally, our models predict coastal areas and major river corridors as highly suitable for Argentine ants, and indicate that western and eastern Iberian Peninsula populations occupy similar environmental conditions.

AB  - The Great Lakes are used as a migratory corridor and for feeding by tens of thousands of waterbirds each spring and fall, yet little species-specific information is available regarding numbers, seasonal timing, and connectivity along the route. The objective of this study was to use land-based surveys to quantify fall migration at two important landmarks in Lake Superior for an assemblage of waterbirds from three orders (Anseriformes, Gaviiformes, and Podicipediformes). Both the Keweenaw Peninsula (KP) and Whitefish Point (WP) showed a temporal pattern of high numbers (peaking at 9000 and 16,000, respectively) in the first 3 h after dawn and a decline (dropping to 1000 and 5000, respectively) over the following 5 h, although the decline was far more abrupt at KP than at WP. Fall totals for WP were nearly 85,000 individual waterbirds, and for KP about 34,500. Species abundance rankings were generally similar for both locations, with the most common species being long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis), red-necked grebe (Podiceps grisegena), greater scaup (Aythya marila), and red-breasted merganser (Mergus serrator). Most species were far more numerous at WP than at KP, with long-tailed ducks being 65 times more numerous. A notable exception was redhead (Aythya americana), which was 33% more numerous at KP than at WP. We suggest that during the fall, Lake Superior acts as a geographic funnel concentrating waterbirds from northwest to southeast and that details of the composition, timing and amplitude of this phenomenon are important considerations for any nearshore Great Lakes development.

AB  - Satellite telemetry was used to identify migration routes and stopovers, estimate migration chronology, and describe variation in movements among American Black Duck Anas rubripes marked in Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Virginia between 2007-2009. Thirty-one transmitters each provided data for at least one spring migration. The ducks departed their wintering areas during 18 March-7 June ((x) over bar +/- s.e. = 17 April +/- 3.3 days), averaged 3.35 +/- 0.3 stopovers (range = 1-5 stopovers) and spent 6.44 +/- 0.8 days at stopover sites (range = 0.54-12.2 days), migrated 1,126.1 +/- 89.5 km (range = 270-1,396 km), and arrived at inferred nesting areas during 16 April-28 June ((x) over bar = 9 May +/- 3.4 days). Black Duck on the South Atlantic Flyway migrated nearly twice as far (P < 0.01), made twice as many stopovers (P < 0.01) and arrived at their inferred nesting areas two weeks later than those on the North Atlantic and Mississippi Flyways (P = 0.04). Transmitters on 13 ducks provided at least partial data during autumn migrations. Black Duck departed inferred nesting or moulting areas during 5 October-1 December ((x) over bar = 24 October +/- 43 days), averaged 2.0 +/- 0.3 stopovers (range = 1-4 stopovers), spent 12.6 +/- 3.5 days at stopover sites (range = 0.25-41 days), migrated 993 +/- 202.9 km (range = 277-1,485 km), and arrived at wintering areas during 18 November-18 December ((x) over bar= 1 December +/- 5.8 days). Our study confirmed known migration routes and stopovers and emphasises the need for habitat conservation and management along seasonal corridors, especially for Black Duck transitioning between their southern wintering and western breeding ranges. Furthermore, migration chronology and stopover duration of stay from our study should be incorporated into energetic carrying capacity models, to inform and direct habitat goals for Black Duck in north-eastern North America.

AB  - Nesting Canada geese (Branta canadensis) appear to be colonizing portions of the Colorado River in Glen Canyon and Grand Canyon, Arizona. We report the first appearance of nesting geese in this area with one record in the 1950s, followed several decades later by single-pair nesting records in 2001, 2012, 2013, and 2016, increasing to two pairs in 2018, five or six pairs in 2019, and at least two pairs in 2020. Our recent field observations (2018-2020) document that nesting geese are currently successfully raising broods in two geographically distinct areas separated by over 300 km along the river corridor in Grand Canyon: a 4-km area from river kilometer 80 to river kilometer 84 in eastern Grand Canyon, and a 54-km area from river kilometer 392 to river kilometer 446 in western Grand Canyon. The eastern nesting area is dominated by riparian habitat that has proliferated in a relatively stabilized shoreline since Glen Canyon Dam began regulating the river in 1963. The western nesting area is within the fluctuating inflow of the river with Lake Mead, a geomorphologically distinct area where >20 years of drought-induced declining reservoir levels have exposed sediments deposited when Lake Mead was higher than at present (1950s-2001). Two factors likely contribute to the increased presence of nesting geese in Grand Canyon, including (1) expanding populations of nonmigratory, resident geese and the southward expansion of their historic breeding range and (2) the availability of nesting habitat along the Colorado River today that may not have existed historically.

AB  - Information on the ecology of jaguars (Panthera onca) in "El Cielo" Biosphere Reserve in Tamaulipas, Mexico is scant and limited to anecdotic records in a handful of publications. The objectives of our study were to: a) determine population density and structure of jaguars, b) compare their activity patterns with that of pumas (Puma concolor), c) ascertain potential prey relative abundance, and d) evaluate local resident's perception on loss of domestic animals due to jaguar predation. Between April 2013 and April 2014 we conducted camera trapping in Gomez Farias Township with a total sampling effort of 8 580 camera trap days. Besides, we completed 136 semi-structured interviews among local residents of Gomez Farias and Llera Townships to gather information on domestic animal losses attributed to jaguars and other carnivores. We identified eight different jaguar individuals during a complete year of camera-trapping, composed of four adult females, one juvenile female, two adult males and one juvenile male. We estimated a jaguar density of 5.9 +/- 1.3 jaguars/100 km(2). Activity patterns for jaguars and pumas were similar as both were nocturnal and crepuscular in nature. The most abundant potential prey species for jaguars in the study site were Crax rubra, Cunicztlus paca, Mazama temama, Odocoileus virginianzts and Didelphis virginiana; while the rarest were Mephitis macroura and Procyon lotor. Interview results suggested that chickens, dogs, and house cats were the most consumed domestic animals from all reported losses by local residents (n= 107). This study represents the first attempt to describe jaguar ecology in "El Cielo" Biosphere Reserve; however, there is a need of additional monitoring efforts to determine the current status of jaguars in a larger area in order to establish conservation strategies. Finally, this jaguar population may have an important role in maintaining the species in the Sierra Madre Oriental biological corridor connecting populations in Nuevo Leon and San Luis states in Northeastern Mexico.

AB  - Here we evaluate the hypothesis that during cold climatic phases, people and resources became increasingly packed along highland Lesotho's riverine corridors as the viability of palatable grasslands for large mammal hunting on the upland plateaus declined. These intensification efforts resulted in increased reliance on lowerranked aquatic (fish) resources with knock-on effects for lithic technological organization. We compare data on the relative contribution of fishing to the diets of highland hunter-gatherers at Sehonghong rockshelter with a faunal proxy widely argued to correlate with subsistence intensification (faunal assemblage evenness). In addition, we compare these data with two measures of lithic technological intensification (cutting edge production and core reduction intensity) to test whether diet intensification tracks technological intensification. We show that at Sehonghong, aquatic resource exploitation is not always correlated with faunal assemblage evenness. We find that some layers (i.e. RF) show spikes in aquatic resource use irrespective of changes in faunal assemblage evenness. Other layers (i.e. RBL/CLBRF) were intensively occupied, but they do not have many fish. Our data also demonstrate that aquatic resource use is not correlated with lithic technological intensification. These results suggest that while aquatic resource exploitation was a 'fallback' option for some of Lesotho's highland hunter-gatherers, there is considerable variability. Our data show that multiple intensification dimensions were variably combined through the Late Pleistocene at Sehonghong as they were elsewhere in southern Africa.
