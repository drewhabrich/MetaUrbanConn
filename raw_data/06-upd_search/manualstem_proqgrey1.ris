AB  - House fly, Musca domestica L., dispersal up to 3 km from a dairy release site into a nearby town was documented in this study. Dispersal occurred by both direct flight across multiple, mixed habitat types including open fields with interspersed tree copses, and by corridors and edges provided by local roads. Marked flies were collected at an adjacent dairy, and at most traps that were set along two well-travelled roads connecting the dairies and the town. Additionally, one marked fly was captured on a trap that was placed outside of a restaurant in town 3 km from the release site. In total, 0.67% (250) of marked house flies were recaptured from a total release of 37,200 marked flies over 11 wk.Escherichia coli O157:H7 was isolated from two dairies in north-central Florida using immunomagnetic separation followed by direct culture plating onto CHROMAgar and sorbitol MacConkey agar supplemented with potassium tellurite and cefixime (CT-SMAC) selective media. Presumptive identification of E. coli O157:H7 was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the fliCH7 and rfbEO157 gene amplification.Dairy samples that were tested included pools of house flies, spilled grain, and fresh dairy cattle manure. Forty-two percent (24/57) of samples were positive by direct-culture using both CHROMAgar and CT-SMAC agar, with 11 positive samples from CHROMAgar and 13 positive samples from CT-SMAC agar. The 24 positive samples were submitted to PCR; of those 24 samples, 14 (58%) were confirmed by PCR. Two of the PCR-confirmed samples were false-negatives on CHROMAgar media, but presumptive positive on CT-SMAC media, indicating the importance of analyzing samples by more than one method, and demonstrating the sensitivity of PCR.Direct culture prevalence rates from CHROMAgar were 14.0% (8/57) for house flies, 5.3% (3/57) for grain, and 0% (0/57) for manure. The rate of CHROMAgar isolation of E. coli O157:H7 from house flies was 2.6 times greater than from grain. The PCR confirmation rates were 67% (8/12) for house flies, 56% (5/9) for grain and 33% (1/3) for manure. These data suggest that detection of E. coli O157:H7 on dairies might be more accurately determined by testing house flies instead of grain or manure samples, regardless of which isolation method is utilized.Flies are easy to collect and process, and because they disperse into urban areas, they provide valuable information regarding a mobile element for pathogen transmission that is lacking in grain and manure samples. House flies should be an important consideration in the design of a pathogen monitoring program on dairies.

TI  - The movements of small mammals within the environmental mosaic of a railway junction
AU  - Hicklenton, David Mark
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - This study investigated small mammal movements within and between semi isolated habitat islands. The results are relevant to urban small mammal species in general and their movements in relation to man-made barriers in particular. The study site was a railway junction consisting of railway tracks of different widths, dissecting an area of relict grassland in an otherwise urban environment.For two years the small mammals in this area were trapped, marked and recaptured. They were also tracked using dyed bait markers and a grid of dropping boards from which were recovered faeces containing remains of the dyed bait. The ability of the small mammals present (Apodemus sylvaticus, Clethrionomys glareolus and Microtus agrestis) to cross the railway lines was correlated with weight and sex; and also related to the width of the railway track and the vegetation on either side.Conclusions were reached concerning the distribution and behavioural ecology of the three species within the study area, particularly in relation to the animals' capabilities for movement within heterogeneous habitats.The biogeography of small islands such as these was considered, with reference to the effects of size and isolation on mammal movements. The effect of population density on such movements and possible local migratory effects were also investigated. The implications for conservation were discussed and it was shown that information from fieldwork such as this can aid biogeographical analysis in reserve design (for conservation of urban mammal populations) and aid in urban planning.

TI  - Wildlife responses to anthropogenic disturbance in amazonian forests
AU  - Abrahams, Mark
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Legally inhabited indigenous, extractive and sustainable use tropical forest reserves, have been lauded as a solution to the intractable problem of how to assure the welfare and secure livelihoods of the world’s diverse forest-dependent people, whilst conserving the world’s most biodiverse terrestrial ecosystems. This strategy has been critiqued by human rights advocates, who assert that legally inhabited reserves paternalistically restrict the livelihood choices and development aspirations of forest-dwellers, and by conservationists, who argue that sustained human presence and resource extraction erodes tropical forest biodiversity. This thesis examines both the anthropogenic impacts on tropical forests at the regional, landscape and household scales and the livelihood challenges faced by semi-subsistence local communities in the Brazilian Amazon. A spatially explicit dataset of 633,721 rural Amazonian households and an array of anthropogenic and environmental variables were used to examine the extent and distribution of structural (deforestation) and non-structural (hunting) human disturbance adjacent to 45 cul-de-sac rivers across the Brazilian states of Amazonas and Pará. At the landscape and household scales, a total of 383 camera trap deployments, 157 quantitative interviews and 164 GPS deployments were made in the agricultural mosaics and forest areas controlled by 63 semi-subsistence communities in the Médio Juruá and Uatumã regions of Central-Western Brazilian Amazonia, in order to quantify and explicate the (i) livelihood costs incurred through the raiding of staple crops by terrestrial forest vertebrates, (ii) degree of depletion that communities exert upon the assemblage of forest vertebrates and (iii) spatial behaviour of hunting dogs and their masters during simulated hunts. Our results indicate that at the regional scale, accessibility, fluvial or otherwise, modulated the drivers, spatial distribution and amount of anthropogenic forest disturbance. Rural household density was highest in the most accessible portions of rivers and adjacent to rivers close to large urban centres. Unlike the low unipolar disturbance evident adjacent to roadless rivers, road-intersected rivers exhibited higher disturbance at multiple loci. At the household and landscape scales semi-subsistence agriculturalists lost 5.5% of their staple crop annually to crop raiders and invested significant resources in lethal and non-lethal strategies to suppress crop raiders, and to avoid losses an order of magnitude higher. Crop raiding was heightened in sparsely settled areas, compounding the economic hardship faced by communities already disadvantaged by isolation from urban centres. A select few harvest-sensitive species were either repelled or depleted by human communities. Diurnal species were detected relatively less frequently in disturbed areas close to communities, but individual species did not shift their activity patterns. Aggregate species biomass was depressed near urban areas rather than communities. Depletion was predicated upon species traits, with large-bodied large-group-living species the worst impacted. Hunting dogs travelled only ~ 13% farther than their masters. Urban hunters travel significantly farther than rural hunters. Hunting dogs were recognised to have deleterious impacts on wildlife, but were commonly used to defend against crop raiders.

TI  - The impact of riparian habitat quality on the activity of british bats in lowland river systems, and its relevance to conservation management
AU  - Scott, Sarah Jane
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Rivers and their associated floodplains are natural wildlife corridors used by a wide range of animal species. Most British rivers in both rural and urban areas have been significantly affected as a result of drainage, flood defence structures, urban development and direct habitat loss. This has, in some cases, fragmented the river corridor and affected the structure and function of the riparian zone. As landscape-scale conservation schemes aim to restore the ecology of rivers, I consider what affect the quality of the riparian zone (an area where the river channel, bank and flood plain interact) has on the foraging and activity of important riparian users, British bats, and assess their relevance as bioindicators of ecosystem health. A matched pairs design was used to test the effect of 'undisturbed' (high quality) and 'disturbed' (lower quality) riparian zones based on riparian width, habitat complexity, connectivity, and surrounding land use, on bat activity. In general, wider and more complex riparian zones did not show sign ificantly more bat activity overall, though exhibited significantly greater foraging activity expressed by the number of feeding buzzes recorded. However, species-specific responses showed that Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Myotis spp. (probably mainly Myotis daubentonil) were influenced by the quality of the riparian zone more so than known habitat generalists, such as P. pipistrellus. Small differences in the complexity and width of the riparian zone positively affected the foraging and activity of P. pygmaeus, whereas the presence of wider stands of wet woodland positively affected the foraging and activity of Myotis spp. Broader landscape features and the availability of insect prey also affected the activity of two sympatric species, P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus. Both species were positively associated with the presence of urban habitat within a 2 km radius of survey sites and aquatic invertebrates, and showed niche differences related to known dietary preferences. The association with invertebrate abundance may make Pipistrellus bats potential bioindicators of riverine health. Pipistrellus bats select riverine habitats that are associated with urban areas, which may indicate a dependency on rivers in urbanised areas. The composition of the riparian zone and floodplain habitat affects the foraging and activity of riparian specialist British bats and should be considered when designing landscape-scale conservation schemes that include British rivers.

TI  - An integrated approach to enhancing ecological connectivity and accessibility in urban areas: a case study of sheffield, uk
AU  - Ersoy, Ebru
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Recently, increasing environmental threats to the functioning of landscape and biodiversity have heightened the need for developing new approaches to nature conservation. Green and ecological networks have been developed as an attempt to maintain the functioning of landscapes, promote the sustainable use and conservation of nature, support the movement of species and increase people's use and enjoyment of the nature (Bennett and Wit, 2001; Bennett and Mulongoy, 2006; Lawton et al., 2010). These can be achieved by the identification and selection of the main features of ecological and green networks based on ecological and / or social functions we intend them to fulfil as well as the determination of objective conservation measures. The main purpose of this research is to focus on critically examining different ways of defining green and ecological networks and their functionality for biodiversity and people in the case of Sheffield, which were derived from different theoretical and professional perspectives (planning and ecology), and to explore the potential for different approaches to define ecological / green networks. Due to its multidisciplinary nature, this thesis uses a mixed research methodology, based on different methods of data collection and analysis. This research commences with the analysis of existing green and ecological network approaches, namely the Green Network (Sheffield City Council) and the Living Don (Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust). In order to analyse these approaches, policy document analysis, semi-structured interviews and ArcGIS spatial analyses were conducted to understand the rationale, aims and the spatial structure of current networks in the case of Sheffield. For the identification of criteria to develop alternative routes of connectivity, ArcGIS and FRAGSTATS were used. After generating land cover and land use maps at a very fine scale (2m raster resolution) and with different levels of detail, the alternative connectivity routes, for both biodiversity and people, were identified on the basis of two connectivity measures. The first set of spatial analyses took into account structural connectivity of landscape components as the main criteria, to develop potential routes using ArcGIS and FRAGSTATS in combination. On the other hand, based on functional connectivity, the second set of alternative connectivity routes were developed using a least-cost corridor approach in ArcGIS. For the delineation of alternative connectivity routes for biodiversity, 10 species were selected from 3 different taxon groups (birds, mammals and reptiles); and for people, the alternative routes from residential buildings to (a) green and open spaces, (b) public buildings and (c) industrial / commercial units were used considering the effects of physical / legal accessibility and slope. Then, existing approaches and derived alternative routes of connectivity were compared and contrasted to each other in ArcGIS, to analyse the relationship between their structural properties and the urban morphologies in which they occur, with a view to predicting the implications for ecological connectivity and use by members of the public. The Sheffield City Council and the Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust aim at maintaining and enhancing ecological connectivity for the benefit of wildlife as well as supporting public enjoyment and movement, and both of their network approaches benefit from the linear connectivity formed around the main rivers, streams and valleys. However, it was found that there are significant differences in the representation, spatial coverage and arrangement of the Green Network and the Living Don based on the methods and the site selection criteria used for developing green and ecological networks. Regarding the structural connectivity routes for biodiversity and people, significant differences were found in the spatial extent and arrangement of alternative routes. On the other hand, functional connectivity routes for biodiversity showed both similarities and differences in their spatial extents and arrangements according to selected species' habitat requirements and movement behaviours across the landscape. Similarly, functional connectivity routes for people changed as I used different destinations and parameters. The overall results of this research provide further support for the conceptual premise that the definition of green and ecological networks is highly dependent on the methodology, ecological and / or social functions that are considered, and also criteria for the inclusion of different habitats or land uses within the network.

TI  - Lichen Conservation in Eastern North America: Population Genomics, Climate Change, and Translocations
AU  - Allen, Jessica L.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Conservation biology is a scientific discipline that draws on methods from diverse fields to address specific conservation concerns and inform conservation actions. This field is overwhelmingly focused on charismatic animals and vascular plants, often ignoring other diverse and ecologically important groups. This trend is slowly changing in some ways; for example, increasing number of fungal species are being added to the IUCN Red-List. However, a strong taxonomic bias still exists. Here I contribute four research chapters to further the conservation of lichens, one group of frequently overlooked organisms. I address specific conservation concerns in eastern North America using modern methods. The results of these studies provide insight into lichen conservation in each situation, implications for the broader ecosystems within the study regions, and advancement of methods for the study of lichen conservation and biology.The first research chapter (Chapter 2) is a population genomics study based on whole genome shotgun sequencing of Cetradonia linearis, an endangered, lichenized fungus. These data were used to 1) assemble and annotate a reference genome, 2) characterize the mating system, 3) test for isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by environment (IBE), and 4) investigate the biogeographic history of the species. Approximately 70% of the genome (19.5 Mb) was assembled. Using this assembly, only a single mating type was located, suggesting the species could be unisexual. There was strong evidence for both low rates of recombination and for Isolation by Distance, but no evidence for Isolation by Environment. The hypothesis that C. linearis  had a larger range during the last glacial maximum, especially in the southern portion of its current extent, was supported by Hindcast species distribution models and the spatial distribution of genetic diversity. Given the findings here, it is recommended that C. linearis remain protected by the U.S. Endangered Species Act and listed as Vulnerable on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red-List.The third chapter is an estimation of the impacts of climate change on high-elevation, endemic lichens in the southern Appalachians, a global diversity hotspot for many groups, including lichens. Extensive field surveys in the high elevations of the region were carried out to accurately document the current distributions of eight narrowly endemic species. These data were compared with herbarium records, and species distribution modeling was used to predict how much climatically suitable area will remain within, and north of, the current range of the target species at multiple time points and climate change scenarios. Fieldwork showed that target species ranged from extremely rare to locally abundant and models predicted average losses of suitable area within the current distribution of species ranging from 93.8 to 99.7%. The results indicate that climate change poses a significant threat to high-elevation lichens, and illustrates the application of current modeling techniques for rare, montane species.In the fourth chapter, a dataset of >13,000 occurrence records for lichens in the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain (MACP) of eastern North America was used to model distributions of 193 species. The resulting models were used to quantify the amount of each species’ distribution that is occupied by unsuitable land use types, along with the potential area that will be lost to sea-level rise (SLR). These analyses showed that species have likely already lost an average of 32% of their distributional area to development and agriculture, and are predicted to lose an average of 12.4 and 33.7% of their distributional area with one foot (∼0.3 m) and six feet (∼1.8 m) of SLR, respectively. Functional and taxonomic groups were compared to identify specific effects of SLR. Species reproducing with symbiotic propagules were found to have significantly larger distributions than species that reproduce sexually with fungal spores alone, and the sexually reproducing species were predicted to lose greater distributional area to SLR. Cladonia species occupy significantly less area in the MACP than Parmotrema species and were predicted to lose more of their distributions to SLR. Patterns of total species diversity showed that the area with the highest diversity is the Dare Peninsula in North Carolina, which was also predicted to lose the most land area to SLR. The workflow established here is flexible and applicable to estimating SLR impacts worldwide and can provide essential insights for local conservation planning. The fifth chapter describes the results of three experiments conducted to test new and established methods for lichen transplantation. First, small fragments of Graphis sterlingiana, Hypotrachyna virginica , and Lepraria lanata were placed on medical gauze attached to each of the species’ most common substrate to test the feasibility of transplanting narrowly endemic species. Second, burlap, cheesecloth, medical gauze, and a plastic air filter were directly compared for their use as artificial transplant substrates with Lepraria finkii as the test lichen. Third, transplants of Usnea angulata were established to test its amenability to transplantation via hanging fragments on monofilament. The first two experiments were established on Roan Mountain, North Carolina and the third experiment at Highlands Biological Station, North Carolina. In the first two experiments medical gauze did not withstand local weather conditions and nearly all pieces fell from the trees within 6 months. The plastic air filter and burlap performed best as artificial substrates for transplants, with a 100% and 80% success rate, respectively. Cheesecloth remained attached to the trees, but only 20% of lichen fragments remained attached to the substrate after one year. In the third experiment U. angulata  grew 3.5 ± 1.4 cm in 5 months, exceeding previously reported growth rates for this species. These results advance methods for conservation-focused lichen transplants, and expand established methods to a new region and new species.

TI  - The ecological factors governing the persistence of butterflies in urban areas.
AU  - Loram, A.
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Previous studies have suggested that availability of high quality habitat rather than habitat connectivity or species mobility was the limiting factor in the distribution of grassland butterflies, but were mostly undertaken on specialist species in rural areas.  Consequently, this project tests the hypothesis that the quality of available habitat is more important that patch size or connectivity to the persistence of four grassland butterfly species in the West Midlands conurbation.  Two of the study species are widespread (Polyommatus icarus and Coenonympha pamphilus) whilst two have a more restricted distribution (Erynnis tages and Callophrys rubi).  However, unlike species with very specific requirements, all are polyphagous and can tolerate a wide range of conditions, making habitat quality different to quantify.  Several means of assessing habitat quality were developed and tested.  A detailed vegetation quadrant sampling method had the best predictive abilities for patch occupancy and summarised the habitat preferences within the urban context.  A model based upon habitat quality and connectivity was devised, with the ability to rank each patch according to potential suitability for each species.  For all four species, habitat quality accounted significantly for the greatest variance in distribution.  Connectivity had only a small effect whilst patch area had almost none.  This suggests that conservation efforts should be centred upon preserving and improving habitat quality.

TI  - Animal movement in pelagic ecosystems: From communities to individuals
AU  - Schick, Robert S.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Infusing models for animal movement with more behavioral realism has been a goal of movement ecologists for several years. As ecologists have begun to collect more and more data on animal distribution and abundance, a clear need has arisen for more sophisticated analysis. Such analysis could include more realistic movement behavior, more information on the organism-environment interaction, and more ways to separate observation error from process error. Because landscape ecologists and behavioral ecologists typically study these same themes at very different scales, it has been proposed that their union could be productive for all (Lima and Zollner, 1996). By understanding how animals interact with their land- and seascapes, we can better understand how species partition up resources are large spatial scales. Accordingly I begin this dissertation with a large spatial scale analysis of distribution data for marine mammals from Nova Scotia through the Gulf of Mexico. I analyzed these data in three separate regions, and in the two data-rich regions, find compelling separation between the different communities. In the northernmost region, this separation is broadly along diet based partitions. This research provides a baseline for future study of marine mammal systems, and more importantly highlights several gaps in current data collections. In the last 6 years several movement ecologists have begun to imbue sophisticated statistical analyses with increasing amounts of movement behavior. This has changed the way movement ecologists think about movement data and movement processes. In this dissertation I focus my research on continuing this trend. I reviewed the state of movement modeling and then proposed a new Bayesian movement model that builds on three questions of: behavior; organism-environment interaction; and process-based inference with noisy data. Application of this model to two different datasets, migrating right whales in the NW Atlantic, and foraging monk seals in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands, provides for the first time estimates of how moving animals make choices about the suitability of patches within their perceptual range. By estimating parameters governing this suitability I provide right whale managers a clear depiction of the gaps in their protection in this vulnerable and understudied migratory corridor. For monk seals I provide a behaviorally based view into how animals in different colonies and age and sex groups move throughout their range. This information is crucial for managers who translocate individuals to new habitat as it provides them a quantitative glimpse of how members of certain groups perceive their landscape. This model provides critical information about the behaviorally based movement choices animals make. Results can be used to understand the ecology of these patterns, and can be used to help inform conservation actions. Finally this modeling framework provides a way to unite fields of movement ecology and graph theory.

TI  - Dispersal behavior and connectivity of red-cockaded woodpeckers in the North Carolina sandhills
AU  - Trainor, Anne Maura
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Human activities are degrading natural ecosystems globally, thus eroding biological diversity and reducing wildlife populations. One prominent example is the Red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) which is a federally endangered, cooperative breeding species endemic to highly-fragmented longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forests in the southeastern United States. The persistence of P. borealis is dependent upon managing longleaf pine forests to facilitate prospecting and dispersal movements and thus connecting populations.My overall research objective was to interrelate spatial environmental data and animal movement behaviors in order to evaluate P. borealis  habitat connectivity. First, I developed a novel method to empirically estimate and validate landscape resistance surfaces using mark-recapture and radio-telemetry data. I then applied this method to determine how prospecting movements were influenced by both environmental and conspecific cues during forays. The detail prospecting and dispersal data was then combined with detailed data on forest structure to estimate habitat connectivity across the landscape. Finally, I evaluate if P. borealis connectivity is positively impacted by private landowners involvement in a voluntary incentive-based agreement. My results illustrated with an empirically-derived resistance surface that P. borealis are influenced by subtle changes in vegetation structure and land-use activities. The resistance surface successfully predicted most of the short-distance dispersal events. In addition, prospecting individuals’ are cueing into environmental characteristics between breeding sites and complex social dynamics at potential breeding sites. When the network model was correlated with observed dispersal events, the abrupt transition from highly connected to disconnected territories provides insight into habitat connectivity within and between habitat patches. This approach showed that highly connected territories reside within managed areas of continuous forest but territories on private properties are isolated from managed lands and each other by agriculture or development. However, voluntary incentive-based conservation programs on private land are increasing the connectivity of P. borealis populations by managing and restoring habitat on private property.

TI  - Anthropogenic Impacts, Stormwater Runoff Dynamics and Opportunities for Upscaling Multifunctional Urban Green Spaces Using High-Frequency Sensing
AU  - Hernandez Gonzalez, Liliana Maria
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Unrestrained urban growth combined with the increase in the intensity and frequency of precipitation events, due to climate change, has become a major challenge for urban green spaces. Urban sprawl increases ecosystem degradation and the vulnerability of cities to floods as a result of excess stormwater runoff and non-point source pollution. To study these challenges and potential solutions in urban green spaces, we designed and deployed a network of in situ sensors measuring surface and groundwater level, soil moisture, precipitation, temperature, electrical conductivity, and discharge at 30-min intervals. In a native prairie-wetland complex, Gensburg Markham Prairie (GMP), anthropogenic inputs are a concern given observed ecosystem degradation around the periphery of the prairie. To understand soil quality and the potential for habitat degradation in GMP, we evaluated concentrations of metals and phosphorus in soil profiles, identified possible sources of contamination, and assessed the likelihood that contamination would impact the prairie ecosystem. We observed enrichment of Pb, Cu, Zn, and P because of deposition from the urban environment, but the enrichment levels are low enough that they are not expected to negatively impact the ecosystem of GMP. The detailed soil chemistry data constitute a spatial contamination map that can be used to assess potential long-term impacts on the ecosystem, such as reduction of plant growth and species diversity, and inform site management and biodiversity conservation efforts.Inland freshwater wetlands throughout the northern U.S. are experiencing an increase in salinity due to road salt runoff during the winter months. Salinization affects soil texture, contaminant transport, microbial activity, and plant growth in wetlands. Therefore, there is a pressing need to understand the dynamics of road salt intrusion in these ecosystems. Two years of continuous data in GMP show periodic spikes in electrical conductivity (EC) during winter months, generally by an order-of-magnitude, due to intrusion of road salt applied on nearby roads. Traditional water quality monitoring methods, such as monthly sampling, would likely have missed these abrupt changes in EC levels caused by rapid snowmelt runoff events. Spectral analysis of EC time-series in ditches suggests that salinity dynamics are not correlated at super-annual timescales, indicating that the dynamics are event-driven, and the introduced solutes are rapidly exported from the site. This study supports the development of improved de-icing strategies by local agencies and informs site-specific management of wetland ecosystems under anthropogenic stressors.A GIS-based spatial analysis tool, named Multifunctional Urban Green Stormwater Infrastructure (MUGSI), was developed for identifying and prioritizing locations for green infrastructure investments at the parcel level. The tool was applied in two watersheds – the Lower Des Plaines and the Little Calumet – and the City of Chicago in Cook County, IL – as part of a 5-year pilot program to assess the feasibility of a regional stormwater credit trading program in Cook County, termed StormStore. A stormwater credit trading program allows developers to meet a portion of their stormwater detention requirements on their sites by purchasing credits for stormwater retention or detention from others in the same watershed who have voluntarily retrofitted their properties for increased stormwater storage. We collected multiple datasets from the region to determine the suitability and benefits of candidate sites and developed 13 metrics to represent the benefits of green infrastructure. The metrics assess the multifunctionality of green infrastructure for stormwater management, species diversity, green space connectivity, air quality, water quality, urban heat island amelioration, environmental justice, green cover increase, and public green space accessibility. The results of the local GI assessment show that priority sites for investment are primarily located near industrial corridors, major highways, minority neighborhoods, and along the banks of the Lower Des Plaines and Little Calumet Rivers. The MUGSI tool advances the capability of urban planners, property developers, stormwater agencies, and conservation groups to prioritize sites for green infrastructure in Cook County and other urban areas based on their multifunctionality, feasibility, and overall benefit. The global increase of urban impervious land cover poses a significant threat to the aquatic ecosystems. Green roofs (GR) are one approach to mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization on aquatic ecosystems, such as thermal surges and pollution from urban runoff. We evaluated the ecohydrological behavior of two fully established GR under differing management regimes at the Chicago Botanical Gardens from July to September 2019. Drainage outflow from a managed GR (perennial native and non-native plants) and an unmanaged GR (perennial natural prairie vegetation) was monitored over a storm season (summer and early fall). Thermal dynamics dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition and nitrate concentration of runoff were assessed. The managed GR runoff had a lower DOC concentration and less humic-like DOM signal (SUVA254) than the unmanaged GR. In contrast, lower concentrations of nitrate and more recalcitrant DOM (less protein-like compounds relative to humic-like compounds) were released from the unmanaged GR. The unmanaged GR also displayed a greater capacity to reduce thermal surges associated with storm events. Our study provides new information on the links between GR management and runoff water quality. Further, the impacts of GR management on the mitigation of thermal surges and DOM composition can help to improve future GR design, as these ecohydrological responses have been largely overlooked to date. Our findings are scalable and can support future urban planning, particularly for scenarios where green infrastructures are used to mitigate the impacts of climate change on urban ecosystems.

TI  - Genetic Analysis of Bobcats (Lynx rufus) and Ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) in a Fragmented Landscape Using Noninvasive Sampling
AU  - Taylor, Daniel Raab
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Bobcats (Lynx rufus) are highly mobile, occupy diverse habitat types, and are well-suited for adaptation in response to anthropogenic changes on the landscape. These abilities make bobcats valuable indicators of landscape connectivity, which is essential for the viability of wildlife populations. Understanding patterns of gene flow among bobcat populations can help evaluate habitat corridors through urban environments, such as the Lower Rio Grande Valley of South Texas. I used scat sampling and landscape-genetic methods to determine the impact of habitat fragmentation on genetic connectivity of bobcats in South Texas. The noninvasive scat sampling strategy was an efficient method for collecting genetic samples of bobcats, but appears unsuccessful for monitoring ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) populations. I found evidence for restricted dispersal of bobcats in fragmented habitat patches through analysis of spatial autocorrelation and contemporary gene flow. Bobcat populations in contiguous rangeland habitats appeared panmictic, while fine-scale spatial autocorrelation in fragmented areas indicated restricted dispersal. Estimates of migration rates and direction of gene flow indicated that bobcats within the fragmented areas are likely to remain or disperse to rangeland if possible, but dispersal rarely occurred into the fragmented areas from the rangeland. Monitoring connectivity of habitat corridors will be important for the long-term conservation of wildlife in the region, including the two remaining U.S. ocelot populations.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of Asian Longhorned Beetle in Worcester, MA: Thermal Effects, Community Responses, and Future Vulnerability
AU  - Elmes, Arthur Francis Marett
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urban environments experience air, water, noise, and heat pollution as a consequence of their composition, structure, and function. These adverse environmental conditions, which have direct and indirect effects on human health and ecological stability, can be mitigated or partially offset by healthy and extensive urban forests. Additionally, urban trees provide a number of cultural, aesthetic, and property value benefits. However, to provide maximum ecosystem service benefits, an urban forest must be carefully planned and maintained, so that average tree lifespan is maximized and ecological vulnerability is minimized. Maximal urban forest resilience is best achieved via taxonomic and age-diversity, such that no one genus or age-cohort dominates. This diversity enhances overall urban forest resilience, which in turn facilitates maximum ecosystem service provision. The Asian Longhorned Beetle (ALB,  Anoplophora glabripennis) infestation in Worcester, MA represents a case example of taxonomic monoculture vulnerability, but also an excellent opportunity to reinvest and diversify the urban forest. As a result of the ALB infestation, which was first documented in 2008, approximately 35,000 host trees were removed from residential and public property, substantially reducing urban tree canopy coverage and uncovering impervious surfaces. Chapter two quantifies this Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) loss, and shows that in loss areas Land Surface Temperature (LST) increases range from 1 – 6° C. The research investigates multi-scale effects of this relationship, particularly in the hard-hit Burncoat and Greendale neighborhoods of Worcester, MA. In response to the large quantity of UTC loss suffered due to ALB, the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR), the City of Worcester, and the Worcester Tree Initiative (WTI) have together planted over 30,000 trees, primarily via tree giveaway programs to local residents. Chapter three assesses the effectiveness of this initiative in terms of juvenile tree mortality rates – a critical indicator of long-term urban forest success. Results indicate that tree stewardship variables such as renter proportion and number of trees planted per property are strong predictors of tree mortality. Tree species was shown to be strong predictor of mortality, with ornamental trees showing lower mortality rates than shade deciduous or conifers. Finally, Chapter four investigates the potential risk of further ALB infestation in the Worcester area, using a circuit theory dispersal model, which uses an analogy with electrical circuits to predict the dispersal of random-walkers across a heterogeneous landscape. The results indicate that impervious surfaces such as roads, sidewalks, and parking lots, as well as proximity to existing trees are facilitators of ALB movement. Circuit-based dispersal maps highlight the importance of narrow dispersal corridors connecting larger areas of potential dispersal. Dispersal potential was combined with ALB habitat suitability measured with Mahalanobis typicality, yielding a hybrid map of ALB infestation risk. These map products are valuable both as contributions to the understanding of invasive species movement in novel environments, and as tools for land managers attempting to eradicate ALB, such as the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. This dissertation investigates three elements of the ALB infestation of Worcester, providing a holistic explanation of the impacts, recovery, and vulnerability of Worcester’s urban forest.

TI  - Movement behaviour and distribution of forest songbirds in an expanding urban landscape
AU  - Tremblay, Marie Anne
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urbanization is viewed as a major threat to global biodiversity because of its role in the loss and fragmentation of low-lying, productive habitats associated with coastal plains and river valleys. My study examines the effects of urbanization on the movements and distribution of songbirds in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. I conducted playback and translocation experiments to assess the permeability of small-scale (e.g. transportation corridors, rivers) and large-scale (e.g. multi-lane expressways, areas of urban development) features of the urban landscape, respectively. I then used these empirical data to parameterize spatially explicit models and determine functional landscape connectivity across the study area. Finally, using point surveys conducted at 183 sites across the urban matrix, I examined the role of land cover type, local vegetation characteristics, landscape-level forest cover, and isolation from natural features on the distribution of songbirds. In 563 playback trials involving the responses of 2241 birds, I found that the size of the gap in vegetation was the most important determinant of movement across linear features; the likelihood of movement sharply decreasing as the gap in vegetation exceeded 30 m. The results of 176 translocation trials provided further evidence of the barrier effect of gaps. Multiple gaps, in particular, constrained the movements of both yellow warblers (Dendroica petechia) and black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus). The bird surveys revealed that natural forest stands played a critical role in sustaining regional avian diversity in the study area. Moreover, functional distance to the nearest forested natural area or water body often explained more variation in the probability of occurrence of focal species than straight-line distance, suggesting that barriers identified from the permeability experiments may have affected not only the movements of songbirds but their settlement patterns as well. Taken together, my results suggest that preserving a functionally connected network of natural areas is vital to conserving avian biodiversity in cities. My research describes novel methodologies for characterizing the composition and configuration of highly heterogeneous and fragmented landscapes. It also provides a unique examination of the link between the movement behaviour of individual birds and population-level distribution patterns within this context.

TI  - The Effects of Urbanization on Riparian Forest Plant Communities in the Research Triangle Area of North Carolina
AU  - Lopez, Bianca E.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Ongoing urban development is having profound impacts on ecosystems worldwide, by reducing the amount and connectivity of natural habitat and changing the local environmental conditions. Despite the ubiquity and the continued growth of urban areas, the effects of urban development on the diversity and composition of plant communities remain poorly understood. In this dissertation, I address this issue by investigating the effects of urban development on patches of remnant riparian forest in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina. To do this, I used a rural-to-urban gradient approach, comparing the plant species and environmental conditions of sites surrounded by different amounts of urban development. I first explored the effects of different “filters” created by urban development on plant biodiversity using structural equation modeling. In this, I tested the predictions of an established conceptual framework and developed a general model that could be used to compare the effects of urbanization on plant biodiversity across cities. I then examined changes in plant species’ functional traits along the rural-to-urban gradient and compared the species and traits found at these sites to high-quality riparian plant communities that represent potential targets for restoration. I found that plant traits change somewhat predictably along an urbanization gradient, particularly with regard to species’ seed dispersal modes, but that traits may not be as useful for predicting which species will establish in urban restoration efforts. Finally, I assessed the ability of environmental variables and spatial variables describing habitat connectivity to explain variation in plant species composition across sites. I found that species with limited dispersal ability showed the strongest signal of dispersal limitation across sites, and that urban development between sites appears to reduce connectivity for these species. This dissertation provides insight into the ways that urban development is altering riparian forests in the Research Triangle, which may have important impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. My results have implications for land management, restoration, and urban planning in this landscape.

TI  - Plant migration along freeways in and around an arid urban area: Phoenix, Arizona
AU  - Gade, Kristin Joan
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - General ecological thought pertaining to plant biology, conservation, and urban areas has rested on two potentially contradictory underlying assumptions. The first is that non-native plants can spread easily from human developments to "pristine" areas. The second is that native plants cannot disperse through developed areas. Both assume anthropogenic changes to ecosystems create conditions that favor non-native plants and hinder native species. However, it is just as likely that anthropogenic alterations of habitats will favor certain groups of plant species with similar functional traits, whether native or not. Migration of plants can be divided into the following stages: dispersal, germination, establishment, reproduction and spread. Functional traits of species determine which are most successful at each of the stages of invasion or range enlargement. I studied the traits that allow both native and non-native plant species to disperse into freeway corridors, germinate, establish, reproduce, and then disperse along those corridors in Phoenix, Arizona. Field methods included seed bank sample collection and germination, vegetation surveys, and seed trapping. I also evaluated concentrations of plant-available nitrate as a result of localized nitrogen deposition. While many plant species found on the roadsides are either landscape varieties or typical weedy species, some uncommon native species and unexpected non-native species were also encountered. Maintenance regimes greatly influence the amount of vegetative cover and species composition along roadsides. Understanding which traits permit success at various stages of the invasion process indicates whether it is native, non-native, or species with particular traits that are likely to move through the city and establish in the desert. In a related case study conducted in Victoria, Australia, transportation professionals and ecologists were surveyed regarding preferences for roadside landscape design. Roadside design and maintenance projects are typically influenced by different groups of transportation professionals at various stages in a linear project cycle. Landscape architects and design professionals have distinct preferences and priorities compared to other transportation professionals and trained ecologists. The case study reveals the need for collaboration throughout the stages of design, construction and maintenance in order to efficiently manage roadsides for multiple priorities.

TI  - Ecological network planning method and case study : a case study in chongming island, china
AU  - Guo, Ji Guang
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorAlong with the process of urbanization, the development of natural and the reconstruction strengthen the changes in the city pattern. Habitat fragmentation and habitat loss are widely recognized as major threats to biodiversity & extinction on a global scale. The main reason is it may cause the reduction of the number of species and mortality and reduce species possibility of reproduction in other habitat. As a result of fragmentation, landscape plaques become smaller and smaller, more isolated and boundary, more or less is surrounded by unfavorable matrix. Through the ecological corridor to connect the habitat island, especially larger habitat, can reduce even eliminate the landscape fragmentation impacts on biodiversity. So constructing ecological networks and connecting the patches of spatial distribution is the effective way to protect wildlife. Existing ecology network planning methods more attention of nodes, connection and plants, these methods in solving problems in a single problem are very useful. However, these methods are less likely to find a regional scale of ecological network planning method. In this paper, integrated the research advanced experience both at home and abroad to put forward a comprehensive ecological network planning method. The major steps for ecological networks construction discussed in this paper are: (1) habitat resources assessment; (2) wildlife assessment; (3) Node chooses; (4) network analysis; (5) cost analysis; (6) least-cost analysis. The construction of ecological networks is discussed in this paper mainly adopts the method of gravity model, the resistance model and least cost model.(1) In the gravity model by the method of evaluating the gravitational attraction of each node degree solved the problems of the importance of the corridor and which nodes are connected. (2) In the resistance model through analysis of the actual path through the landscape in each land use to determine each landuse's resistance value, resolve the problem of the relative resistance it is difficulted to determine. (3) At the least cost model the first two model analysis results is used to find a minimum cost between the nodes, resolve the spatial location of the corridor it is difficult to determine and reduce the problem of building cost. The advantages of this method is (1) gives the quantitative method of selecting the node; (2) gives the quantitative method of assessment importance of the corridor;(3) gives the quantitative method of assessment importance of the network connectivity; (4) gives the quantitative method of Corridor construction; (5) maximize the use of existing green space, wetlands resources,which can lower construction costs. Based on this method, this paper chooses Chongming Island as the case study. Chongming Island located in the northeast of Shanghai, water clean and flat and with a good ecological environment. The eastern part of the beach is the red-crowned cranes, swans and other rare habitats of migratory birds. Chongming Island, the geographical environment is very suitable for plant growth, but also there have been many large wild animals, however, since the last half century, as population growth, urban construction, and gradually changed the structure of natural ecosystems, landscape fragmentation serious. The main habitat types in Chongming Island including urban, agricultural land, plantation land, wetlands. Large-scale green patch mainly located in the eastern, western and Dongping National Forest Park. These habitats uneven distributed, separated by matrix between the green patch. The lack of contact is not conducive to the proliferation and the protection of animals. Therefore, this paper chooses two kinds of resource: Woodland and wetland, to construct ecological network system with different form corridor. The research result indicates that this method is effective. For the ecological and strategic resources can be fully utilize, more than 50% of the green corridor in the planning is existing resources, construction cost is low feasible, the cost of the construction is low and feasible. The innovation of this article is:(1) extract the advantages of Gravity model, Resistance model, Least cost model and uantify the ecological networks construction Methods;(2)With GIS, given the spatial location of corridor; (3)Maximize use of existing green space, wetland resources, to reduce the cost of building. The inadequacies of this paper is the only goal is to protect the animals. The future combination of cultural, aesthetic, human demand for open space to study the network

TI  - Impact of Rapid Urban Expansion on Structure, Function and Connectivity of Green Space
AU  - Muhamad Nor, Amal Njihah
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Globally, rapid urban expansion has caused a significant decline in green spaces in urban areas. It affects the form and structural patterns of green space. As a result, green space area becomes reduced in size, spatial structure, connectivity and function in urban areas. These gaps extend beyond uncoordinated master planning, which lacks required information regarding the past, present and future structural changes in urban expansion and green space. However, the existing methods and adaptive tools designed to respond to such needs are uncertain. This research aims to understand the impact of rapid urban expansions on the structure, connectivity and function of green spaces and to develop models as diagnostic and decision support tools in three Southeast Asian cities which are all areas of rapid expansion: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Jakarta, Indonesia; and Metro Manila, Philippines. This study has evaluated the changes in the spatial structures and patterns of green space in urban areas of the three cities over the last two decades. The performance of the integrated Land Change Modeler (LCM) and the Markov chain modelling were verified to simulate future urban expansion by 2030. To reveal the priority corridors on maps, a novel integrated model which combines circuit theory, connectivity analysis and the least-cost path modelling, was used based on the target species of the Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus) and the Yellow-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus goiavier). Overall, this study found that the percentage of green spaces in all three cities had reduced in size as the function of rapid urban expansions over the 25-year period. Key findings clearly indicated that important differences exist in spatial distributions of green space in different cities. LCM-Markov chain models proved to be suitable for the simulation of future land use/land cover (LULC). There were also important differences in the predicted spatial structure for 2030 when compared to the planned development in each city; substantive differences in the size, density, distance, shape and spatial pattern. The increased fragmentation of the landscape will continue in 2030, more shape complexity will be observed and less connectivity between green space patches will be present. Evidence suggests that these spatial patterns are influenced by the rapid urban expansion and respective master planning policies of the municipalities in the cities. This study identified that, the emergence of potential corridors by integrating structure and functional connectivity of green space could increase the connectivity of green space for conservational significant areas. Therefore, the use of integrated remote sensing, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), landscape ecology analytics, simulation modelling and connectivity modelling tools provide significant insights into understanding the impact of rapid urban expansion on green space structure, identifies constraints and informs intervention for spatial planning and policies in cities, and contributes to the improvement of ecological networks in rapidly expanding cities.

AU  - Elliott, Milissa
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The impact of natural resource extraction, and subsequent transportation to market, is hypothesized to have consequences on the plant community structure of the western Canadian Arctic. The Mackenzie Valley gas pipeline project will create new transportation and disturbance corridors and it is expected that this will facilitate the movement of introduced species northward. As a part of the IPY-GAPS project, an assessment of plant community composition among different types of disturbance was conducted within the vicinity of four communities in the Northwest Territories (Fort Simpson, Fort Good Hope, Norman Wells, and Inuvik) from June – August 2008. Results indicate that the prevalence of introduced species was significantly higher in close proximity to roads, urban centres, and existing pipelines. These disturbance types had greater richness and cover of introduced species than seismic lines. The highest proportion of introduced species was found in Fort Simpson, especially along transportation corridors. The percent cover and occurrence of introduced species were found to be significantly higher along transects within 1-5 m from these roads compared to 10-20 m away. A community consultation survey was also completed on the perceptions of community members held toward the idea of invasive alien species (IAS), their willingness to participate in monitoring programs for IAS, and what role they wanted the government to play in monitoring IAS. The results of the survey suggested that people were willing to report the presence of an IAS, but would not use a website to submit that information. Furthermore, the concept of using an incentive to gather support and increase participation in a monitoring program was seen as unnecessary due to the participants' inherent connection to the land. The results of these studies suggest that future expansion of disturbances, such as roads, pipelines, and enlarged urban areas may increase the prevalence and number of introduced species within northern communities and that managing these impacts will require the development of a community based action plan geared towards the social and cultural background of each affected community.

TI  - Active Citizenship in Green Space Governance
AU  - Mattijssen, Thomas
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - BackgroundThe role of authorities in green space decision-making and management is increasingly supplemented with activities from citizens. Research has shown how citizens across Europe nowadays engage in a wide variety of practices to accomplish their green space-related objectives. In this way, citizens contribute to the management of protected natural areas, rural landscapes and urban green spaces.The current focus on active citizenship in green space governance brings about important debates. This includes discussions about how to best govern and protect our green spaces. There are also democratic debates about the roles and responsibilities of different actors in green space governance. While citizens potentially contribute towards the realization of public policy, their objectives can also clash with the formal responsibilities and preferences of authorities. There might also be tensions between and inequalities among citizens.Thesis aims and research questionsThis PhD-project specifically focuses on forms of governance in which active citizens play a leading role in realizing, protecting and/or managing public green space. The main research aim is to contribute to scientific and societal debates on active citizenship in green space by studying its relevance for the governance, management and protection of green space. For this purpose, four main research questions have been formulated to address four main knowledge gaps regarding the involvement of active citizens in green space governance:• What are the overall scope and key characteristics of active citizenship in green space governance?• What are the benefits and co-benefits of different types of active citizenship in green space governance?• What factors contribute to or constrain the long-term continuity of active citizenship in green space governance?• How can the transformative potential of active citizenship in green space governance be understood?Research approachThis PhD-research focuses on the study of daily practices that involve active citizens in green space governance. To do so, this thesis departs from the Policy Arrangement Approach (PAA) and enriches it with elements from practice theory in order to tailor it towards this study of daily practices.The Policy Arrangement Approach is an established analytical framework used to study the governance of natural resources through four analytical dimensions: actors (those involved in governance), discourse (the content and verbal aspects of governance), rules (guiding principles that govern actions of actors) and resources (tools and skills used to achieve certain outcomes). By adopting elements from practice theory this thesis adds a focus on human activities as a fifth dimension. It also adds a stronger recognition of the constitutive role of materiality in practices and an emphasis on the ends to which practitioners orient their activities.I argue that a deeper understanding of the role and relevance of active citizenship in green space governance requires both a broader overview of the scope of these practices and a deeper understanding of specific practices. In order to do so, I used a 3-layered framework for this thesis. This started with a broad inventory and analysis of 264 different practices in order to gain an overview of their characteristics and diversity. The second layer progressed upon this with a detailed qualitative analysis of a subsample of 50 practices in order to gain more reliable knowledge and a deeper understanding of these practices. In the third layer, four case studies have been conducted to gain in-depth knowledge on a number of specific issues.The scope and key characteristics of active citizenshipWhen I started with this thesis, there was a scarcity of good quality baseline data on the nature and diversity of active citizenship in green space governance. The analysis of 264 examples of active citizenship across the Netherlands in layer one of this thesis gives a good overview of the variety of ways in which active citizens engage in green space governance. They for example aim to protect the habitat of an endangered species or manage land within a nature reserve. However, improving social cohesion through community gardening or providing access to a woodland can be important objectives just as well. Active citizenship in the green domain thus often works across traditional policy silos and crosses borders between nature, culture and social domains.This study on the scope and key characteristics of active citizenship highlights that most of the practices in which citizens engage are small scale; they are usually limited to local areas spanning no more than a few hectares, and often much less. Most of the active citizenship in green space governance takes place outside of protected reserves, often in (peri-)urban areas. It also shows that citizens do not always engage in the actual management of green space. In contrast to most previous studies, this research highlights the additional relevance of political activities such as lobbying and protesting, as these activities are important means for citizens to accomplish their objectives.Active citizenship is often linked with other actors in the public domain. Citizens often cooperate with local authorities and NGOs, and occasionally also with business actors such as farmers. Funding from local authorities can be an important source of income, as well as sponsoring by companies and private donations. In many practices, involved citizens donate their own money and sometimes revenues are generated through delivering products and services.The benefits and co-benefits of active citizenshipThe detailed qualitative analysis in layer two addresses a lack of insight into the outcomes produced by active citizens. This makes it difficult to comprehend the implications of a shift towards active citizenship for the natural environment and the population.The analysis shows how the large majority of the 50 practices contribute towards ecological benefits, such as biodiversity, urban greening, landscape restoration, expansion of green space areas, or species protection. This large majority also contributes towards socio-economic co-benefits, such as environmental awareness and the use functions of green space (accessibility, recreation, amenity). Other cobenefits relate to social cohesion, food production, employment and the protection of cultural aspects of the landscape. The exact benefits and co-benefits strongly depend on the type of practice.The practices in this study generally generate benefits on a much smaller scale than those of authorities and large NGOs. While green self-governance does contribute towards realizing environmental and social objectives, this contribution is therefore mostly of local relevance. It is also important to be aware of potential tensions between benefits and co-benefits related to the activities of active citizens, for instance when an increase in recreation negatively affects biodiversity. Furthermore, citizens are not always successful in accomplishing their objectives and the activities of citizens can also produce outcomes considered as negative.The long-term continuity of active citizenshipIn the studies in layer one and two citizens expressed concerns about the longterm continuity of active citizenship in green space governance. This was an important motivation for me to conduct three European case studies into placekeeping, the long-term responsive management of places, in order to preserve the qualities and benefits that a place offers.These cases show how citizens can manage public green spaces over multiple decades. While similar examples are rare, such cases can provide important inspiration for other groups that aim to protect certain green values in the long term. They show how citizens can develop an inspiring idea, mobilize fellow citizens, realize a green space and maintain it over time. Even so, these studies also highlight how even after several decades, groups still struggle to continue their activities. Changing policies such as declining subsidies, urban development such as encroachment, and the ageing of volunteers all put pressure on the continuity of citizens’ activities.A number of important lessons for continuity can be distilled from these cases. First of all, long-term continuity is supported by a degree of formalization: established rules and internal procedures provide stability to citizens. Secondly, the importance of adaptive capacity is also underlined: citizens need to be able to respond and adapt to political, socio-economic and cultural developments over time. Third, authorities play a key role in place-keeping by citizens: their longterm support can provide stability to citizens, but they can also constrain citizens when they change their policies.The transformative potential of active citizenshipTensions between the activities of citizens and the role of authorities are manifest throughout this thesis. Prior research shows that active citizens are often hindered by institutions and often face difficulties in scaling up beyond the local level. I therefore conducted an in-depth case study on how citizens can transform practices in governance and reshape the relationship between citizens and (local) authorities.This fourth and final case study shows how discourses and activities promoted by citizens became embedded in spatial planning and green space management. This instigated institutional changes, and showcases a transformative potential in both substance (redevelopment of a green space) and governance (co-creation). Yet, this study also highlights the persisting influence of institutionalized rules and procedures. Institutional change in local governance is often a slow and complex process, in which citizens need to align with the institutions that they want to change in order to be able to instigate these changes. This conditions the activities of citizens, reducing their autonomy.Even so, transformation in governance is not necessarily a matter of citizens striving to realize their objectives vis-à-vis authorities trying to realize theirs. Instead, this study shows that when certain ways of working are under pressure, when motivations align towards a shared end-goal, and when there is a shared sense of urgency, transformation can take place through co-creation between citizens and authorities. In this, the success of practices that involve active citizens in governance can clear the way for involvement of citizens in other practices, eventually instigating a gradual rather than disruptive change in how society is locally governed.DiscussionThis thesis shows how citizens can make an important contribution to the governance and management of green space. Most practices are currently situated outside protected nature reserves, but they can enhance urban greening and biodiversity in the city or ensure the conservation of cultural elements in the landscape. Even so, the contribution of citizens to (inter)national policy goals and ecological networks is still relatively small, as the outcomes of active citizenship in green space governance are mostly limited to the local scale level.In the long run, co-benefits of active citizenship in green space may increase people’s connection and involvement with nature, leading to increased support for environmental protection. With this, co-benefits can provide a first step towards the realization of more direct benefits for nature conservation. After all, practices with an explicit focus on co-benefits often also produce benefits - and vice-versa. Relating to co-benefits can therefore be an effective strategy for governments or environmental NGOs aiming to involve active citizens in their work.From a democratic point of view, critical scholars have highlighted how authorities prefer to deal with citizens whose objectives correspond with their own policy aims. While authorities often aim to promote active citizenship in their discourse, this will sometimes put them at odds with citizens who pursue different goals. Conflicts between citizens and authorities often manifest themselves in my work, but such notions are often overlooked in the political discourse, which tends to focus on cooperative forms of active citizenship. My work also reiterates citizens’ dependency on authorities and shows how the continuity of their activities can depend on the role of local governments.Scholars have also been critical of the exclusion of non-active citizens in these debates. Previous research has shown how certain societal groups are less represented in active citizenship, and there are ongoing debates about how the costs and benefits of active citizenship in the green domain are spatially distributed. Authorities still have an important task to represent everyone, also disengaged or less successful citizens, to make sure that everyone has the chance to enjoy the benefits offered by green space. The fragmented nature and local scale of active citizenship also point towards a need for a continued central role of authorities in safeguarding green space values and realizing ecological networks.In this, active citizenship can offer a valuable addition to what governments do, contributing important benefits and co-benefits to the environment and the population. By strategically supporting or collaborating with active citizens, authorities can strengthen their contribution to policy objectives and stimulate direct forms of democracy. Over the long term, authorities can support placekeeping by citizens by providing security via stable policies, formally protecting the involved spaces, allowing long-term management contracts and contributing resources.In this context, the adoption of a more polycentric and context-sensitive approach to green space governance can help authorities in achieving their policy objectives. The diversity of active citizenship does not match with generic ‘one-size-fitsall’ policy and governing approaches of authorities. Rather, it calls for a flexible role of authorities in governance: in some instances authorities should have a leading role, in other instances an enabling or facilitating role, and sometimes a collaborative approach to governance is called for – all of this with sensitivity to the local context.

TI  - Loggerhead Shrike Detectability and Occurrence in Coastal South Carolina Urban Areas
AU  - Krauser, Michelle
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Grassland birds, such as the loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus), are threatened by extensive land-use change, including urbanization. Loggerhead shrikes have been declining since the early 1900s and are rare or extirpated in portions of their former range. Obtaining reliable population estimates of loggerhead shrikes is important to identify demographic trends and ensure conservation decisions are based on an accurate assessment of their current status. Imperfect detection, or the inability to detect every shrike during a survey, can result in biased population estimates. Estimating detection probability is labor-intensive and requires assumptions that are difficult to satisfy in most field studies. Understanding a species' detectability before beginning research is thus ideal.	In chapter one, I calculated the detection rates of long-term resident loggerhead shrikes along a highway corridor dominated by commercial and industrial development in Horry County, South Carolina. Using a generalized linear mixed model, I evaluated factors that could affect detection probability. All 47 shrikes included in the study were color-banded and monitored about twice per month year-round, from January 2019 through December 2021, allowing observers to determine occupancy and sex and track the status of each bird. Collectively, observers conducted 2,208 qualifying surveys on occupied territories. The best-fitting models showed that all predictor variables, including observer identity, season, sex, year, and the interaction between sex and season, affected detectability. The average detection rates for males and females had overlapping 95% confidence intervals, as did the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. Loggerhead shrikes had an average detection rate of 0.58 (range = 0.28–0.75, SD = 0.10) and were detectable year-round, with an average detection rate of 0.67 (SD = 0.17) during the breeding season, 0.56 (SD = 0.17) during winter, and 0.51 (SD = 0.16) during the molting season. The breeding season was the only season where the 95% confidence intervals for male and female detection rates did not overlap, with males having a detection rate of 0.70 (SD = 0.17) and females 0.60 (SD = 0.19). Females likely had a lower detection rate during the breeding season because they were unavailable for detection while incubating. Observers had detection rates ranging from 0.47 to 0.68 (SD = 0.08), suggesting variation among observers could affect population estimates. The results of chapter one can be used to improve the accuracy of population estimates by providing correction factors to account for the imperfect detection of urban shrikes. The correction factors can be used to identify the appropriate number of repeat surveys, increasing the efficiency of survey protocols and decreasing the costs of demographic studies. In chapter two, I identified habitat characteristics associated with loggerhead shrike occurrence along urban gradients in Charleston, Florence, Georgetown, and Horry counties, South Carolina. I surveyed 300 2.25-ha sites with impervious surface levels ranging from 3.2 to 96.3%. Using a generalized linear model, I assessed how impervious surface (%), highway density (m/ha), other road density (m/ha), total road density (m/ha), canopy cover (%), and powerline density (m/ha) are related to loggerhead shrike occurrence. Because loggerhead shrikes have been documented responding to habitat characteristics at multiple spatial scales, I measured predictor variables at the 2.25-ha, 20.25-ha, and 1-km scales.

TI  - Bee Community Response to Local and Landscape Factors along an Urban-Rural Gradient
AU  - Birdshire, Kristen R.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Over a third of the world’s crops—including fruits, vegetables, nuts, spices, and oilseed—require insect pollination. Reliance on the pollination services that promote these food products continues to rise due to increasing demands from growing human populations; therefore, it is imperative to understand the ecology of insect pollinators. While extensive research describes pollination services in both agricultural and urban settings, few studies examine pollinator activity along urban-rural gradients. Even fewer address how bees with different bee life history characteristics respond to urbanization, and to my knowledge, never from a high elevation semi-arid environment. This study documented different pollinator assemblages from 12 sites along an urban-rural gradient in Denver, Colorado, USA. Percent impervious surface was used define the extent of urbanization. Wild bees were collected in the summer of 2017 and local and landscape characteristics were estimated using field assessments and geospatial analysis. Bee species’ life history characteristics were assigned to ecological guilds, and the relationships between urbanization and bee communities were explored using linear modeling. Given findings from a similar study, I hypothesized that bee communities in urban landscapes would be dominated by smaller bees with more ecologically generalized characteristics (e.g., polylectic and eusocial) than bees in rural landscapes, which were hypothesized to contain bee communities with more specialized traits (e.g., oligolectic). Overall, bee abundance and diversity decreased with increasing urbanization, suggesting that urban areas negatively impact bee communities. Moreover, all bee guilds responded positively to local floral richness, and negatively to the degree of urbanization in the landscape, suggesting that urbanization in the Denver metropolitan area is detrimental to entire bee communities. For the Denver metropolitan area, the findings suggest incorporating a greater diversity of floral species and increasing pollinator resource corridors throughout the city of Denver.

TI  - Forest Structure Shapes Tropical Terrestrial and Arboreal Mesomammal Communities Under Moderate Disturbance
AU  - Masseloux, Juliana
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Tropical biodiversity is threatened globally by anthropogenic disturbances, particularly forest degradation and overhunting. Where large mammals have been extirpated, smaller-bodied “mesomammals” may play an important ecological role (e.g., as seed-dispersers). However, mesomammals are routinely understudied as they tend to be rare, cryptic, and nocturnal. Tropical tree-dwelling (arboreal and semi-arboreal) mesomammals are especially vulnerable to forest conversion, particularly when reliant on old growth forest structures. Understanding species- and community-level responses of terrestrial and arboreal mesomammals to changes in forest structure and human activity is crucial for informing management decisions in protected areas where resources are limited. We deployed 20 arboreal and 75 terrestrial camera traps throughout Nam Cat Tien National Park, southern Vietnam. The study objectives of the first chapter were to 1) identify long-term changes in terrestrial mesomammal richness and 2) evaluate the effects of forest structure and anthropogenic disturbance on an 18-species mesomammal community using community occupancy models. The objectives of the second chapter were to 1) evaluate the utility of arboreal camera traps for surveying nine arboreal and four semi-arboreal tropical mesomammals, 2) model the effects of forest structure and anthropogenic disturbance on detection and occurrence of arboreal mesomammals using generalized linear mixed models and single-season occupancy models, and 3) estimate arboreality of semi-arboreal species using multi-scale occupancy models. We found that terrestrial mesomammal site occupancy was driven largely by the interaction between distance to seasonally inundated grassland and absolute forest cover (basal area per hectare). We found no negative effects of anthropogenic factors at the community-level. However, we did find that four disturbance-tolerant small carnivores have been extirpated since the 1990s and continued human presence in the park suggests that hunting and snaring remains an acute threat to native mesomammals. We also found that canopy connectivity and other mature forest characteristics were important across the arboreal community. The effect of tree and focal limb characteristics on species detection was most likely explained by physiological adaptations and tree use behavior. Mean occupancy was underestimated for most semi-arboreal species when only one method was used. Multi-method occupancy designs may thus improve estimates of species distribution and habitat use, which are important for guiding management and conservation decisions.

TI  - The Influence of Land Use and Habitat Fragmentation on Landscape Connectivity
AU  - Gray, Morgan
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The built environment, especially roads, urban and suburban development, can reduce the ability for wildlife to move across landscapes. Maintaining landscape connectivity has become a central theme in ecology and conservation, as corridors of intact habitat help maintain ecosystem functionality and, in the face of climate change, may provide migration paths for species. However, the influence of the built environment on connectivity is rarely quantified using empirical data informed by species detection, movement, or genetic structure. Rather, structural connectivity, as opposed to functional connectivity, is estimated using land cover alone. Structural connectivity estimates offer a simple and potentially powerful approach with fewer data requirements for wildlife corridor planning; however, models of structural connectivity are rarely if ever evaluated with empirical species data, limiting our understanding of their reliability and utility. This dissertation fills this gap by investigating the influence of human land use and habitat fragmentation on landscape connectivity using a suite of quantitative modeling approaches and mammals as the focal species, including cross comparisons among these approaches. Specifically, three methods that vary in levels of biological information are used to evaluate how well structural connectivity models perform for individual species, as well as their relationship to functional connectivity.To begin with, the utility of a structural connectivity model based on the distribution and intensity of land use is evaluated by comparing model predictions to observed land use by a generalist carnivore, the puma (Puma concolor). Findings from this study indicate that generic landscape permeability models can be used with confidence as a guide when prioritizing habitat corridors for biodiversity conservation across fragmented landscapes. Next, the utility of structural connectivity models is further evaluated by examining how the inclusion of specific human land use variables affects model accuracy in a species distribution model for gray fox ( Urocyon cinereoargenteus). Findings from this study indicate that species distribution models generated in human-dominated landscapes have higher accuracy when informed by indices of land use. Finally, a combination of spatial and genetic methods is used to evaluate the influence of roads on the functional connectivity for a small mammal, California ground squirrels (Otospermophilus beecheyi). Findings from this study indicate that a combined spatial and genetic approach can be used to identify locations where roads act as barriers. Given the importance of habitat fragmentation, there is a pressing need to rapidly develop and utilize connectivity assessment methods in conservation planning. Research findings presented here have already impacted mammal conservation planning and management in California in the following specific ways. The structural connectivity model was used to identify priority habitat linkages for inclusion in the Conservation Blueprint for Santa Cruz County, and the combined genetic and spatial approach was used by the Santa Clara County Open Space Authority, CA to identify corridors and restore connectivity in an area with an existing road network. Beyond these regional impacts, future conservation planning worldwide can benefit from using readily available data collected by citizen scientists as input in predictive mapping to increase the sample size and spatial coverage for species distribution modeling.

TI  - Assessing the ecological significance of linkage and connectivity for avian populations in urban areas
AU  - Rosenfeld, Emma Jane
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - As urbanisation continues to fragment and degrade habitats there is a need to ensure that cities are managed to sustain ecosystem function and high biodiversity. Ecological theories suggest that areas with higher levels of functional connectivity sustain a more diverse avian population. By identifying the key habitat features that dictate the distribution and abundance of avian populations it is possible to inform planning policy to maximise biodiversity. Bird species presence and abundance across an urban gradient in Birmingham (UK) was surveyed at 70 sites over three sampling periods (between 2009 and 2010), in combination with a tree survey and digital analysis of land use. Functional connectivity was shown to increase the abundance of bird species and to ameliorate the impacts of urban development. Bird species were found to vary with their associations with vegetation structure and a proxy for invertebrate productivity. There was clear evidence for increasing native tree species in the urban matrix to support more bird species. Ringing data collected between 2008 and 2011 were used to examine bird movements through the city and the influence of habitat factors such as connectivity and built space in the matrix. Bird movements between ringing sites demonstrated the permeability of the city and the importance of connectivity in the landscape. This work showed that the composition of the matrix influences bird occupancy and turnover of sites. The novel findings presented in this thesis on the influence of the urban landscape on urban avian ecology should make an important contribution to urban conservation methods.

TI  - Ecology and conservation of prairie rattlesnakes ( Crotalus viridis viridis) in relation to movement in a fragmented urban environment
AU  - Andrus, Wonnita
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Eighteen prairie rattlesnakes (Crotalus viridis viridis ) were tracked using radio-telemetry and 82 snakes were PIT-tagged over a 2-year period in Lethbridge, AB to determine population size, movement patterns, and habitat utilization, and to predict fragmentation effects on the species within an urban locale. Population size was estimated using closed population models at 374 snakes (295 adults) and open population models at 204 snakes (161 adults), greater than an estimate of <50 adults in 2003 (Ernst, 2003) and 2006 (Ernst & Quinlan, 2006). Mean home range sizes, based on 95% minimum convex polygon analysis, differed significantly between years (31.51 ha in 2005, 3.72 ha in 2006). Calculated movement parameters, such as mean distance moved per day, total distance moved over the course of the active season, and frequency of movement varied between years and individuals. Greater-than-expected (under hypotheses of even habitat choice) utilization was observed in habitat types located within coulee and flood plain areas, with apparent preference towards unbroken parcels of grassland or cottonwoods, whereas less-than-predicted utilization of agricultural habitat type was observed. Fragmentation effects on prairie rattlesnake movement and occurrence were examined through modeling and were found to coincide with observed species' locations, suggesting that prairie rattlesnakes are undergoing modification of movement patterns to avoid highly concentrated human density or use. Influence of weather on the use of vegetative ground cover was observed, as it was accessed more by prairie rattlesnakes at higher temperatures. Recommendations towards future management of the prairie rattlesnake population in Lethbridge are given, including protection of the Bridge View Drive site and inclusion of varied habitat types and terrain when planning habitat and wildlife corridors. Management decisions that ensure remaining habitat parcels and connective areas near rattlesnake foraging or movement corridors are also advocated. Identification of future research focuses include studies on juvenile survivorship, genetic structure, and vehicle-related mortality.

TI  - Arthropods in Linear Elements : Occurence, Behaviour and Conservation Management
AU  - Noordijk, Jinze
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Intensification of agriculture and urbanisation have caused large‐scale destruction and fragmentation of natural and semi‐natural areas in the Netherlands, with a considerable loss of biodiversity. As a consequence, the conservation of the biodiversity in the remaining small landscape elements has become increasingly urgent. This thesis presents the results of our study of arthropods in (mainly) roadside verges. The diversity of species proved to be considerable, with several rare and threatened, as well as many specialised species. These arthropod assemblages should be taken into account during the management of roadside verges. Our research aimed at a better understanding of the distribution and ecology of these species, which enables us to recommend appropriate measures for their conservation. Roadside verges are often covered by grassland vegetation and need to be mown in order to retain a high biodiversity. We studied ground beetles, weevils, ants and epigeic spiders in experimental plots with five different mowing regimes: no mowing; mowing once a year in autumn with or without removal of the cuttings; mowing twice a year, in early summer and autumn, with and without removal of the cuttings. Plots were located on three different verges which represented a plant productivity gradient, ranging from low‐productive, through medium‐productive to high‐productive grassland. The different mowing regimes had hardly any effect on the biodiversity at the low‐productive site, whereas at the medium‐productive and high‐productive sites, mowing twice a year with removal of the cuttings resulted in the highest arthropod species‐richness and abundance. A second experiment carried out on the medium‐productive verge showed that mowing twice a year with removal of the cuttings also gave the highest values for flower richness, flower diversity and abundance of flower‐visiting insects. Therefore such verges also had the highest number of visits to flowers by insects. On low‐productive verges, yearly mowing is not necessary. However, to ensure a high diversity of arthropods on medium‐productive to high‐ productive grassland verges, a regime of mowing twice a year with removal of cuttings is recommended for the largest part of the verge. Small patches of vegetation should be left intact to provide a refuge for arthropods in the period just after mowing when their resources are otherwise almost absent. This type of rotational management will probably improve their chance of survival.  Sandy verges can be important to xerophilic and thermophilic arthropods. These species are in decline due to the fragmentation and decreasing quality of heathland nature reserves. In the past, habitats for these species were numerous in the roadside verges in the Veluwe area. However, now vegetation succession is causing them to disappear and restoration management is urgently needed. We sampled arthropods in patches of grey hair‐grass (Corynephorus canescens) vegetation on the verges, and found that there were fewer stenotopic ground beetles and spiders than in similar vegetation patches in nature reserves. This seems attributable to differences in ‘habitat quality’, namely a denser cover of grass in the verges, as well as more herbaceous plants and tree seedlings. Moreover, any suitable vegetation patches are smaller. In addition, we sampled ground‐dwelling and flying ground beetles in open sandy roadside verges and newly‐created linear forest clearings. The occurrence of teneral individuals and flightless species indicate that verges may function as ‘habitat corridors’. In the forest clearings, teneral individuals were rare, but flying beetles were very abundant: more than twice as many individuals were caught here than in nature reserves and on roadside verges. This indicates that the clearings are used particularly by dispersing ground beetles, and thus function mainly as ‘movement corridors’. To make conditions more suitable for xerophilic and thermophilic species in roadside verges, we recommend restoring nutrient‐poor zones and recreating pioneer conditions. Subsequently, a regular management of selectively removing encroaching vegetation should be installed. If this is done over large distances, roadside verges can act as habitat corridors. Linear clearings in forests, situated between separate heathland habitat areas can help species bridge short distances between them. In this way, ecological networks can be created in highly fragmented heathland landscapes. Being relatively straight and narrow, roadside verges have an enormous distance of edge biotopes. We therefore studied edge effects on insect species to obtain more insight into how a verge functions as a habitat. We looked at the effects of the border between the vegetation and asphalt of the road on the direction of movement of two ground beetle species. The road appeared to be a barrier for these species and its presence caused movement patterns parallel to the asphalt. In another study, the number of flying ground beetles increased in linear forest clearings, probably because they are directed by forest edges when dispersing. Both studies provide extra evidence that roadside verges may act as ecological corridors. In addition, we found that flying ants used forest edges to find each other for mating, while their nests were located elsewhere. All these results indicate a substantial effect of edges on insect behaviour and their occurrence. This knowledge can be applied in conservation management. Roadside verges are distinctive biotopes with anthropogenic disturbances and edge effects that may negatively influence arthropods. However, as roads are an inherent, inevitable part of the densely populated Netherlands landscape, we choose here to emphasise the positive aspects of these linear habitats. Our investigations show that arthropod communities of high conservation interest occur in roadside verges, that verges can be used to create ecological networks, that abrupt biotope edges in verges act as a guide for dispersing insects and are sometimes favoured as a mating site, and that a regular applied mowing scheme provides valuable conditions for arthropods of hay‐meadows.

T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - A spatial distribution model was developed to predict the pattern of stormwater catchment facilities in developing urban areas. The model was validated through comparison of predicted results with historical data in Guelph, Canada, using nearest neighbour analysis. The validated model has been applied to developing urban-rural fringe lands in Guelph to illustrate land use patterns likely to occur under different scenarios. Simulations of various scenarios for incorporating stormwater catchment facilities into greenways have been tested with the model and the resultant land use patterns compared to the status quo, through measures of landscape ecological integrity such as connectivity and porosity.The results demonstrated that landscape integrity could be increased, urban wildlife habitat enhanced, and opportunities for residential non-consumptive wildlife recreation improved through integration of the evolving 'blue-green' open space provided by urban stormwater management facilities into existing greenways.

TI  - Patterns and Processes of Genetic Diversity in the Endangered San Joaquin Kit Fox
AU  - Wilbert, Tammy R.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Survival of the endangered San Joaquin kit fox (SJKF; Vulpes macrotis mutica) is challenged by reduced and fragmented habitat resulting from anthropogenic land uses in the Central Valley of California. Because the SJKF is adapted to arid landscapes and utilizes large home ranges to prey on kangaroo rats, genetic techniques are very useful to study these elusive animals. We used annual noninvasive genetic surveys from 2009 to 2011 to document the kit foxes on the Topaz Solar Farms (TSF) in San Luis Obispo Co., California, prior to the construction of the solar facility. We identified 45 individuals from 351 fresh scat samples and found kit foxes predominantly used the annual grasslands and rarely used agricultural lands. Second, we conducted 3 years of systematic transect surveys for scat throughout the Ciervo-Panoche area. We identified 93 kit foxes, with half of the individuals carrying a mtDNA haplotype with a 16bp deletion that had not been previously identified. Next, we used 795 scat and tissue samples collected over a period of 20 years to ascertain landscape level patterns of connectivity and population dynamics of kit foxes in the San Joaquin Valley. We found 3 geographically and genetically distinct groups that are highly disconnected and have undergone a 76% reduction from their estimated historic population size. Finally, we used pyrosequencing to characterize three major histocompatibility (MHC) genes that have been shown to play a role in immunity. We selected a subset of individuals from two relatively stable natural environments and compared their patterns of MHC variation to kit foxes adapted to the urban environment in Bakersfield, CA. Every gene (DQA, DQB, and DRB) was polygenic with varying degrees of polymorphism, although DRB alleles translated into a greater number of unique antigen binding sites, and thus greater immune system diversity. Urban and wild populations had similar allelic diversity, and each carried unique alleles. Each of these studies resulted from long-term collaborative efforts from a team of researchers that are working closely with federal, state and private agencies responsible for the protection of the endangered SJKF. The results of our research on patterns of genetic diversity and connectivity are already playing an important role in the design of SJKF conservation and management plans.

TI  - Landscape ecological analysis and assessment in an urbanising environment: Forest birds as biodiversity indicators
AU  - Mortberg, Ulla
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - To achieve a sustainable development, impacts on biodiversity of urbanisation, infrastructure, land use changes and other developments must be considered on a landscape and regional scale. Landscape ecology can provide a conceptual framework for the assessment of consequences of long-term development processes like urbanisation on biodiversity on a landscape scale, and for evaluating the impacts of alternative planning scenarios. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of habitat quality, quantity and connectivity on forest bird diversity in an urban-rural gradient. The purpose of the analyses was to develop knowledge and methods for integrating biodiversity issues in planning and assessments in an urbanising environment, on landscape and regional scales. The study area was situated in and around Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, covering the city centre, suburbs and peri-urban areas. Data on breeding forest birds were collected through bird censuses in an urban-suburban gradient. In order to embrace also the peri-urban areas for a more complete urban-rural gradient, data on two fragmentation-sensitive forest grouse species were obtained through a questionnaire to hunters in the whole study area. Response variables in the analyses were forest bird species richness and diversity, relative species richness and occurrence of single sensitive species like selected sedentary forest birds, including the forest grouse species, and red list species. Habitat quality, quantity and connectivity were analysed using available data on abiotic conditions, including urban disturbances, and vegetation in geographical information systems. In addition, a field study on vegetation structure and composition was performed in a subset of the smaller sample sites. Relationships between the response variables and habitat quality, quantity and connectivity were explored using multivariate statistics. Further, for some models, spatial dependencies were quantified and accounted for. When habitat models were retrieved, they were used for spatial predictions of habitat suitability. They were also applied on future planning scenarios in order to predict and assess the impacts on sensitive species. In the urban-rural gradient, the forest structure and composition changed, so that in more urban areas, coniferous forest on rich soils, wet forests and wetlands became less abundant and more scattered.

TI  - Ecology of coyotes (Canis latrans) in the greater Detroit area of southeastern Michigan
AU  - Dodge, William B., Jr.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Coyote distribution and habitat use, diet and foraging behavior, and space use patterns were investigated in the greater Detroit area of southeastern Michigan. We found evidence of coyotes on 24 of 30 (80%) suburban and 7 of 11 (64%) urban plots. Overall fifty-eight percent of coyote evidence was found within edge habitats, with den sites and tracks the only types of evidence found strictly in interior habitats. Land cover around evidence points included more wooded land cover than expected in suburban areas, suggesting the importance of tree cover for coyote occupancy, and more open space and wooded land cover than expected in urban areas, highlighting their avoidance of heavily populated areas. Coyote diet was assessed through identification of remains of food items recovered in coyote scat. White-tailed deer, eastern cottontail rabbit, and small rodents were the most consumed prey in both urban and suburban areas. Coyote consumption of white-tailed deer biomass was 7.2% greater than expected in suburban areas and 10.0% less than expected in urban areas and the difference was significant (P< 0.004). More white-tailed deer, raccoon, and woodchuck biomass was consumed compared to other studies, likely due to high use of road-kill. In suburban areas, coyote selection for road-killed white-tailed deer was positive regardless of white-tailed deer or rabbit abundance. Coyotes in urban areas used a foraging strategy that incorporated both prey selection and switching, with no strong discernable pattern. Radio-telemetry technology was used to gather relocations of coyotes for analysis of home range and cores areas frequented by coyotes. Smaller home ranges were made up of greater proportions of urban land than natural land cover, although there was variation. Core areas were dominated by relatively large patches of natural land cover and had greater connectivity compared to home range areas. Radio-telemetry data suggested that coyotes were selective in their use of space, avoiding urban land in favor of natural land cover.

TI  - Green Infrastructure and Human Health: Nature Exposure, Attention, and Well-Being
AU  - Jiang, Xiangrong
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The environments we live in play an important role in keeping us ready to face challenges in a competitive, complex, information-rich world. There is growing body of studies showing that having access to nature has positive impacts on people’s attentional functioning, capacity to recover from stressful events and the development of social ties among nearby neighbors. In spite of these findings, many of the studies examining the impact of nature on human health have focused on traditional types of green infrastructure, such as trees and parks. We know little about the effects of other newer types of green infrastructure (e.g. bio-swales) on human health and wellbeing. Moreover, we do not know the extent to which daily variations in exposure to various forms of nature are related to health outcomes. This gap in our knowledge hinders the development of green infrastructure that provides multiple benefits – to human beings and the environment. Identifying the extent to which varying densities of green infrastructure contribute to human health can provide evidence-based guidelines for designer, administrators and other stakeholders.The lack of empirical evidence regarding newer types of green infrastructure and their relationship to human health creates a risk that we missing opportunities to promote public health and protect the environment simultaneously. Green infrastructure is often introduced into urban areas as an efficient and eco-friendly way to manage stormwater and increase bio-diversity. Green spaces that include trees, bioswales, retention wetlands, rain gardens and open green spaces are defined as green infrastructure, which are promising to provide a wide variety of benefits to human living environments. However, we have not accumulated enough evidence regarding the effects of newer types of green infrastructure (e.g. rain gardens and bioswales) on human health and wellbeing. These newer green infrastructure types are important approaches for stormwater management and other ecosystem services, which should not be ignored and cannot be avoided in the development of natural resources in people’s daily living environment. Moreover, most people do not live in completely natural settings. Too many people live with too little exposure to nature on a daily basis. It can be challenging to provide decent access to nature for urban residents. Most of previous findings regarding the health benefits by exposure to green infrastructure have been achieved in laboratory settings or through semi-controlled experiments, which do not reflect the dynamic quantity of people’s exposure to nature in their daily lives. If we do not know the extent to which daily variations in exposure to nature are related to health outcomes, we may risk providing not efficient design of green infrastructure to promote public health. The lack of understanding of various types of green infrastructure and the relationship between daily variations in exposure to nature and health outcomes hinders the development of green infrastructure that can be beneficial to both human well-being and environmental sustainability.In order to fill the gap in our knowledge and promote urban green infrastructure, I have conducted studies to shed a light on the benefits people may get from exposure to different types of green infrastructure, and understand how daily variations of exposure to different forms of nature are associated with health outcomes. This dissertation includes: 1) an experiment examining impacts of different types of green infrastructure on attentional functioning; 2) a study connecting attentional benefits to functional networks in the brain; 3) a survey of the relationship between daily exposure to nature and health outcomes. The objective of the first study was to understand the extent to which three levels of exposure of green infrastructure impact recovery from attentional fatigue. I recruited 43 participants and randomly assigned them to watch one of the three videos that consist of 24 images of urban settings. The only differences among the three videos was the type of green infrastructure featured: one video had no green infrastructure, another had street trees, and the final had street trees and bioswales. I measured participants’ attentional functioning before and after they watched one of the videos and calculated the difference between the before and after attentional tests. Results show a significant difference in the improvement from the first to second attentional test between the group with no green infrastructure compared to the group with trees. The group with trees & bioswales was not significantly different than the other two treatment groups. The purpose of the second study was to clarify the mechanism underlying Attention Restoration Theory and observe the restorative process in action. In this study using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), I connect the previous attentional tests results to functional networks in the brain. I addressed the following questions: 1) What are the neural correlates in the restorative process of exposure to different green infrastructure types? 2) To what extent are the neural correlations consistent with the actual attention scores from participants who viewed different green infrastructure types? Results identify two pairs of functional connectivity. The first significant level of functional connectivity is between the right lateral prefrontal cortex (rlPFC) and the occipital cortex. Post hoc Tukey tests showed that the rlPFC-rMOG1 connectivity was significantly higher in the Trees group compared to the No GI group and the Trees & Bio group. The second significant level of functional connectivity is between the anterior cingular cortex (ACC) and a cluster in the right middle occipital gyrus (rMOG2). Pairwise post hoc tests revealed that the ACC-rMOG2 connectivity in the No GI group is significantly higher than that in the Trees group and in the Trees & Bio group. This is the first study to observe neural correlates associated with exposure to green infrastructure, which provides us supporting evidence for the proposed mechanism of Attention Restoration Theory. The consistency in the results of the attention tests and the observed functional connectivity is consistent with our hypothesis.The purpose of the third study was to measure the daily exposure to nature and examine the extent to which the exposures predict health outcomes. In this study, I addressed the following questions: 1) To what extent are variations in daily exposure to vegetation density (e.g., in neighborhoods, daily destinations, and routes) associated with human health? That is, do higher levels of daily exposure to nature predict better health outcomes? 2) To what extent are variations in exposure to different types of urban nature (e.g. trees, understory vegetation) associated with human health? I used Google Street View images and National Land Cover Dataset 2011 to estimate participants’ daily exposure to nature, and two standard questionnaires (e.g. SF-12 and Perceived Stress Scale) to assess health outcomes. Results show that greater exposure to nature in daily life is associated with better health outcomes. Specifically, higher neighborhood concentrations of tree canopy are related to better physical health, overall health and better capacities to control stress. In contrast, the understory vegetation has a negative relationship with stress and mental health.The most important contribution of this dissertation is to clarify the effects of newer types of green infrastructure (e.g., bioswales) on human health through studies using an experiment and a survey. By combining an experimental study in a controlled setting with a survey without any intervention, results of the three empirical studies broadened our knowledge, verified the Attention Restoration Theory and increased our confidence in the findings. A number of policy and design implications can be derived from this dissertation. Planners, designers and administrators should be aware of the intrinsic and supportive roles urban green infrastructure can play in promoting public health. We should develop policies and designs that respond to people’s needs. Policy makers and public health providers should introduce green infrastructure at every door step and offer nature-based subscription for those in needs.

AB  - As linhas de água são sistemas de drenagem natural e elementos integrantes da paisagem. A presença permanente ou temporária de água origina um desenvolvimento de sistemas bióticos de grande diversidade e riqueza, com grande interesse em conservar. É na proteção dos espaços próximos de água que maiores proveitos se conseguem obter para a saúde humana e para a própria saúde da vegetação e da vida animal, e ainda no contributo para uma maior qualidade do ar, da água e do clima em geral.Ao longo da história, o Homem tentou desde sempre tirar o máximo partido da utilização, mais ou menos intensa, dos recursos e vantagens oferecidas pela proximidade aos cursos de água. Porém, uso intensivo e abusivo destes recursos conduziu à degradação dos ecossistemas ribeirinhos levando a uma destruição dos sistemas de drenagem natural sobretudo em áreas urbanas, destruição da flora, poluição difusa devido à utilização de fertilizantes e pesticidas na agricultura, bem como o lançamento de efluentes domésticos e industriais. Face à importância dos recursos hídricos, surge então a necessidade de os reabilitar.Neste contexto, pretende-se com esta dissertação elaborar uma proposta ao nível da bacia hidrográfica do rio Coina, no âmbito do ordenamento do território, abordando alguns conceitos fundamentais relacionados com a reabilitação de rios e ribeiras com vista à valorização das linhas de água e galerias ribeirinhas, contribuindo para o melhoramento do ambiente, da qualidade de vida e segurança em meio urbano. Serão propostas medidas que levem a uma melhor consolidação das margens e proteção contra a erosão, a uma melhoria da drenagem e funcionalidade da corrente, a uma maior manutenção da diversidade, conservação da flora e consequentemente da fauna, bem como à minimização da artificialização das margens. Com isto, pretende-se contribuir para o desenvolvimento sustentável do ecossistema indo ao encontro do equilíbrio da vida

TI  - A study on the landscape characters of the vegetation in Baiyunshan scenic sports
AU  - Wang, Hua Yong
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Baiyunshan, the biggest urban forest in Guangzhou, plays an important role in pro-moting urban sustainabIe development, and in improving urban environment. Based on the digitized map of vegetation in Baiyunshan scenic spots, the vegetational landscape charac-teristics in Baiyunshan including landscape pattern and spatial heterogeneity were studied systematically after achieving the perimeters and areas of the patches of all the landscape elements by using graphics interchange software.According to the physiognomy of the vegetationaI communities, five landscape ele-ment types, i.e. evergreen coniferous forest, evergreen coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest, evergreen broad-leaved forest, meadows with sparse trees and orchard were classi-fied by using vegetional approach of land attribute classification in landscape ecology then on basis of the upper layer tree's life form of vegetionaI landscape, 29 patch types were di-vided. The total area in Baiyunshan is 32.2658 km~2, and the total perimeter is 428.9047 km,There were 200 patches in the studied region, and the largest one was 3.3250 km~2, which was 1583 times of the smallest one (0.0021km~2), and the longest one was 26.8472km,which was 118 times of the shortest one (0.2269km). This showed that the difference of patch areas and perimeters were very large. Vegetaional landscape dominates in the vegeta tional landscape of Baiyunshan absolutely, the total areas and total perimeters of the vegeta-tional landscape patches are 77.58 percent and 75.02 percent of the whole landscape of Baiyunshan, respectively, with the biggest patch number (64) and the largest total patch area (12.7l97km~2). Shape indices, including fractal dimension (1.34), shape index (21.30) and elongation index (75.51) of the Baiyunshan landscape were higher than those of all the landscape elements and all the patch types. The shapes of all the patches were regular in the area, and the difference of patches in the same types was very small, and selfsimilarity was obvious. The vegetational landscape in the area studied is grain landscape now; the grain structure indicated the pattern of more small patches and less big ones in number, and the pattern of evenness in area. Shannon-Wiener index of evergreen coniferous forest, evergreen coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest, evergreen broad-leaved forest, others and total landscape were 0.771, 0.654, 4.085, 0.484, 4.019, respectively; Simpson index were 0.350, 0.269, 0.923, 0.188, 0.904, ecological dominance were 0.229, 0.346, 0.439, 0.5l6,0.835. The landscape diversity index of the evergreen broad-leaved forest type was highest,whose patch types were rich, and the differences in patch area were distinct. The intensity of human activities was even in the studied region and the degree of the landscape frag-mentation is little. The evergreen broad-leaved forest type had the smallest fragmentation.Its patch density is 5.032 .km~(-2), the patch area per area is 0.394km~2 .km~(-2), the patch number in landscape total area is 1.984 .km~(-2). The landscape heterogeneity of the landscape element types in Baiyunshan was analyzed using linear sampling method of informatics. Resultsshowed that the whole landscape heterogeneity was rich, and had close affinity with the spatial distribution of the landscape elements and patch types. Evergreen broad-leaved for-est type was characterized by highest relative frequency and even information content,showing a highest heterogeneous spatial pattern, which is the matrix of the whole landscape,and plays a decisive role in improving the landscape structures and ecological changes in Baiyunshan. The effect and function of the corridor, the relation between landscape and scale, and the dynamics of the vegetational patches in Baiyunshan were also discussed. This study can provide systematic information and a theoretical basis for the sustainable utiliza-tion and exploitation of the vegetational landscape resources in Baiyunshan scenic spots.

TI  - Evaluating the Benefits, Sustainability, and Resilience of Green Infrastructure on a Sustainable Residential Home
AU  - Thompson, Rhea
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - With global populations becoming increasingly urbanized, green infrastructure (GI) is progressively being recognized as a sustainable approach to mitigating urban environmental problems. Unlike traditional ‘hard’ engineering approaches that historically viewed problems in isolation and solutions in singular terms, implementation of GI promises some deferment from the effects of urbanization by providing a multitude of benefits such as reduced stormwater runoff and flooding, decreased heat waves, and enlivened local environments and ecological habitats. These benefits are important considering many cities are projected to be more vulnerable to the effects of urbanization with climate change, especially as the vast amount of the global population lives in coastal urban environments. However, the diversity of GI benefits has not been fully characterized, and they are increasingly applied in residential settings. Furthermore, current research has not fully explored the beneficial role of GI in achieving sustainable and resilient communities. Using an Integrated Water: Energy Monitoring System measuring meteorological, water, and energy fluxes over two years (July 2014–June 2016) on a sustainable home in Rockville, Maryland, U.S., the following objectives were explored: (1) Examined how a sloped modular extensive green roof, constructed wetland and bioretention designed in-series affected site hydrology. Furthermore, we studied the effect of season, antecedent substrate water content, storm characteristics (size, intensity, frequency), and vegetation development (green roof only) on hydrological performance. (2) Characterized the seasonal thermal performance of the green roof (to the building and surrounding environment) relative to the cool roof. Evaluated how green roof thermal performance related to evapotranspiration, solar reflectance (albedo) and thermal conductance (U-value). Additionally, the effect of substrate water content, vegetation development, and microclimate on evapotranspiration, albedo and U-values was assessed. (3) Green roof evapotranspiration was measured and compared to values predicted with the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith model. Furthermore, the effects of substrate water content, vegetation characteristics and microclimate on evapotranspiration rates was also evaluated. (4) Finally, using emergy  theory, GI sustainability and resilience relative to a gray wastewater system and natural forest was explored.

TI  - Dispersal Effects on Species Distribution and Diversity across Multiple Scales in the Southern Appalachian Mixed Mesophytic Flora
AU  - Tessel, Samantha M.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Seed and spore dispersal play important roles in the spatial distribution of plant species and communities. Though dispersal processes are often thought to be more important at larger spatial scales, the distribution patterns of species and plant communities even at small scales can be determined, at least in part, by dispersal. I studied the influence of dispersal in southern Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests by categorizing species by dispersal morphology and by using spatial pattern and habitat connectivity as predictors of species distribution and community composition. All vascular plant species were recorded at three nested sample scales (10000, 1000, and 100 m2), on plots with varying levels of habitat connectivity across the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Models predicting species distributions generally had higher predictive power when incorporating spatial pattern and connectivity, particularly at small scales. Despite wide variation in performance, models of locally dispersing species (species without adaptations to dispersal by wind or vertebrates) were most frequently improved by the addition of spatial predictors. Patterns in plant communities were also compared among dispersal categories, and though it was shown that species without dispersal adaptations were less likely to co-occur, this was more likely to be caused by differences in frequency across dispersal categories than by dispersal limitation per se. Spatial pattern, distance, and connectivity were significant predictors of non-random patterns of species turnover at all scales and were stronger among dispersal-limited species groups. Species with limited dispersal were also less frequent at all three sampling scales than those with adaptations for vertebrate dispersal and had smaller geographic ranges than either wind- or vertebrate-dispersed species. Species with no dispersal adaptations were overrepresented among southern Appalachian endemics and lineages endemic to North America, whereas species dispersed by vertebrates were overrepresented among Tertiary disjunct lineages, and species dispersed by spores were cosmopolitan. Relationships among dispersal and biogeographic affinity reflect the evolutionary history of the mixed mesophytic flora owing to adaptation of dispersal mechanisms to regional environmental conditions, the relative ages of lineages, and the effect of dispersal mechanism on the distributions of plants across time and space.

TI  - Niche Shifts, Species Distributions, and Genetic Diversity in Gymnophthalminae Lizards, with a Focus on Microclimates and Thermophysiology
AU  - Strangas, Maria Louisa
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The environmental niche is a central organizing concept in the study of ecology and evolution, as the environmental conditions in which species can persist (their fundamental niches) and the conditions in which they occur (their realized niches) can shape spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity at multiple scales. How organisms at different levels of biological organization are affected by environmental heterogeneity has consequences for the distribution of genetic and phenotypic diversity, yet the mechanisms through which this occurs are poorly studied. In this dissertation, I present three research chapters that explore how species’ traits and their microclimatic environments shape biodiversity patterns across geographic space and throughout evolutionary time. I focused on a group of Neotropical lizards distributed throughout Central and South America, the Gymnophthalminae clade of the Gymnophthalmidae family. First, I described spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity in the Gymnophthalminae clade of Gymnophthalmidae lizards. By combining custom exon capture genetic data with environmental data, I found that the use of ecologically-informed microclimatic environmental variables uncovered more complex patterns of niche shifts throughout the history of this group than did more commonly used macroclimatic variables. Second, I explored the ecological mechanisms that shape species distributions for three montane species that occupy the Atlantic Forests of Brazil. To ask whether the physiological traits that delimit the species’ fundamental niches explain their present-day range limits, I created spatial models of thermophysiological suitability across the Atlantic Forest of Brazil for three species. I found that thermophysiological constraints in the warm edge of the distribution, while commonly inferred to drive range contractions and expansions in this system, do not restrict the ranges of these species to high elevations. Third, I investigated the ecological mechanisms through which species’ phenotypic traits interact with microclimatic conditions, resulting in the generation of genetic and genomic diversity in the cold edge of a species range. I found evidence that divergence in isolation has been an important driver of evolution in this system. In particular, poor thermophysiological performance in cool environments best predicted intraspecific patterns of genetic diversity. Common to all chapters is the use of novel, integrative approaches tied to empirical studies to investigate the many different ways environmental heterogeneity and species’ environmental niches shape species distributions and genetic diversity.

TI  - Factors affecting the diversity and abundance of roadside invertebrates and plants in urban areas
AU  - Jones, Elizabeth Louise
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - With increasing human populations and a rise in people migrating to urban areas there will be a corresponding rise in urbanisation across the globe. Urban green spaces are therefore becoming increasingly important for biodiversity as reserves and movement corridors. This thesis aimed to understand the impacts of traffic and environmental related factors on the ability of green space to be wildlife reserves using the town of Bracknell, Berkshire, UK, as a model urban area. Concentrations of NO2 declined with distance from the road but urban green spaces showed many exceedances of NO2 and NOx critical levels. There were decreases in soil moisture and total C and N at the road edge but increases in soil pH, C:N, titanium, chromium, nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium and lead. Some protection of urban green spaces from the road could be achieved with the use of tree shelterbelts. It was found that roads had a significant affect on plant communities; with more bare ground, moss, herbs and stress-tolerator species and less grass and competitive species near to the road edge. These changes are related to differences in the environmental conditions at the roadside. Carabid species richness, abundance and diversity and invertebrate abundance and plant diversity were all higher at the road edge than the site centres, indicating that these groups are able to take advantage of the road edge habitat. Overall, sites with decreased mowing had more invertebrates and the bioindicators carabids and woodlice. Reducing mowing frequency therefore provides a simple method to improve urban green spaces for biodiversity. Furthermore, older and larger sites had greater biodiversity. This thesis has demonstrated that environmental and traffic related factors have significant effects on urban biodiversity. There are methods which could be employed, however, to lessen these impacts to allow urban green space to act as effective wildlife reserves.

TI  - The importance of biodiversity in private gardens relative to public green spaces and the synergistic effects of garden connectivity
AU  - Sperling, Corinne D.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urban ecology, or the study of relationships among plants, animals and humans in cities, is an interdisciplinary science. It integrates issues of environmental concern, for example, biodiversity and ecological health, with the practices of a sample of urban dwellers. Private backgardens and public urban green spaces (parkettes) in the Greater Toronto Area were sampled and compared with respect to plant diversity and environmental heterogeneity. With a greater number of microhabitats and higher plant species richness than public parkettes, private backgardens were found to be remarkable hotspots of biodiversity and environmental heterogeneity. A backgarden microcosm experiment looked at the interaction of structural features of backgardens and the incidental recruitment of invertebrates, seeds, and plants. These small supplements of space served as habitats for recruitment of plants and seeds as it was determined that invertebrate abundance and diversity, incidental seed recruitment and above-ground vegetation growth were enhanced regardless of soil or grass substrate treatment in microcosms. Backgarden characteristics, specifically the number of woody plants (trees and shrubs) and the number of plant species significantly predicted seed recruitment and winged invertebrate visitation, respectively, to microcosms. Lastly, a spatial analysis evaluated local and regional green space composition and heterogeneity of the urban landscape. Nearly 74% of the Greater Toronto Area is comprised of green space, however, more than 50% is made up of low vegetation (i.e., grass and herbaceous ground cover). Approximately 8% of the urban landscape was appraised as private backgardens; 6% of the urban landscape, conservatively, was estimated as backgarden green space. The percent green space composition of backgardens differed between neighbourhoods, and based on different human population densities, while neighbours were found to be statistically similar in their backgarden percent green space composition. This research study thus promotes citizen science and ecological practices within backgardens to enhance urban biodiversity and regional green space connectivity.

TI  - Butterfly conservation in fragmented landscapes
AU  - Leidner, Allison Kara
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Human activities disturb and fragment many natural areas, thereby altering the way in which species interact with their landscape. In natural settings, species often evolved to disperse through areas unsuitable for habitation, but in a world dominated by human-modified landscapes, species face novel features that may disrupt their movement, increasing the isolation of populations. Consequently, there is a pressing need to understand if animals can persist in small natural areas separated by agricultural or urban development. The way in which species respond to fragmentation will inform if conservation actions are necessary to protect a species and what strategies might mitigate the consequences of fragmentation. My dissertation addresses these conservation problems using two studies of butterflies in fragmented landscapes. First, I used a novel synthesis of behavioral, mark-recapture, and population genetic studies to identify the effects of urban fragmentation on a rare butterfly. I present the synthesis in the context of a butterfly endemic to barrier islands in North Carolina, Atrytonopsis new species 1. Atrytonopsis  sp1 occupies sand dune habitat, which in this region has largely been converted to residential and commercial development. Many studies rely on a single method to measure movement, but combining methods may help elucidate the effects of natural or anthropogenic fragmentation. To test edge permeability, I conducted butterfly releases at four edge types: sand dune - beach, sand dune - maritime forest/shrub, sand dune - urbanization, and beach - ocean. I then used mark-recapture to compare Atrytonopsis sp1 movement rates in continuous sand dune habitat and between habitat patches separated by urban areas. Finally, I conducted a range-wide population genetic study to assess if there was significant population structure across the range of  Atrytonopsis sp1, and to determine how the structure was partitioned relative to natural barriers and urbanization. All three studies independently indicate that natural features, not urbanization, are barriers to Atrytonopsis sp1 movement. Analyzed separately, each study would point to the same general conclusion, but could result in different conservation recommendations. Both linear corridors and stepping-stones are conservation strategies that can increase connectivity of fragmented landscapes. For stepping stones to work, however, Atrytonopsis sp1 must be willing to enter the matrix, successfully find new habitat, and integrate its genes into the new population. The edge behavior studies indicate that  Atrytonopsis sp1 will fly into urban areas, and the mark-recapture studies confirm that it can successfully disperse over short distances. The population genetic studies indicate that longer distances of urbanization are not intrinsically barriers to movement. Consequently, I recommend conservation strategies that focus on preserving stepping stones, rather than on habitat corridors. In a separate study, I examined the effects of habitat fragmentation on tropical butterfly communities. Habitat fragmentation is a major driver of biodiversity loss, but its effects may be obscured by the ways in which different species respond to fragmentation. One reason that species display varying responses to fragmentation may be that variability itself is an effect of fragmentation. I tested whether forest fragmentation causes long-term hyperdynamism in butterfly communities, a taxon that naturally displays large variations in species richness and community composition. Using an 11-year dataset from an experimentally fragmented landscape in the central Amazon, I evaluated the effect of fragmentation on changes in species richness and community composition through time. Butterfly species richness did not differ between fragmented forest and intact forest. However, spatial and temporal patterns of butterfly species richness in fragmented forests were significantly more variable than in intact forest. Fragmented forest had a significantly lower proportion of understory shade species and a significantly higher proportion of edge species. I conclude that fragmentation fundamentally alters the natural dynamics of butterfly communities.

TI  - A complex systems approach to dynamic spatial simulation modeling: LandUse and LandCover change in the Ecuadorian Amazon
AU  - Messina, Joseph Paul
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The Ecuadorian Amazon, lying in the headwaters of the Napo and Aguarico River valleys, is experiencing rapid change in LandUse and LandCover (LULC) conditions and regional landscape diversity uniquely tied to spontaneous agricultural colonization and oil exploration. Beginning in the early 1970s, spontaneous colonization occurred on squattered lands located adjacent to oil company roads and in government development sectors composed of multiple 50 ha land parcels organized into “piano key” shaped family farms or fincas. Since  fincas are managed at the household level as spatially discrete, temporally independent units, land conversion at the finca-level is recognized as the chief proximate cause of deforestation within the region. Focusing on the spatial and temporal dynamics of deforestation, agricultural extensification, and plant succession at the finca-level, and urbanization at the community-level, cell-based morphogenetic models of LandUse and LandCover Change (LULCC) were developed as the foundation for predictive models of regional LULCC dynamics and landscape diversity. Two cellular automata models were developed and used to integrate biophysical, geographical, and social variables to characterize temporally dynamic landscapes. The human, geographical, and biophysical dimensions of land use and land cover change were examined, specifically deforestation, anthropogenic extensification, and reforestation. Remotely-sensed data ranging temporally from the 1970s through 1999, combined with thematic map coverages of biophysical gradients and geographical accessibility, were linked to household and community survey data collected in 1990 and 1999. Image processing techniques for LULC characterization and spatial analyses of landscape structure were used to assess the rate and nature of LULCC throughout the time-series. In addition, LULC and LULCC associated with secondary plant succession and agricultural extensification were assessed and simulated for specific landscape strata and study area locations related to development corridors along transportation networks and expanding urban environments. The presented research combines household survey data with biophysical and geographical data through a spatio-temporal modeling context that links complexity theory and landscape ecology to a GIS and remote sensing analytical framework to increase the understanding of landscape dynamics across time, space, and landscape strata.

TI  - Temporal, Spatial, and Environmental Influences on the Demographics and Harvest Vulnerability of American Black Bears (Ursus americanus ) in Urban Habitats in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia
AU  - Tri, Andrew
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - To date, no research studies in the eastern United States have addressed the spatial ecology of black bears (Ursus americanus) in urban and suburban habitats, and there is limited information regarding black bear space use, habitat selection, and harvest vulnerability. I assessed the harvest vulnerability, home range size, and spatial ecology of black bears in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia in collaboration with the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife, Pennsylvania Game Commission, and the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources. The major objectives of my study were to identify and quantitatively assess: (1) if black bears shift home ranges seasonally with respect to urban/suburban habitats; (2) harvest vulnerability and cause-specific mortality of black bears in urban/suburban habitats; (3) if black bears captured as result of nuisance complaints are transient or reside in urban/suburban habitats; (4) habitat characteristics of movement corridors utilized by black bears in urban/suburban habitats; and (5) if corridors likely to be used by black bears accessing urban/suburban environments can be predicted by habitat modeling. Over the course of the study (2010-2012), agency employees trapped, handled, and fit 119 bears with GPS-GSM collars. Individual study areas in each state were centered around West Milford, Stillwater/Branchville, and Vernon, NJ; Johnstown, Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, and State College, PA; Beckley, Charleston, and Morgantown, WV. A total of 57,816 bear locations were recorded in New Jersey, 114,451 locations were recorded in Pennsylvania, and 33,217 in West Virginia. Black bears shifted spatial distribution on the landscape in response to resource availability, and consequently I expected bears in urban areas to shift their home ranges seasonally in urban environments. On average, bears were most often found near city limits (<5 km). Home range centers of male bears were twice as far from city limits as female bears (2.31 km vs. 0.91 km, respectively). Bear home range size did not differ among seasons, but did differ between sexes (male home ranges were 5.6 times larger than female bears) and among study areas. Bears did not shift their home ranges closer to urban areas during times of food shortage (spring or late fall). Urban bears lived near town and were resident to the edge of the urban area, but this distance varied with the study area in which they resided. As a result, managers seeking to understand where potential bear conflicts may occur should focus their efforts on the edge of urban and suburban areas (known as the exurban areas) in the Mid-Atlantic Region. Regulated harvests have reduced mortality and allowed black bear populations to increase throughout the eastern United States over the past 30 years. This rapid and dramatic recovery in population size has led to increased human-bear interactions in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Harvest vulnerability of black bears is dependent on a variety of factors and therefore difficult to estimate. I measured harvest vulnerability by generating maximum entropy (Maxent) models of bear occurrence during the prehunting period and hunting season for each study area. I used Maxent to generate models of bear occurrence. In all but one study area, black bear occurrence was 5-75% less in the hunting season than in the prehunting period. Bear occurrence decreased from prehunting period to hunting season in both public hunting lands and urban areas. Bear occurrence probability shifted from public hunting areas to the periphery of the public hunting areas between the prehunting period and hunting season. Annual harvest rates of urban bears were highest in Pennsylvania (20.2%) and lower in New Jersey (5.9%) and West Virginia (17.3%). Despite the short timeframe (3 years) of my study, regulated hunting was effective in killing urban black bears Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Hunters in Pennsylvania harvested a similar proportion of urban bears to the long-term harvest rate of all bears in the state (20.2% vs. 20.0%, respectively). Probability of urban bear occurrence shifted from public hunting areas during the prehunting period to private lands on the periphery of urban areas during the hunting season. Average overall mortality rates of urban bears were highest in Pennsylvania (28.1%) and lower in West Virginia (17.5%) and New Jersey (15.1%). Despite the short timeframe of the study, regulated hunting was effective in killing a high number of urban black bears in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, when all mortality sources were taken into account.  Black bear populations have increased nationwide over the past 4 decades due to reduction in direct mortality. Bear population sizes have increased over time and as a result, human-bear conflicts have increased. I sought to determine whether nuisance bears in urban/suburban areas are residents to the area or transient. I predicted that the majority of bears found in urban/suburban areas form resident populations on the urban perimeter, rather than transient individuals that leave the core forests and enter the urban areas periodically. There was considerable support for my prediction that bear populations in urban areas are resident and spend much of their time on the city's edge. Black bears used private lands on the periphery of urban areas. I posit that this may have been because these areas likely had abundant food and provided reduced risk of disturbance (e.g., hunting, human disturbance).  Given the recent explosive increase in urban bear populations, managers are charged to determine which areas of urban/suburban centers are likely to be used by bears. It is unknown whether black bears use travel corridors within urban/suburban matrix to travel between habitat patches. There exists a paucity of information on how black bears use urban and suburban habitats. We used boosted regression trees to create two predictive models of bear occurrence in urban and suburban habitats for (1) New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and (2) West Virginia. We separated West Virginia from New Jersey and Pennsylvania in the modeling process because West Virginia's topography is more rugged and the population density of people was the lowest of all three states. We randomly selected a subset of 40,000 bear locations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, as well as, 30,000 bear locations in West Virginia from the full database of locations. We generated 40,000 random points within the study areas in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and 30,000 random points within the study areas of West Virginia. We built three models (1) for New Jersey and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, PA, (2) State College and Johnstown, PA, and (3) West Virginia. We found that probability of bear occurrence was highest in New Jersey and Scranton/Wilkes-Barre study areas when bears were: (1) <1 km from edge forest, (2) <7.5 km from the nearest road, (3) <7.5 km from the nearest urban area, (4) land use/ land cover was forested, (5) <12 km from public land, and (6) NDVI < 0.3. We found that probability of bear occurrence was highest in Johnstown and State College study areas when bears were: (1) <1 km from edge forest, (2) <1 km from the nearest road, (3) <7 km from the nearest urban area, and (4) <7 km from public land. The highest probability of bear occurrence in West Virginia occurred when (1) NDVI was >0.6, (2) distance to public land was >22.0 km, (3) distance to urban areas was between 1-5 km, (3) topographic position index was >100 (steep, rugged terrain), (4) land use land cover was forested or "other", (5) distance to roads was >1.4 km, and (6) distance to core forest was >1.5 km. We found no support for our prediction that urban bears use corridors. Bears spent nearly 95% of their time on the edge of city limits and <5% of their time within city limits. We found no evidence that habitat quality on the edge of city limits was lower than that of "non-urban" bear habitat. There is likely not a physiological need for bears to traverse urban areas when they can remain in habitats where they would encounter less human disturbance. I found no support for my prediction that bears use corridors. Bears spent nearly 95% of their time on the edge of city limits and <5% of their time within city limits. I had no evidence that habitat quality on the edge of city limits was lower than that of non-urban bear habitat. There likely was no physiological need for bears to traverse urban areas because urban habitat patches are often safe from human disturbance and therefore, they did not use corridors. The final predictive model of the probability of bear occurrence will assist managers by identifying areas where urban bears are most likely to live and areas that require direct management actions.

TI  - The effects of urbanization on the behavior, distribution, and conservation of forest birds
AU  - Minor, Emily Stuart
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urbanization is occurring rapidly around the world, but ecologists are just beginning to realize the effects on birds and other wildlife. This dissertation has two major goals: (1) to document some of the effects of human development on bird distributions and movement in the North Carolina Piedmont, and (2) to test and develop graph theory as a tool that can be used for habitat assessment and conservation in fragmented habitats. These issues are critical to explaining and predicting bird occurrences in today's landscapes and are important for both basic ecological research and management. The first portion of this dissertation uses empirical data collected from 272 point counts to quantify the effects of urbanization on forest songbirds. Initial results indicate that avian community composition varies across the study area with urban land cover and road density. However, an in-depth examination of the effects of roads on species abundance revealed that the importance of roads is simply an artifact of the vegetation and land cover changes that typically accompany them rather than a direct effect of the roads themselves. A final analysis of the field data considered the importance of roads and other land cover classes to bird movement in fragmented landscapes. Using alternative representations of bird dispersal behavior to predict species abundance, I showed that forest interior birds experience high dispersal cost through non-forest habitat but no cost of dispersing over roads. The second portion of this dissertation presents graph theory as a tool for understanding bird movement, distribution, and conservation in fragmented landscapes. I compare the performance of graph theory to a more computationallyand data-intense spatially explicit population model (SEPM) in selecting important habitat patches for conservation, and show that graph theory makes very similar predictions in some cases and in other cases offers insight not available from the SEPM. In addition, I use graph theory to make inferences about movement, disturbance, and conservation strategies across the entire study area, concluding that the study area displays an intermediate level of connectivity and should be fairly resilient to development and disturbance.

TI  - The Impact of Urban Forest Corridors on the Richness of Urban Bird Populations in Baltimore Forest Patches
AU  - Shobe, Beatriz Bridget Manon
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Chapter one reviews what is known about animal movement patterns in an urban ecology context and how that knowledge is obtained. Several of the analytical programs used to assess movement are examined as well as strategies and technologies on gathering empirical movement data. Dominant paradigms used in understanding movement patterns across heterogenous urban habitat patches are also examined and evaluated. Chapter two then examines movement directly by assessing fragmented urban forested areas, including urban forested corridors, connected forested patches, and isolated forested patches. We attempt to assess connectivity from a species perspective and document the way in which species interact with heterogeneous urban landscape matrices. Urban corridors across Baltimore City are closely examined throughout the Summer of 2020. Using point counts and vegetation data, the effects of corridors on bird species richness are analyzed. I found that corridors contribute to urban biodiversity by providing habitat as well as mitigating the effects of nearby impervious surfaces associated with urban development.

TI  - Southeastern Fox Squirrel (Sciurus Niger Niger) Occurrence Throughout the Piedmont and Coastal Plain of North Carolina
AU  - Voorhis, Moriah Van
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Once widely distributed, the southeastern fox squirrel’s (Sciurus niger niger) populations have been gradually declining over the past 100 years (Amspacher et al. 2019, Carraway et al. 2017, Wiegel et al. 1989). These declining populations raise conservation concern as southeastern fox squirrels are an ecologically important disperser of longleaf pine seeds and beneficial fungi (Greene and McCleery 2017). Remaining populations of southeastern fox squirrels are suspected to be disconnected from one another as there are isolated patches of suitable habitat containing no southeastern fox squirrels (Carraway et al. 2017). This raises concerns for population resiliency. Habitat fragments that are connected by dispersal will possess a greater overall population and exhibit more resilience to habitat disturbance (Opdam 1991). Hence, the uninhabited patches are indicative of the population decline and indicate uncertainty regarding southeastern fox squirrel habitat range and connectivity in the region (Carraway et al. 2017). The southeastern fox squirrel is a subspecies of fox squirrel that occurs throughout the Piedmont and Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States and has historically been tied to a habitat of firemaintained longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest (Amspacher et al. 2019, Carraway et al. 2017) (Figure 1). Pine species appear to be a necessary component of their habitat as pine seeds account for 27.6% of the southeastern fox squirrels’ diet in the fall and 39.4% of their diet in the winter (Lee et al. 2001). Further, the large size of the southeastern fox squirrel is advantageous in the longleaf pine due to the aide the size provides in handling pinecones (Weigel et al. 1989, Prince et al. 2016). Evidence for declining southeastern fox squirrel populations consists of decreasing estimates of population densities, decreases in hunter harvest reports, and anecdotal observations (Green and McCleery 2017, Wiegel et al.1989). The reason for the widespread population declines of southeastern fox squirrels is believed to be the destruction and fragmentation of habitat through fire suppression and land conversion (Lee et al. 2008, Koprowski 2005, Brudvig et al. 2015). Habitat loss and fragmentation has caused population decline in multiple species associated with the longleaf pine ecosystem (Carraway et al. 2017, Frost 1993, Weigel et al. 1989, Perkins and Conner 2004). Destruction and fragmentation of habitat through fire suppression and land conversion reduces overall quantity of habitat on the landscape and decreases connectivity by increasing isolation and distances over which southeastern fox squirrels must travel in search of resources (Winiarski et al. 2017).The longleaf pine ecosystem evolved a characteristic open canopy with a shifting mosaic of woodlands and grassy savannah understory that is maintained through frequent fire originated by lightning and intentional fires started by Native Americans (Engstrom 1993, Van Lear et al. 2005). This frequent fire regime of one-to-three-year burns is critical to sustain the biodiversity of the longleaf pine ecosystem (Mitchell et al. 2006, Van Lear 2005). Additionally, the frequent fire regimes prevent invasion and replacement of less fire-adapted species (Ware et al. 1993, Engstrom et al. 2001, Carroll et al. 2002, Van Lear et al. 2005). In areas of fire suppression or exclusion, hardwood encroachment and secondary regeneration create a dense understory, depriving the southeastern fox squirrel of resources and maneuverability, rendering former habitat no longer suitable (Florida FW, Wiegel 1989). Forest fragmentation and changes in land use have contributed to fire suppression throughout the southeast, with fire often excluded for decades (Frost 1993, Van Lear et al. 2005, Obrien et al. 2010).

TI  - Genetic Connectivity of Stream Salamanders in Urban, Suburban, and Rural Habitats
AU  - Fusco, Nicole A.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Ongoing human population growth and increased urban development around the world is inflicting new pressures and challenges for wildlife living within areas affected by urbanization. Habitat alteration can have severe consequences for native species that remain in previously undisturbed areas. Urban development has shown to reduce abundance and density of populations and create barriers to gene flow for stream salamanders in urban areas. Although they are still relatively common and abundant through the Northeast, Northern two-lined salamander (Eurycea bislineata) populations are declining in urban habitats including in New York City. In this study, I explored genetic structure of E. bislineata across an urban, suburban and rural habitat to better understand how urbanization is affecting genetic connectivity between headwater streams. Next, I investigated what environmental and/or urban features influence gene flow patterns in E. bislineata across these same three habitats using landscape genetic methods. Lastly, I used environmental DNA monitoring with metabarcoding techniques to explore stream salamander presence on an urban-to-rural gradient and to investigate overall vertebrate species richness differences to further understand how urban development may be affecting biodiversity in urban aquatic ecosystems.E. bislineata within the urban habitat had greater genetic structure, yet exhibited comparable genetic diversity levels to individuals in the suburban and rural habitat. A mixture of terrestrial variables influence gene flow in the urban habitat, percent canopy cover is most influential for gene flow in the suburban habitat, and variation in aquatic variables affects gene flow patterns for rural stream salamanders. Urbanization factors were identified as the second most important features affecting genetic variation for salamanders in the suburban and urban habitats. Finally, using eDNA from stream water, I found that E. bislineata is present in streams across a gradient of urban development, while another common stream salamander species, Desmognathus fuscus was only detected in more non-urban habitats. With this method, I also detected differences in species composition in urban versus non-urban habitats, mostly due to more non-native species eDNA detected in more urbanized streams. This dissertation provides further understanding of how urbanization affects the evolution of a native amphibian species and how urban development affects stream salamander distribution in the NYC metropolitan area. This information will inform conservation efforts and urban planning in cities that want to promote longevity of populations of this indicator species in our urban ecosystems.

TI  - The effect of urbanisation on plant diversity: Comparative case studies in Bolton, UK and Sofia, Bulgaria
AU  - Terziyski, Georgi Dimitrov
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - In the last few decades the importance of urban green space in terms of biodiversity conservation and sustainable development has been widely recognised. The planning decisions about urban green space, however, have been based mostly on two factors. Green areas that are perceived as more natural are generally seen as more valuable than those, like playing fields, which are heavily managed. The second factor is the degree of isolation; green spaces, which link together to form 'green corridors', are expected to be more valuable. One might also expect green spaces located within less built-up residential areas to be of higher quality than those within dense housing. This study investigated the relative importance of three factors on the plant diversity of urban green spaces in two case study areas: Bolton, UK and Sofia, Bulgaria. These were the position of the green spaces relative to housing of different densities; the type of green spaces, and level of management to which they had been subjected; and the effects of the size of the green space and whether they were connected to others. First, three residential morphology types (high, medium and low density) were delineated from maps and high-quality aerial photographs using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) software. The interpretation of aerial photographs showed that high density housing covers 18.0%, medium density 60% and low density 22% of the overall residential areas in Bolton. In Sofia the largest proportion was made up of low density housing (46%), followed by medium density (43%) and high density (11%). A set of 24 sampling plots positioned within the residential green spaces were selected in each of the case study areas. The focus of the study was the herbaceous component of grasslands. The four studied green space types were: parks and recreational gardens, playing fields (in Sofia substituted by roadside verges), derelict areas, and remnants of semi-natural vegetation. These green spaces could be grouped into two categories of management: managed and unmanaged. Overall 174 species of herbaceous angiosperms were identified in Bolton and 246 in Sofia. There were significant differences between the mean species numbers identified in the three housing densities in both case study areas. Least species rich were the green spaces within the high density residential areas. Most species were found in the medium density in Bolton and within the low density in Sofia. There were also differences between the types of green spaces. The most species were found in semi-natural remnants of vegetation and derelict areas. The managed green spaces were less species rich compared with unmanaged ones in both case study areas. A positive correlation was observed between the size of the green space and number of species in Bolton, but in Sofia, the lack of aerial photographs made this test impossible. The connectivity between the green spaces did not, however, correlate with their species richness. In conclusion, these results suggest that the size, management method, type and position within particular residential type are the important factors which determine plant diversity in urban areas. Connectivity between green spaces does not seem to affect diversity. Therefore, the negative effects of urbanisation may best be mitigated by better management of existing urban green space. The results also suggest, albeit tentatively, that the concept of the green corridor may not be that important for maintaining urban plant diversity. Further studies will continue to determine the effect of patch size and isolation on plant diversity.

TI  - Wildlife Crossing Over Route 101 and the Benefits and Challenges it Presents
AU  - Moinuddin, Sheik
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Biodiversity across the world is in decline due to population increases as well as urban development. Subsequently, fragmentations of the landscape and habitat loss are occurring. Globally, only twenty-one biodiversity hotspots remain, and nowhere is the risk more severe than in Southern California. In countering these threats, it has become necessary to connect all available open lands in Southern California to create a network for wildlife movement. Such an interconnected set of reserves will allow natural ecological processes to continue and thrive, as they have for centuries. Thus, researchers in the field identified the Santa Monica – Sierra Madre Connection as the highest priority linkages to conserve, which would provide miles of roaming ground to a wide variety of animals, ranging from shrews to mountain lions. Mammals, especially mountain lions, require a large area for hunting and to thrive genetically. However, this once-contiguous mountain range stretching from Santa Monica to Sierra Madre was severed in the early 1970s by the construction of the US-101 Freeway, dividing the habitat range into isolated habitat fragments and severely restricting movement for many wildlife species, including mountain lions, bobcats, gray foxes, coyotes, and mule deer, between the two mountain ranges. For mountain lions in particular, this restriction has led to increased inbreeding, territorial fighting, and very low genetic diversity. Research conducted by the National Park Service since 2002 has demonstrated that because of a fragmented landscape, mountain lions could face extinction in the Santa Monica Mountains within fifty years, with a median of fifteen years.Therefore, researchers analyzed several locations and investigated probable alternatives and recommended the development of a vegetated bridge over US-101, near Liberty Canyon Road, in the City of Agoura Hills, which would both provide the best location in the region for improving connectivity and serve the broadest range of species.Once built, this bridge would be the largest wildlife crossing of its kind in the world and the first to attempt a large-scale intervention for wildlife in an urban area with over twenty million people—and over a roadway carrying over three hundred thousand vehicles per day. This project will set a model worldwide for urban wildlife conservation and help inform future efforts. It has renewed the urgency to keep our wildlife from going extinct because of urban development and demonstrates that animals and humans can coexist.

TI  - Human Disturbance on High Andean Forests in Colombia: Spatio-temporal Dynamics and Vegetation Analysis of Forests Fragments around Bogotá, and Potential Effects of Climate Change on Treeline Species Distribution
AU  - Calbi, Mariasole
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - This research presents a multi-scalar work on the effects of human disturbance on high Andean forests in Colombia. It focuses on the analysis of vegetation composition and structure and on the dynamics of forest cover change and connectivity through time in selected localities around Bogotá. Additionally, a distribution model exercise is carried out to further the understanding of the environmental constraints driving the present distribution of a distinctive Andean treeline species and to examine its response to climate change in the future.High Andean forests are a unique and highly biodiverse ecosystem, located at high elevations in one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots, the Tropical Andes. Unfortunately, these forests are extremely fragmented and particularly vulnerable to climate change. Despite the fact that they provide essential ecosystem services to neighboring high Andean cities, such as the capital of Colombia, Bogotá, overall, high Andean forests have been poorly studied. Their fragility and their great value in terms of environmental services, together with their outstanding diversity, make them ecosystems with high priority for conservation. Nevertheless, especially around Bogotá, the vegetation studies carried out often have been rather circumscribed, rarely incorporating more complex parameters such as landscape fragmentation and anthropic disturbance metrics nor assessing functional and phylogenetic diversity attributes and ecosystem services. Also, there is a lack of studies that consider multiple vegetation strata at once and that address long-term changes in the extent and structure of high Andean forests, pairing plot-based work with forest cover change analysis. Lastly, few efforts have been made so far to model the response to climate change of high Andean forests and their species. Investigating these aspects could provide meaningful insights into species’ responses to anthropic influences and community assembly mechanisms, broadening our understanding of high Andean forests and strengthening strategies to conserve them.The aim of the present study is to explore the relationship between human disturbance and the condition of high Andean forest in the surroundings of Bogotá, the growing capital city of Colombia. Therefore, three parallel approaches were developed and implemented. On one hand, permanent plots establishment and plot-based fieldwork was carried out in several localities in the surroundings of Bogotá. Here, tree layer and understory vegetation were assessed and analyzed in terms of their taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity, but also as to their structure and above-ground biomass production. A broad array of environmental factors and anthropic disturbance-related indicators was compiled and subsequently used to characterize the tree layer and understory plant communities using a cluster analysis in combination with ordination techniques (Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling and partial Redundancy Analysis). Finally, environmental and disturbance predictors were related to tree and understory diversity metrics and above-ground biomass by means of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). As a result, a noticeable effect of anthropic related predictors on both tree and understory layer community composition and also a direct negative effect on tree layer diversity and above-ground biomass production have been documented.

TI  - The Role of Aquatic Subsidies in Riparian Food Webs and the Effect of Urbanization on the Diet, Diversity and Web-Spinning Behavior of Riparian Spiders
AU  - Kelly, Sean P.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The exchange of nutrients and organic material that occurs along the riparian zones of stream ecosystems has long been recognized to be vital in providing energetic subsidies for both aquatic and terrestrial food webs. Web-spinning spiders that inhabit stream channels are considered specialists of aquatic ecosystems and are major consumers of emerging aquatic insects, while other spider taxa are more commonly found in riparian forests and as a result may rely more heavily on terrestrial insects. The proportion aquatic insects in the diet of riparian spiders will most likely depend on factors such as spider taxa and prey diversity. However, the majority of studies focusing on the movement of subsidies between aquatic and riparian food webs have been conducted in non-urban areas and little is known about how human impact through urbanization may be affecting the transfer of energy between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The overall objective of this dissertation was to improve our understanding of how spider communities can be utilized in studying the connectivity between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. This objective was achieved by using a combination of stable isotope analyses along with measuring diversity and web-spinning behavior of riparian spiders. Results showed that spider assemblages are strongly associated with aquatic ecosystems due to their dependence on aquatic insects as a major energy source. In addition, results showed that urbanization can have a strong effect on the diet, web building behavior and body condition of riparian spiders and overall negatively affected spider diversity along an urban gradient. This study is of great importance because of the constant expansion of urban areas and as a result of this we need to have a better understanding how urbanization is impacting ecosystem interactions that are essential for sustaining complex food webs that could have negative effects for many aquatic and terrestrial organisms. In addition this dissertation has also provided evidence that spider communities should be included as part of integrated biotic indexes for stream ecosystems due to their ability to provide novel insights for more holistic analyses of the condition of the entire stream ecosystem, including the riparian areas.

AU  - Zhang, Shu Chang
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorLocated in the south of Wuhan East-Lake High-tech Zone, Fenghuang Mountain is an important component of the ecology corridor of South-east Wuhan. After more than forty years of building stone mining, the mountain's physiognomy has been severely damaged and formed near 300000 m2 broken slope. In this area, the origin vegetation is almost totally destroyed with only a few masson-pine survived, resulting in bare mountain massif, severe water and soil erosion, ecology system degradation, and severely affected urban environment of Wuhan. To restore the ecology system of the damaged mountain is an important ecological construction project. Guided with ecology theories, this paper analyzed and concluded the landscape restoration mode and technology of the damaged mountain, expounded the necessity of the ecology restoration project of the Fenghuang Mountain, explained the restoration plan, elaborated the restoration technology, investigated the effects of different restoration measures, discussed the key technology and put forward some countermeasures and suggestions. In the restoration plan, this paper analyzed the cause of formation and the characteristics of the mountain damage, investigate the ecological state, put forward the restoration object, discussed the restoration plan principle, concluded the plan idea and object, put forward the design concept, drew up the plant selection and design plan. The ecological restoration of the Fenghuang Mountain included geologic repairing and vegetation restoration. The geologic repairing included topography preparation, retaining wall construction, drain preparation. In vegetation restoration, the technology used included landscape plants transplanting, seed spraying sow with three-dimension net, seed spraying sow with steel net, seed spraying sow with replaced soil, finished vegetation blanket transplanting. Applying the above technology, vegetation restoration was finished from 10 to 90 degree of slope grade in the nearly 300000 m2 broken slope. Near one year's observation after the restoration works was conducted to research the growth states of the plants, the plant species diversity, the plant community diversity and the plant landscape, base on which the restoration effect was analyzed and valuated. Results showed that the vegetation was in good growth state, and good ecologic, social and economic effects were obtained. The research results had important value in Wuhan's "Friendly Environment Society" construction, and provided certain helpful references for comprehensive repairing and restoration of damaged mountain in Wuhan and other

TI  - Garden life: the influence of garden age and area on the biodiversity of ground active arthropods
AU  - Brown, Grant R.
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Urbanisation is a global issue, and rapidly gaining attention from researchers as a major cause of biodiversity loss. Gardens represent a considerable proportion of the urban landscape in the UK and have significant potential to promote urban biodiversity and reduce species loss providing they can be designed and managed appropriately. This research focused on gardens in St Andrews, Scotland, and investigated the influence of environmental variables such as age and area on arachnid and beetle biodiversity with the aim of identifying key predictors of arthropod species richness in urban environments. The key result of this research was that the age and area of individual gardens was not a strong predictor of ground active arthropod biodiversity. This suggests that more recently developed or smaller gardens can contribute to the overall urban region species richness pool as well as larger or more ancient gardens. The most important predictor of ground active arachnid and beetle species richness was the proportion of porous (or 'green') habitat surrounding each garden, and suggested that urban density and habitat connectivity at the regional scale are of key importance. In general, variables measured within gardens (e.g. the provision of microhabitats such as leaf litter, non-managed vegetation, etc.) did not exert any measurable effect on the biodiversity of arachnids or beetles. The findings of this research suggest that the regional availability of heterogeneous greenspace habitat is of high importance for promoting and maintaining urban arthropod biodiversity.

AU  - White, R. Jonathan
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Stream riparian zones are ecotones between terrestrial and aquatic environments. Studying these areas in urban environments is important since they lie adjacent to stream water supplies. I conducted a study of riparian woody and groundcover vegetation along urban, suburban, and rural streams (land-use designations based on % impervious surface) to assess how cities are affecting plant community structure. I also studied riparian soil gas flux (carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) in relation to water table depth and groundwater nutrient concentrations spanning a 10-month period (January to October, 2008). I found distinct woody and groundcover communities associated with proportion of impervious surface surrounding the research sites. These communities differed regarding diversity and proportion of native, exotic, and wetland species distributions. The most urban communities generally had lower species richness, more exotic species, and fewer wetland species when compared to rural areas. Urban areas also exhibited the highest streambanks and lowest water tables. Carbon dioxide gas flux rates were higher in urban areas, but methane and nitrous oxide fluxes did not respond uniformly to site differences as classified by proportion of impervious surface. Methane and nitrous oxide differences, in addition to seasonal variability, were more greatly affected by local site level differences in substrate and nutrient ratios as well as soil moisture.

TI  - Barriers to Dispersal and the Challenges Facing the Southern Expansion of Bobcats in New Jersey
AU  - Cerreta, Ariana
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - In urban environments, the threats of habitat fragmentation and loss, barriers to dispersal, and anthropogenic causes of mortality affect the recolonization potential of extirpated species. One such species, the bobcat (Lynx rufus), historically occurred throughout the state of New Jersey, but due to increased urbanization and agricultural expansion has been confirmed to occur almost exclusively in the northern portions of the state since the 1960’s. In this study I examine current barriers to bobcat dispersal and the possibility of the establishment of central and southern New Jersey bobcat populations. First, I developed a statewide habitat suitability index for bobcats and validated it with known bobcat locations. I then identified discrete suitable habitat patches and calculated landscape resistance values across the state from the inverse of the habitat suitability values with some adjustment for road-based metrics. To evaluate landscape connectivity throughout New Jersey, I applied circuit theory using the program Circuitscape within a GIS framework. I ran “current,” representing movement potential, through the resistance landscape between each pair of previously identified habitat patches. Using circuit theory in combination with least-cost path analysis, I next identified bottlenecks to bobcat movement throughout New Jersey. I identified barriers to movement using the change in least-cost path value based on a hypothetical barrier reduction. Finally, I repeated all these analyses for a case study in central New Jersey, where all stream crossing structures under roadways were assigned the lowest resistance value of 1, representing the ideal scenario that all structures had been modified to allow bobcat passage. I found that habitat patches were connected with some redundancy in the north, but with less redundancy throughout central New Jersey. The regions of high cumulative current flow around the Trenton area indicate that dispersing bobcats would have to pass through west central New Jersey to move from northern to southern habitat patches. Of the four least-cost paths connecting northern patches to southern patches, the shortest was approximately 25 km in length. While bobcats can easily disperse that distance, the movement corridors I identified cross through a highly urbanized landscape and contain several potential barriers. The resultant maps I produced will allow state managers to target specific areas for connectivity maintenance and improvement work within the CHANJ framework that are important for bobcat movement.I next used spatially explicit agent-based simulation models to examine the possibility of the establishment of central and southern New Jersey bobcat populations. The simulations consisted of a primary population model using life history statistics as well as two spatially explicit sub-models that examined dispersal and home range formation through a rasterized landscape representing movement resistances for bobcats. I evaluated the impacts of the following management actions: 1) status quo, 2) barrier reduction, and 3) single translocation event. I ran each scenario ten times to project population size and distribution at the end of 1, 5, 10, and 25 years. There was no significant difference in population size at the 1-, 5-, 10-, and 25-year time intervals for both the status quo and barrier reduction scenario. The translocation scenario revealed that the model needs further refinement as the population decreased between the 1- and 5-year time intervals, with no differences found between any other time interval pairs. Results from all scenarios indicated high probability of bobcat occupancy in habitat north of Route 80 over the course of 25 years. Bobcats more consistently occupied territories south of Route 80 but north of Interstate 95 under the barrier reduction scenario than either the status quo or translocation scenarios. The translocation scenario revealed higher probabilities of occupancy in the south at the 5-year time step likely due to the continued presence of translocated bobcats in their original territories. However, this high probability decreased by the 10-year time step and occupied territories largely disappeared by year 25. The surprising results of the translocation scenario highlighted the need to refine how the model identifies reproducing females, as it is currently too strict. Additionally, the impact of multiple small translocations on the persistence of a southern bobcat population should be evaluated before any decisions are made regarding translocation. Overall, my results suggested that bobcats are unlikely to recolonize central and southern New Jersey under current conditions within the next quarter century. Mitigation of barriers, through the implementation of modified culverts and crossing structures appropriate for bobcat movement, may allow for more reliable establishment of bobcat presence in the region south of Route 80, but still little occupation of territory south of Interstate 95. Given limitations in the model and its need for further refinement, no conclusions can be made regarding the translocation scenario. Translocation, especially in conjunction with barrier mitigation and the conservation of corridor habitat, may still be a viable management opportunity for NJDFW as it has previously been successful with bobcats in both in Georgia and northern New Jersey. However, further research should be pursued before any decisions are made. Once properly calibrated, spatially explicit agent-based models can be useful tools for wildlife managers to evaluate the potential impacts and results of different management actions. Overall, this research has expanded the scientific understanding of species-specific connectivity in an increasingly urban world, thus informing the implementation of mitigation methods to maintain and increase permeability within the landscape.

TI  - Genetic and Morphological Variation of Butterflies in Relict Habitats
AU  - Crawford, Lindsay Ann
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Habitat fragmentation and loss are leading threats to global biodiversity and can alter patterns of dispersal, population dynamics, and genetics with implications for long-term species persistence. Most habitat fragmentation research has focused on recently fragmented species that historically occupied interconnected habitat patches. We know comparatively little about how naturally fragmented species may respond to habitat loss. For these species, local habitat patch quality may influence the dynamics and genetics of populations more than the structure of the surrounding landscape (e.g., degree of isolation of suitable habitat). I examined aspects of the ecology and evolution of populations inhabiting fragmented landscapes, using two butterfly species representing relict populations that are 1) recently fragmented by anthropogenic activities (Mormon metalmark, Apodemia mormo), and 2) naturally fragmented (bog copper, Lycaena epixanthe). I assessed patterns of genetic (amplified fragment length polymorphism, AFLP) and flight-related morphological variation, and their relationship to measures of surrounding landscape structure and local habitat quality.Population genetic analysis of the anthropogenically fragmented Mormon metalmark revealed a high degree of spatial genetic structure, indicating limited gene flow, despite a small geographic scale (<20 km). Management of this endangered population should focus on increasing connectivity among the most isolated sub-populations and through urban areas. For the naturally fragmented bog copper, genetic diversity was explained by variables related to patch quality rather than landscape structure. Movement ability in the bog copper (inferred by flight morphology) appeared to depend on both local habitat conditions and the surrounding landscape. Also, using an AFLP-based genome scan approach, I identified signatures of selection in the bog copper associated with fine-scale landscape heterogeneity.My work on the bog copper highlights the importance of considering the effects of local habitat conditions, in addition to habitat isolation, for conservation of fragmented populations.My work on the bog copper highlights the importance of considering the effects of local habitat conditions, in addition to habitat isolation, for conservation of fragmented populations.

T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urban environments can satisfy the habitat requirements of a variety of wildlife species. It has been shown that urban residents enjoy wildlife near their homes. The goal of this study was to determine if urban wildlife distributions could be predicted by metropolitan planning variables, so that opportunities for urban residents to enjoy wildlife near their homes could be enhanced.Three hundred one random points, stratified into seven zones, based on intensity of urbanization and vegetation type, were chosen in the Tucson metropolitan study area. Birds were censused with the variable circular plot method. Sign of selected mammal species were searched for at a subset of these points.Native bird species diversity declined steadily as housing density increased. The study area still supports a high diversity of native species because of the high levels of natural open space still found intermixed with residential development. The amount of land covered in residential development and the amount of paloverde-saguaro vegetation types with associated riparian areas were the best predictors of native bird species diversity. The data also suggest that plant cover created by man-maintained vegetation is not as attractive to native bird species as naturally occurring vegetation.Ground nesters and insectivores tended to drop out at higher housing densities while seed-eaters were retained. Three patterns of avian response to variables describing the intensity of urbanization and the amount of natural vegetation emerged: urban, suburban, and exurban.Native Sonoran desert birds appear to be highly sensitive to urbanization, as minor increases in residential housing densities lead to declines in diversity. Mammal species appear to be most sensitive to the size of open space areas and fragmentation and isolation of natural lands.Metropolitan planning processes may be limited in their ability to retain high species diversities. The impacts of urbanization on wildlife diversities may be mitigated through sensitive open space planning.

AU  - Vankina, Priyanka
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Landscapes are mosaics of patches and corridors which are formed by hills, different soils types, vegetation patchiness, natural disturbances and human activities. As humans have developed, the patches and corridors have become fragmented and edges have been created. These edges become the critical points of interaction for wildlife with their surroundings. This is especially true in urban areas where development has created harsh edge environments.   \This study investigates the edge structure of Olmsted's Emerald Necklace to understand how edges can be designed to create habitat for wildlife in urban areas. The Emerald Necklace is located in Boston, MA and was designed in the 1800s by Frederick Law Olmsted. The Necklace is the first designed greenway and has been used as a model by many cities throughout the country. As such, the Emerald Necklace can be studied to gain insight into how the edges of an urban greenway can be designed to augment animal diversity in urban areas. The goal of the study is to provide design recommendations that can be used as a guide by landscape architects to maintain current urban greenways and to plan future ones.  The study's major findings suggest that plant and animal species vary along the park as per the original design. Additional findings show that there is no separation of spaces for people and animals along the Necklace which can lead to habitat disturbance. In addition eight design recommendations are suggested to improve the current conditions of the Emerald Necklace. Moreover the recommendations are not site specific and can be applied to other existing and future urban greenways. These include protecting existing habitat, using native plants and eradicating invasive species. The results and findings are discussed in further detail. Overall the Emerald Necklace is ecologically healthy and provides functions for both people and animals.

TI  - An exploration of the impact of greenway trail development on riparian habitat
AU  - McFadden, John F.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Greenways are linear parks generally designed and managed to support recreation and conservation. Ahern's (2004) greenway theory includes three hypotheses: co-occurrence of resources, inherent benefits of connectivity, and the compatibility of uses. The compatibility of recreation and conservation uses was the foundation for the current study. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of greenway development through an examination of trail footprint width (at 8, 10 and 12 ft widths plus their respective mowed areas), trail age, and surface type on percent canopy cover and surface temperature; the secondary purpose was to explore biodiversity through a comparison of tree species diversity for the greenway and a pristine natural area. Two greenways in Middle Tennessee were utilized to achieve the study purposes. Study findings revealed that eight foot asphalt trails do not effect percent canopy cover, while ten and 12 ft trails do effect percent canopy cover ( p = .000) as compared to on and off-site controls. As well, trail center surface temperatures were significantly different from on-site control surface temperatures (p = .000). The main effects model resulting from multivariate analysis of variance revealed that footprint width effects on percent canopy cover and surface temperature were significant; however, further analysis using Tukey's HSD post hoc analysis indicated that there were no significant effects, and the model lacked predictability and explained little variance (r2 =  .04). Study findings indicated that trail age had no effect on percent canopy cover. There was a significant, but weak correlation between on-site control canopy cover and surface temperature, yet not between the trail percent canopy cover and surface temperature. T-tests results indicated no significant difference between concrete and asphalt surface temperatures. Finally, descriptive analysis found tree species diversity lower on the greenway when compared to a pristine area. Study results may help planners and designers better integrate conservation of natural resources and recreation infrastructure in riparian greenways. Furthermore, study results may be helpful to greenway managers interested in understanding how vegetation management around hard surfaced trails may impact tree canopy cover. Finally, results from this exploratory study indicate future research directions.

TI  - Wildlife Movement and Connectivity across Large Scales: Migratory Ecology of Golden-Crowned Sparrows (Zonotrichia atricapilla) and Evaluating Landscape Connectivity Designs for Terrestrial Wildlife in California
AU  - Iverson, Autumn Rose
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Many species need to move across landscapes for a variety of reasons central to their survival and reproduction. Landscape connectivity allows gene flow among populations, provides opportunities for demographic rescue, facilitates necessary range shifts due to climate change, and can bolster a species’ ability to respond to other threats such as habitat loss. In western North America, species face many challenges that affect their ability to move and survive across different landscapes, including habitat loss and fragmentation, climate change, transportation infrastructure, and land use changes. Landscape connectivity has therefore become a key conservation target.To address potential losses of landscape connectivity, many habitat linkage designs have been created for the state of California. These designs were created with the intent to preserve important natural spaces between wilderness areas and ultimately allow the movement and connectivity of species. However, many linkage designs are created based on remote sensing of land cover types – with the assumption that natural areas are better for wildlife connectivity – and few are based on actual observations of wildlife occurrence or movement. In Chapter 1, we used ~180,000 terrestrial mammal, reptile and amphibian detections collected opportunistically throughout California over the past 20 years to assess whether species were more likely to be found within areas designated as linkages from five different linkage designs. We had a two-step approach and investigated 1) whether the linkages predicted wildlife distribution during residence periods (using occupancy modeling) and/or 2) whether animals were preferentially using linkages for movement or migration (using wildlife-vehicle collision data). We found that the linkage areas were not important predictors for the probability of landscape occupancy or movement for most species, with the exception of a few large-bodied mammals. These results demonstrated that landscape linkage designs are not a one-size fits all conservation strategy and using data from wildlife movements, instead of only habitat quality and disturbance metrics, is important. In urban environments, linkage designs may accurately reflect the critical last places for wildlife to move and should be reserved. However, in agricultural, forested, rangeland, and other mixed-use landscapes where wildlife may move more easily, connectivity as a gradient across the landscape should be the target of conservation.The species in Chapter 1 were all terrestrial and therefore limited to movement on the ground. However, some species can fly over roads and habitats that are not ideal for them, some even migrating across multiple large-scale management boundaries and into different biomes. Connectivity for these species is on a larger scale and conservation actions are reliant on detailed information across different seasons and life stages. For migratory birds in particular, studying migration has been a difficult challenge, especially for smaller birds that are difficult to track. Recently though, technological advances have led to miniaturized GPS tags that small songbirds can carry. In Chapter 2 and 3, we used these tiny tags in addition to stable isotope analysis fill knowledge gaps about the migration ecology and breeding grounds for Golden-crowned Sparrows (Zonotrichia atricapilla).In Chapter 2, we investigated habitat selection along migration routes for the Golden-crowned Sparrow, which migrates from wintering grounds in California to northern breeding grounds in Canada and Alaska. We tagged birds with GPS on two California wintering grounds. We put out 50 GPS tags and used a resource selection function combined with conditional logistic regression to determine how land cover class, vegetation greenness and climate variables influenced habitat selection during migration. We also reported on general migration descriptions for this understudied species. We acquired 22 tracks across 19 individuals, with a total of 541 valid spring and fall migration locations. We found that birds selected for shrubland and higher vegetation greenness in both migration seasons as well as grasslands during fall migration. Birds also selected for locations with higher daily maximum temperature during spring migration. Routes during spring migration were lower in elevation on average, shorter in duration, and had fewer long stopovers than in fall migration. For two birds, we found repeated use of the same stopover areas in spring and fall migration. This study provided new insights into habitat selection along migration routes for a common temperate-zone migrating songbird. We found important habitat associations along migration routes and previously unknown behaviors for this species, such as repeated use of stopover areas by individuals in different migratory seasons.GPS tags are useful tools for studying migration, as demonstrated in Chapter 2, but their cost and the necessity to retrieve them from returning birds presents limitations for sample sizes. Therefore, it is useful to combine GPS data with other methods to get a better understanding of migratory ecology. In Chapter 3, we demonstrate that the techniques of GPS and stable isotopes can be used to complement each other and fill knowledge gaps for understudied species by providing data on remote breeding territories, and migratory connectivity and strategy. We used feather isotope values from 170 samples across five wintering grounds for the Golden-crowned Sparrow and GPS tracks from 22 tags to calibrate predictive isoscapes with known origins based on GPS. We found evidence for regional connectivity for Golden-crowned Sparrows partitioned by wintering groups, with differentiation especially between southern and northern wintering birds. We also found that breeding home range sizes for this species were larger than reported for other Zonotrichia species, with shrubland cover common at breeding sites. Using stable isotope information, we also found Nitrogen isotope values that suggested females were eating at a higher trophic level at the breeding grounds than males. With three birds tracked twice with GPS data, we were able to determine that birds returned to the same breeding location each year, supporting high breeding and wintering site fidelity for this species. Using GPS in conjunction with stable isotopes proved a useful method, as we refined predictive isoscapes and identified patterns of migratory connectivity. We also uncovered new natural history information for this understudied species that breeds in very remote areas.Determining what species need in terms of connectivity is vital for species persistence as we make important conservation decisions that allow or restrict movements. There are many tools available for assessing both what species need and how well we design strategies to allow for connectivity. Combining GPS and stable isotope analysis can uncover patterns and habitat requirements for long-distance migrants, and spatial data analysis can help us determine how to improve conservation efforts. With an increasing human population, climate change and more frequent fires in western North America, it will continue to be increasingly important to gather data on species connectivity and how to design effective conservation strategies.

TI  - The conservation status of urban and urban fringe woodlands in Nottinghamshire
AU  - Sanders, I.
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Many of the criteria used to evaluate natural ecosystems for wildlife conservation are not applicable or must be modified for use in the urban environment. The reasons for this relate both to the different roles which conservation can fulfill in built up areas, compared to the rural countryside, and to the unique ecology of the urban environment. The ecology of a major component of this environment, the urban forest ecosystem is described in detail. The studies of the conservation status of the woodlands of the Greater Nottingham conurbation were carried out to establish which are the most important sites for nature conservation and how they compare to the best sites in the Country of Nottinghamshire. The studies of conservation status use those criteria which are considered to be applicable to the urban environment and by other different criteria to which numerical values are easy to assign. The woodlands of the Greater Nottingham conurbation form a representative but degraded series of the main woodland types occurring in the County of Nottinghamshire. Although, many of the urban and urban fringe woodland exhibit features which give them county importance few of the woodlands in the Greater Nottingham conurbation have any legislative conservation status. The use of `social' criteria, e.g. proximity, educational use, recreational value and position and linkage of sites, for the conservation evaluation of urban woodlands is discussed. In the quantified assessment of conservation status many of the urban and urban fringe woodlands are comparable to the best woodlands of the Country with respect to species richness and plant rarity. However, the regression analysis used in this investigation only showed significant relationships where a large number (20 or more) of sites were compared. Only the relationship between site area and species richness was considered as valuable in the ranking of woodland sites in order of conservation value. The results are discussed in relation to the ecology of the whole urban forest ecosystem and to management implications. Certain areas within the Greater Nottingham conurbation lack woodland habitats, e.g. the central parts of the City of Nottingham and parts of Gedling and Rushcliffe and these are seen as important areas for woodland habitat creation. Future management of the woodlands of the Greater Nottingham conurbation should follow a carefully designed conservation strategy taking into account the critical factors of disturbance, fragmentation and isolation to ensure the conservation of this ecosystem.

TI  - The study of associations between Maryland's amphibian species and habitat parameters at local and landscape scales
AU  - Walz, Anita
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The relationship between amphibians and their surrounding habitat was examined at local and landscape levels. Amphibian species presence and richness information and measurements of local habitat conditions were obtained for 1000 stream segments sampled during the Maryland Biological Stream Survey. Landscape metrics were determined from the National Land Cover Data set for varying extent landscapes around each sampling segment. Anura species richness was higher at typical pristine lowland streams, often in the presence of instream structures. If compact large forests were close by or if large and many wetlands were in the far reach, more anuran species were encountered. Caudata species richness was generally higher west, in small, relatively steep, pristine mountain streams with high forest proportion. Wetlands, agriculture and urban features showed negative relationships with Caudata richness. Most individual species followed these trends set by their respective richness group. Exceptions were northern two-lined salamanders and red-backed salamanders, which seemed more tolerant of lower habitat quality. For red salamanders the absence of urban areas seemed highest priority. The optimum map extents that were closely associated with species presence were species and land cover type specific. Generally, negative associations with urban cover were strongest at the smallest map extent. Multivariate linear models predicting encounter probabilities of a species from local and/or landscape parameters showed less fit for anuran species than for Caudata. More frequently encountered species were more difficult to predict, possibly because they are less specialized than others. Changes in association strength due to changes in age, resolution or processing of landuse data sets were evaluated. Fluctuations in association strength was species and/or cover type specific. Sources of fluctuations were data origin and resolution. The finest resolution was rarely the best. However, wetlands are a limiting factor when reducing the resolution, due to their small size. In order to measure landscape connectivity, a hypothetical species was released at the center of each landscape map with dispersal simulated at varying step sizes. After hypothetical riparian zones were added, connectivity increased with greater improvements in landscapes of lower initial connectivity.

AU  - Wallace, Brennan Samuel
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The puma (Puma concolor), a generalist species, have a realized niche that is constantly changing due to new urban development and management strategies. They have an extensive geographic range, from northern British Columbia down to Patagonia, and from sea level up to an elevation of 4,500 m, which is currently highly fragmented in many key areas. Using historic occurrence points, Genetic Algorithm for Rule set Prediction (GARP) is used to model the potential living area for pumas at the contiguous United States, California, and then southern California regional scales. Then post processing will separate urban areas, roads, and other non-suitable living areas from the model. An analysis of these model results with current conservation strategies and wildlife corridor locations will determine their effectiveness, and allow new strategies to be recommended.

TI  - Wildlife Connectivity Modeling for the Northern Red-legged Frog in the Portland Metropolitan Area, Oregon
AU  - Temple, Amanda Hilary
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Effective habitat connectivity tools that use GIS data perform well in remote areas but may not be as dependable in urban environments. My goal was to study uses and limitations of a conservation management tool in development, the Metro Regional Habitat Connectivity Toolkit, which evaluates connectivity for and permeability of wildlife movement. Habitat quality scores are generated from GIS-derived and field collected data such as connectivity patch/matrix characteristics, water source, vegetation, other structural components, wildlife observations, and human disturbance at survey sites. I compared GIS and field generated habitat quality scores for the Northern Red-legged Frog (Rana aurora) in urbanizing Gresham East Buttes, Oregon. Using Spearman’s ranked correlation, there was low positive correlation between GIS and field scores indicating the two scores assess different types of data. The magnitude of difference between these scores had no interdependence along a development gradient. Assessment of Northern Red-legged Frog locations in Forest Park, resulted in habitat quality scores which were sensitive to the presence or visibility of water sources and other structural components such as woody debris. These findings indicate the need for repeat field surveys, and the importance of field-collected data’s unique contributions which ensure crucial wildlife dispersal is protected in rapidly changing environments. To give regional conservation managers confidence in applying connectivity tools in urbanizing environments, I compared a predictive Circuitscape connectivity model to additional field collected data such as habitat quality, and distance between aquatic-terrestrial habitats using aquatic egg mass surveys for Northern Red-legged Frog. Further genetic and demographic studies are recommended to fully discern the implications of these findings and to protect this Oregon state strategy species that utilizes at-risk aquatic and terrestrial connections during its annual migrations.

TI  - Eco-Evolutionary Implications of Environmental Change Across Heterogeneous Landscapes
AU  - Homola, Jared J.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Species use a variety of mechanisms to adapt to environmental change. These range from spatially tracking optimal environments, to phenotypically plastic responses and evolutionary adaptation. Due to increases in anthropogenic influence on environments, characteristics of change such as their duration and magnitude are undergoing fundamental shifts away from the natural disturbance regimes that shaped species’ evolution. This dissertation uses empirical data and simulation models to examine the ecological and evolutionary consequences of environmental change across real, heterogeneous landscapes for multiple species, with an emphasis on anthropogenic changes. I used landscape genetics to evaluate the effects of urbanization on two native amphibian species, spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) and wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus). Population isolation was positively associated with local urbanization and lessened genetic diversity for both species. Resistance surface modelling revealed connectivity was diminished by developed land cover, light roads, interstates, and topography for both species, plus secondary roads and rivers for wood frogs, highlighting the influence of anthropogenic landscape features relative to natural features. Further study of a subset of wood frog populations revealed adaptive evolution associated with urban environments. I identified a set of 37 loci with the capacity to correctly reassign individuals into rural or urban populations with 87.5 and 93.8% accuracy, respectively. I developed an agent-based model to examine how gene flow, rates of change, and strength of landscape spatial and temporal autocorrelation influence abundance outcomes for species experiencing an environmental shift. Analysis of 36 environmental scenarios suggests that environmental variation, which is an emergent property of landscape autocorrelation, is negatively associated with the magnitude and duration of abundance declines following environmental change. Higher levels of gene flow lessened this effect, particularly in abrupt change scenarios, although gradual changes also resulted in demographic costs. Lastly, I used an investigation of an emerging disease in American lobsters (Homarus americanus) to study within-generation responses to environmental pressures. Using whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing I identified eight differentially expressed unigenes associated with the disease and seven related to environmental differences. Collectively, my dissertation provides numerous examples of how anthropogenically induced environmental change can direct ecological and evolutionary processes.

TI  - Law, culture, and landscape architecture: Defining the sidewalk landscape in downtown Winnipeg
AU  - Johnson Kwan, Melanie
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - This research examines the space currently protected for the movement of pedestrians within the downtown of Winnipeg as a  sidewalk landscape. This complex landscape contains both cultural and ecological systems which need to be considered holistically in order to maintain a healthy sidewalk landscape. As an application of the United Nations' ‘Healthy City’ principles, a healthy sidewalk landscape includes healthy vegetation, ecologically responsible design and maintenance, and a safe, economically sustainable, and contextual experience for pedestrians. The sidewalk landscape of downtown Winnipeg is well used as a functional corridor, but its systemic health is suffering. The growing requirements for urban vegetation, the climatic and experiential effects upon pedestrians, and the lack of an ethical approach toward groundwater and wind are examined by looking at this landscape as a right of way, a private and public sector investment, a public space, and as an ecological network. These perceptions of the sidewalk space are a translation of cultural values into the planning and regulatory legal documents written for this landscape. In order to understand this landscape, this research examines the sidewalk as a product of cultural values serving many cultural purposes, and an evolving landscape affected by emerging civic goals and priorities expressed in provincial legislation, and municipal by-laws and planning policy. Two goals of this research were to educate landscape architects about the sidewalk as a cultural and outdoor landscape, and to prepare a framework for sidewalk design as a form of applied landscape theory. Landscape architects as teachers and designers can provide leadership toward a review of the practices and legal documents shaping the sidewalk landscape.

TI  - Maximizing ecological and social benefits of habitat restoration in the Lower Duwamish River: A spatial framework for site selection
AU  - Brandon, Tess B.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The Lower Duwamish River (LDR) estuary is an 11-mile stretch of river that contains the core of industrial activity in the Seattle area. As the city's only river, the LDR also provides important habitat for many of the region's valued fish and wildlife species. However, its long history of urban development and industrial activity has polluted and degraded the river, and significant habitat restoration is now required under federal and state law. Given the highly developed urban industrial setting of the LDR, habitat restoration projects tend to be small and opportunistic, with limited ecological value. At the same time, the LDR is home to several underserved urban neighborhoods, and restoration projects have the potential to bring significant social value to these communities. Maximizing this potential value together with ecological value requires a more strategic approach to restoration. Through a review of local and regional planning documents, I developed a list of community-defined characteristics that contribute to a restoration project's potential ecological and social value in the LDR. I then used these characteristics to explore the spatial distribution of potential restoration value in the river, creating a series of heat maps of potential value for each characteristic, and for overall potential ecological and social value. I developed six ecological metrics and eight social metrics, which I calculated for 511 waterfront parcels in the LDR. Results show more variability with positive skewness in the ecological index, and a more normal distribution with higher average values in the social index. Spatial analysis revealed higher ecological value in the northern, industrial section of the LDR, with particular dependence on the existing habitat network. Social value was higher in the southern section and as the river passes through residential neighborhoods. These results can inform site selection for future restoration projects in the LDR. Methodologies and results for individual metrics can be used to address project-specific objectives, while use of the complete collection can inform those restoration projects that seek to maximize overall ecological and social benefits in the LDR.

TI  - Conservation biology and genetics of a rare mining bee, colletes floralis
AU  - Davis, E. S.
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - This thesis aimed to investigate the conservation biology and genetics of a rare, solitary bee, Colletes floralis in Britain and Ireland, which is believed to contain 90% of the world’s Atlantic zone population.  An investigation into changes in the distribution and occurrence of C. floralis recorded substantial and significant declines, with surveys suggesting that the species has become locally extinct at 52% of all sites historically occupied.  Local extinction of the species was associated with landscapes dominated by broad-leaved woodland, mixed forest, agriculture and, to a lesser extent, urban development. By assessing the pollen requirements of C. floralis and then comparing results with floral resource availability, it was possible to deduce forage selectivity and specialisation of this supposedly polylectic species.  It was found that whilst the species is polylectic, it has a clear preference for selecting plants within the family Apiaceae.  C. floralis exhibits extremely high levels of population differentiation (global FST=0.34; global GST=0.66). Water appeared to act as a substantial barrier to gene flow over medium to long distances.  Agricultural land and beaches, dunes and sand were identified as possible facilitators of gene flow; while natural grassland, semi-natural vegetation, urban areas and woodland could all potentially act as barriers to gene flow.  C. floralis has been shown to have undergone significant range declines and exhibit high levels of population differentiation, indicating an extreme level of isolation.  The results of this thesis indicate that C. floralis would benefit from urgent management actions that should be applied at a site-specific level.

TI  - Evolution and Ecology of Urban Pigeons (Columba livia) in Northeastern North America
AU  - Carlen, Elizabeth Jane
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urbanization is drastically changing landscapes across the globe leading to changes in the ecological and evolutionary dynamics within cities. This urban landscape change may restrict, facilitate, or have no effect on gene flow, depending on the organism and extent of urbanization. In human commensals, with high dispersal ability, urbanization can facilitate gene flow by providing continuous suitable habitat across a wide range. Additionally, suburban or rural areas with lower human population density may act as a barrier to gene flow for these human commensals. Spatial population genetic approaches provide a means to understand genetic connectivity across geographically expansive areas that encompass multiple metropolitan areas. Here, I examined the spatial genetic patterns of feral pigeons (Columba livia) living in cities in the Northeastern United States. I focused my sampling on the Northeastern megacity, which is a region covering six large cities (Boston, Providence, New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, DC). I performed ddRAD‐Seq on 473 samples. My analysis detected higher‐than‐expected gene flow under an isolation by distance model within each city. I conclude that the extreme urbanization characteristic of the Northeastern megacity is likely facilitating gene flow in pigeons. Additionally, spatial genetic patterns may diverge between cities as food accessibility, nesting site availability, and eradication policies differ. Pigeon hobbyists (people who collect, breed, trade, and race pigeons) also vary by region leading to differing degrees of public tolerance for pigeons and impacting the spatial genetic patterns. Fancy and racing pigeons display a variety of characters which are often seen in the feral population, suggesting that these breeds may partially contribute to feral populations. I found that pigeon population structure is influenced by continued introduction of racing/fancy pigeons and the local conditions including attitudes towards pigeons, management practices, and food availability. Furthermore, variation in behavioral traits is especially important in novel habitats where selection forces determine successful colonizers. Prey species must constantly balance the risk versus reward of remaining in an area with threats while gaining possible fitness benefits. Flight initiation distance, the distance at which an animal flees when approached by a human, is a common metric used to assess habituation to stressors and risk behavior. I examined the flight initiation distance of pigeons across New York City, USA. I then assessed this behavioral response across the landscape with respect to multiple urbanization factors related to human activity, the abiotic environment, and the ecological community. I found that flight initiation distance in pigeons decreased with increased human activity demonstrating that pigeon behavior varies with urbanization, human activity, and ecological attributes. Since behavioral changes are often the most rapid phenotypic response to change, this study demonstrates that pigeons are responding to anthropogenic stressors, which may set the stage for adaptive changes. Overall this research demonstrates that urban landscape heterogeneity may contribute to variable spatial genetic and behavioral responses across a single city, therefore researchers must examine patters at different spatial scales. Moreover, organisms such as pigeons that depend on humans, exhibit fine-scale spatial genetic structure that reflects human patterns and distributions, stressing the importance of sampling across urban areas.

TI  - Green Roofs and Urban Biodiversity: Their Role as Invertebrate Habitat and the Effect of Design on Beetle Community
AU  - Gonsalves, Sydney Marie
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - With over half the world’s population now living in cities, urban areas represent one of earth’s few ecosystems that are increasing in extent, and are sites of altered biogeochemical cycles, habitat fragmentation, and changes in biodiversity. However, urban green spaces, including green roofs, can also provide important pools of biodiversity and contribute to regional gamma diversity, while novel species assemblages can enhance some ecosystem services. Green roofs may also mitigate species loss in urban areas and have been shown to support a surprising diversity of invertebrates, including rare and endangered species. In the first part of this study I reviewed the literature on urban invertebrate communities and diversity to better understand the role of green roofs in providing habitat in the context of the larger urban mosaic. My review concluded that, while other factors such as surrounding land use and connectivity are also important to specific invertebrate taxa, local habitat variables contribute substantially to the structure and diversity of urban invertebrate communities. The importance of local habitat variables in urban green spaces and strong support for the habitat complexity hypothesis in a number of other ecosystems has led to proposals that “biodiverse” roofs—those intentionally designed with varied substrate depth, greater plant diversity, or added elements such as logs or stones—would support greater invertebrate diversity, but there is currently limited peer reviewed data to support this. In order to address the habitat complexity hypothesis in the context of green roofs, in the second part of this study I surveyed three roofs designed primarily for stormwater management, three biodiverse roofs, and five ground-level green spaces, from March until September of 2014 in the Portland metropolitan area. Beetles (Coleoptera) were sampled bi-weekly as representatives of total species diversity. Biodiverse roofs had greater richness, abundance, and diversity of beetle species compared to stormwater roofs, but were not more diverse than ground sites. Both biodiverse roofs and ground sites had approximately 20% native beetle species while stormwater roofs had only 5%. Functional diversity was also higher on biodiverse roofs with an average of seven trophic groups represented, while stormwater roofs averaged only three. Ground sites, biodiverse roofs, and stormwater roofs each grouped distinctively in terms of beetle community composition and biodiverse roof communities were found to be positively correlated with roof age, percent plant cover, average plant height, and plant species richness. These results support the findings of previous studies on the importance of local variables in structuring urban invertebrate communities and suggest that biodiverse design can reliably increase greenroof diversity, with the caution that they remain no replacement for ground level conservation.

TI  - Using Population Genetics to Examine White-Tailed Deer ( Odocoileus virginianus) Connectivity across Multiple Spatial Scales: Influences of Proximity, Landscape, and History
AU  - Gardner Almond, Lynne Carol
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Understanding the degree to which population connectivity is influenced by social structure, movement patterns, and management actions is important for development and evaluation of the impact of wildlife management strategies on wild game populations. I used population genetic tools to examine genetic diversity and spatial genetic structure of an abundant, highly vagile habitat generalist game species, the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus ). I used both microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA sequences to explore the roles of proximity, landscape, and population history on genetic connectivity of deer at local, statewide, and regional spatial scales. At local scales, I evaluated the effects of spatial proximity on levels of connectivity between urban and adjacent rural deer populations. I found high levels of genetic similarity, suggesting that localized management to control densities of urban deer populations may be complicated by recolonization due to movement of deer from rural into urban areas. I examined the effects of differences in population history and management on levels of connectivity to understand potential for disease spread between a captive and adjacent wild deer population. I found high levels genetic similarity that could be attributed to numerous mechanisms, and therefore could not make any definitive inferences regarding the captive facility as a source of infection for wild deer. At a statewide level, I evaluated the influence of landscape factors on deer spatial genetic structure across Iowa, and found weak genetic structure related to landscape factors, indicating that Iowa deer are part of a single continuous population across the state with few limitations on movement and potential for disease spread. At a range-wide scale, I found an impact of historical deer management on broad scale population connectivity of deer across their North American range. Specifically, translocation efforts led to higher levels of diversity and increased genetic similarity between geographically distant deer populations compared to naturally restored populations. My results suggest that, despite their high vagility and habitat generalist nature, social structure, landscape characteristics, and management history all impact genetic structure of white-tailed deer populations at multiple spatial scales.

TI  - What Is the Potential to Increase Local Biodiversity in Semi-Urban Amenity Grasslands Through Meadow Constructions?
AU  - Östberg, Alexandra
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - The loss of biodiversity worldwide and methods of prevention are hot subjects receiving increased interest in todays’ research. Meadow construction in urban areas has been the focus of recent studies to increase both local and global biodiversity. In my report, I address potential analyses to conduct in advance before practical meadow constructions in a landscape. The subject I chose to focus on for this report was a LONA-project aimed to construct meadows on contemporary amenity grasslands in a semi-urban municipality. I used vegetation data from an inventory executed in 2021. Patches were in advance classified based on conditions observed during the inventory with class 1 obtaining the highest meadow potential, class 2 obtaining mediocre potential, and class 3 weak or no potential. I analysed vegetation data on species richness, environmental indicator values, and composition. Additionally, I analysed the soil types and historical land uses in the study area to display credible soil characteristics. The order of Lepidoptera was used as a model taxon for pollinators and the red-listed Marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia) was separately analysed for conservational purposes. To illustrate the landscapes’ ability to facilitate the dispersal of butterflies, connectivity analyses of varying meadow construction scenarios were executed. Results indicate higher species richness on average per patch and more indicator species in class 1, suggesting a better starting point and making quality assessments more credible in comparison to class 2. Underlaying soil type seems to some extent to influence the meadow potential by affecting vegetation composition and hence butterfly occurrence in terms of host plant distribution. I could however not draw any conclusions from the effect of historical land use on current patch classifications, and consequently meadow potential. To facilitate for E. aurinia to widen its distribution in the study area, and to avoid local extinction, further conservational efforts should focus on mimicking the conditions and current management of the powerline corridor, that currently yields high diversity of butterflies and abundance of E. aurinia, to other powerline corridors in the study area. To facilitate dispersal of butterflies and other pollinators, target meadow areas of both class 1 and class 2 patches should be constructed to avoid patch isolation, as illustrated in the connectivity analyses. Further research is needed to investigate other factors possibly affecting suitability of grasslands for meadow construction.

AB  - Patterns of human settlement can have profound effects on the natural environment and biological resources, including direct habitat destruction, contribution to greenhouse gases, and obstruction of animal movement. Over half the world's population live in urban areas, which are experiencing tremendous growth rates. Planners and scientists are struggling to accommodate urban growth while conserving natural resources. UPlan, a spatially-explicit urban growth model, was developed to help decision-makers quantify and visualize the potential implications of land use decisions by modeling patterns of future human settlement and measuring their relative impacts.In chapter one, I apply UPlan to the San Joaquin Valley, California, to model urban growth impacts from land use policy scenarios on conservation priority lands. Results indicate that the least detrimental impacts are from the growth scenario that emphasizes higher housing densities and a smaller human settlement footprint. To better understand the relative contribution of urban growth to California's greenhouse gas emissions, in chapter two I use UPlan's greenhouse gas (GHG) calculator to estimate emissions from buildings accommodating new growth through the year 2050 in California. The GHG calculator can test alternative emission-reducing measures to help determine what actions will be needed to achieve the 2050 reduction targets. Reducing very low residential housing lowers emissions by 1%, suggesting targets cannot be met without a higher percentage of renewable energy sources and/or implementing conservation measures.Kenyan Maasai pastoralists are transitioning from communal land tenure to individual parcel ownership, leading to a sedentary, agriculture-based livelihood with more fenced land. Effects of land subdivision include landscape-scale habitat fragmentation and decreased wildlife populations. To date, there has been no systematic way of estimating longer-term impacts of differing growth scenarios on wildlife and other environmental resources in Africa. Chapter three explores whether UPlan can be adapted to the Kenyan policy framework. I test the feasibility of using UPlan in rural Kenya by applying it to the Mbirikani Group Ranch. The modeled pattern of human settlement from each policy scenario is combined with wildlife routes across Mbirikani. Findings indicate that the scenario with the highest level of fencing has the most detrimental effects on migratory corridors.

TI  - Effects of Urbanization on Bat Habitat Use in the Phoenix Metropolitan Region, Arizona, USA: A Multi-Scale Landscape Analysis
AU  - Bazelman, Tracy C.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Context – Urbanization can have negative effects on bat habitat use through the loss and isolation of habitat even for volant bats.  Yet, how bats respond to the changing landscape composition and configuration of urban environments remains poorly understood.Objective – This study examines the relationship between bat habitat use and landscape pattern across multiple scales in the Phoenix metropolitan region.  My research explores how landscape composition and configuration affects bat activity, foraging activity, and species richness (response variables), and the distinct habitats that they use.Methods – I used a multi-scale landscape approach and acoustic monitoring data to create predictive models that identified the key predictor variables across multiple scales within the study area.  I selected three scales with the intent of capturing the landscape, home range, and site scales, which may all be relevant for understanding bat habitat use.Results –  Overall, class-level metrics and configuration metrics best explained bat habitat use for bat species associated with this urban setting.  The extent and extensiveness of water (corresponding to small water bodies and watercourses) were the most important predictor variables across all response variables.  Bat activity was predicted to be high in native vegetation remnants, and low in native vegetation at the city periphery.  Foraging activity was predicted to be high in fine-scale land cover heterogeneity.  Species richness was predicted to be high in golf courses, and low in commercial areas.  Bat habitat use was affected by urban landscape pattern mainly at the landscape and site scale.Conclusions – My results suggested in hot arid urban landscapes water is a limiting factor for bats, even in urban landscapes where the availability of water may be greater than in outlying native desert habitat. Golf courses had the highest species richness, and included the detection of the uncommon pocketed free-tailed bat (Nyctinomops femorosaccus).  Water cover types had the second highest species richness. Golf courses may serve as important stop-overs or refuges for rare or elusive bats. Urban waterways and golf courses are novel urban cover types that can serve as compliments to urban preserves, and other green spaces for bat conservation.

TI  - The distribution and dispersion of herpetofauna in lowland farmland: with a focus on the common toad (bufo bufo)
AU  - Salazar, Rosie Diane
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Concern over unexplained population declines in the common toad (Bufo bufo) has led to it being recognised as a priority species for conservation research. The general consensus among herpetologists is that the most important cause of the declines seen as part of a global amphibian extinction crisis is habitat loss and degradation. The aim of thesis is to investigate the effect of habitat availability and quality on common toad populations in the United Kingdom, with a particular emphasis on the effect of land under agricultural use. I use occupancy modelling, resource selection function modelling and genetic techniques to determine the effects of both terrestrial and aquatic habitat on common toads. Based on my findings, I consider the impacts of habitat at local, landscape and national scales. My research revealed the importance of pond density and presence of woodland in increasing relative probability of toad occurrence in the terrestrial habitat (Chapters 2 and 3) and the importance of water quality, woodland coverage and available terrestrial habitat coverage in determining common toad presence in ponds. The isolating effect of urban areas is demonstrated in Chapter 4 where Isolation By Barriers (IBB) explains genetic distance between common toad breeding populations better than Isolation By Distance (IBD). In Chapter 5 I again use the resource selection function for terrestrial habitat use developed in Chapter 3, to investigate the importance of terrestrial habitat availability in determining pond use by common toads at a national scale. In my concluding chapter, I make recommendations for management and further research including consideration of potential interactions between the effect of habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation with other potential causes of common toad decline.

TI  - Movement and population structure of cerambycid beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) and white-footed deermice (Peromyscus leucopus) on a fragmented forest landscape
AU  - Dunn, Emily R.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Cerambycid beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) locate suitable hosts and mates using both pheromones and plant volatiles, many of which have been identified and are now produced synthetically for trap lures. The range over which these lures attract cerambycids within a forest, and the tendency for cerambycids to move out of a forest in response to these lures, have not been previously explored to our knowledge. We conducted two field experiments using baited and unbaited flight intercept traps in northern Delaware to investigate these questions. Within forest fragments, traps that were 2 m from the baited trap, but not 10 or 20 m, captured more beetles than control traps suggesting relatively short-range and nonspecific attraction by these lures. In contrast, male  Prionus laticollis (Drury), which were attracted by the female-produced sex pheromone 3,5-dimethyldodecanoic acid, were rarely caught in unbaited traps at any distance from baited traps. Baited traps attracted significantly more cerambycids than unbaited traps outside of the forest at distances up to 40 m from the forest edge, with catch generally decreasing between 8 and 40 m from the forest. Some cerambycids were caught in both baited and unbaited traps at all distances from the forest edge, indicating that at least some cerambycids disperse freely outside of the forest independent of any pheromone attractants. Our results provide context to previous studies that used these pheromone lures, and offer insights into the dispersal behavior of cerambycids. Forest fragmentation and human development undoubtedly affect wildlife movement on a landscape, but this effect likely varies by species. We analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two species of cerambycid beetles and in white- footed deermice (Peromyscus leucopus) to determine the population structure of these species on the same fragmented landscape in northern Delaware. White-footed deermice showed more population structure than either cerambycid species, indicating that cerambycids are more capable of movement among forest fragments. The cerambycid Xylotrechus colonus  showed less population structure than Prionus laticollis, which may be explained by both dispersal ability and life history differences. Our study highlights the importance of using diverse study species to assess connectivity and movement on a human-dominated landscape.

TI  - A Multi-scale Exploration into the Spatial Patterns of a Three Dimensional Urban Tree Infrastructure (UTI) : Integrating Landscape Connectivity, Network Resilience, and Social Deprivation
AU  - Bishop, Oliver James
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - A functionally connected urban tree infrastructure (UTI) contributes to ecosystem function, resilience, and the provision of Ecosystem Services (ES). Variation in tree height is an important attribute influencing movement of passerines, habitat quality and landscape patterns. UTI provided ES are particularly beneficial in the most deprived areas of a city. Presented in this thesis is an exploration into the social-ecological shape of a UTI using a holistic, multi-scale and dimensional, landscape approach.The potential landscape connectivity of a UTI in the City of Salford, UK was quantified and compared using the integral index of connectivity (IIC) across vertically stratified canopies existing in 2005, 2009, and 2013. System resilience was assessed through landscape graph network analysis and by the identification of canopies critical in maintaining connectivity (dIIC). The index of multiple deprivation (IMD) was related to UTI landscape composition and configuration through a series of statistical tests.The connectivity of Salford’s vertically stratified UTI was low (IIC = <0.000001 – 0.0045), besides this the temporal change in connectivity was complex with no discernible overall pattern. The rate of connectivity increase decreased after a 90-120m gap-crossing threshold. The resilience of Salford’s UTI relies on the connectivity of canopies within 4 to 5 sub-connected regions, depending on passerine perception, increasing to 10 -16 smaller regions for canopies above 17.1m. The resilience and stability of these sub-connected regions were often reliant on a central canopy patch. UTI composition is related negatively with deprivation, UTI configuration is related positively, while structural diversity of canopy heights revealed no correlation with deprivation.The research in this thesis contributes to the debates on how to best manage the UTI for both people and nature. The findings of this thesis have a number of important implications for future urban landscape management, especially as previously unknown landscape patterns have been identified.

TI  - Comparative Population Genomics of Native (Sundamys Muelleri) and Invasive (Rattus Rattus) Rodents Along an Urbanization Gradient in Borneo
AU  - Herrera, Giselle Agatha
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urbanization continues to be one of the most significant processes of global change modifying the environment rapidly and permanently. With increases in infrastructure and human settlement, natural areas become fragmented, and small populations in these patches become more vulnerable to genetic drift and are unable to disperse due to barriers to gene flow. Often these pervasive alterations to the environment result in the introduction of exotic species that can thrive in urban habitats with anthropogenically made available resources. Both native and nonnative wildlife that inhabit cities and nearby non-urban areas serve as ideal models to show how populations are evolving in response to developmental pressures. While native rodents in urban areas exhibit patterns of low genetic diversity and genetic connectivity, populations of invasive rodents reveal high connectivity and gene flow. Studying the evolutionary implications of this ecological change, particularly in understudied regions of rapid development like in biodiverse rich areas of Southeast Asia, will be vital to understand the variation of species responses to urbanization. In this study, I explored genetic diversity, structure, and connectivity of populations of the native Müller's giant Sunda rat (Sundamys muelleri) and invasive black rat (Rattus rattus) across an urbanization gradient on the island on Borneo. Sundamys muelleri exhibited decreased genetic diversity in urban areas and was differentiated from rural and suburban locations. Populations of S. muelleri also displayed low genetic connectivity with urbanization posing a potential barrier to gene flow. Rattus rattus exhibited decreased genetic diversity in rural areas and a clinal genetic structure across the urbanization gradient. Populations of R. rattus also displayed high genetic connectivity, but development likely still prevents dispersal opportunities. This research provides useful information on how urbanization evolutionarily affects these two species of rodents (a native and invasive) and how development impacts population structure and connectivity. This information will provide useful for the conservation of endemic species in Borneo, to better understand the population genetics of these vector species and inform pest management across the urbanization gradient.

TI  - Population dynamics and occupancy patterns of Eastern screech owls (Megascops asio) in New York City parks and adjacent suburbs
AU  - Nagy, Christopher M.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Eastern screech owls (Megascops asio) are one of the few raptor species that permanently reside in New York City (NYC).  To better inform management of this charismatic species in urban parks, I sought to determine the present status and future viability of existing screech owl populations in NYC and identify potential landscape characteristics that affect park occupancy by screech owls.  Using captive, non-releasable owls and isolated free-living owls, I developed a method of identifying individual screech owls via vocalization analysis.  Using call-broadcast surveys and subsequent recording of owl responses, I gathered capture-recapture histories of urban owls in three NYC parks and one comparison nature preserve, the Mianus River Gorge Preserve (MRGP), a rural/suburban nature preserve in Bedford, NY.  These histories were used to estimate abundance and survival rate in each of the parks.  I then projected simulated populations using my estimated adult survival and previously published yearling survival and reproductive rates.  I built my projection model to include density dependence based on park area, realistic sex ratio fluctuations, and periodic drops in survival rate due to hypothetical environmental events.  Survival in urban parks was 0.98–1.0, much greater than in the MRGP, 0.57 ± 0.15.  Despite the high adult survival, populations in parks could be extirpated within 10–20 years by severe drops in survival rate (e.g., extreme winters, storms, or secondary poisoning) if such conditions occurred more often than once every ten years or if parks were smaller than 1.0km2.    In 2008 and 2009, my colleagues and I conducted a citizen science-based study on screech owl occupancy patterns across three counties adjacent to NYC: Westchester and Putnam, NY, and Fairfield, CT.  Volunteers conducted call-broadcast surveys on their own properties and sent my colleagues and me the results in 2008 and 2009.  Occupancy and detection were modeled as functions of the amount of forest cover and impervious surface cover at each survey point.  These models were validated against an independent dataset collected by myself and other trained scientists.  Validated models indicated a negative association between occupancy and percent forest cover or, similarly, a positive association with percent impervious cover. Both the citizen science and the systematic datasets supported similar owl-habitat patterns of higher occupancy probabilities in developed areas compared to rural.  The above patterns described eastern screech owl habitat use in rural and suburban areas outside of NYC.  I hypothesized that at some point urbanization would become too intense for owls to tolerate,  and they would be primarily relegated to protected greenspaces in extremely urbanized cities, as I observed in NYC.  In 2010, I surveyed 13 additional parks in NYC and the more urban southern sections of Westchester to characterize occupancy patterns in highly urban areas.  I used similar landscape measurements as in the citizen science study, only these measurements were taken across the entire park.  Occupancy appeared to decline sharply if the percent impervious cover surrounding a park rose above 50–60%.  I interpreted this pattern as evidence that high urbanization around a park acts primarily as a barrier to immigration.  It is also possible that high urbanization around a park leads to higher mortality from vehicles.        In terms of management, my work has indicated that in large parks (e.g., >1km2), extinction probability is relatively low, but parks larger than 3km2 may be less suitable if big parks allow the establishment of larger raptors such as barred (Strix varia ) or great horned owls (Bubo virginianus).  Managers can enhance population persistence by increasing the amount of available habitat via habitat restoration and reforesting or re-meadowing developed but unused parks (e.g., large lawns and paved areas) and increasing over-winter survival and reproductive rates by installing nest boxes.  However, frequent chance events can extirpate any park-bound population, and thus managers and city planners should also look to enhance the probability of dispersal and recolonization via corridors or reducing the general level of urbanization around protected parks.

TI  - Conservation Genetics and Ecology of the Hazel Dormouse
AU  - Combe, Fraser
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Woodland species face a challenging future because of human activity and global climate change, as such it is vital to understand the ecology of species that inhabit these habitats in order to conduct effective conservation management. I describe the phylogeographic structure of the hazel dormouse within the UK, to identify post-glacial dispersal routes and to describe population units for conservation. I provide evidence for a single post-glacial colonization coincident with the start of the Holocene period, 7.5-11 Kya. I also demonstrate the utility of novel occupancy modelling techniques to determine dormouse presence with high probability of detection. I provide optimal survey guidelines for ecological practitioners to conduct rigorous statistically significant surveys. This species is known to be susceptible to habitat loss and fragmentation limiting dispersal and functional connectivity. I use a landscape genetics approach to characterize the genetic structure of populations of dormice from seven regions around the UK to explicitly test for the role of landscape heterogeneity and barriers to dispersal. The results suggests build-up of genetic structure amongst islands of fragmented habitat that is explained in part due to isolation-by-distance, and in part due to specific landscape features between different regions. The isolation-by-resistance analysis allows us to identify the landscape features, such as land cover, hedgerows and roads that facilitate or inhibit gene flow. Results suggest that dispersal in hazel dormice is strongly influenced by barriers in the landscape, with our main findings being that urban areas and roads are associated with decreased gene flow while habitat features such as hedgerows and forest cover are associated with increased gene flow. Finally, I investigated the effect of density dependence and climatic factors on the population demography of five marked hazel dormice populations in Europe (four in the UK and one in Lithuania). The results from the chapter have identified the environmental drivers of these population parameters on hibernating mammals whilst providing evidence that density dependence has the greatest effect on population dynamics in this species. The results provide information that variability in winter conditions can have serious consequences for individual fitness, decreasing the dormancy season and leading to an increased extinction risk in this species. I discuss the implications for hazel dormouse conservation in the UK, and make recommendations for conservation practitioners to ensure the future persistence of this species.

TI  - Ecology of mesopredators within an urban area in east Texas
AU  - Lombardi, Jason Vincent
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - As urbanization is increasingly becoming more commonplace across the country, the effect of urban landscape features on wildlife species is becoming more important. Unlike large predators, mesopredators are expanding their geographic range and are readily adapting to living in and around urbanized areas. Even though urban mesopredator research has steadily been growing over the last 45 years, the majority of this has taken place in large metropolitan areas in the Midwest, Pacific and Northeastern regions. Research in the southeastern US, especially Texas and within small, urbanized areas is surprisingly lacking. In eastern Texas, mesopredators commonly found in urban areas include coyotes (Canis latrans), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), bobcats ( Lynx rufus), Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), raccoons (Procyon lotor) and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis). As more natural habitats are developed, it is important to identify variables likely to influence the density, occurrence and detectability of these species in order to establish sound management strategies to mitigate potential human-wildlife interactions. A mark-recapture study was conducted to: 1) Determine if density, occurrence and detectability of coyotes, red foxes, gray foxes, bobcats, raccoons, Virginia opossums and striped skunks vary in predictable ways in response to urban landscape features, and 2) identify hot spots of high potential human-mesopredator contact.I utilized motion-activated cameras during summer 2013 and winter 2014 to determine how coyotes, bobcats, and red and gray fox respond to urban landscape features in the city of Nacogdoches and immediately surrounding areas. The mesocarnivore community in the study area was affected by a variety of urban landscape features and their presence, density, and detectability shifted seasonally, but was similar to studies conducted in larger urban areas in North America. Coyote and bobcat presence and detectability both differed seasonally and were primarily associated with natural cover. Gray fox presence was affected by low density of buildings, whereas red fox densities increased as distance to buildings and distance to urban edge decreased. Low density residential zones adjacent to large forested patches such as the southeastern and northeastern extremes of the study area may have the greatest potential for human contact with coyotes, bobcats, red and gray foxes.For raccoons, Virginia opossums and striped skunks I conducted a live mark-recapture study during late August – early September 2013 and early – late January 2014 in both suburban (summer 1.76 km2; winter 1.23 km2) and urban (winter 1.37 km2) areas within the city of Nacogdoches, Texas. Densities of raccoons within urban habitat ranged from 7.0 – 59.0 / km2, (  x¯ = 18.8 ± 6.4 / km2), which is consistent with previous research, whereas I report the first density estimate of opossums in an urbanized area during the summer (4.8 ± 1.9 / km2) and winter (13.1 ± 7.5 / km2). At the urban site, raccoon density, presence and hot spots were tied to areas of greater road density with small forested patches and subsequent greater human presence whereas opossum occurrence and hot spots were tied to close proximity to water. At the suburban site, presence and detectability of opossums and raccoons was associated with proximity to water and near small forested patches.This research indicates that the mesopredator community does in fact vary in their density and occurrence within the city of Nacogdoches. Nacogdoches has one of the greatest densities (x¯ = 227 ± 0.46 ind/km2) of coyotes reported in the literature in both urban and nonurban areas. Densities of red fox (1.19 ind/km2), bobcats (x¯ = 0.57 ± 0.32 ind/km2) and raccoons (x¯ = 18.8 ± 6.4 / km2), were consistent with values reported for urban populations, while I also report the first population densities of Virginia opossum (4.8 – 13.1 ind/km 2) and gray fox (x¯ = 0.36 ± 0.19 ind/km 2) living within a small urban area.The ability to see how the densities of certain species changes throughout the landscape will help biologists, city officials and wildlife managers make important decisions regarding educating the public and reducing human – mesopredator contact and zoonotic disease transmission. The remarkable variability of these species to urban landscape features is a testament to their remarkable and seamless adaptability. However, I see the need to preserve or construct wildlife corridors within and/or on the edges of urbanized areas to facilitate the movements of mesopredators away from residential areas and possible human interaction. Although I provide new insights in the urban ecology to all of the focal species, there is still a lot to be learned in urban areas such as gray fox and opossum urban ecology.

TI  - Data to Decision in a Dynamic Ocean: Robust Species Distribution Models and Spatial Decision Frameworks
AU  - Best, Benjamin D.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - In this dissertation, I build robust species distribution models in two case study areas, US Atlantic (Best et al. 2012) and British Columbia (Best et al. 2015), predicting presence and abundance respectively, from scientific surveys. These models are then applied to novel decision frameworks for preemptively suggesting optimal placement of human activities in space and time to minimize ecological impacts: siting for offshore wind energy development, and routing ships to minimize risk of striking whales. Both decision frameworks relate the tradeoff between conservation risk and industry profit with synchronized variable and map views as online spatial decision support systems.For siting offshore wind energy development (OWED) in the U.S. Atlantic (chapter 4), bird density maps are combined across species with weights of OWED sensitivity to collision and displacement and 10 km2 sites are compared against OWED profitability based on average annual wind speed at 90m hub heights and distance to transmission grid. A spatial decision support system enables toggling between the map and tradeoff plot views by site. A selected site can be inspected for sensitivity to a cetaceans throughout the year, so as to capture months of the year which minimize episodic impacts of pre-operational activities such as seismic airgun surveying and pile driving. Routing ships to avoid whale strikes (chapter 5) can be similarly viewed as a tradeoff, but is a different problem spatially. A cumulative cost surface is generated from density surface maps and conservation status of cetaceans, before applying as a resistance surface to calculate least-cost routes between start and end locations, i.e. ports and entrance locations to study areas. Varying a multiplier to the cost surface enables calculation of multiple routes with different costs to conservation of cetaceans versus cost to transportation industry, measured as distance. Similar to the siting chapter, a spatial decisions support system enables toggling between the map and tradeoff plot view of proposed routes. The user can also input arbitrary start and end locations to calculate the tradeoff on the fly.Essential to the input of these decision frameworks are distributions of the species. The two preceding chapters comprise species distribution models from two case study areas, U.S. Atlantic (chapter 2) and British Columbia (chapter 3), predicting presence and density, respectively. Although density is preferred to estimate potential biological removal, per Marine Mammal Protection Act requirements in the U.S., all the necessary parameters, especially distance and angle of observation, are less readily available across publicly mined datasets.In the case of predicting cetacean presence in the U.S. Atlantic (chapter 2), I extracted datasets from the online OBIS-SEAMAP geo-database, and integrated scientific surveys conducted by ship (n=36) and aircraft (n=16), weighting a Generalized Additive Model by minutes surveyed within space-time grid cells to harmonize effort between the two survey platforms. For each of 16 cetacean species guilds, I predicted the probability of occurrence from static environmental variables and time-varying conditions. To generate maps of presence vs. absence, Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves were used to define the optimal threshold that minimizes false positive and false negative error rates. I integrated model outputs, including tables and plots, into an online spatial decision support system, allowing for easy navigation of models by taxon, region, season, and data provider.For predicting cetacean density within the inner waters of British Columbia (chapter 3), I calculated density from systematic, line-transect marine mammal surveys over multiple years and seasons (summer 2004, 2005, 2008, and spring/autumn 2007) conducted by Raincoast Conservation Foundation. Abundance estimates were calculated using two different methods: Conventional Distance Sampling (CDS) and Density Surface Modelling (DSM). CDS generates a single density estimate for each stratum, whereas DSM explicitly models spatial variation and offers potential for greater precision by incorporating environmental predictors. Although DSM yields a more relevant product for the purposes of marine spatial planning, CDS has proven to be useful in cases where there are fewer observations available for seasonal and inter-annual comparison, particularly for the scarcely observed elephant seal. Abundance estimates are provided on a stratum-specific basis. Steller sea lions and harbour seals are further differentiated by ‘hauled out’ and ‘in water’. This information offers the opportunity to assess the risks posed to marine mammals by existing and emerging threats.Starting with marine animal observations at specific coordinates and times, I combine these data with environmental data, often satellite derived, to produce seascape predictions generalizable in space and time. These habitat-based models enable prediction of encounter rates and, in the case of density surface models, abundance that can then be applied to management scenarios. Specific human activities, OWED and shipping, are then compared within a tradeoff decision support framework, enabling interchangeable map and tradeoff plot views. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Several mechanisms are involved in shaping species' distributions, such as abiotic parameters of climate and substrate; biotic interactions with competitors, predators, and mutualists; and geographic considerations that constrain dispersal. Janzen, in 1967, proposed that mountain passes are effectively higher in the Tropics than in temperate areas in terms of their effectiveness in limiting dispersal, creating greater opportunity for isolation of populations, and differentiation into new species. Here, I analyze quantitatively predictions derived from Janzen's theory via 1000 virtual species across South America covering all major environments on the continent, taking into account effects of environmental contiguity and connectivity, effects of seasonality, and presence of known biogeographic barriers (rivers, principally). Virtual species' distributions were obtained by calculating Euclidean distances in ecological space to 1000 seed points, and applying different thresholds of ecological similarity within which the species is allowed to disperse into adjacent pixels. Distributional areas were measured taking into account only mean environmental similarity across the year, and considering the effects of seasonality and known geographic barriers. The results illuminate the situation: distributional areas are smaller in temperate areas when only mean similarity is considered (contra Janzen), but the pattern reverses when seasonality and barriers are considered, confirming and clarifying Janzen's ideas regarding generation of greater biological diversity in tropical areas as compared with temperate areas. Keywords: landscape subdivision, species' distributions, biogeography, virtual species

TI  - Ecological studies of the green space in xiaolan toww,zhongshan city
AU  - Li, Hua Wei
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - This thesis studies the composition of planting species, function and distribution of green space in Xiaolan Town, Zhongshan City. The eco-system of Xiaolan green land is planned by applying relative theories of urban ecology and landscape ecology.Xiaolan Town covers a large variety of garden plants including 105 families and 433 species. Public green land per capita is 5.02m2, and the coverage of greening 33.3%. In the urban area, there are 4 parks occupying 27.6 hm2, which are completely equipped with entertainment facilities and several plots of street green space of 4.35hm2. Street greening begins to take shape. The new urban areas are densely dotted with green trees, which consist of arbors, shrubs and grass. However, the street of the old urban area is narrow and its greenery is simply composed of single layer arbors. The new urban area, Jinju Garden, whose green land accounts for over 30% of the area, possesses central garden and courtyard green belt while the old urban area, Xinyong Road residential area, is densely populated and is crowded with houses with hardly any green land. Some green belts attached to units such as Today Group, Guli Corporation, Yongda Company, Xiaolan Middle School and the local government are well done with greening. Conversely, some schools and factories attach little importance to greening and even have no green land. The nursery in this town covering 8000 hm2 is one of the biggest bases for flower culturing in China, and seedlings are sold all over the country. In general, garden plants in Xiaolan town are abundant and varied, most of which are nursery and flower farmland. Varieties and richness of plants in parks are ranked the second. In contrast, there are much fewer street trees. Efflorescent arbors are widely cultivated in parks, having strong decorating effects. In addition, flowering shrubberies and colorful shrubberies are also effectively planted in parks and streets. Nevertheless, perpendicular greening is seldom used, and species of lianas need to be further researched into.As far as the aesthetic function is concerned, People's Park and Longshan Park are rich in landscape types with great aesthetic effects. The street in old urban areas is narrow with busy traffic with the concentration of CO2 relatively higher, 323.1ppm, while the street in new urban areas is wide with light traffic so that CO2 concentration is lower, only 312.0ppm. As far as concentration of air negative-ion and bacteria are concerned, there is no significant difference between new and old urban areas. On the average, air negative-ion is 224/cm3, the amount of bacteria 2453/m3 and Ci 0.17. Air is slightly polluted.At the bus station, the negative-ion is as low as 92/cm3 and Ci 0.03, which is below 0.09. The amount of bacteria is 2461/m3 and air is seriously polluted.On an average, in the urban area of Xiaolai town the concentration of CO2 amount of bacteria is 1784/m3, air negative-ion 1057/cm3 and air quality index (Ci) 1.12. The environmental air is the cleanest and of good quality in the whole town. As to the ecological function, there are abundant and various garden plants in parks and streets, while relatively fewer and monotonous in schools, residential areas and green land attached to some units. In a word, the coverage rate of green land is low in Xiaolan Town, and the present distribution of green space is out of proportion. According to the climate conditions of Xiaolan town, with the road planning and the urban planning considered, the eco-system of Xiaolan green land is planned to be a pattern of Ring-Net Type, One Line, One Center, One Belt and Two Loops by applying relative theories of urban ecology and landscaping ecology and sticking to the principle of priority to ecology. A linear corridor of Shengping East-Xingning Road is to be constructed from northeast to southwest oblique direction. In the meantime, the urban central park, with the Gym Center centered, is to be built. Moreover, the river green belt is to be expanded along the long dike, the eastern dike and the southern dike. The outside and inside green ring belts are also to be reconstructed. Finally, a suburb ecological shelter belt , which will be connected with the nursery culturing base in the south of the town and developed into a net of southeastern ecological shelter belt in Xiaolan town, is to be built at the windward direction of the town, which is situated at the south of Dongsheng street. The eco-system of the ring-net green space is relatively stable, which makes the serials of landscapes continuous and accessible, thus, Xiaolan town is to be surrounded with green and the ecological environment will be excellent. In accordance with the present distribution of green space and urban planning in this town, some measures have been proposed, which can increase green land areas and percentage of green coverage, and make green land areas bring about maximum ecological benefit as well.

TI  - Analysis of urban heat island climates along the I-85/I-40 corridor in central North Carolina
AU  - Watson, Charles
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Land surface temperature is a significant parameter for identifying micro-climatic changes and their spatial distributions relative to the urban environment. This paper examined and identified the urban heat islands and their spatial and temporal variability along the I-85/I-40 corridor in central North Carolina between 1990 and 2002. More specifically, the study focused on: (1) understanding the behavior of the spectral and thermal signatures of various land cover and land use types and their relationships with UHI development, and (2) applying digital remote sensing techniques to observe and measure the temporal and spatial variability of these surface heat islands. An assemblage of remotely sensed imagery (Landsat data), land surface temperature data, land cover and land use classifications, vegetation indices, and archived weather data was used to create maps, charts and statistical models to indicate and display the magnitude and spatial extent of these thermal climates. The data revealed that urbanization in the I-85/I-40 corridor region increased significantly between 1990 and 2002. Quantitative results from the satellite imagery also indicated that differences in land cover/ land use types, anthropogenic heat sources, and land surface temperature variability likely contributed to a temperature rise in the corridor study area thus thermal climate development.

TI  - Drivers of Predatory Insect Distribution in Urban Greenspaces
AU  - Parker, Denisha M.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The majority of the human population resides in cities. This transformation to an urbanized world has disrupted many species due to habitat disturbance, alien species colonization, and changes in soil and air quality. This reality has raised concerns about the impact of urbanization on insect communities. Many cities are implementing conservation efforts to combat these stressors by transforming habitats to urban farms, pocket prairies, and rain gardens. Although urbanization is a negative driver of insect biodiversity, opportunities exist to implement conservation strategies in “legacy cities” that can support insects and allow us to understand how challenges of urbanization affect their distribution patterns. Legacy cities are cities that have faced significant population decline due to the fall of manufacturing industries. This has resulted in an increase in vacant land that can be revitalized to target key conservation initiatives. My research was focused on how urban habitat transformation affects predatory insects and their community assembly, distribution patterns, and diet. I used lady beetles (Coccinellidae) and long-legged flies (Dolichopodidae) as my target species due to previous evidence illustrating their decline and importance as biological control agents. My key objectives were to determine how the local management and landscape context of urban greenspaces influenced the abundance, richness, and health of these predators. To examine their health, I focused on their ability to locate prey as well as their dietary breadth. In Chapter 1, I found that habitat type had no effect on native lady beetle abundance while local variables within a site such as plant height, biomass and bloom abundance supported a greater richness of lady beetle species. Also, I found that landscape variables such as decreased impervious surface surrounding a site and sites that were surrounded by less isolated greenspace patches supported a greater abundance and richness in lady beetles. In Chapter 2, I found that lady beetle abundance was greater in vacant lots that had been transformed to urban agroecosystems and within urban farms that were surrounded by increased proportions of greenspace and less isolated greenspace patches. Local features such as bloom richness and plant available nitrogen had a negative effect on lady beetle abundance while pollution within a site had a positive effect on lady beetles within urban farms. In Chapter 3, I found that long-legged fly abundance was greater within vacant lots compared to pocket prairies. We also found that local and landscape variables within a site such as increased impervious surface, patch isolation, bloom abundance and plant height resulted in decreased dietary breadth. In Chapter 4, I found that dominant exotic lady beetle predators have a wide dietary breadth in urban landscapes and their prey frequency and dietary breath were influenced by habitat fragmentation and landscape variables within a habitat. Overall, my work showed that the surrounding urban landscape plays an important role in predatory species distributions and diet. Findings also shed light on how habitat transformation and management shape lady beetle and long-legged fly communities. Conservation efforts should focus on the placement and management of urban conservation habitats. However, habitat transformation type should also be targeted to benefit particular species groups.

TI  - If You Feed Them, They Will Come: How the Availability of Food and Cover Within a Zoo Enclosure Increases the Likelihood of Free-Living Birds Within
AU  - Brass, Jake Matthew
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Recently, the role of the modern day zoo has shifted away from ‘Ark’ style conservation towards more in-situ conservation and education. In-situ conservation often focuses upon exotic species and actions taken to conserve these species require extensive funding. A relatively unexplored and less costly form of conservation for zoos to become involved in is the promotion of free-living bird species within zoo grounds. However, within the peer reviewed literature there are few studies which describe free-living species across zoos and only one study (on free-living corvids) attempts to attribute factors within a zoo to the distribution of free-living species. The current study investigates factors affecting free-living bird abundances across multiple zoos. Over a period of seven months, four zoos were studied with 10 enclosures from each zoo being randomly selected for survey. Utilising point counts at an enclosure level, interactions of free-living bird species were recorded. Results highlight both cover within enclosures and the availability of subsidised feeding as significant factors in influencing free-living bird presence within. Further, results demonstrate that factors affecting bird presence and abundance are species specific, with access to subsidised food within an enclosure being significant for both house sparrows (Passer domesticus) and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), but not for the robin (Erithacus rubecula). While the study presented is limited by sample size and survey effort, a novel approach in relating free-living bird presence to enclosure design is described, allowing for future studies to fully explore factors influencing free-living species distributions across zoo grounds. Utilising results from this study, zoos can begin to actively promote native bird conservation and further develop biodiversity action plans designed to encourage native species conservation within zoo grounds.

TI  - Landscape ecology study on ditch-net system in Yangtze river delta--a case study of Yangzhong city, Jiangsu province
AU  - Fan, Jie Wen
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Based on multi-temporal images and social-economic data, a case study was carried out firstly on Dyked fields (low-lying paddy fields surrounding by dykes) landscape and ditch-net system in Yangzhong City, Yangtze River Delta, using landscape ecological approach. The major conclusions are summarized as follows: l. The landscape unit of "field----ditch--village-road" is the dominant feature of the dyked fields landscape. Ditch-net system plays an important role in this kind of landscape, which pattern determines the distribution of the paddy fields and villages. 2. At present, the ditch-net system consists mainly of three components: river reaches, ditches and ponds. As the backbone of ditch-net system, the pattern of the river reaches determines the pattern of the whole system. It has a distinguished feature of artificial river system. Under the impact of urbanization, the ditches and ponds in urban area are decreasing gradually. The widespread herbaceous is the major component of the vegetation in the ditch-net system and the riparian areas. Compared with the plants around ditches and ponds, the species abundance in river riparian is greater. 3. The ditch-net system in Yangzhong has been changed dramatically since the last one hundred years. Images from l935 to l958 indicate that Yangzhong still enjoyed a river system of natural dendritic pattern in that time. Since l980 the river net pattern began to show typical features of artificial river system with straight watercourse, low curvilinearity. The river network  was improved during l980-l994, both of the quantity and the length of the river reaches have increased remarkably The ditches and the ponds near the urban areas show a trend of decrease,. The connectivity and the fluidity of the rivers has declined, the environment of the ditch-net deteriorated, and the ecological security also decreased. 4. Economy development, particularly, industrialization is the major impetus for the reconstruction of river reaches in Yangzhong. The river network in the agricu1tural age is characterized by the dentritic river system, which has been changed to straight watercourse after l970's in the industrial age. After all, the essential cause for these transformations is the change of the relationship between human and the environment. 5. The spatial expansion pattern of Yangzhong city and its ecological reservation area is simulated by the Minimum Cumulative Resistance Model. Through scenario analysis, three scenarios, i.e., "no intervention", "current situation adjustment", and "optima1 pattern", are set up to forecast the development of ditch-net pattern in Yangzhong.

TI  - The forgotten forest: Ecosystem structure, function, and services of forested verges along interstates in Louisville, KY
AU  - Trammell, Tara L. E.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Cities, and the interstates that connect them, alter the local environment by changing the microclimate, elevating pollutant deposition, introducing species, and disturbing ecosystems. How these multiple factors interact to affect natural areas within the urban environment and adjacent to interstates is important to understand. However, the vegetation communities along urban interstates are forgotten in urban and road ecology studies. In previously forested landscapes, remnant vegetation alongside urban interstates are "forgotten forests" that may be extremely beneficial in providing ecosystem services to society and habitat corridors for plant and animal species in the urban environment. I examined forested verges along interstates in Louisville, KY and determined whether introduced plant species, disturbance legacy from interstate construction, current interstate impacts, or the surrounding urban context explained variation in woody plant composition and the underlying soil matrix. A primary production study and a decomposition experiment were conducted to assess the ecosystem function of these forests. The UFORE and CENTURY models were used to estimate ecosystem services (i.e., carbon storage and accumulation, pollutant removal) provided by these forest verges. The tree species composition of these forests was almost entirely native whereas exotic invasive species were more frequent in the understory (i.e., shrubs and vines). An exotic invasive shrub, Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii), was the most important species explaining variation in woody vegetation composition. Amur honeysuckle may further enhance its own establishment by reducing native tree regeneration via lower light levels below honeysuckle shrubs, by increasing carbon reserves through an extended growing season, and by increasing nitrogen release from decaying honeysuckle litter during early spring before other species may access the nitrogen. The legacy of planting honeysuckle post-construction and disturbing soils during construction has lasting effects on the forest composition. Exotic species, including honeysuckle, were more prevalent and native tree regeneration was lower on disturbed soils. The combined impact of honeysuckle presence and soil disturbance diminished ecosystem services provided by these forests and the future ability of these forests to provide ecosystem services is expected to decline over time with the continued dominance of honeysuckle. Altered forest composition and diminished ecosystem services in locations where interstate construction activities occurred demonstrates the lasting effects of past human activity on forest composition. However, the existence of native stands along urban interstates provides hope that naturally regenerating forests can persist in the urban environment along interstate corridors. To promote the ability of native woody species to maintain their populations along forested highway verges, management needs to reduce exotic invasive species and to plant native species. These "forgotten forests" contribute many ecological services and they deserve recognition for their value.

TI  - Resource Selection and Landscape Connectivity of the Ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) in Southern Texas
AU  - Veals, Amanda Marie
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Wildlife species across the globe are faced with landscapes that are becoming increasingly difficult to traverse because of habitat loss and degradation. Roadway networks are widespread and significant anthropogenic influences on the landscape that can have profound impacts on wildlife populations. Understanding how organisms perceive barriers to movement, or landscape resistance, is important for the conservation and management of wildlife populations threatened by habitat fragmentation and loss. The ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) is an endangered felid in the United States, with remnant populations in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of southern Texas. An estimated 95% of native Tamaulipan thornshrub had been cleared for agriculture and urban development which has led to the LRGV being classified as one of the most rapidly developing urban areas in the United States today. This development corresponded to an increase in road collisions and a decrease in available habitat for ocelots. To guide efforts to mitigate ocelot road mortalities, I have modeled probability of landscape use by ocelots as a function of environmental resources (e.g., vegetation cover) and road characteristics at the individual and population level. I modeled resource selection from animal location data collected via VHF and GPS radio collars from 1982–2017. I quantified spatio-temporal consistent habitat for ocelots compared to land ownership. I evaluated differences in individual behavior to habitat and road variables using functional response analyses. I evaluated potential movement pathways between habitat patches and across roads based on landscape resistance scenarios using spatially absorbing Markov chains. This project will inform the placement of future road crossing structures to decrease ocelot-vehicle collisions and increase landscape permeability for this endangered species. This information will assist Texas Department of Transportation with ocelot conservation objectives.

TI  - Information on Emergent Insect Associated Tree Diseases Including Epidemiological Studies of Drippy Blight Disease of Oak and Thousand Cankers Disease of Walnut
AU  - Sitz, Rachael A.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Two emergent disease complexes called drippy blight and thousand cankers have become injurious to hardwood trees in communities across the urban corridor of Colorado. In order to better understand these disease complexes, studies were initiated to identify the causal agents, symptomology, and epidemiology of drippy blight disease as well as determine if multiple fungi were involved in thousand cankers disease.Chapter I, published in the Journal of Arboriculture and Urban Forestry, provides information on the basic biology of drippy blight disease. This article explains the signs and symptoms of drippy blight, and shows that the bacterium Lonsdalea quercina subsp.  quercina is able to cause the disease. Finally, it was noted that a kermes scale insect was abundant on all diseased oaks, but its role as a vector is unknown. Overall, this research documents the microbe and insect causal agents in this disease complex. These findings are biologically significant as the isolated bacterium was able to produce disease on several species of sapling red oaks. This, taken into consideration with other diseases caused by Lonsdalea quercina, implies that this bacterium has the potential to become widespread.Chapter II provides a detailed life history of Allokermes galliformis,  the insect causal agent in drippy blight disease. Management decisions to mitigate the effects of insect damage are largely based on an understanding of the life cycle. This research documents periods when A. galliformis  may be most exposed and vulnerable to controls and notes areas of the tree where it inflicts damage when feeding. Therefore, the information provided in this chapter can serve as a guide for more informed decisions when considering management of drippy blight-affected trees.Chapter III considers what insects may be involved in the dissemination of Lonsdalea quercina subsp. quercina from oaks with symptoms of drippy blight disease. Although kermes scales are the most consistent and abundant insects found in association with drippy blight disease, other more mobile insects are frequently observed on diseased trees and it was hypothesized that these may play a role in spreading the bacterial pathogen within trees and to new trees. After testing insects collected on diseased oak trees for bacterial contamination, various insects were documented to carry the bacterium, providing insight into ways the disease may move in a population of susceptible hosts.Chapter IV, published in Plant Disease, involves a tree disease characterized by an insect and fungal pathogen interaction, thousand cankers disease of walnut. This study investigates whether genetically distinct isolates of the fungal pathogen Geosmithia morbida vary in pathogenicity. Also examined was whether Fusarium solani, commonly found on diseased trees, may contribute to production of thousand cankers disease. A range of Geosmithia morbida isolates were tested alone and in combination with a Fusarium solani isolate to determine the relative contribution of each fungal pathogen to thousand cankers disease. Importantly, in Colorado Geosmithia morbida does not interact synergistically with F. solani.Overall, this research is the first to describe the emergent disease complex drippy blight and provides information to better understand the bacterial and insect causal agents. Furthermore, the investigations of drippy blight of red oak and thousand cankers disease of walnut, improve our understanding of the epidemiology of woody plant diseases that involve both arthropod and pathogen partners.

TI  - Investigating the small public urban open spaces at high-density cities: a case study of hong kong
AU  - Lau, Hiu Ming
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Many researches have shown that urban parks can enhance the quality of life, which is a key factor of building a sustainable city. Hong Kong, as one of the most densely populated financial city in the world, has severely low urban park density. Instead, a large number of small public urban open spaces (SPUOS) are scattered within the city fabrics. This paper therefore aims to study the design and functions of these SPUOS. It is also hoped that find out whether a network of connected small open spaces can compensate for a large urban park. After reviewing the history of urban parks in Hong Kong. It is believed that the multitude of SPUOS is the result of poor urban planning and imperfect urban renewal schemes during the early occupation by the British Government. These SPUOS are usually around 1000 to 1500 m2 large in size and can be abundantly found along adjacent streets. For the design of the SPUOS, benches are usually the only facility installed and the vegetation is of poor quality. The connectivity of SPUOS located within the study area in the Yau Tsim Mong District is investigated with the use of graph theory and connectivity indices. The result has shown that these SPUOS in the study area have a high degree of connectivity. They are further compared with a larger urban park located nearby. Based on the comparisons and other prior researches, a conclusion has been drawn that size of a park is not the major concern of park users but rather its facilities and design. It is believed that a network of connected SPUOS might serve the local community better due to their locations. However, they should not be able to entirely replace large urban parks since they have fewer amenities provided. The SPUOS are found to have rather different functions to the society than what urban parks are commonly expected. Their environment and economic functions are constrained mainly by the poor design and the locations. An interview with the representative of a non-government organization has been made to further understand their social functions. The interviewee believes that SPUOS now mainly act as social hubs and living rooms for senior citizens. This statement is then verified by the result of a prior survey and some other researches. This is due to the combination of aging population structure, exploding population growth, and expanding poverty gap. Lastly, a comparative study has been made on the small public urban green spaces (SPUGS) in Copenhagen. The SPUGS can attract visitors of different age group from other far neighborhoods. Despite than fact that there is cultural difference and citizens from these two cities have different lifestyles, a better design of the pocket park might be the reason of why it becomes an attractive natural meeting point in the central Copenhagen for all age-groups visitors. Based on all the investigations and findings, suggestions have been made to improve the quality of SPUOS in Hong Kong.

TI  - The persistence of prairie dogs within urban habitat islands in the Colorado Front Range
AU  - Magle, Seth B.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - I investigated the ecology of black-tailed prairie dogs in fragmented urban habitat in the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area. My study area consisted of 387 habitat fragments, 54 of which were colonized by prairie dogs. These fragments were highly isolated and surrounded by roads and development, and my studies represent the first studies of prairie dogs in highly urban environments. I evaluate the interactions between urban prairie dogs and vegetation and find that prairie dogs in urban areas tend to be present on sites with high grass coverage, though the grass layer is reduced in the immediate vicinity of the colonies. Prairie dogs interact with vegetation similarly in urban areas and natural habitat, providing evidence that the ecological role of prairie dogs as keystone species may be partly retained in human-dominated landscapes. I provide the first study using mark-resight methodology to evaluate the local population density of prairie dogs, and find it more accurate than traditional methods of burrow counts or visual indices. I observed extremely high densities for prairie dogs in urban settings, probably because of a fence effect where animals are restricted to available habitat due to the difficulty of dispersal in an urban environment. I compare connectivity metrics to determine which have the best predictive power for the occurrence of colonies in this area, and find that complex methods incorporating area of patches and cost-weighted distance surfaces perform best. In general, inclusion of biological information improves the ability of metrics to predict wildlife distribution. This study provides a rare opportunity to compare the performance of connectivity metrics using empirical data on wildlife distribution and will be of benefit to future spatial and landscape analyses. Finally, I evaluate a series of landscape and local variables to determine which have the most importance to the distribution of prairie dogs across our study system. Fragment area and local variables such as litter coverage have the most explanatory power, but all tested metrics had importance to prairie dog occurrence. My results can be used to target potential habitat for prairie dog conservation and to inform future research on wildlife in urban areas.

AB  - Urban areas are often considered adverse environments for wildlife communities given that the colonization and establishment of local species pools are disrupted by biotic and abiotic changes at different spatial scales such as the introduction of invasive species, periodic mowing, and changes in soil and air quality. Although the number of people residing in cities has increased in the last century, over 300 cities worldwide have shrunk due to prolonged economic decline and population loss, resulting in thousands of newly available greenspaces scattered throughout cities. Consequently, interest in urban greenspaces as sites for conservation has grown considerably, raising questions about the ability of these habitats to support wildlife. As novel ecosystems, urban areas represent a set of new challenges for local species pools, yet the mechanisms driving community assembly processes within cities is a major knowledge gap. My work focused on identifying species distributions, patterns, and processes leading to the successful establishment arthropods in cities. For this, I chose to work with beetle and spider assemblages as they are considered biological indicators of environmental changes at small and large spatial scales and are taxonomically and functionally diverse predatory groups.In Chapter 1, my objective was to determine how urban greenspaces management and design impacts Carabidae and Staphylinidae beetles using taxonomic and life-history trait approaches. I found that ecological and morphological traits were good indicators of how beetles were responding to greenspace management strategies. Most species were negatively associated with building structures, while undisturbed habitats supported more hygrophilous and brachypterous beetle populations.In Chapter 2, I investigated the importance of local and landscape characteristics on spider communities using taxonomic and functional diversity approaches. I found that Pardosa milvina (Lycosidae) was the most abundant spider in our system. Plant height favored larger species, while mowing frequency benefited small spiders, leading to lower than expected functional alpha and beta diversity of spider communities. I also found that patch isolation and impervious surface increased the functional dissimilarity of spider communities.In Chapter 3, I examined the dietary niche breadth and niche overlap of the generalist spider P. milvina using DNA gut-content analysis. I found that dietary niche breadth was not greater within urban pockets, and Diptera, Hemiptera, and Collembola were often preyed by this urban-adapted spider. I also found that P. milvina predation patterns were driven by foraging strategies, suggesting that taxonomic identify and nutritional content were more important than prey availability.In Chapter 4, my goal was to determine the habitat characteristics and landscape variables influencing spider functional groups directly and indirectly. Using structural equation modeling, I found that web spiders were negatively correlated with plant biomass, hunting spiders were positively associated with available prey breadth, and both spider functional groups were positively correlated with heavy-metal pollution in the soil.In summary, my work showed that urban greenspace management and design play important roles shaping beetle and spider communities within cities. I also highlighted the importance of using multi-trophic and molecular approaches coupled with multivariate methodologies to disentangle local food web interactions and elucidate the mechanisms shaping community assembly processes of urban species pools. Investments in managed greenspaces that require infrequent mowing (i.e. urban prairies) will enhance the populations of beneficial arthropods, such as spiders and beetles, and beautify local neighborhoods.

TI  - Habitat interactions structuring songbird communities across forest -urban edges
AU  - MacDonald-Beyers, Kristi
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urban habitats vary greatly in the resources they provide for birds and other wildlife. Few species entirely avoid either human or forest habitats and for species that regularly utilize both, the two habitat types (forest and urban) may interact in complex ways to shape the animal communities at the forest-urban ecotone. I studied habitat relations to songbird community structure across the urban-forest edge in a heavily urbanized watershed in the New York metropolitan region. My research was designed to provide specific knowledge about the natural and human-built habitat components that maintain avian richness and abundance. I found that mature, intact forests with large trees and greater vertical complexity were the most valuable to birds breeding in and migrating through urban forests. Also, shrubby habitats along forest edges bolstered bird richness because they provide habitat for specialized shrub-nesting species. In my study, urban forests of a broad range of sizes and habitat conditions were associated with increased bird diversity in adjacent human habitats up to at least 0.2 Km from their edges. A high density of large trees in the urban matrix was related to increased avian richness outside the forest in urban neighborhoods. Also, a high density of large trees in the urban matrix was associated with higher richness and abundance of breeding and migrating birds inside adjacent forests. Because residential areas have the highest density as well as variety of large trees relative to other types of urban land use, they also contain the greatest richness of birds. This study demonstrates that local habitat is very important in structuring the bird community both inside forests as well as in the urban matrix but adjacent habitat also affects bird community structure. Forest area and isolation are relatively unimportant in shaping bird communities at the forest-urban ecotone. These findings suggest a wide-range of conservation practices, including forest preservation, management of shrubby edges, and planting and caring for a variety of long-lived trees in urban neighborhoods, that would maintain a rich bird community in urban regions.

TI  - Spatial movements and ecology of mountain lions in southern Arizona
AU  - Nicholson, Kerry Lynn
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Managing wildlife in urban areas is increasingly necessary for wildlife conservation. Large carnivores like mountain lions ( Puma concolor) present a particular challenge to managers because of public safety and the polarizing emotional reactions to human-lion encounters. Intensive development and conversion of large open spaces to small properties and subdivisions has caused increased habitat loss, fragmentation and encroachment. Preserving movement corridors for access to habitat patches is important in maintaining landscape connectivity to ensure viable populations adjacent to urban areas. Because mountain lion habitat is often adjacent to urbanization in Arizona and lions traverse large landscapes, mountain lions are ideal models to examine how human alteration of habitats influences their life history characteristics and ability to adapt to a variety of environments. The objective of this study was to examine the ecology and spatial movements of mountain lions surrounding urban areas. We studied habitat selection, urban use by mountain lions, spatial movements and overlap, genetic relatedness, feline disease, and ectoparasites of mountain lions in southern Arizona.

TI  - Status and Conservation of the Grass Snake in Jersey
AU  - Ward, Robert John
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Global biodiversity losses are being driven by anthropogenic pressures; the most pervasive of which is habitat loss resulting in fragmentation and population isolation. These issues are prevalent throughout Europe due to high intensity agriculture and increasing human population densities. Limitations imposed by resources and the secretive lifestyles of many species hinder the ability of conservationists to undertake status assessments and identify conservation actions. This thesis investigates the threats to an isolated population of grass snakes Natrix helvetica on the island of Jersey, providing recommendations for conservation management and recovery, whilst testing the suitability of tools for monitoring cryptic species. Grass snakes were historically widespread throughout Jersey; however, anthropogenic influences have restricted their distribution to the west and southwest. Furthermore, recent monitoring efforts have detected few individuals and their status is unknown.Intensive surveys to locate individuals combined with occupancy and N-mixture (abundance) models identified continued occupancy of semi-natural sites in the island's west and southwest, but also highlighted poor detectability of the species unless utilising a large survey effort. Therefore, a large amount of effort is required to determine absence of snakes, and declines in the population cannot be detected with reasonable power. Occupancy models were more reliable than N-mixture models, particularly due to the risks of closure violation when estimating abundance. Nonetheless, N-mixture models estimated an abundance of 48 snakes (95% CI: 23?1279) across the study sites. Radio-tracking also provided evidence for low detection rates. Additionally snakes demonstrated small ranges (mean: 2.48 ha ± 3.54 SD), site fidelity, preferences for ranges close to paths and compost heaps, but avoided crossing roads. Snakes were positively associated with structurally complex habitats including rough grassland, dense scrub and gorse at multiple spatial scales, but negatively with open and wooded habitats.Species distribution modelling indicated similar habitat preferences to radio-tracking and poor suitability of agricultural habitats. Areas close to amphibian prey populations were also suitable whereas those with high road densities were not. A fifth of Jersey contained priority conservation areas, however almost 90% of these areas do not receive statutory protection. Those in the west and southwest should be prioritised for protection due to their proximity to extant subpopulations. Mitochondrial genes identified the population to belong to a western lineage of grass snakes Natrix helvetica helvetica, with a probable natural colonisation prior to separation from northwest France. Within Jersey, microsatellite markers identified three subpopulations, with significant differentiation between snakes in the south and west. This coincides with a dense urban area, through which connectivity needs improvement.The Jersey grass snake population can be classified as regionally Vulnerable (D2) under IUCN guidelines. The study illustrates how nature reserves are important for maintaining isolated subpopulations and the potential avenues by which statutory protection, sympathetic management practices and efforts to improve inter-reserve connectivity can contribute to conservation objectives.

The first part of the research investigates the relationship between forest bird abundance and the surrounding landscape characteristics, especially, forest area and its spatial configuration in urban regions at multiple scales.

TI  - Effects of fragmentation and urbanization on forest bird communities in the Region of Waterloo, 1990-1991
AU  - Friesen, Lyle Edgar
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Forest bird communities in 41 urban and rural woodlots in the Region of Waterloo, Ontario were examined to assess the effects of fragmentation and urbanization on different classes of bird communities--neotropical migrants, short-distance migrants, and permanent residents--and to interpret the findings in terms of theories of ecological stress. The relationships between groups and individual species of forest birds and forest size, isolation of forest patches from other forests, urban-rural location, and vegetation structure were analyzed using stepwise regression.The number of species and the abundance of individual species were higher in larger than in smaller forests, and in rural than in urban forests, because of the increased presence of neotropical migrants. Many neotropical species were absent or uncommon both in small forests and in urban forests (small and large), but usually were present in large rural forests. In contrast, the diversity and abundance of short-distance migrants and permanent residents remained constant in both small and large, and in urban and rural, forests.Neotropical migrants account for at least 60 percent of all breeding individuals in extensive forest tracts. Measured against this standard, many forests in the Region of Waterloo, especially the urban ones, have suffered a significant loss of integrity.

TI  - Process Oriented Infrastructure for Climate-Driven Forest Migration Through Cities
AU  - Han, Qiyao
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Global climate change is expected to shift the geographical distribution of tree species worldwide. Increasing empirical evidence has emerged showing that many tree species are already moving toward higher latitudes to track suitable climatic conditions. Yet, such movement cannot guarantee their survival, especially if the accessibility of suitable climates is highly constrained by species dispersal capabilities and human-created barriers. In order to assist forest migration, many efforts have been made to translocate tree species from their native ranges to locations where the climate is projected to be suitable in the future (known as assisted migration). However, there are concerns that such translocations may not be successful and may lead to unpredictable adverse consequences. This is because uncertainties in species’ distribution projections could cause a risk of moving species too far or not far enough. Within this context, this study develops a process-oriented approach to map and design urban landscapes to facilitate forest migration under climate change. The focus lies on the connectivity of urban landscapes for effective seed dispersal. Since the migration of trees is a continuing process that does not rely on their future distributions, a process-oriented approach could avoid projections of species’ future distributions and thus might be more feasible and manageable, as well as more robust to future climate change, than the current “goal-oriented” strategy of assisted migration. This study is guided by the following three research questions: (1) Why should we consider cities in the process of forest migration and what roles can urban landscapes play in the process? (2) How can forest trees migrate through urban areas, and more specifically, how can urban landscapes, as seed sources or stepping stones, contribute to the process? (3) How to design urban green infrastructure to facilitate forest migration and, more specifically, to promote seed dispersal and species’ range expansion across urban areas? A three-phase research methodology, which includes a transdisciplinary literature review, a mapping-based approach and a research-by-design methodology, is proposed to answer each of the three research questions, respectively. The Greater Manchester area, which is one of the most urbanised regions in the UK, is selected as a case study site. Eurasian jays, Eurasian siskins, and coal tits are selected as the main seed dispersal agents in the study area. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of urban landscapes to facilitate climatedriven forest migration through cities. By collecting and integrating knowledge and II information from multiple disciplines, this study suggests that cities could provide suitable climatic (urban heat islands) and environmental conditions for the persistence of outlier populations at higher latitudes than their native ranges, thereby shortening or even eliminating migration lags in tree species. The proposed process-oriented approach maps potential migration flows between urban woodlands in Greater Manchester, from the perspective of seed dispersal. Furthermore, by testing different afforestation strategies, this study reveals that the processes of forest migration at a metropolitan scale can be facilitated by creating small, distributed but functional-connected green spaces at site scales. The process-oriented approach can be used by designers to re-visualise urban landscapes as a series of interconnected flow channels, which in turn allows for a more piecemeal form of landscape design to improve urban green infrastructure for climate adaptation. Moreover, this study will encourage researchers who currently work in climate-driven species migration to consider taking advantage of urban landscapes and will promote the cooperation between biologists, foresters, designers, and managers in urban planting to cope with the rapidly changing climate.

TI  - Essays in the Non-Separability Between Environmental Resources and Human Nutrition, and the Role of Markets in Mitigating the Linkage: Evidence from Malawi and Nepal
AU  - Kim, Kichan
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - In these essays, I study the soil-to-human mineral transmission and the role of markets in mitigating the linkages in the context of Nepal and Malawi in the first two chapters. And, in the last chapter I explore the adverse impact of rural connectivity on children's unhealthy dietary habits in rural Nepal.The first chapter examines the negative child health impacts of soil zinc (Zn) deficiency in Nepal. Soil Zn deficiency limits the Zn concentration in food crops, leading many to speculate that it underlies human Zn deficiency and child stunting, globally and particularly in South Asia. We find strong evidence that soil Zn deficiency does have a causal impact on child stunting in Nepal's Tarai region, the breadbasket of the country. Using conservative causal bounds, we find that a 1 part per million increase in plant-available soil Zn --- achievable with application of Zn-enriched fertilizer --- decreases child stunting by 9-10 percentage points in the long run, and 4-7 percentage points in the short run. Multiple statistical sensitivity tests indicate that these relationship are not manufactured by omitted, relevant variables. The association is strongest in the most isolated areas and in seasons where dependence on food crops is strongest, as expected if soil Zn deficiency reduces local crop Zn concentration and through that human Zn intake and status.The second chapter investigates the linkage between human selenium (Se) status and the local vs nearby market Se environment, and the role of markets in mitigating the linkage in Malawi. Using nationally representative data on human micronutrient concentration and gridded data on soil characteristics, we find that local soil type (with implications for crop Se concentration) and proximity to Lake Malawi (which holds Se-rich fish) are strongly predictive of human Se status. Furthermore, markets seem to aggregate Se from their catchment area and supply that Se to nearby families. Human Se intake and status therefore appears to depend on both the hyper-local environmental availability of Se and the availability of Se around their nearest market.The globalization of food markets is accompanied by a nutritional and epidemiological transition in developing countries — often manifest as increased dietary diversity but also increased consumption of sugars and fats and an accompanying increase in obesity and diabetes. The last chapter examines how improved rural connectivity catalyzes the nutritional transition among rural households in Nepal. Recent large-scale road and bridge construction concentrated in the urban areas has also dramatically connected rural with urban areas, historically isolated due to Nepal’s dramatic topography. Working with OpenStreetMap data, I identify plausibly exogenous reductions in travel time between rural communities and major cities due to the \textit{non-local} construction. I find that the improved rural connectivity to the closest food trading city or Kathmandu improves child dietary diversity score, mainly through increased consumption of legumes and nuts. At the same time, however, the rural connectivity to Kathmandu, the city where majority of junk foods are produced and distributed, rather increases child junk food consumption and child wasting accordingly, with no evidence on stunting. Therefore, the overall impact of the improved rural connectivity appears to be negative.

TI  - Generalized Texture Models for Detecting High-Level Structures in Remotely Sensed Images
AU  - Doğrusöz, Emel
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - With the rapid increase in the amount and resolution of remotely sensed image data, automatic extraction and classification of information obtained from such images have been an important problem in the field of pattern recognition since remotely sensed imagery is a critical resource for diverse fields such as urban land use monitoring and management, GIS and mapping, environmental change and agricultural and ecological studies. This thesis proposes statistical and structural texture models for detecting high-level structures in remotely sensed images. The high-level structures correspond to complex geospatial objects with characteristic spatial layouts in a region. As opposed to the existing approaches that are based on classifying images using pixel level methods, we propose to use simple geospatial objects as textural primitives and exploit their spatial patterns. This representation can be viewed as a “generalized texture” measure where the image elements of interest are urban primitives instead of the traditional case of pixels. The spatial patterns we are interested in correspond to the regular and irregular arrangements of these primitives within neighborhoods.The methodology we propose in this thesis has two steps. First, the primitives of interest are detected using spectral, textural and morphological features with one-class classifiers. Then, the spatial patterns of these primitives are modeled. At this step, either a statistical or a structural approach can be followed. In the statistical approach, analysis of the spatial arrangement of the primitives is done by co-occurrence-based spatial domain features and Fourier spectrum-based frequency domain features. These features are used to quantify the likelihood of presence of the focused object in the image region being analyzed. In the structural approach, a graph-theoretic representation is proposed where the primitives form the nodes of a graph and the neighborhood information is obtained through Voronoi tessellation of the image scene. Next, the graph is clustered by thresholding its minimum spanning tree and the resulting clusters are classified as regular or irregular by examining the distributions of the angles between neighboring nodes.The algorithms proposed in this thesis are illustrated with the detection of two geospatial objects: settlement areas and harbors. The first step in the modeling of these objects is the detection of primitives such as buildings for settlement areas, and boats and water for harbors. In the second step, both statistical and structural approaches are illustrated for the modeling of the spatial patterns of these objects. Results of the experiments on high-resolution Ikonos satellite imagery and DOQQ aerial imagery show that the proposed techniques can be used for detecting the presence of geospatial objects in large remote sensing image datasets.

TI  - Population genomic inference of ecology, conservation, evolution, and demographic history of Atlantic seahorses and pipefishes (Syngnathidae)
AU  - Boehm, J.T.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - In the Atlantic Ocean powerful directional ocean currents can play a significant role in the formation and persistence of marine species. Syngnathidae fishes have a sparse fossil record, high morphological plasticity, and many of these species are difficult to observe in the wild, therefore they frequently lack life history information and the status of regional lineages and species designations are often obscure. In this dissertation I explore the ecology, evolution, and conservation of primarily Atlantic seahorses (Hippocampus) and pipefish (Syngnathus) in four core chapters, using differing genetic datasets ranging from mitochondrial DNA to genome-wide RAD sequences. Most Synganthids have the potential to disperse passively by rafting on floating vegetation, and are direct developers, which is thought to limit their active mobility, yet many species have widespread distributions. The majority of genetic research on Syngnathids fishes has focused on Indo-Pacific species, however the Atlantic Ocean is home to dozens of species of pipefishes from nine genera and roughly 1/5th of the world's seahorses species. In Chapter 1, I use six loci to infer the species tree for all Atlantic seahorses and infer the demographic history and evolution of the "Hippocampus erectus complex." The results of this study support the establishment of an ancestral population of the H. erectus complex in the Americas, followed by the Amazon River outflow splitting it into Caribbean/North American H. erectus and South American H. patagonicus at a time of increased sedimentation and outflow. Following this split, colonization occurred across the Atlantic via the Gulf Stream currents with subsequent trans-Atlantic isolation. Based on the results of Chapter 1, the species H. erectus exhibited a panmictic genetic structure from Latin America to temperate New York waters. However, inhabitants of the temperate region are considered by some ecologists to be tropical vagrants that only arrive during warm seasons from the southern provinces and perish as temperatures decline. Contrary to the findings of Chapter 1, in Chapter 2, I use thousands of RADseq loci and show strong support that temperate inhabitants are genetically diverged from southern populations and are composed of an isolated and persistent ancestral gene pool. The aim of Chapter 3 is to investigate how major current forces as well as climatic and geographic processes have shaped the evolutionary and demographic history of western Atlantic seahorses (Hippocampus) and pipefishes (Syngnathus). This Chapter takes a comparative approach across five codistributed species (two seahorses and three pipefishes). Genomic patterns of subpopulation divergence and post-divergence gene flow may be shared amongst fish species with similar life history traits, however ecological differences (i.e., macroclimatic tolerance and rafting propensity) may impact the rates of gene exchange and/or isolation times between subpopulations. The result of this study show how directional ocean currents and the life history trait of rafting propensity impacts population divergence and connectivity, and predicts gene flow directionality and magnitude in four out of five of the focal taxa. Lastly in Chapter 4, I use a molecular forensics approach to track the U.S. dried seahorse trade. Due to global exploitation, the genus Hippocampus are the only fish to have all species listed under the Convention of International trade of endangered species (CITES). Millions of individuals are traded each year for the use in traditional Chinese medicine as well as for souvenirs and crafts. Using "DNA barcoding," while mentoring high school and undergraduate students, we identified and compared specimens collected from two primary U.S. dried seahorse end-markets: 1) traditional Chinese medicine and, 2) Internet and coastal souvenir retailers. The results of this study found a significant contrast in both the species composition and size of individuals being sold between each market.

TI  - Using Roadkill as a Lens to Understand Animal Movement and Mortality
AU  - Jonaitis, Lauren Adele
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - This study took place within the Oak Openings Region, a biodiversity hotspot in northwestern Ohio. The Oak Openings was created during the Cenozoic period, a time where glaciers continuously moved across Ohio, creating valleys and riverbeds. When the Wisconsin glaciers melted back from Ohio around 14,000 years ago, waters were released into multiple lakes with sandy beaches. Overtime, these sandy beaches started to became dunes inundated by rainwater that could not drain past the clayey till and bedrock ground layer. Water that would stand between the clay layer and sandy dunes provided moisture to eventually support oak savanna habitat. Between the sand ridges, rainwater would saturate the land, which created open areas of wet prairie (Higgins, 2003; Grigore, 2004). The combination of oak savanna habitat and open wet prairie gave this region the name of "Oak Openings" (Grigore, 2004).Today, the Oak Openings looks quite different as a result of the economic development and agricultural pursuits along the Toledo-Detroit corridor. This area is highly fragmented by roads, agricultural fields and urban/residential development. Roughly 45% of the Oak Openings Region contains urban and suburban development and roughly a quarter of the region has been converted to areas of agricultural production (Schetter and Root, 2011). However, there are still remnants of wild lands that exist west and south of the city of Toledo. This area is Ohio's largest single surficial sand covering which is 1-12 meters thick and consists of wet lowland and sand ridge terrain with elevations up to 210 meters above sea level. This region is approximately 8 kilometers wide and 32 kilometers long (Higgins, 2003; Figure 1) and contains oak savanna, oak woodland and wet prairie habitats on post glacial beach ridges and swales and covers 478 km2 (The Nature Conservancy, 2001; Grigore, 2004; Schetter and Root, 2011).The Oak Openings Region contains one third of all of Ohio's endangered plant communities as well as many rare animals and early successional ecosystems. However, only about 10% of the Oak Openings Region is in protected areas (Abella et al., 2007). Early successional ecosystems in this area (e.g. oak savannas and prairies) were historically maintained by disturbances such as fire. Now, these disturbances are mimicked by management activities such as prescribed fires and thinning. In Ohio there are two preserves known as the Oak Openings Preserve and Maumee State Forest, which are the largest protected areas and support many different vertebrate populations and species. However, these two preserves are also highly fragmented by agricultural fields, roadways, railways, and trails that may limit animal movement and increase road mortality. Therefore, it is critical to better understand animal movement and road mortality in this area to promote viable populations, increase our knowledge of vertebrate movement and prevent the killing of vertebrate species by vehicle collisions. This thesis has two foci, each as the topic of stand-alone chapters. The overarching goal is to predict animal movement and identify the features that may be managed to reduce road mortality, which is likely to be applicable to other reserves in human-dominated landscapes. The objective of the first chapter is to understand what factors influence animal movements and road mortality. Specifically, the first chapter examines how structural features of roads, environmental variables, spatial factors and land cover types can influence vertebrate movement (e.g. mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians) and road mortality on roads surrounding and within the Oak Openings Preserve and Maumee State Forest. Road surveys as well as visual surveys on trails within both protected areas were utilized to account for animal movement, dispersal and mortality.The second chapter focuses on mammal movement patterns and road mortality on roads surrounding and within the Oak Openings Preserve and Maumee State Forest. Similar to chapter I, road and visual surveys along trails were utilized to understand mammal movement and mortality. Mammals were found as roadkill more than any other taxa, so it is important to specifically understand what factors influence these trends. Again, structural features of roads, environmental variables, spatial factors and land cover types were all analyzed to understand what influences mammal movement and mortality.

T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Intense road development and urbanization have fragmented the natural landscapeacross coastal Southern California since the middle of the 20th century. As mitigationefforts, in 1992 the Natural Community Conservation Plan and Habitat Conservation Plans Iand II (NCCP&HCP I and II) allocated reserves and non-reserve open spaces to connectthese fragmented natural habitats and foster the coexistence of wildlife and people inOrange County. Here, I aim to evaluate the effectiveness of two established wildlifecorridors (the Sand Canyon Wash Corridor and the Bonita Creek Corridor) in southernOrange County, linking two large reserve areas (Figure 1). I conducted camera trappingsurveys by using 11 cameras placed along these two linkage corridors. Additionally, Iobtained more photographic data at 10 different camera stations within the Irvine RanchWater District (IRWD) San Joaquin Marsh & Wildlife Sanctuary. Then, I calculated RelativeAbundance Index (RAI) values based on the photographic capture rates of key vertebratespecies of concern for each location. I compared the current RAI values with values from astudy by Lyren et al. (2008) to illustrate the changes over a decade at three subsets oflocations. I also obtained wildlife-vehicle collision (WVC) data from 2005 to 2019 from theCity of Irvine Local Animal Services. I found an average of two bobcat mortalities event peryear occurred until 2015. After 2015, no bobcat detection or roadkill mortality is observed.Additionally, the number of coyote detections has increased by almost 700% over a decadeat these locations. It is likely that this result reflects urban coyotes’ greater ability tofunction in a changing environment and (greater) resilience to anthropogenic effects. Thelong-term success of wildlife corridors requires understanding how the regional environment may influence species composition and potential use of these linkage elements reserve designs over extended periods.

TI  - Air Quality Implications of Future Scenarios for Oil and Natural Gas Production and Use in the Western United States
AU  - Nsanzineza, Rene
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Since 2005, electricity generation in the United States has shifted from coal to increasing reliance on natural gas power plants and renewable sources while the production of oil and gas has increased to satisfy the increased demand. This shift in the energy landscape has air quality implications for local and regional air quality in the U.S., especially in the Rocky Mountain (RM) region which has abundant supplies of oil and gas and a large share of electricity generation from coal. This study aims to examine the prospective impacts of energy shifts in this region on electricity generation, emissions, ozone, and human health from 2011 to 2030. We focus on the RM region since it has several areas facing challenges to meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone. This study builds up on a previous study by McLeod et al. (2014) who applied the MARKAL (MARKet ALlocation) model and EPA’s 9-region U.S. energy system database to investigate several future scenarios, finding the least cost means of satisfying demand for energy in each scenario and the associated annual emissions in the U.S. and the RM region out to the year 2050. We adapted four scenarios from McLeod et al.’s study. The baseline scenario assumes a supply and prices of natural gas based on reference projections made in 2013 while the greenhouse gas (GHG) fees scenario assumes a supply of natural gas similar to the baseline scenario but applies fees to the emissions of CO2 and CH4. Two contrasting scenarios are the cheap gas scenario which assumes a high supply of natural gas at lower prices while the costly gas scenario assumes a low supply of natural gas at higher prices. We downscale emissions from electricity generation temporally and spatially to capture the effects of changes in the small-scale emissions on the local and regional air quality. The electricity generation mix is estimated using the PLEXOS dispatch model on an hourly basis for a one-year period. The estimated generation from coal and natural gas power plants in each scenario is combined with unit specific emissions rates to determine the future emissions from power plants. Annual oil and gas production in the RM region are downscaled to the basin level to determine basin specific scaling factors used to estimate future emissions scenarios from oil and gas production. The estimated emissions from power plants and oil and gas production as well as emissions from other energy sectors are processed with the SMOKE software package and then incorporated into the CAMx chemistry and transport model to determine the change in ozone associated with changes in emissions in the different scenarios. A health benefits analysis tool, BenMAP-CE, is used with the ozone modeling results to determine the human health impacts and their monetary value associated with the change in ozone. We find that electricity production in the western U.S. from coal and natural gas increases from 2011 to 2030 along with generation from renewable energy as electricity demand increases from population growth. Contrary, to the trend in generation, NOx emissions from electricity production decrease by 33% over the same period as a result of retirement of old inefficient coal-fired plants, power plant refueling, and emissions control application. Within the western U.S, electricity generation and emissions vary by state and time of the year. Oil and gas production increases from 2011 to 2030 corresponding to increased demand, hence NOx and VOC emissions from oil and gas production increase by 5% and 58%, respectively, despite the emissions reductions from regulations imposed on the oil and gas sector. The net tradeoffs in these emissions trends lead to reductions in the summer MDA8 ozone as high as 8 ppb from 2011 to 2030, especially downwind of power plants and oil and gas basins in the 4 km CAMx domain. However, elevated ozone persists in urban areas such as Denver and Salt Lake City during peak time periods. The reduction in ozone from 2011 to 2030 is estimated to result in 303 to 360 reductions in premature deaths per year in the 4 km CAMx domain, in addition to reductions of morbidities associated with ozone. Between scenarios, electricity generation from natural gas displaces some coal generation in the cheap gas scenario compared to the 2030 baseline scenario, while renewable energy capacity expansion, particularly wind energy, displaces generation from coal and natural gas in the costly gas and the GHG fees scenarios. A similar trend is observed in the oil and gas production with production increasing in the cheap gas scenario and decreasing in the costly gas and the GHG fees scenarios.

TI  - Spatial models of morning commute consistent with realistic traffic behavior
AU  - Lago, Alejandro
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urban planners are increasingly concerned about the sprawling suburban development in metropolitan areas around the world, which they often blame for growing traffic congestion and excessive highway investment needs. This dissertation seeks to shed light on this issue by studying the relationship between morning commute congestion and urban form. The causes and consequences of traffic congestion have been extensively studied in the economics and engineering literatures. Unfortunately, most conclusions have been drawn from very idealized models, which either fail to consider adequately the spatial nature of congestion, by neglecting the effects of physical queues and merging interactions, or overlook dynamic aspects, such as commuters' departure time adaptation during the rush-hour. To better capture the spatial-dynamic nature of morning commute traffic, this dissertation proposes a new analytical framework that explicitly incorporates  spatially distributed commuter origins, realistic traffic behavior and commuter timing decisions. The work combines the departure-time equilibrium theory (as first proposed by Vickrey [1969]) with the spatial model of traffic dynamics of Newell [1993] and the model of merge traffic interactions of Daganzo [1994, 1995a]. Focus is placed on idealized urban configurations, where traffic behavior can be studied analytically and general insights can be gained. We first study the equilibrium problem in a stylized two-origin network. This enables us to understand the fundamental role of merging bottlenecks and queue spillovers when commuters have different origins. The analysis is then extended to model congestion behavior in long freeway corridors and monocentric cities. We develop an exact procedure to solve the dynamic departure-time equilibrium for single-destination freeway tree networks. Solutions are characterized for cases with and without an alternative street network. The results show that the location-based congestion cost is very dependent on the spatial behavior of queues and that congestion can be reduced by altering the freeway access priorities given to different origins. At the same time, urban sprawl is shown to contribute not only to larger travelled distances but also to increased overall delays. Sprawl effects, however, are not as severe as often assumed. We finally propose some closed-form continuous approximations for the location-based congestion cost. These formulae provide an improved and simple representation of the dependence of congestion on the spatial distribution of population that can be easily incorporated to study policy issues. The design of more effective measures to reduce congestion and control urban development is an immediate example.

TI  - Do Open Spaces Provide Refuge for Anurans Within an Urban Matrix?
AU  - Hutto, David Ruple, Jr.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urbanization is among the largest threats to amphibian populations through habitat fragmentation, isolation, and outright destruction. Urban open spaces, such as parks and golf courses, have the potential to provide amphibians with suitable habitat within an urbanized matrix. During the spring and summer of 2018, I conducted dip net surveys and active call surveys to determine the presence and abundance of anurans at 51 wetland sites within the Piedmont ecoregion of South Carolina. Nearly one-third of these wetlands were located within urban open spaces, while the others were situated along a rural – urban gradient. Impervious surface and road density surrounding the wetlands were measured at a core habitat scale (300 m) and average maximum migration scale (750 m). Urban Open Space wetlands were found to have levels of impervious surface similar to High Urbanization wetlands at the larger scale and were intermediate between Low and High Urbanization wetlands at the smaller scale. Road densities were higher at Urban Open Space wetlands at both scales compared to Low and High Urbanization sites. Species richness decreased as impervious surface and road density increased among all wetlands. Wetland category was not a significant driver explaining species richness, but β-diversity was higher among Urban Open Space wetlands than either Low or High Urbanization wetlands. I also evaluated species-specific relative abundances as a function of wetland type (Urban Open Space, High Urbanization, or Low Urbanization), several within-wetland variables and two landscape-scale covariates. No species were influenced by wetland type, however impervious surface had a negative influence on the abundance of one species whereas road density negatively affected three species of anurans. Urban Open Space wetlands did not appear to increase suitability for anurans relative to urban wetlands, instead showing higher variability in species composition; perhaps attributable to the diversity among sites represented in the Urban Open Space category. Conservation efforts conducted within open spaces should attempt to focus on issues not only at an individual wetland scale, but also at larger scales surrounding the open spaces themselves. Understanding how urbanization at various spatial scales effects anuran species can bolster amphibian conservation efforts in urban matrices.

TI  - Pond -breeding amphibians in a highly modified landscape: Habitat modeling, landscape genetics, and predictions of landscape change
AU  - Goldberg, Caren S.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - In the second half of the 20th century, landscape change on the terrestrial surface of the Earth occurred at an unprecedented rate, leading to habitat loss and degradation for thousands of species. Amphibians are currently the most imperiled of all vertebrate taxa and are often considered good indicators of ecosystem function because of their vulnerability to habitat degradation Despite this, several native amphibian species currently persist in the highly modified Palouse Prairie ecoregion of North America. We modeled the landscape associations of the most common of these species at a home range and population connectivity scale, predicted how this landscape is likely to change in the future, and assessed what the impacts of those changes would be on the persistence of these amphibian populations. First, we developed a novel survey-based method for predicting landscape change, compared it to a standard trend-based model, and found that rural housing units were predicted to increase by 31%, forests to decrease by 11%, agricultural lands by 7%, and grasslands by 4% over the following decade. We then developed habitat models for Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris), Pacific treefrogs (Pseudacris regilla), and long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) which indicated that forest practices will likely to be detrimental to long-toed salamanders and beneficial to Pacific treefrogs, and that Columbia spotted frogs had a high level of vulnerability to predicted development patterns. Next, we used an empirical example from this area to show how removing full siblings from larval population genetic could reduce bias. Finally, we used a comparative landscape genetic approach to model the connectivity of Columbia spotted frogs and long-toed salamanders. For both species, urban and rural developed land cover provided the highest landscape resistances. Resistance values for long-toed salamanders followed a moisture gradient, with forest providing the lowest resistance. For Columbia spotted frogs, however, agriculture provided the least resistance, with grassland and forest associated with much higher resistance values. These results emphasize the need for species-specific data to inform management and conservation planning, and also contribute to a growing body of work on the landscape associations and multiple dispersal strategies of pond-breeding amphibians globally.

TI  - Studies on population ecology of badger in suburb of shanghai
AU  - Hao, Hui
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorBadger (Meles meles) is a medium-size animal, it belongs to Mammalia, Carnivora, Mustelidae,Meles, only species of Meles. As the key mammal of the suburb in Shanghai, the badger plays important role in biodiversity. In history, there were relatively abundant mammals in Shanghai, but in recent decades of developing into an international city, the habitat of badger was losing and the badger was in a state of distinct. So conservation of the badger in Shanghai, and recovering the population of badger is important to protect the biodiversity of Shanghai and build a modern ecological city. Researches on the distribution pattern, population number, habitat selection, activity, food habit and behaviour of badger were carried out in March 2006 to April 2009 in Shanghai. The results showed that: 1. The activities of badgers in the suburbs of Shanghai were observed by infrared video from January 2007 to January 2008. The results showed that the badger emergences from sett were concentrated between 19∶00 and 22∶00, the activity of returns to sett were concentrated between 2∶00 and 4∶00. The average activity time of badger in the outside of sett was about 6 hours per day. There were significant differences in the seasonal duration of the activities. In fall, the activities in the outside of sett for the duration were 8. 23 hours, while the winter activities for the shortest duration was 3.11hours. Research showed that the badger lived in the suburbs of Shanghai had no hibernation. 2. The distribution and density of badger in Shanghai was estimated by gathering information about the location of badger setts with a questionnaire survey. Setts were sited preferentially in bamboo forest habitat. Badgers are separated into 6 areas of 2 counties, they are: Xidu and Zhuanghang of Fengxian, Tianma Mountain, Sheshan, Tagang, Nanmen of Songjiang County. The mean minimum group size was 4 badgers, so we estimated the population of badger in Shanghai is 28. 3. We investigated the direction, size, use or not, and shelter of the entrances, then discussed the relation between these factors and population and status of badger. 4. To investigate the agricultural damage, a questionnaire survey was conducted in 2007 to determine the extent and significance of badger damage in Fengxian. Badger damage was widespread, but its incidence was highly dependent on crop type. Results showed that the large number of crop types was damaged as follows: melons, corn, and peanut. The farthest farm was 750m away from the main sett. 5. It is the right time that some measures should be taken to conserve wild badger now. Based on the results of our research, we give some suggestion. Firstly, we should revise the local law of protecting badger. Secondly, we should protect the habitat of badger. Thirdly, we should construct the ecological corridor for the communication of population gene. At last we should reset the local nature reserve to conserve the

TI  - Spatial Population Genomics and Landscape Ecology of Urban Brown Rats (Rattus norvegicus)
AU  - Combs, Matthew Aaron
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Spatial patterns of genetic variation provide a lens into the ecological and evolutionary responses of wildlife populations to landscape heterogeneity, though our understanding of urban landscapes remains limited. Further, it remains unclear whether species exhibit parallel responses to independent landscapes. Commensal rodents are widely distributed within cities and around the world, offering a useful model for understanding the influence of cities on gene flow, genetic drift, and habitat distribution. Here I study the population genetics and landscape ecology of brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) in four urban landscapes, New York City (NYC), New Orleans (NOL), Salvador (SAL), Vancouver (VAN), using genome-wide SNPs to understand the influence of urban landscapes on eco-evolutionary processes governing their distribution and functional connectivity.Rat populations in each city exhibited significant genetic discontinuities that coincide with landscape features, despite widespread isolation-by-distance processes. Genetic variation in NYC and SAL rats was clinal, but I identified genetic clusters separated by areas with lower genetic diversity and reduced migration. Rats in NOL and SAL exhibited stark genetic structure that coincided with a canal and major roadways, respectively. I identified spatially restricted dispersal in all populations leading to parallel decays in spatial autocorrelation with increased distance. Habitat suitability modeling revealed a consistent response of rat distribution to human population density, income, and building characteristics. Landscape genetic modeling indicated that models incorporating features of the built physical environment consistently predict gene flow processes, though unique landscape effects were identified in each city, particularly at local spatial scales. Further, I found that habitat suitability and genetic connectivity were uncoupled (i.e., driven by different factors) and habitat is rarely the best predictor of gene flow for urban rats. My results demonstrate the utility of multi-landscape studies in identifying generalized trends across populations, with implications for the management of invasive pest populations. Ultimately, this dissertation improves our understanding of the influence of urban landscapes on neutral evolutionary processes in widely distributed species and the ecology of commensal rodents.

T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Based on theoretical analysis and argumentation, comprehensive principles for evaluating the green land of parks and the plant disposition were established, including high biodiversity, harmonious intra-species and interspecies relationship with reasonable ecological structure, multiple functions of ecological service, harmonious human-nature relationship, and the self-maintenance, self-adjustment, self-cycling, self-renewal, self-perfection and self-upgrading. Seven principles were put forward for evaluating the plant disposition, including paying attentions to the habits and interspecific relationship of plants, spatial disposition of plants, temporal disposition of plants, aesthetic effects of plant disposition, comprehensive application of pose, texture, color, aroma, sound, light and so on, humanities and artistic conception, and the harmony between plants and other landscape elements.According to the field investigations in the green lands of 80 parks in Shanghai, and the theoretical analysis, the characteristics of the green lands of parks in Shanghai was discussed, which included the following aspects: the inheritance of plant disposition techniques of classical Chinese gardens, the absorption of advanced theories of modern western parks, the contemporary developments in the design of green lands of parks in Shanghai, and the scarcity of animal biodiversity. As to the third characteristic, the developments referred to the increase of plant biodiversity, the changes in life form spectrum, and the diversity of ecological structure and functions. The flora and species composition of trees, the frequency of commonly used trees and the applications of native trees in the green lands of parks in Shanghai were analyzed. The composition of native species in the green lands of parks in Shanghai according to families and genera was analyzed and compared with those in the whole area in Shanghai. The current situation of life form spectrum in the green lands of parks in Shanghai was analyzed and compared with that in the regional vegetation in Tiantong National Forest Park. The variety of structure and function of plant disposition in the green lands of parks in Shanghai was analyzed in terms of  tree height, light and soil requirements, resistibility to poisonous air. To solve the scarcity of animal biodiversity, some suggestions for the attraction and protection of wild animals were put forward, and the disposition of bird plants and nectar plants in the community were recommended.Some ecological countermeasures for the future development in the green lands of parks in Shanghai were discussed. Parks as the pool of biodiversity and the place for animal, plant and microbe to rest, reproduce, assembly and diffuse, should act as nodes of urban landscape ecosystem, so as to maximize the ecological effects at the scale of urban landscape ecosystem. Outside the parks, the other green lands in the city should serve as the corridors between the landscape nodes, the biodiversity patches.

TI  - Water Level and Discharge Dynamics in Human-Affected Lowland Rivers
AU  - Geertsema, Tjitske  Janelle
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - The current water policy aims to accelerate discharge, which is causing problems, such as eutrophication, reduced (aquatic) biodiversity, drastic decline in groundwater levels, increased water levels during floods and prolonged droughts, predominantly in urban areas and densely populated lowland areas. To address and prevent these problems, the water policy should concentrate more on water retention. Few of the existing strategies towards water retention have been evaluated regarding their functionality and quantified impacts on the regional water system. Specifically, regional water systems in lowland areas are defined as areas that freely drain in large rivers and where groundwater is an important component in the water system. In this context, the research focusses on the local and regional effects of increasing water levels and delaying discharge in regional water systems. The current practice of stream restoration involves the construction of meander bends and insertion of wood in streams, asserting local controls on stream conveyance capacity and on water level and discharge dynamics. Backwater effects resulting from sharp bends and the obstruction by wood in streams are currently poorly understood, and are considered key sources of uncertainty in predicting the effects of stream restoration and water retention measures. Regionally, streams are typically analysed in isolation from the downstream river system, with the risk of simultaneous occurrence of discharge peaks in the river and its tributaries. Within a catchment, groundwater variation near rivers is rarely being analysed as a response to surface water dynamics. Progress in understanding the impacts of stream restoration on discharge dynamics requires more knowledge about simultaneous occurrence of discharge peaks in a river and its tributaries, and a deeper understanding of response time dependence on open water-subsurface water exchange. This thesis discusses the topics wood in streams (chapter 2), flow in sharp bends (chapter 3), groundwater reaction as result of instant lowering of river water levels (chapter 4) and the simultaneous occurrence of discharge peaks in a main river and its tributaries (chapter 5).Wood-induced backwater effects are influenced by discharge, wood configuration and channel geometry. Model simulations and field experiments in chapter 2 show that the backwater effect increases with increasing discharge up to a maximum, after which the backwater effect decreases with discharge. A sensitivity analysis of this model showed that the width of the wood patch is responsible for the peak in the backwater elevation, and the height of the wood is responsible for the discharge at which the highest backwater effect is observed. Moreover, the characteristics of this relation depend on wood configuration and channel geometry. These two components may change over time, exerting an impact on the backwater response to discharge condition. Significant morphological adjustments and wood degradation were observed within two to five years after wood placement.Horizontal recirculation zones are common flow patterns in sharp river bends. Chapter 3 shows that these recirculation zones are not stable with increasing discharge. The Essche Stroom showed similar flow patterns for similar discharge conditions. The Dommel River, on the contrary, showed two distinct flow patterns, one with and one without flow recirculation. With a simple model for bend flow and the one-dimensional depth-\\averaged momentum equation, it is shown that for the flow pattern without flow recirculation, the flow decelerates according to what may be expected from channel curvature and cross-section variation. For the flow pattern where flow recirculation is present, the model is less easily applicable. Chapter 3 discusses the delicate processes that may or may not result in flow reversal in the Dommel River, highlighting the instability of flow recirculation zones. The water surface topography substantially influences the flow patterns in bends, however, it is too small to be directly measured with standard instrumentation, and is only locally observed in the bends. Two and three dimensional effects, such as lateral redistribution of momentum and the interaction with scour holes, will influence the horizontal flow recirculation. These effects should be incorporated in future analysis to explain the unexpected transience of flow recirculation in the Dommel River.When the Maas water levels were instantaneously reduced, the groundwater levels responded immediately. Chapter 4 shows that the groundwater levels close to the river were reduced by 1.5 meters within 3 days. The groundwater level reduction was negligible at 2 km distance from the river. The rapid response of groundwater levels in the Maas area is encouraging to rapidly create additional groundwater storage. Groundwater storage can be created by lowering river water levels, and thereby lowering groundwater levels, before an intense rainfall event. When the groundwater storage is dynamically managed, the timing and height of the discharge peaks can be controlled, and water levels can be maintained at higher levels during periods without intense rainfall. In addition to groundwater storage, the scaling effects of hydraulic soil parameters were investigated in chapter 4, by comparing the hydraulic soil parameters of local pumping tests and of the regional river lowering in the Meuse. The available soil parameters of the pumping test are preferably used to understand the regional groundwater response using the physically-based Boussinesq equations. Chapter 4, however, shows that the measured specific yield from the pumping tests is not comparable with the specific yield obtained from the regional lowering of the Meuse water levels. The currently available data can therefore not be easily used to understand river-groundwater exchange. It can be concluded that the rapid response of groundwater levels to an instantaneous lowering of the river water levels is promising to store large amounts of water, but scale effects have to be taken into account for application at regional scale.Extreme discharge events at the confluence of the River Meuse and two joining lowland tributaries are studied, introducing a new analysis method based on dynamic time warping. The method offers robust means of tracing individual discharge waves in discharge time series collected throughout a catchment. Chapter 5 shows that the precipitation patterns in the catchment areas are spatially correlated. Spatial correlation of the precipitation patterns is a prerequisite for simultaneous occurrence at the confluence. From a comparison of the nine highest discharge waves in the main stream and the joining lowland tributaries, it follows that the exact timing of the discharge peaks and the probability of simultaneous occurrence of discharge peaks are of little relevance to flood risk. The duration of the discharge wave in the main stream is larger compared to the time lags between discharge peaks in the main channel and the tributaries. Simultaneous occurrence of discharge peaks result in the backwater effects in the tributaries. The backwater height can increase to 1.5~m over 4km from the confluence in the Dommel and Aa rivers.Water level and discharge dynamics can change as result of human intervention in lowland river systems. It is important to understand the dynamics in detail before interventions are applied in order to improve, for instance, water retention. A number of interventions have been studied in detail in this thesis. It can be concluded from these studies that: local water level increase can be created by obstruction and/or increased friction.local discharge delay cannot be achieved by creating sharp bends, despite the additional advection and diffusion resulting from a longer thalweg. regional water level increase can be obtained by preserving higher surface water and groundwater levels during conditions without severe rain events and by managing surface water levels before severe rain events.regional discharge delay has a marginal negative impact on the simultaneous occurrence of flood peaks at lowland confluences despite the locally increased water levels in the tributaries.With the help of these insights, local and regional effects on water level and discharge dynamics can be better understood, and by continuous learning from the water system, a liveable environment can be maintained for humans and other biota.

An urban-rural gradient was used to assess the impact of land use on riparian forests along the Assiniboine River. Above ground flora and seed bank were examined and species- and guild-level indicators of disturbance identified. Twenty-five sites were categorized according to land use, and included urban, suburban, high intensity rural, low intensity rural, and relatively high quality reference forests. Changes in herbaceous, shrub, and tree species composition and diversity were related to landscape level measures of disturbance that included the proportion of surrounding land use, forest patch size, connectivity, and area:perimeter ratio. These results suggest that landscape measures of disturbance, and related changes in environment, may be confidently used to assess the impacts of land use along urban-rural gradients. Opportunistic and vulnerable species, and their associated guilds can be used as effective indicators of disturbance and forest integrity and be used to select and monitor forests for further protection or active management.

AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorAbstract The fast urbanization in our country has drastically in the need of community construction, and dissects many important ecological corridors, shrinks Lake Wetland, losses ecological diversity. Even though, community ecological planning has been paid widespread attention, we can't get rid of traditional thinking mode of "figure-ground" relation in our community planning and design, buildings are often refined finely as "figure", just then natural ecological landscape patch, such as Greenland is designed as "ground" as buildings collateral "filling stuff", so community natural ecosystem can't refined and screening finely. Constructing community eco-network is to change tradition ways of planning and design, using landscape ecology principle, natural ecosystem and landscape patch should be brought into community general planning design. We could use ecological corridor as a tie to link those relatively independent landscape patch into a continuous and integrated eco-network which is also viewed as the skeleton of community. Such the structure has the functions of natural ecological service, life-form variety protection, stroll about or rest of sight, and directing the development of community space into a rational way. The thesis contains five parts: Section one introduces the research background, points out three deficiencies on wholeness of ecosystem, regional characters of eco-elements and diversity of eco-composition, which are ubiquitous in community ecological planning, meanwhile, the development of community eco-network planning study of both internal and international communities are described, and the research frame is established. Section two introduces the theory and method, it specifies the definition of some relative concepts, discusses the connotation of community eco-network, takes some principles as the supports of the research by introducing landscape ecology, and meanwhile translates the pattern "patch, corridor, matrix" into "node, route, ace", which is fit for community ecosystem, then lays out the mechanism, "joint, choroid, structure" for the constructing community ecosystem. Section three is the core part of thesis, starting form community ecosystem character, this paper expounds three important eco-components constructing "virgin, symbiotic, regenerated" and put them into studying on the construction and space structure of community eco-network all though, bases on the analysis about problems of community ecological planning and components of community ecosystem. Then, based on conversion platform and research mechanism, this part studies on the construction of community eco-network "joint, choroid" from the "node, route" of landscape patch and corridor, studies on the space structure of community eco-network "structure" from the "face" of landscape matrix. At this time, it also classifies community eco-nodes into intersection nodes, attached nodes, unattached nodes; classifies eco-routes into water routes, plant routes; classifies eco-construction into core, axis and complexness, and then couples of ecosystem and community space. Section four takes the community ecological planning of Longxiang villa Huludao city as an example. This work introduces three aspects (i.e. node, route, face) to link ecosystem to community space, further leading to a rational community planning and development. Conclusions are in section five with constraints discussed, and a summery of directions for future work.   Key words: Landscape ecology principle, Community eco-network, Conversion platform, Research

T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorAs a complicated system, the urban spatial structure is influenced by natural, social and economic factors on its formation and development. By making use of modern information technology and the multiple-discipline-crossing method to research spatial distribution of all component elements of the urban spatial structure and interrelationship and interaction among these elements in space and time, in different spatial scales, it can provide scientific basis and technical support for building organic urban spatial structure and formulating appropriate development strategies, which is very significant to maintain sustainable urban development. Due to above-mentioned significance, this paper systematically analyzes characteristics and evolutions of the spatial structure of Wuhan urban circle in different spatial scales through modern information technology and by establishing effective methods to analyze the urban spatial structure, and acquires major research results as following: (1)On the basis of describing concepts, component elements and scale compositions of the urban spatial structure, commenting on urban spatial structural modes, and summing up quantitative research methods of urban spatial structure in different spatial scales, it establishes the hierarchical analytical method of urban spatial structure, which is based on remote sensing image and can be used in different spatial scales, according to the relationship between remote sensing image and geographical spatial information. This method explains distribution characteristics of thermal-environment-based urban thematic information and connectivity of areas covered by this information by extracting urban thematic information from multi-source remote sensing image, defining multiple distribution modes for thermal-environment-based urban thematic information and constructing topological structure diagram made up of areas covered by urban thematic information and ways to connect these areas. (2)On the basis of analyzing characteristics of multi-source remote sensing data and qualitative and quantitative concepts involved in applying these characteristic to urban research, it realizes extraction of urban thematic information based on remote sensing image through extraction and quantification of concepts about urban building and vegetation coverage in remote sensing image by using the cloud model, which can be used to converse qualitative concepts into quantitative expression. It proves that this method is effective to extract urban thematic information through precision comparison with the maximum likelihood method. During researching distribution characteristics of thermal-environment-based urban thematic information, it recognizes distribution modes of thermal environment of urban thematic information through quantitative definition, and also analyzes characteristics and reasons of distribution of thermal environment of urban thematic information according to recognized results. (3)On the basis of discussing evolution rules of urban spatial structure, it analyzes application superiority and range of modern information technology in the research of evolution rules, and also describes change patterns of urban spatial structure and quantitative analytical method. Besides, it further analyzes characteristics and evolution of Wuhan urban road network by introducing into the complex network theory, mapping the urban road network, which represents the basic framework of urban spatial structure, as complex network, and using statistical characteristics parameters of complex network. (4)This paper systematically analyzes spatial structure and evolution of Wuhan urban circle in different spatial scales by using multi-source remote sensing image and various research methods. A number of suggestions have been proposed according to the above anaylsis results. Within the spatial scale of urban circle, it adopts models of economic relation intensity and strength to divide spatial levels of Wuhan urban circle, and also incorporates the complex network theory to analyze network characteristics of constructed economic relation network of urban circle. Besides, it uses the fractal theory to analyze spatial fractal characteristics of the urban system of Wuhan urban circle from two aspects, namely, rank-scale structure and spatial distribution. In addition, it makes use of MODIS remote sensing image and the hierarchical analytical method to research spatial structural characteristics of Wuhan urban circle. Within the city-wide spatial scale, it performs qualitative analysis to change patterns of Wuhan urban spatial structure since 1949, and also uses two-period TM/ETM+ remote sensing images and corresponding social and economic data to perform quantitative analysis to changes of time and space during 1991-2002, and further compares changes on distribution modes of thermal environment in areas covered by urban buildings and urban and rural topological structure diagrams of these two periods. Within the spatial scale of main city zone, it adopts the landscape index method to analyze composition and spatial allocation of urban greenland landscape pattern in the main city zone, and also uses ASTER image and the hierarchical analytical method to research distribution characteristics and connectivity of thermal environment through extraction of urban greenland in the Wuhan main city

TI  - Understanding the Ecological Challenges in California Protected Areas Through the Lens of Remote Sensing Technologies
AU  - Jia, Shenyue
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Protected area (PA), usually built to address the potential ecological pressure from different sources, aims to sustain, protect, and maintain the wilderness of nature for ecological, economic, and scenic purposes. Establishing, maintaining, and expanding the monitor network of PAs helps to enhance the ecological and biological value of these areas, especially in the light of species decline and habitat degradation. Intensively monitored and regulated through various administrative agencies, California keeps one of the best maintained network of PAs in the world, which supports various studies to address the significant threats to the preservation of wilderness from the projected warming climate and pressure from human development, including water deficit and prolonged drought, abnormality in wildfires, urban sprawl, and light pollution.With the help of satellite remote sensing technologies and geospatial analysis, we can overcome the limitation of data availability in traditional ecological studies and expand the study of PAs to a continuous gradient both in time and space. This dissertation aims to develop a comprehensive understanding through remote sensing technologies on three significant and linked ecological disturbance in California PAs, including the change of land cover, the dynamic of wildfire, and the extent and intensity of human activity reflected by stable nighttime light. Exploiting various of remote sensing observation and its derivatives, this study investigated the three topics through trend, seasonality, abnormality, spatial distribution, and hotspot of change to provide a cost-effective and repeatable studying paradigm for PA managers to better understand the past and present situation, as well as the ecological challenges of PAs. In addition, it also supplemented the study of PAs as a case study focusing on a non-tropic ecosystem, which usually involves greater interaction with human thus faces ecological pressure at a higher level.The analysis on land cover dynamics and change from 2000 to 2015 found that many protected areas in California have experienced an increase of brownness since 2000. PAs with a higher coverage of greenness are associated with a higher temporal variability, mostly because of the more complex life cycle of green vegetation and the sensitivity to the disturbance, possibly due to a drying climate regime. Partly linked to the gradual influence from the drying climate, the change in the regime of wildfire may cause a more drastic change in land cover, through the removal of aboveground biomass and its influence on the post-wildfire regrowth. In the study focusing on California PAs from 2000 to 2013, a shift in wildfire-prone land cover and season was observed starting from 2008, while the wildfires southern California shrubland during the fall season became nearly extinct and the northern California evergreen forest wildfires in the late spring increased, partly explained by the recent loss of available fuel in biomass and the increase of potential of ignition in evergreen forest as a result of prolonged drought. Most burned areas experienced a significant weakening of the immediate growing season, although the influence from fire on local landscape decayed over time, which became irrelevant after five years on average. The lower fuel moisture and a more intensive removal of aboveground biomass makes shrubs more sensitive in time, with a shorter period for biomass removal by fire and a greater delay in the start and peak of post-fire growing season.The long-enduring and sometimes intensive disturbance from human activity, especially from the development can be even more disastrous than wildfire in damaging the aboveground biomass by interrupting the natural nutrient and mass circulation, thus brings more fundamental and sometimes irreversible consequences to ecosystems. However, after decades of protection, especially the removal of settlements in side PAs, land management strategies may have bored beneficial fruits to reduce the negative effects from historical human disturbance. As a good proxy of human activity and development, the historical records of stable nighttime light from 1992 to 2012 tracked the temporal change and spatial migration of hotspot of human activity inside California PAs. A decrease of lit area at night inside PAs occurred from 1992 to 2012, with a turning point around 2004 when the relatively sharp decrease started from became more gradual thereafter. Besides, area covered by higher stable nighttime light not only shrank, but also retreated from the area with high wilderness. If solidly confirmed by other socioeconomic variable, the above finding demonstrated the effectiveness of PA establishment and the fruits of multiple conservation strategies kept for decades.The investigation of three major disturbances to the wilderness of California PAs provided an example of exploiting the cost-effective and continuously available observation of the Earth surface at a regional level to understand the ecological challenges of PAs. The findings can help the National Park Service and other related agencies of PA administration in the review, adjustment, and proposal of regulations and policies regarding to PAs. Future work and analysis can be focused on improving the accuracy of predictive models involved the analysis, either by concentrating on the difference between categories of protection, or through a better understanding on the related ecological process and mechanisms to identify or develop better explanatory variables. In addition, when conducting analysis on PAs, the buffer area adjacent to PAs cannot be ignored, which is an important source of disturbance to PAs as well as an ecological corridor that links nearby PAs into clusters. Considering the great diversity in the landscape of PAs, the analytical results can be aggregated and interpreted by different ecoregions to derive more accessible guidance to local policy makers.

TI  - Cultivating and Characterizing Electroactive Microbial Communities using Bioelectrochemical Systems and Metagenomics
AU  - Arbour, Tyler Joseph
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Certain microbes have the remarkable ability to form direct electronic connections with their extracellular environment, harnessing existing redox gradients to drive their own life processes. The recognition of extracellular electron transfer (EET) as a widespread microbial phenomenon that plays an important role in biogeochemistry is recent, and is accompanied by new understanding of how this process impacts physical and chemical characteristics of the environment. Our current knowledge of the mechanisms and the microbial physiology behind EET is based largely on studies of two well studied isolates, Geobacter sulfurreducens and Shewanella oneidensis. Nevertheless, nature is not well represented by isolated organisms. Identification of the larger set of “electroactive” microbes from across much of the phylogenetic spectrum is critical for complete understanding of microbial controls on redox chemistry in natural environments. Genomic information for these organisms has the potential to expand our understanding of the mechanisms of growth that rely upon EET. This information should be particularly useful if it is obtained in an experimental setting that enables manipulation of redox potential. In this doctoral dissertation, microbial electrochemical cells (MXCs) are employed as a tool to select for and characterize the subset of electroactive microbial community members. The main advantage of MXCs is that they use a solid, inert electrode in place of natural minerals as the terminal electron acceptor (TEA) for microbial metabolism. This enables direct control over the redox potential and overcomes the chemical heterogeneity and variation in surface reactivity of natural minerals. Experiments are inoculated using microbial communities from subsurface sediments sampled from a major Department of Energy research site near the town of Rifle, Colorado, USA. This site has general relevance as a riparian zone aquifer; prior research has generated thousands of microbial genomes from samples collected across multiple subsurface environment types and impacted by a variety of experimental manipulations (including acetate amendment). Complex electroactive microbial communities, including anode-associated biofilms, are cultivated in the MXC experiments using the sediment inoculum and acetate as the electron donor. Experiments include two independent MXCs with duplicate compartments. In Chapter 1, we subjected the biofilms and associated planktonic cells to large changes in anode redox potentials and characterized the responses of these organisms using electrochemical methods. Community composition was documented using 16S rRNA gene-based surveys. Our results strongly suggested that TEA redox potential is an important determinant of the makeup of mineral-respiring communities. Chapter 2 tested the hypothesis that microbes populating anode-associated biofilms electrochemically adapt to imposed redox conditions on a short timescale (minutes). Through a series of cyclic voltammetry experiments, the overall biofilm responses to changing redox potential were observed. The voltammetry data suggested inherent redox flexibility in the microbial EET network, very likely conferred by multiheme c-type cytochromes known to be critical for extracellular respiration in most known electroactive organisms. We performed a series of experiments that allowed us to rule out within-biofilm pH changes as the cause for the observed shifts. In Chapter 3, metagenomic methods were employed to genomically characterize the MXC microbial communities. Genome-resolved metagenomics enabled the recovery of comprehensive genetic information for the majority of community members without the requirement for isolation of individual organisms. Hundreds of near-complete genomes were reconstructed and used to compare biofilm and planktonic organisms across experimental systems. Specifically, biofilm vs. planktonic growth preferences for most organisms were defined. Importantly, genomes were used to predict genes that could enable growth on electrodes. Biofilm-associated bacteria are known to have genomes that are strongly enriched in multiheme cytochromes and to have associated outer-membrane porins implicated in electron transfer complexes. In addition to organisms related to known electroactive species, several novel organisms (from an expected undiversity of phyla) were implicated in electrode growth. The extensive metagenomic data assembled previously from the Rifle site was used to link specific organisms enriched in the MXCs to those from Rifle, and thereby yielding insights into their roles in the natural environment. Coupling electrochemical methods with genomic and metagenomic DNA sequencing provided new information about microbial growth in MXCs and the response of the overall microbial community to imposed changes in redox potential. The hypothesis that TEA (and by proxy, mineral) redox potential shapes community composition was supported. The question of adaptation of microbes to changing environmental redox conditions was investigated in community context, without reliance on isolation methods. The findings suggested that large multiheme cytochromes evolved to cope with intrinsic mineral redox heterogeneity and fluctuating redox conditions. Finally, genome-resolved metagenomics enabled the identification of novel, putatively electroactive organisms functioning as part of complex microbial consortia, with widely different metabolisms from those of the well-studied type strains. This contributes to basic knowledge of EET in natural systems, and opens new avenues for the application of electroactive organisms in biologically-based technology, engineering and remediation.

TI  - Feral pig management in southern Texas: A landscape genetics approach
AU  - Delgado-Acevedo, Johanna H.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Feral pigs are the most abundant exotic ungulate in the United States, comprised of escaped domestic swine, Eurasian wild boar, and their hybrids. Feral pigs have been reported in 23 states, with Texas having the highest number of animals (about 2 million). Feral pigs predate on and compete for resources with native wildlife. In addition, feral pigs are a significant threat to agriculture (grain, peanut, soybean, cotton, and vegetable crops) and soils because of rooting and trampling. Feral pigs also transmit, and are reservoirs for, diseases such as pseudorabies, brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis, and foot and mouth disease that affect humans and livestock. I studied complementary ways for assessing multiple paternity, damage control effectiveness, and the influence of landscape features on genetic population structure. I found evidence of multiple paternity in 21 of 64 litters (33%) from 7 of 9 south Texas sites sampled. Sows displayed a range of conception dates, where 2 sites had a non-concurrent estrous, sows collected at a third site had a bimodal estrous, and sows had a relatively synchronous estrous at a fourth site. Males sired from 8 to 11 offspring at 3 study sites with sufficient litters to assess paternal contribution. The mean litter size was less than the best fit value for the number of offspring sired, indicating that some males sired offspring with ≥2 females. My data could improve management strategies by providing insight into mating behavior of feral pigs. For example, the frequency of multiple paternity can be used to assess sexual contact, and therefore opportunity for disease transmission. In addition, the presence of multiple mating could influence the development of fertility control strategies, specifically in the decision of which sex should be targeted. Lethal control methods are widely practiced but the effects of lethal control on the population dynamics of feral pigs have rarely been evaluated. I used a panel of genetic markers to assess the impact of common lethal control methods (trapping and aerial shooting) at 2 sites in southern Texas. I conducted 2-3 removals at each site and quantified population structure and differentiation among pigs sampled during the removal events. I found no evidence for immigrants from genetically differentiated populations. I conclude that lethal control at the spatial scale and level of intensity tested had minimal effect on feral pig populations. Control efforts should be conducted at greater spatial scales to achieve long-term impacts on populations of feral pigs in south Texas, perhaps through the formation of management cooperatives. My findings also emphasize the need for understanding how landscape features influence the movements and large-scale population structure of feral pigs in the south Texas region. I used genetic data to evaluate the effect of landscape features (e.g. waterways, roads, urban area, and agricultural fields) on the populations structure and movements of feral pigs. I generated a cost-weighted distance surface for southern Texas to model the movement of feral pigs through the landscape. I validated the cost-weighted model using genetic data from 1,258 adult feral pigs collected at 24 sites in southern Texas. First, I quantified broad-scale population structure among the 24 sites by computing an overall FST value and used different Bayesian clustering algorithms implemented in Structure 2.2 and BAPS 4.2 to group individuals into genetic clusters (K), both with and without considering the spatial location of samples. Subsequently, I overlapped the cost- weighted surface with the suggested number of clusters to identify barriers and corridors among clusters. At a broad geographic scale, pig populations displayed a moderate degree of genetic structure (FST = 0.11). The best partition for number of populations in Structure 2.2, based on 2nd order rate of change of the likelihood distribution was K = 10 discrete genetic clusters. A spatially Bayesian clustering algorithm implemented in BAPS 4.2 suggested 12 genetic clusters in the region. I found evidence of past (and possibly ongoing) translocations; many populations were admixed. At finer geographic scales, it appears that predicted areas of unsuitable habitat did indeed act as barriers, while expanses of homogenous habitats may facilitate natural (not human-mediated) dispersal among sites. The cost-weighted distance surface was validated with genetic data and represents a realistic model that can be applied for other zones in Texas. Results from this study may have a significant impact feral pig control by helping define the geographic area over which control methods should be conducted to achieve long term results.

T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Studies on bird community patterns and processes in Hangzhou heterogeneous urban landscape habitats (urban woodlots, street tree strips, western mountain, ecotone and wetlands etc.) were carried out during 1997 ~ 1999. The main results are as follows:1. 150 species were recorded.Based on sensitivities to urbanization and edge, and distributing in how many kinds of habitat, they were divided into 12 urban landscape habitat distributional guilds.2. The distributions of birds over urban woodlots were nonrandom. There was imperfect nested subset pattern in community assemblages. The heterogeneity between woodlots was the cause of the departure from perfect nested subset pattern.3.The species-area relationships of woodlot bird communities were the results of action of multi-factors, which included: the effect of different sample size (under the same sample size, the small woodlots have higher species density than large one), the habitat diversity (the diversity of tree species was the uppermost influencing factor), disturbance factors, species factors and the effect of different research scales etc.4. There were substantial turnover and distinct seasonal changes in woodlot bird communities. The overall stability of woodlot bird community was low. 5. Street tree strips had extensive ecological functions, they served birds not only as the roosting and feeding sites, but also the corridor of movement.6. The characteristics of distributions of bird communities from the edges of the city zone to the forest interior were misty. Species number, diversity and abundance had a great fluctuation along the linear space. They were correlated with the random distributions of heterogeneous features in western mountain.7. Edge effect could result in not only increasing of diversity, but also decreasing of diversity, it depended on the characteristics of the edge. Edge effect was transformable in time.8. With urban expansion, rare and interior species, waterbirds and insectivore declined. Meanwhile,some species showed limited adaptation to urbanization.9. Landscape habitats were correlative in space, and the factors influencing communities usually be at different scales. The diversity at definite scale correlated nearly with the heterogeneity at a definite scale.10. Urban bird community in Hangzhou was cognized as a landscape metacommunity. It possessed three characteristics: 1)  The habitat was landscape habitat composed of multi-patches; 2) All local communities were correlative and interdependent; 3) There were individual flows between local communities.

AB  - Wildlife need connected habitats to move across the landscape to meet foraging needs, reproduce and establish new territories. Increasingly, habitat areas are lost due to conversion to alternative uses such as agriculture or urban development and being carved into pieces by roads and other transportation infrastructure. Roads are considered a major contributor to habitat fragmentation particularly as they are long, linear features prevalent throughout the landscape. The potential barriers species encounter and interact with on the landscape, such as roads or fences, could be permeable to some species and a near complete barrier to others. This creates a challenge when conservation professionals work on methods to plan for enhancing and preserving connectivity across the landscape. While roads can present weak to complete barriers to wildlife, depending on the animal and traffic volume, mitigations such as under-crossings and green bridges on highways at least partially increase the permeability of the landscape to some of these species. The few studies evaluating the effectiveness of these structures for at least three years typically focused on a single species. Here, we monitored the crossing structure under Boeckman Road, in Wilsonville Oregon, for wildlife activity across summer seasons for ten years, since construction of the road and subsequent opening to traffic. This long-term multi-species dataset, which includes monitoring when the road was closed to traffic has provided a unique opportunity. Wildlife activity was collected using sand track pads monitored during summer seasons from 2009 to 2018. Wildlife activity showed a significant community level response from year to year and species-specific responses to year, vegetation change, disturbance, detection area, and previous experimental additions of artificial light. Black-tailed deer showed a significant negative association with disturbance, i.e. the presence of traffic and construction activity. Average annual detections of coyote, bullfrog, cottontail rabbit, and eastern gray squirrel demonstrate a dramatic but not significant response to the road closure period. In addition, it appears that the transition between species with preferences for lower canopy cover, and those preferring greater canopy cover, co-occurs with the road closure period, particularly in 2013. This is also the year that invasive plant management activities (mowing and spraying) stopped. Long-term studies such as this one can help researchers and managers design monitoring programs to best account for variable responses over time by documenting changes in use and working to identify covariates and interactive effects that may be driving those changes. Managers working on projects where vegetation disturbance or restoration is being conducted next to crossing structures may decide to delay monitoring until vegetation communities and/or habituation responses have had time to stabilize, avoiding erroneous conclusions about structure use. Roads create barriers to animal movement through collisions and habitat fragmentation. Investigators have attempted to use traffic volume, the number of vehicles passing a point on a road segment, to predict effects to wildlife populations approximately linearly and along taxonomic lines; however, taxonomic groupings cannot provide sound predictions because closely related species often respond differently. We assess the role of wildlife behavioral responses to traffic volume as a tool to predict barrier effects from vehicle-caused mortality and avoidance, to provide an early warning system that recognizes traffic volume as a trigger for mitigation, and to better interpret roadkill data. We propose four categories of behavioral response based on the perceived danger to traffic: Nonresponders, Pausers, Speeders, and Avoiders. Nonresponders attempt to cross highways regardless of traffic volume. Pausers stop in the face of danger so have a low probability of successful crossing when traffic volume increases. Hence, highway barrier effects are primarily due to mortality for Nonresponders and Pausers at high traffic volumes. Speeders run away from danger but are unable to do so successfully as traffic volume increases. At moderate to high volume, Speeders are repelled by traffic danger. Avoiders face lower mortality than other categories because they begin to avoid traffic at relatively low traffic volumes. Hence, avoidance causes barrier effects more than mortality for Speeders and Avoiders even at relatively moderate traffic volumes. By considering a species’ risk-avoidance response to traffic, managers can make more appropriate and timely decisions to mitigate effects before populations decline or become locally extinct. Barriers to animal movement can isolate populations, impacting their genetic diversity, susceptibility to disease, and access to resources. Barriers to movement may be caused by artificial light, but few studies have experimentally investigated the effects of artificial light on movement for a suite of terrestrial vertebrates. Therefore, we studied the effect of ecological light pollution on animal usage of a bridge under-road passage structure. (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.)

TI  - Ecological and Epidemiological Consequences of Rapid Urbanisation at Wildlife-Livestock-Human Interfaces
AU  - Hassell, James Mark
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Urbanization is characterized by rapid intensification of agriculture, socioeconomic change, and ecological fragmentation, which can have profound impacts on the distributional ecology of host populations and epidemiology of infectious disease within them. In this thesis, results from a large-scale field study conducted in Nairobi, Kenya are used to explore how anthropogenic and ecological changes associated with urbanisation influence the structure of sympatric wildlife, livestock and human host populations, and dictate bacterial epidemiology in wildlife hosts. As likely points of contact (and thus parasite transmission) between vertebrate wildlife, livestock, and humans, household ‘interfaces’ were chosen as sampling units. The ecological and sociological status of households was characterised through ecological surveys, questionnaire data and geospatial mapping, and faecal samples were collected from wildlife occurring within the household compound, and livestock and human inhabitants. Escherichia coli was isolated from faecal samples, and characterised both phenotypically (through antimicrobial sensitivity testing) and genetically (through whole genome sequencing). In the first part of this thesis I consider the influence of urban land-use change on the structure of host populations at household interfaces. Using unsupervised machine learning I describe variation in the host composition of wildlife-livestock human interfaces and, through multivariate regression analysis, demonstrate that citywide variation in ecological and anthropogenic factors (such as biotic habitat diversity and wealth) drive structural changes in wildlife, livestock and human populations across the urban landscape of Nairobi. Utilising commensal E. coli as an exemplar organism, I proceed to explore epidemiological connectivity between wildlife, livestock and humans at household interfaces, and link epidemiological processes in urban wildlife to their drivers across the urban landscape. Firstly, I explore the epidemiology of clinically relevant antimicrobial resistant (AMR)-E. coli in urban wildlife in Nairobi. Comparing E. coli isolates in wildlife to livestock, humans and the environment, I find that E. coli isolated from wildlife have a lower diversity of resistance phenotypes, and are thus an unlikely source of AMR. At household interfaces, I find evidence of AMR-E. coli exchange between rodents/seed-eating birds, and cattle and humans, and demonstrate that transmission is facilitated through anthropogenic resource provision in households. Next, utilising high resolution sequencing data, I explore the response of microbial communities in wildlife hosts to urban land-use change. Specifically, I test the hypothesis that communities of bacterial mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are deterministically structured, according to changes in host community structure. I show that the diversity of genes encoding virulence and AMR in avian-borne E. coli is determined by variation in the distribution and density of birds, livestock and humans at household interfaces, and that this varies along gradients of urbanisation. To conclude, I relate the findings in this thesis across multiple scales, linking the influence of abiotic factors such as habitat alteration and socioeconomics to host community structure at household interfaces and the epidemiology of wildlife-borne E. coli. Using this framework, I suggest future directions for research on urban disease emergence, and discuss implications of my findings for public health and urban planning.

AU  - Miller, Carol Lee
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - A forest gap model was used to investigate how surface fires can create spatial pattern and to examine the consequences of that pattern on the spread of subsequent fires. These questions were examined in light of past fire suppression, current management options, and future climatic change. The model simulates forest characteristics, fuel loads and fire intensity within a forest stand with a spatial resolution of 0.02 ha.The spatial heterogeneity of species composition increased under a simulated fire regime relative to simulations without fire. Although simulated surface fires altered the structure of the spatial heterogeneity of basal area within a forest stand, analysis of spatial autocorrelation did not detect a fire-generated pattern. Crown fires may exert a self-organizing influence on landscape pattern, but results from this model suggest that surface fires may not.Simulations demonstrated that connectivity of burnable area was inversely related to fire frequency and generally increased with elevation. Certain conditions of fuel moisture and fuel bed bulk density outweighed these relationships. Nonlinear thresholds in connectivity occurred across the elevation gradient as a result of gradients in fuel loads and fuel bed bulk density simulated by the model.Potential effects of climatic change on forest structure, composition and the fire regime were investigated. The effects of climatic change on forest structure and composition were site-specific. Fire frequency responded directly to climate's influence on fuel moisture, while fire extent was affected by changes that occurred in either forest structure or species composition. The influence of species composition on fuel bed bulk density was particularly important. Future fires in the Sierra Nevada could be both more frequent and of greater spatial extent if climate model predictions prove true.The effects of fire suppression and current management options for restoring pre-suppression forest conditions were evaluated. Simulation results suggest that forest structure, species composition, and spatial autocorrelation structure may be restored quickly after 100 years of fire suppression if disturbances are reintroduced that cause significant tree mortality.

TI  - Resilience and Sensitivity to Changing Environments in North American River Otters (Lontra canadensis)
AU  - DeNeve Weeks, Danaan L.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The North American river otter is a semiaquatic carnivore that occupies freshwater habitats across most of North America, and is a conservation symbol across most of its range. It is used as an indicator species, a keystone species, an umbrella species, and an example of conservation success. The broad distribution of river otters suggests a broad range of habitat tolerances, but they appear to be highly sensitive to anthropogenic habitat alterations. This apparently conflicting robustness across habitat types and sensitivity to habitat change has baffled researchers for decades. Using morphometric, modeling, and synthetic approaches I explored how otters relate to their environment on a broad scale to gain a better understanding of the conditions to which they are robust, the conditions to which they are sensitive, and the mechanisms by which they adapt to varying environments. Using Maximum Entropy species distribution models I determined that river otter distributions are not strongly affected by climate or macro-environmental variables. Using geometric morphometric methods to examine how cranial shape varies across geographic and ecological space, I determined that morphological variation which may affect feeding and locomotion occurs more intensely at local than broad scales, indicating local morphological adaptation is not strong in this species. Finally, a review of the phylogeography and ecology of river otters and related species indicated that this species evolved from a low-speciation lineage that tends to produce species that can occupy a wide variety of environments without undergoing evolutionary change. Overall I determined that river otters do indeed have a broad ecological niche, and do not respond strongly to climatic or environmental differences or changes across their habitats through altering their distributions or locally adapting. Evidence suggests that river otters may respond strongly to anthropogenic alterations of their habitats because anthropogenically-induced habitat alterations tend to have strong consequences for aquatic food chains, and otters may be more reliant on robust food webs than they are on other aspects of their habitats. These findings have implications for how we think of otter conservation and the conservation of species and ecosystems that are strongly affected by otter presence, as well as what otters indicate about their habitat quality. Additionally, these results may shed light on the ecologies of other mustelid carnivores.In the first chapter of my dissertation I conducted a review of the phylogenetics and biogeography of North and South American river otters to investigate how geography and environmental change have driven river otter evolution in the Americas, and how this informs the ecology of the modern species. I focused first on reviewing the biogeography and evolutionary history of Lontra and Pteronura, and then on the modern ecology, threats, and conservations status of each of the four modern species of Lontra and the single extant species of Pteronura. I chose to review these species because they overlap in geographic and environmental space, and because their shared history provides means for an evolutionarily-grounded examination of relative rarity, specialization, and level of conservation concern. I found that speciation between American otters primarily occurs allopatrically, and there is little functional differentiation in response to allopatric speciation, though they do appear to have the ability to adapt in response to extreme conditions when necessary. Additionally, allopatric speciation primarily occurs in response to changes in waterway connectivity, which is also responsible for changes in population connectivity within the modern species. Most otters have less specific habitat requirements than previously thought, as all species of Lontra persist across a wide variety of climates and semi-aquatic environments, and most of them do so without exhibiting a strong evolutionary response. All American river otters exhibit a strong sensitivity to anthropogenic habitat destruction, though several of them have also shown some ability to coexist with humans. Evidence from this study provides strong indication that this has to do with how human activities near waterways affect food webs, and more generally that on closer examination many habitat components previously thought to be requirements for otters may be better interpreted as indicators of food availability.In the second chapter of my dissertation I use species distribution modeling to examine river otter associations with climate and environment across their range to explore their apparently conflicting robustness to habitat change and sensitivity to human presence. Specifically, I examined the climate and landcover variables that constrain the geographic distribution of otters. I obtained otter occurrences from GBIF and BISON biodiversity databases, climate variables from BIOCLIM, and environmental layers from NASA’s SEDAC program. I built Maximum Entropy species distribution models at 80 and 150 km spatial thinning and varying numbers of background points. The combined model at 80 km spatial thinning and default number of background points produced the highest quality models. Six climatic and landcover variables explained over 10% of otter distributions each: open shrubland, net primary productivity, urban/built, water, annual mean temperature, and precipitation of coldest quarter. Of these variables I determined that water, annual mean temperature, and precipitation of coldest quarter likely have biological significance. However, the predicted range map generated by these models do not match river otter distributions generated by the IUCN and NatureServe. This is likely due to incomplete occurrence data because of low reporting in parts of the species range. I conclude based on these data that river otters have broad climatic and habitat tolerances (as there are six weakly predictive variables as opposed to 1–2 strongly controlling variables) and that local habitat factors, such as intact-ness of riverine food webs, may have greater impact on otter distributions than broad regional variables. Additionally, I call for improved monitoring and reporting of this and other broadly-distributed species to ensure we can adequately track their habitat requirements and conservation status.In the third chapter of my dissertation I use geometric morphometrics to explore the role of cranial morphological variation in otter persistence across the array of otter habitats. I address two research questions: 1. Is there morphological variation and structure in river otters across subspecies? 2. Is morphological variation in river otters best explained by a pattern of isolation by distance or isolation by ecology? I obtained 100 river otter crania from across the species range from museums. I 3-D scanned them using a Geomagic 3-D scanner and landmarked them using the IDAV Landmark program. To answer Q1 I conducted discriminant function analyses Procrustes ANOVAs and a Principal Components Analysis. None of these tests revealed strong morphological patterning, indicating there is not morphological differentiation across subspecies in cranial shape. T address Q2 I conducted Mantel tests and a Multiple Matrix Regression with Randomization (MMRR) on the relationship between morphological distance and geographic, climatic, and environmental distance. Both the Mantel test and the MMRR results indicated no significant relationship between morphological distance and climatic or environmental distance in otter crania. Both indicated a weak but negative relationship between morphological distance and geographic distance, indicating morphological variation is greater at short geographic distances and lower at broad geographic distances. I conclude that there is significant cranial variation between individuals, but little definable structure in this variation. The weak but significant (and potentially complex) relationship between geographic and morphological distance indicates the possibility that diversifying selection across smaller spatial scales may be more important than differentiation across broader populations, possibly indicating individual specialization within a generalist population.

TI  - Multiscale remote sensing analysis to monitor riparian and upland semiarid vegetation
AU  - Nguyen, Uyen
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The health of natural vegetation communities is of concern due to observed changes in the climatic-hydrological regime and land cover changes particularly in arid and semiarid regions. Monitoring vegetation at multi temporal and spatial scales can be the most informative approach for detecting change and inferring causal agents of change and remediation strategies. Riparian communities are tightly linked to annual stream hydrology, ground water elevations and sediment transport. These processes are subject to varying magnitudes of disturbance overtime and are candidates for multi-scale monitoring.  My first research objective focused on the response of vegetation in the Upper San Pedro River, Arizona, to reduced base flows and climate change. I addressed the correlation between riparian vegetation and hydro-climate variables during the last three decades in one of the remaining undammed rivers in the southwestern U.S. Its riparian forest is threatened by the diminishing base flows, attributed by different studies either to increases in evapotranspiration (ET) due to conversion of grasslands to mesquite shrublands in the adjacent uplands, or to increased regional groundwater pumping to serve growing populations in surrounding urban areas and or to some interactions of those causes. Landsat 5 imagery was acquired for pre- monsoon period, when riparian trees had leafed out but before the arrival of summer monsoon rains in July. The result has showed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values from both Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) had significant decreases which positively correlated to river flows, which decreased over the study period, and negatively correlated with air temperatures, which have increased by about 1.4°C from 1904 to the present. The predictions from other studies that decreased river flows could negatively impact the riparian forest were supported by this study. The pre-monsoon Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI) average values in the adjacent uplands also decreased over thirty years and were correlated with the previous year's annual precipitation. Hence an increase in ET in the uplands did not appear to be responsible for the decrease in river flows in this study, leaving increased regional groundwater pumping as a feasible alternative explanation for decreased flows and deterioration of the riparian forest.  The second research objective was to develop a new method of classification using very high-resolution aerial photo to map riparian vegetation at the species level in the Colorado River Ecosystem, Grand Canyon area, Arizona. Ground surveys have showed an obvious trend in which non-native saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) has replaced native vegetation over time. Our goal was to develop a quantitative mapping procedure to detect changes in vegetation as the ecosystem continues to respond to hydrological and climate changes. Vegetation mapping for the Colorado River Ecosystem needed an updated database map of the area covered by riparian vegetation and an indicator of species composition in the river corridor. The objective of this research was to generate a new riparian vegetation map at species level using a supervised image classification technique for the purpose of patch and landscape change detection. A new classification approach using multispectral images allowed us to successfully identify and map riparian species coverage the over whole Colorado River Ecosystem, Grand Canyon area. The new map was an improvement over the initial 2002 map since it reduced fragmentation from mixed riparian vegetation areas. The most dominant tree species in the study areas is saltcedar (Tamarix spp.). The overall accuracy is 93.48% and the kappa coefficient is 0.88. The reference initial inventory map was created using 2002 images to compare and detect changes through 2009.The third objective of my research focused on using multiplatform of remote sensing and ground calibration to estimate the effects of vegetation, land use patterns and water cycles. Climate change, hydrological and human uses are also leading to riparian, upland, grassland and crop vegetation changes at a variety of temporal and spatial scales, particularly in the arid and semi arid ecosystems, which are more sensitive to changes in water availability than humid ecosystems. The objectives of these studies from the last three articles were to evaluate the effect of water balance on vegetation indices in different plant communities based on relevant spatial and temporal scales. The new methodology of estimating water requirements using remote sensing data and ground calibration with flux tower data has been successfully tested at a variety sites, a sparse desert shrub environment as well as mixed riparian and cropland systems and upland vegetation in the arid and semi-arid regions. The main finding form these studies is that vegetation-index methods have to be calibrated with ground data for each new ecosystem but once calibrated they can accurately scale ET over wide areas and long time spans.

AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorThe species, distribution and pathogenicity of Fusarium causing soybean root rot in northeast China Abstract The genus Fusarium Link is one of the most important groups of fungi, which is widely distributed in soil and are organisms of animals and plants. Soybean root rot is a kind of recurrent disease causing serious harm in seedling stage and Fusarium is the main pathogenic fungus of soybean root rot. Fusarium is suitable for survival because of a vast territory and high content of soil organic matter in northeast China. It is beneficial to clear Fusarium species and provide a solid base for control of plant diseases caused by Fusarium species by identification of species and pathogenicity of Fusarium causing soybean root rot in northeast China. In the present study, 1199 isolates of Fusarium spp. were isolated from the diseased soybean plant roots collected from 72 cities or counties in northeast China during 2007 to 2010 by using tissue isolation and soil plate isolation method. Based on the examination of mycelium growth rate, colony form, morphology and character of conidia, conidiogenus cell and chlamydospore, 8 Fusarium species were identified, including F. oxysporum, F. solani, F. graminearum, F. semitactum, F. verticillioides, F. avenaceum, F. equiseti and F. chlamydosporum, the occurrence frequency of them are 36.45%, 25.35%, 11.43%, 10.76%, 6.76%, 4.42%, 3.84% and 1.00% respectively. F. oxysporum(36.45%) and F. solani(25.35%) were the predominant Fusarium species of three provinces in northeast China. The percentage of F. chlamydosporum was 1.00%. The morphological characteristics of each Fusarium species were described in the present study together with micrographs and discussion. Fusarium species causing soybean root rot were varied slightly in Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning province. All the above eight Fusarium species exist and F. chlamydosporum was first discovered in Heilongjiang province. F. oxysporum and F. solani were distributed in almost all cities or counties of Heilongjiang. Fusarium species are unitary in some areas. There were only F. oxysporum and F. solani in Yichun, F. oxysporum, F. solani and F. avenaceum in Harbin, F. oxysporum, F. solani and F. semitactum in Hegang, F. oxysporum, F. solani, F. graminearum and F. avenaceum in Qitaihe. Fusarium species were complete in some areas. Eight Fusarium species were found in Qiqihaer, Daqing and Heihe; F. avenaceum and F. verticillioides were not found in Jilin province. F. oxysporum and F. solani existed in all sampling point of Jilin. Fusarium species are unitary in some areas. There were only F. oxysporum and F. solani in Helong and Songyuan, F. oxysporum, F. solani and F. graminearum in Longjing and Shulan, F. oxysporum, F. solani and F. chlamydosporum in Baishan, F. oxysporum, F. solani and F. equiseti in Liaoyuan. Fusarium species were complete in some areas. Six Fusarium species were found in Jiaohe and Daan; F. avenaceum and F. chlamydosporum were not found in Liaoning province. F. oxysporum and F. solani existed in all sampling point of Liaoning. Fusarium species are unitary in some areas. There were only F. oxysporum and F. equiseti in Dandong, F. oxysporum and F. semitectum in Jinzhou, F. oxysporum and F. solani in Panjin. These Fusarium species exhibited different pathogenicity to soybean variety Hefeng 25. In Helongjiang province, F. oxysporum had strong pathogenicity to soybean, while F. solani, F. graminearum, F. semitactum, F. avenaceum, F. equiseti and F. chlamydosporum had mid-level pathogenicity, F. verticillioides showed weak pathogenicity to soybean; In Jilin province, F. oxysporum had strong pathogenicity to soybean, while F. solani, F. semitactum and F. chlamydosporum had mid-level pathogenicity, F. graminearum and F. equiseti showed weak pathogenicity to soybean; In Liaoning province, F. oxysporum and F. solani had strong pathogenicity to soybean, while F. graminearum, F. semitactum and F. equiseti had mid-level pathogenicity, F. verticillioides showed weak pathogenicity to soybean; Symptoms of soybean root rot caused by eight Fusarium species are different. Symptoms and pathogeninicity of Fusarium exist certain correlation that diseases are heavy when Fusarium species are strong pathogenicity to soybean and diseases are light when Fusarium species are weak pathogenicity to

TI  - Study on the potential landscape safety pattern of urban air environment and ecological regulation of green spaces : case study of Shanghai
AU  - Zhang, Hao
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - In this paper, based on analysis of potential landscape safety pattern and urban greenspaces layout, Shanghai metropolitan area, one of the highly urbanized zone at the East China coast, were taken for a example to discuss how to construct and maintain the ecologically sound urban greenspaces system, which is aimed to organized and layout the self-purification components of the urban ecosystem and build up urban landscape safety pattern with the primary intention to improve the air environment. Thus, in this paper, focused on air environment, the potential safety pattern of Shanghai metropolitan area was discussed at 3 different dimensions, and further, suggestions were put forward to build up the ecological regulative function of urban greenspaces with the aim to improve the urban air environment. Firstly, on the base of comparative analysis of regional land use dynamics, air quality situation and urbanization trend, at the regional scale the possible impact of urbanization on the potential landscape pattern focused on air environment was studied. The results showed that air quality were better during the recent years, however, according to the current situation of urbanization, there is still a possible existence that the potential landscape pattern will get worse. Secondly, aided with the remote sensing interpretion of SPOT satellite map of Shanghai metropolitan area, the classification of landscape taxa was performed, and a ecological safety index(ESI) was composed and used for the further geostatistical analysis on potential landscape safety pattern based on landscape structure, the result showed along the urban-rural gradient, the ESI level varied significantly from low value to high value and in summary, the safety level of rural landscape type of low density is much better than that of urban landscape type of high density. Thirdly, based on responses of two common urban plants to air pollution stress, the local air environment safety level was performed. The results showed along the stress gradient from clean sites to the heavily polluted sites, the stomatal density tended to increase while the stomatal length tended to decrease, and the fluctuating asymmetry index shared the similar tendency with stomatal density, however, the spatial pattern of stomata maintained the mean distribution pattern, which showed the constant feature. In summary, stomatal density, stomatal length and fluctuating asymmetry index were appropriate to measure the relative air stress level. Finally, based on theories and principles of urban planning and landscape ecology, some discussional suggestions were put forward on building up the ecologically sound regulation of urban greenspaces on air environment as followings: (1) based on the regional ecological demands, rationalizing the layout of urban greenspaces in metropolitan area; and (2)building up the connectivity of greenspaces and constructing the continuous landscape pattern; and (3)constructing ecological sound urban greenspaces.

TI  - Predicting the consequences of human disturbance, urbanisation and fragmentation for a woodlark lullula arborea population
AU  - Mallord, John W.
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Woodlarks Lullula arborea breeding on fragmented heathlands in Dorset, southern England are at risk from the potential threats of habitat fragmentation, urban development and recreational disturbance.  The density of woodlarks was lower on sites with higher levels of disturbance, a result of suitable habitat not being settled by breeding birds.  A model of territory occupancy predicted that the impact of increased access on the population depended on both the extent of the increase and the spatial distribution of people.  However, birds on more disturbed sites had greater density-dependent reproductive success, which operates at all stages of the breeding cycle, including recruitment into the local breeding population.  A multiple-brooded species, the woodlark showed a mid-season peak in clutch size.  Other breeding parameters showed no seasonal trend.  However, chicks that fledge from early nests were more likely to be recruited into the breeding population that those from late nests.  As with other ground nesting species, predation was the main cause of nest failure.   The degree of urban development around a site determined the distribution and abundance of woodlarks on heathland.  Urbanisation operated by reducing the amount of off-site foraging habitat, and as a source of human disturbance.  In addition, although the species favours patchy, ephemeral habitats, the degree of isolation from other woodlarks also affected the likelihood of a site being occupied.  Although disturbance is affecting woodlarks, the population is likely to be limited by the availability of suitable habitat.  This will require sympathetic heathland management, understood within a landscape context to ensure success in maintaining the woodlark population.

In order to give some suggestion for the city street-greenbelts development direction, we investigated the green status of streets in the city. With data of 173 streets in Wuhan obtained by means of on-the-spot investigation, the characteristics of street cross section form, floristic component, application frequency, allocation method as well as plant ornamental have been studied. The results showed there were many problems in Greenland, such as few plant species application, the low diversity of street-greenbelts in forms, and single ornamental landscape. And some suggestions have been given for solving problems mentioned above. Comparing with the results of general investigation in city greenbelts in 2003, the whole green area ratio has been raised up a lot with per capita of 9.15m2 , ratio of green area in main urban area of 32.13% and green coverage to 37.46% in the year 2008. In Wuchang area, there were 2 streets over 50-meter-wide red line in Wuchang District, 1 in Hongshan District and 6 in Eastlake High-tech District. 6 streets of among above 9 came up to street-greenbelt standards, and there were 5 streets over 50-meter-wide red line in Eastlake High-tech District. There were 25 streets being red line 40~50 meters width, among 14 of 25 in Wuchang District, which none of them were up to the standards; 7 in Hongshan District and 4 in Eastlake High-tech District, which all of them came up to the standards. Street cross section form in Wuchang area mainly was"one road plate with two greenbelts", a few streets were "Four road plates with five greenbelts", and many other forms were widely used in Wuchang District. There were 195 plant species for street greening, including 54 deciduous tree species, 32 evergreen tree species, deciduous and evergreen shrubs in a fairly proportion as the first two, as well as 4 vine species and 29 species of cover plants or grasses, belongs to 66 families and 123 genera. Among all above, there were 43 tree species. Cinnamomum camphora and Platanus hispanica were the most widely ones planted in greenbelts. There were 96 flower ornamental species, 26 fruit ornamental species and 34 foliage plant species used for street greenbelts in Wuchang area. Flower or fruit ornamentals were mostly arbor and shrub trees, and foliage plants mainly were trees. Flower season was mainly in spring and summer, fruit season in autumn; foliage plants were with autumn-color, colored or green leaves. The dust holding experiment showed that there was a highly significant difference among different plant species for dust-holding capacity, and there was a highly significant dust-holding capacity difference among different days for the same plant species as well. Rhododendron simsii had the largest dust-holding capacity with 11.7885 g/m2, and Pittosporum tobira the least with 5.6626 g/m2. Selection of plant species should take many aspects into account, for instance ecological benefit, landscape effect and so on, while a street greenbelt being

TI  - Non-Governmental Organizations and the Sustainability of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in Peru: An Analysis of Networks and Discourses
AU  - Aponte, Walter V. Castro
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - The importance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in terms of employment and income generation has been recognized worldwide. In Peru, SMEs are responsible for 85% of the employment at the national level and they represent 98% of the total companies registered. Around 12% of SMEs, organized in associations, clusters, and cooperatives or as single companies, are dedicated to productive actives; the others are engaged in commercial and services activities. However, next to their positive economic role, SMEs are also responsible for significant disturbances of nature, environmental degradation and threats to human health. Environmental pollution related to the increase of productive activities has become evident in Peru and the entire region of Latin America.The thesis aims to provide a better understanding of the changing roles of NGOs in promoting sustainability of SMEs in Peru, using the perspectives of networks and discourses. It focuses on three domains, which together are characteristic for promoting of SME sustainability in Peru: organic production (the first case study), business social responsibility (the second cases study) and sustainable production (the third case study). Three research questions have been outlined for this research: First, what are the networks of NGOs promoting sustainability of SMEs involved in the domains of organic production, business social responsibility and sustainable production in Peru, and what are the main changes in time in these networks? Second, what are the main discourses fostering sustainability that prevail and are articulated in these networks of NGOs and what are the main changes in time in these discourses? And finally, how to understand and assess the actual, new and potential roles of NGOs in promoting sustainability of SMEs in terms of network society theory and ecological modernization theory?In this study the universe of NGOs is narrowed to NGOs operating in Peru that provide support (a) to medium and small scale producers and producer associations to bring organic products to local and global markets, (b) to urban and rural small scale enterprises to adopt cleaner production and appropriate technologies, and/or (c) to SMEs to upgrade social and environmental standards within value chains involving large companies. Some SMEs are concentrated in the main cities of Peru such as Trujillo, Arequipa and Lima, while other SMEs, such as organic food producers, are spread all over the country. In any case, SMEs under this research have collaboration ties with the NGOs to be studied. The research questions were investigated by means of more than 28 interviews with representatives of local NGOs, international NGOs, local SMEs and the national government, carried out in the period of 2006 to 2010. Additionally, documents and internet sources were consulted.The networks involved in promoting the sustainability of SMEs are: the agro-ecological network, the organic market network and the ecological farming network in the first case study; the social justice network and the business network in the second case study; and the eco-efficiency network, the appropriate technology network, the cleaner technology network, the technological innovation network and the urban cleaner production network in the third case study.The main actors identified in the networks of the organic production domain are: the Ecological Agriculture Network of Peru (RAE Peru), Grupo Ecologica Peru and the National Ecological Producers Association (ANPE). RAE Peru consists of 16 individual NGOs operating throughout Peru and has led several initiatives (e.g. Biocanastas, Bioferias, Biostores) to develop the organic market in Peru. Grupo Ecologica Peru consists of 5 NGOs and 24 producers, including associations and individual producers, and it commercializes organic products at local competitive markets (e.g. the Bioferia Miraflores farmers’ market) and provides the supply of organic food to supermarkets. ANPE Peru consists of 22 organic small scale producer associations (including small food processers and family small-scale enterprises). ANPE’s constituencies produce and commercialize organic food in 13 farmers’ markets throughout the country.The main actors identified in the business social responsibility networks are: the Labor Advisory Council of Peru (CEDAL), the Center of Studies for Development and Participation (CEDEP) and Peru 2021. CEDAL and CEDEP promote business social responsibility for urban and rural small enterprises in Peru in order to meet national regulation and international standards on labor rights and good environmental practices. CEDAL has been collaborating with 60 small enterprises of garment and handy craft makers, organized in clusters, who commercialize their products directly to consumers or business intermediaries oriented at domestic and foreign markets. CEDEP collaborates with small and medium-sized agri-industries, small garment workshops, shoemakers, metal workshops and bakeries to adopt business social responsibility principles by improving working conditions for their employees and sustainable production practices. Peru 2021 collaborates only with SMEs that are providers of larger companies in value chains promoting social and environmental standards.The main actors involved in the sustainable production networks are: the Eco-efficiency and Social Responsibility Center (CER), the Institute for the Transfer of Technology for Marginal Sectors (ITACAB), the National Council of Science and Technology (CONCYTEC), the Centers of Technological Innovation (CITEs) and the Peruvian Institute of Social Economy (IPES). While CER, IPES and most of CITEs are NGOs, ITACAB and CONCYTEC are (inter)governmental agencies. CER provides consultancy for small scale suppliers of larger domestic companies and single SMEs exporting to international markets. Through the projects EcoADEX, EcoHotels and EcoParks CER aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase eco-efficiency, optimize production and services processes and reduce operation costs in SMEs. ITACAB promotes technological transfer to small scale rural enterprises through the Center for Technological Transferring Resources. CONCYTEC promotes technological transfer for SMEs but it is currently dispersed into several institutional programmes. CITEs provide production technologies services to SMEs. In total there are 13 CITEs throughout Peru, each one specialized in particular type of products (e.g. leather and shoemaking, wood and furniture, wine and horticulture, tropical fruits and medicinal plants, garment, agro-industry, textile, logistic and tracing, software and forest wood). Finally, IPES promotes cleaner technologies in small scale industries and workshops located in urban areas. During the last year, IPES is focusing on the establishing of recycling SMEs of electronic waste. As this overview shows, in the sustainable production domain, not only NGOs perform central roles but also governmental agencies. In some cases, quite close cooperation occurs between NGOs and governmental agencies.In all three cases, networks of sustainability of SMEs are structured as interlinked platforms operating at local, national, Latin American and global level. For instance, in the organic production networks the Bioferias are at the local level, the Peruvian Agroecological Consortium at the national level, MAELA and GALCI at Latin American level and IFOAM at global level. Platforms include civil society, market and state actors. For instance, in the business social responsibility networks the civil society actors are CEDEP and CEDAL, in the organic production networks the market actors are the small scale enterprises affiliated with ANPE and Grupo Ecologica Peru, and in the sustainable production networks the state actors are CONCYTEC (governmental agency), ITACAB (inter-governmental agency) and the CITEs central office (OTCIT). Coordination and channeling of resources in the network platforms are performed by key actors, such as RAE Peru, Grupo Ecologica Peru, ANPE, Peru 2021, CEDAL, CEDEP, CER, CONCYTEC, ITACAB, OTCIT and IPES.The ten networks are composed by diverse types of NGOs. Next to conventional NGOs as key actors, producer NGOs, market NGOs, business NGOs, technocratic NGOs and government organized NGOs (GONGOs) have emerged. Although NGOs are central in most networks, (inter)governmental agencies (GONGOs) are also central in the cleaner technology network, the appropriate technology network and the technological innovation network. CONCYTEC, ITACAB and the CITES’ central office (OTCIT) are agencies that are part of the governmental structure, but they operate in practice pretty much as NGOs. Hence, NGOs and these (inter) governmental agencies perform similar roles in the networks, compete for funding and operate projects funded by international cooperation agencies. Therefore, the (inter)governmental agencies (GONGOs) that are part of these networks of sustainability of SMEs has been found out to be less effective in promoting sustainability of SMEs than more typical NGOs. As a result of this diversification of NGOs the struggle for leading positions in the network platforms and the competition for scarce funding and operate projects of international cooperation agencies have also intensified. This diversification of NGOs and, above all, the increasing of service-like NGOs aim to fulfill the business growth and market demands of SMEs in collaborating with market actors. Hence, new types of NGOs emerge to fulfill market demands.The discourses that NGOs and SMEs endorse in the networks of sustainability of SMEs are: market adaptation, market access or market democratization in the first case study; business upgrading and corporate responsibility in the second case study; and cleaner production and appropriate technology in the third case study. NGOs and SMEs involved in the networks of organic production endorse one of the following three discourses: market adaptation, market access or market democratization. The main storyline of the first discourse is that NGOs and small scale producers are forced to get new capacities and to adapt to the free market. Small scale producers do not have the competences to adapt to the free market by themselves, and NGOs play a crucial role in assisting them. The main storyline of the second discourse is that small scale producers are eager to move to competitive markets. Support is needed from specialized agents in managerial and technological issues to organize supply to competitive local and international organic markets. The main storyline of the last discourse is the prioritization of making the organic market also interesting for low and medium income consumers. Rather than adapt or access to the free market, small scale producers intend to build up a fair relationship with the market by making organic products available to all income groups.NGOs and SMEs in the business social responsibility networks endorse one of the following two discourses: business upgrading or corporate responsibility. In the first discourse, business social responsibility is seen as a strategy to match economic and social rights with sustainability of small scale enterprises. Connecting small scale enterprises with larger companies and influencing them to become sustainable is central in the discourse. In the second discourse, business social responsibility is seen as a business strategy that contributes to sustainability of larger companies and their supply value chains. Only small providers of large profitable value chains have the capacity to adopt social and environmental standards.NGOs and SMEs involved in the networks of sustainable production endorse one of the following two discourses: cleaner production or appropriate technology. In the first discourse, cleaner production is seen as a business strategy to make SME production more efficient and sustainable. Allocating the most up-to-date modern technology is considered as the best way to reduce environmental impacts and increase competitiveness. The discourse focuses on SMEs that are well established in the local market and have the capacities to reach international markets. In the second discourse, appropriate technology is seen as tailor-made technology adjusted to the needs of SMEs, particularly of micro and small enterprises. Low capital, small scale and suitable technology for the local social, economic and cultural setting are central in the discourse. The discourse highlights the use of renewable energy, development of local markets and poverty fighting.The seven discourses emphasize either market justice or sustainable market. This means that the discourses are different in their position towards social movement and the market. The discourses of sustainability of SMEs have evolved from long-standing antagonist discourses: the liberal market discourse on one hand and the social movement discourse on the other hand, which can be considered as the ‘mother’ discourses of the discourses of sustainability of SMEs. While the cleaner production discourse and the corporate responsibility discourse have their origins in the liberal market discourse, the market democratization discourse, the market adaptation discourse, the market access discourse, the business upgrading discourse and the appropriate technology discourse have their origins in the social movement discourse. Hence, the discourses of sustainability of SMEs share views with their mother discourses. Only, the market access discourse strongly diverges from its origins. The difference between market justice discourses and sustainable market discourses has to do with their interpretation of environmental reform and sustainability.In sum, the identified changes are expressed in new roles for NGOs. Next to the usual ‘watchdog’ roles, NGOs are developing roles of ‘helper’ in order to answer to the market needs of SMEs. The new roles are performed not only by new types of NGOs but also by ‘reoriented’ conventional NGOs. Consequently, NGOs have become market agents as a result of their new roles. Finally, the findings contribute to the theoretical debates on network society theory and ecological modernization theory. The analysis of networks promoting sustainability of SMEs helps to understand more deeply the way non-state actors cooperate, and challenges Castells’ scheme of space of flows versus space of place. Both spaces are connected and integrated in aiming for sustainability. Actors use rationalities, logics and power resources related to both spaces. Amending ecological modernization theory, the analysis suggests that it is needed to consider both ecological rationality and social rationality in order to advance environmental reform of SMEs in developing countries. The research also sheds light of issues of power. NGOs are becoming more collaborative and less confrontational, more conciliatory and less dogmatic towards market actors, but they remain rather conflictive and competitive towards fellow NGOs. Power of SMEs is not acknowledged in most discourses. However, SMEs show their power either by accepting or denying engage to the networks, either by collaborating or pressuring key actors and either by subscribing or being indifferent to the discourses. This power of SMEs pushes the networks to become more inclusive, participatory and valuable for SMEs. It rests on the capacity to be anchored within local social networks.

TI  - Quantifying the Effects of Management on Ecosystem Services
AU  - Van Oudenhoven, Alexander P.E.
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Mensen hebben een groot deel van het aardoppervlak veranderd om in de groeiende vraag naar leefruimte en voedsel, drinkwater en andere natuurlijke hulpbronnen te voorzien. Mijn proefschrift onderzoekt de effecten van landbeheer op ecosysteemdiensten. Landbeheer betreft de menselijke activiteiten die landgebruik ondersteunen. Enkele voorbeelden zijn het toepassen van bestrijdingsmiddelen of irrigatie om de voedselproductie te verhogen, de aanleg van infrastructuur om ecotoerisme te bevorderen en het verwijderen van ongewenste plantensoorten om inheemse biodiversiteit te beschermen. Ecosysteemdiensten zijn de bijdragen van ecosystemen aan het menselijk welzijn. Ze zijn uitgegroeid tot een populair concept om de gevolgen aan te tonen van biodiversiteitsverlies en landdegradatie. Echter, de wereldwijde aantasting en transformatie van ecosystemen ten behoeve van monofunctioneel landgebruik suggereren dat beheerders en beleidsmakers beperkt inzicht hebben in de economische en sociale gevolgen van landgebruik. Inzicht in de effecten van beheer op ecosysteemdiensten draagt bij aan beter begrip van de gevolgen van beleidsvorming en landgebruiksbeslissingen. Huidig beheer is grotendeels gebaseerd op slecht geverifieerde veronderstellingen. Derhalve heeft mijn proefschrift tot doel om de effecten van beheer op de levering van ecosysteemdiensten te kwantificeren.Om dit onderzoeksdoel te bereiken, heb ik een op indicatoren gestoelde methodologie ontwikkeld. Een nieuw ontwikkeld raamwerk voor systematische indicatorselectie staat centraal in de studie (Hoofdstuk 2). Het raamwerk beschouwt ‘beheer’ als de belangrijkste drijvende kracht en onderscheidt verder ecologische eigenschappen, ecosysteemfuncties en -diensten. Ecologische eigenschappen zijn bijvoorbeeld bodemkenmerken, nutriëntenkringlopen en biologische diversiteit. Deze eigenschappen ondersteunen de ecosysteemfunctie, oftewel de capaciteit van het ecosysteem om ecosysteemdiensten te bieden. Deze capaciteit geeft de potentiele levering van ecosysteemdiensten aan en wordt geanalyseerd met zogenaamde 'state-indicatoren'. Voorbeelden hiervan zijn de beschikbare visstand, potentiele koolstofopslag en bezoekerscapaciteit. Of deze capaciteit daadwerkelijk wordt benut, oftewel wordt ‘omgezet’ in een ecosysteemdienst, hangt af van vele factoren, zoals toegankelijkheid van een gebied, de vraag naar ecosysteemdiensten en besluitvorming omtrent beheer. 'Performance-indicatoren' worden gebruikt om de feitelijke levering van ecosysteemdiensten te kwantificeren. Hoofdstuk 2 identificeert criteria om de ecosysteemdienstindicatoren en het selectieproces te evalueren. Het selectieproces moet flexibel en consistent te zijn, terwijl de indicatoren veelomvattend, meetbaar in relatie tot tijd en ruimte, schaalbaar en kwantificeerbaar dienen te zijn. De bruikbaarheid van een indicator hangt tevens af van databeschikbaarheid, de geloofwaardigheid en toepasbaarheid op meerdere gebieden. Het raamwerk werd toegepast in drie case studies, variërend van landschap- tot bioomniveau: in Nationaal Landschap 'Het Groene Woud' in Noord Brabant (Hoofdstuk 3), mangrovesystemen in Java, Indonesië (Hoofdstuk 4), en voor ‘rangelands’ op globale schaal (Hoofdstuk 5). De doelstelling van de case study in Hoofdstuk 3 is het kwantificeren, karteren en modelleren van het effect van beheer op acht ecosysteemdiensten, waarbij expliciet onderscheid wordt gemaakt tussen potentiële en feitelijke diensten. 'Het Groene Woud' is een typisch Nederlands multifunctioneel landelijk gebied. Lokale beleidsplannen zijn gericht op het combineren van landbouw, natuurbescherming en natuurrecreatie. Het raamwerk werd hier toegepast om te bepalen welke ecologische eigenschappen de levering van ecosysteemdiensten ondersteunen en welke indicatoren geschikt zijn voor het kwantificeren van de ‘state-’ en ‘performance-indicatoren’. De meeste ecosysteemdiensten in ‘Het Groene Woud’ zijn sterk afhankelijk van de omvang en connectiviteit van natuurgebieden. Voorts spelen zogenaamde 'groene landschapselementen' (bijvoorbeeld hagen, bomenrijen en bermen) een cruciale rol voor diensten als bestuiving, biologische plaagbestrijding, fijnstofinvang en bescherming van leefgebied voor dieren. De geïdentificeerde indicatoren helpen om de interactie tussen verschillende ecosysteemdiensten te begrijpen, en de resulterende ruimtelijke modellen helpen om de gebieden te identificeren die het meest belangrijk zijn voor het leveren van meerdere ecosysteemdiensten. Tevens werden twee scenario’s, ‘landbouwintensivering’ en ‘grootschalige natuurbescherming’, onderzocht om de gevolgen te bepalen op zuivelproductie, fijnstofinvang en natuurrecreatie. De scenarioanalyse onderstreept dat groene landschapselementen en natuurgebieden van belang zijn voor recreatie en regulerende ecosysteemdiensten. Intensiverende zuivelproductie gaat ten koste van alle onderzochte ecosysteemdiensten. De vastgestelde ecosysteemdienstindicatoren en relaties daartussen kunnen bijdragen tot het kwantificeren van ecosysteemdiensten in andere landschappen.In Hoofdstuk 4 ga ik verder in op de beleids- en ecologische aspecten van beheer, welke zijn bestudeerd in de mangrovekustgebieden van Java, Indonesië. Sinds de jaren ’80 is meer dan de helft van de Indonesische mangroven gedegradeerd of omgezet in aquacultuur, landbouw en stedelijk gebied. Java is gekozen als studiegebied omdat het eiland het sterkst is veranderd door ontwikkeling van aquacultuur en omdat overheidsbeslissingen hier veelal voor het eerst worden geïmplementeerd. De consequenties van landgebruiksbeslissingen zijn beoordeeld door de gevolgen van verschillende ‘regimes’ op mangrove ecosysteemdiensten te onderzoeken. Regimes zijn menselijke activiteiten die gezamenlijk het landgebruik bepalen. Ik onderscheid vijf brede categorieën: natuurlijke mangroven, lage intensiteit gebruikte mangroven en hoge intensiteit gebruikte mangroven, mangroven omgezet ten behoeve van aquacultuur en, tot slot, niet langer gebruikte verlaten aquacultuursystemen. Natuurlijke mangroven worden slechts op zeer kleine schaal gebruikt, zonder het ecosysteem nadelig te beïnvloeden. De brede regime-categorieën zijn verder onderverdeeld in elf specifieke regimes, op basis van wettelijke status, beheerindicatoren en ecologische kenmerken. Zeven ecosysteemdiensten zijn geanalyseerd: voedsel (vis en garnalen), hout en andere bosproducten, kustbescherming, koolstofvastlegging, waterzuivering, habitat voor vis en garnalen, en natuurrecreatie. Deze ecosysteemdiensten zijn geselecteerd in samenspraak met lokale beleidsmakers. Vervolgens zijn de belangrijkste ecologische eigenschappen die ten grondslag liggen aan de ecosysteemdiensten bepaald, en ‘state-’ en ‘performance-indicatoren’ geïdentificeerd. De levering van ecosysteemdiensten is geschat en vervolgens gescoord voor elk regime door ecologische en beheerkenmerken van de regimes te relateren aan ecosysteemdienstindicatoren. Belangrijke indicatoren voor de meeste diensten zijn maximale boomleeftijd, soortenrijkdom en structurele diversiteit. Natuurlijke mangroven scoorden het hoogst voor de meeste diensten, behalve voor voedsel. De hoge voedselproductie van de aquacultuur regimes gaat ten koste van alle andere ecosysteemdiensten. Aquacultuur levert zelfs 'negatieve diensten' op, in de vorm van koolstofemissie, watervervuiling en verhoogd risico op overstromingen. Transities tussen regimes zijn tevens geïllustreerd in een diagram dat de gevolgen van landgebruiksbeslissingen laat zien. Zo kan het aanleggen van plantages en silvo-aquacultuur op locaties van voormalige aquacultuurvijvers de ‘negatieve diensten’ tegengaan, terwijl aanzienlijke hoeveelheden voedsel en hout geleverd kunnen worden. Bevindingen van deze studie zijn door lokale beleidsmakers verwerkt in nieuwe plannen met betrekking tot duurzame aquacultuur en mangroverehabilitatie. Hoofdstuk 5 onderzoekt de effecten van verschillende regimes op bodemerosie en run-off van oppervlaktewater in door waterschaarste gekenmerkte ‘rangelands’. Wereldwijd zijn meer dan één miljard mensen afhankelijk van rangelands voor hun levensonderhoud, omdat ze er hun vee laten grazen en landbouw bedrijven. Elf nieuwe regimes zijn geanalyseerd voor deze rangelands. Elk regime is gebaseerd op tien kwalitatieve indicatoren die verschillende begrazingsintensiteiten en natuurbeschermingsstrategieën weerspiegelen. Belangrijke indicatoren voor het kwantificeren van bodemerosie en run-off zijn de helling, bodemtextuur en –bedekkingsgraad en het organisch stofgehalte. Zowel gemiddeld jaarlijks bodemverlies als run-off nemen toe in de reeks van de regimes onbegraasde natuurlijke rangelands, lage intensiteit begraasde rangelands, hoge intensiteit begraasde rangelands en aangelegde weilanden. Bodemverlies bedroeg, respectievelijk, 717 (SF (standaardfout) = 388), 1370 (SF = 648), 4048 (SF = 1.517) en 4249 (SF = 1.529) kg ha-1 jaar-1 . Run-off bedroeg voor dezelfde regimes 98 (SF = 42), 170 (SF = 43), 505 (SF = 113) en 919 (SF = 267) m3 ha-1 jaar-1 . Verder bleek dat het beëindigen van begrazing alsmede het combineren van begrazing en bosaanplanting bodemverlies en run-off kunnen verminderen. De bevindingen onderstrepen dat bodemerosie en run-off sterk verschillen per regime en dat het behoud en herstel van kwetsbare rangelands deze risico’s kan verminderen. Mijn proefschrift toont aan dat beheer en landgebruik ecosysteemdiensten sterk beïnvloeden. Natuurbescherming in natuurlijke regimes behoudt biodiversiteit maar ondersteunt bovendien cruciale regulerende en habitatdiensten, recreatiemogelijkheden en zelfs voedsel en bosproducten. Lage intensiteit gebruikte regimes kunnen veel ecosysteemdiensten leveren, maar trade-offs tussen de productie- en regulerende diensten kunnen optreden. Beheer ter ondersteuning van intensieve voedsel- en grondstoffenproductie heeft meestal negatieve effecten op recreatiemogelijkheden en cruciale regulerende diensten. De combinatie van intensieve productie met actief natuurherstel kan deze negatieve effecten gedeeltelijk verzachten. Ik maak expliciet onderscheid tussen natuurlijke en omgezette regimes, die worden gebruikt voor intensieve voedsel of grondstoffenproductie. Deze intensive productie gaat meestal ten koste van alle andere ecosysteemdiensten en kan zelfs leiden tot 'negatieve diensten'. Niet langer gebruikte en verlaten systemen leveren onbeheerd weinig ecosysteemdiensten maar zijn potentieel waardevol voor natuurherstel, afhankelijk van de oorspronkelijke ecosystemen. Bevindingen in dit proefschrift zijn gebaseerd op een raamwerk voor indicatorenselectie en een combinatie van verschillende informatiebronnen en onderzoeksmethodes, zoals een indicatorinteractiediagram, een typologie van regimes en een aanpak om de resultaten te integreren. In Hoofdstuk 6 stel ik voor hoe deze aanpak kan worden geïntegreerd in een 'toolbox'. Dit proefschrift presenteert een zeer volledige set van kwantitatieve en kwalitatieve indicatoren voor het kwantificeren van beheereffecten op de levering van ecosysteemdiensten. De genoemde stappen in ‘toolbox’ kunnen worden gebruikt om beheerders en beleidsmakers te informeren over de gevolgen van beslissingen met betrekking tot natuurbehoud, landgebruiksintensivering, het omzetten van natuur ten behoeve van intensieve voedselproductie, en het herstel van verlaten, onbeheerd land. Dit proefschrift biedt een handvat voor het voorkomen van verdere aantasting van het aardoppervlak en het verlies van ecosysteemdiensten.

TI  - Different Shades of Green : Reflections on the Legitimacy of Dutch Nature Policy and Practices
AU  - Leistra, Gilbert R.
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - It is the purpose of this study to understand and explain the concept and problem of legitimacy in relation to Dutch nature policy and practices. Further, this study aims to support the realization of legitimate nature policy and practices, by characterizing legitimacy in relation to the theoretical and empirical insights that are elaborated in this research.Many conceptions of nature are valued. These different shades of green compete with each other and with other land-use for space. It is therefore understandable that decisions regarding what to favour can be controversial and will meet public and political resistance. Legitimacy in Dutch nature policy and practices, the main subject of this study, is therefore important. However, legitimacy is a rather elusive concept that is seldom defined. Nevertheless, most of us are aware of the normative connotation that is enclosed in its meaning. The normative character is focused on the exercise of power or, better said, the just or unjust exercise of power. In our western society, legitimacy is equated with democratic governance and the principles on which it is founded. However, democracy comes in different guises, both in theory and in practice. Nevertheless, there is a call for 'more' or 'better' democracy that is exemplified by two connected shifts. The first is a shift from government to governance, which expresses a decline in top-down planning by state agents in favour of more participatory and interactive policymaking; the second is a shift from normal science to post-normal science, which emphasizes the need to acknowledge nature conservation as a field in which facts are uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high, and decisions urgent. Both shifts ask for more 'democratization' by means of more stakeholder involvement. However, how much involvement is right or enough? 'More' participation might increase the level of direct democracy; it might, at the same time, hinder the representative power of democracy. A critical reflection on legitimacy is thus warranted. To reach the objective of this study the following questions are addressed:(1) What is legitimacy? Or, how should we understand the concept of legitimacy?(2) What are the issues or problems with regard to legitimacy in Dutch nature policy and practices?(3) What characterizes legitimate nature policy and practices?The approach to the concept and problem of legitimacy is inspired by the philosophical pragmatist tradition. Instead of approaching legitimacy as a philosophical artefact, it is understood and explained within the context in which it appears relevant. This is necessary as no theory of legitimacy is offered idly or accidentally. All theories have a pragmatic or expediential element and appear when the uses of power are matters of controversy.The first question – What is legitimacy? Or how should we understand the concept of legitimacy? – is dealt with in chapter 5. Because context is important, this chapter 5 is preceded by three contextual chapters that discuss the character of Dutch nature conservation (chapter 2), the governance shift (chapter 3) and international examples (chapter 4). These chapters provide the necessary context for the development of the theoretical account of legitimacy in chapter 5 and for answering the first research question. With the insights of chapter 5, the second question – What are the issues or problems with regard to legitimacy in Dutch nature conservation policy and practices? – is tackled. The theoretical framework is used to analyze four case studies in chapters 6, 7 and 8. These case studies represent different shades of green within diverse governance contexts. The case studies first of all have an explorative character and will illustrate the problem of legitimacy in different contexts. The case studies studied are:(1) Future Amstelland: central in this case study is the tension between local input and regional challenges that need to be addressed in the future developments of a rural area south of Amsterdam.(2) Wintering geese: growing populations of wintering geese resulted in increasing costs of indemnification. The implementation of a national plan that foresees in a solution is discussed.(3) Gaasterland vs. the Oostvaardersplassen: in order to reflect upon long-term goals a comparison is made between two well-known cases in Dutch nature policy and practices.The case studies are based on desk research, interviews and participant observation.Chapter 2 discusses the context in which legitimacy is an issue of concern by tackling four questions: who are we; where do we come from; where ought we to go; and how can we get there? The answers to these questions reveal something about the identity of Dutch nature conservation, or more correctly, about the identity of the Dutch regarding nature conservation. The answers to the first and the second question show that the Dutch are an ambitious people regarding land use and nature conservation, but that this ambition is multifaceted and reflects a dynamic past with different actors that have different interests. Given this characterization, the third and fourth questions were not answered with resolution; they remain open to debate. Given the post-normal condition, in which facts are uncertain, values are in dispute, the stakes are high and decisions are deemed urgent, it seems difficult or even impossible to formulate the best solution, policy or approach to tackle a certain problem. I argue that this does not mean that any approach will do, or that we cannot make a distinction between different shades of green. On the contrary, the lack of a shared perspective on what is necessary or valuable, albeit on a more abstract level, does not make decisions easier; rather, they are more complex and difficult. Moreover, the prerequisites provided by our democratic society create a challenging situation: we ought to consider the many different conceptions of the common good, whatever that may be or however that may be formulated. As such, an effective policy, and consequently a legitimate policy, should take this diversity into account.Chapter 3 discusses the shift from government to governance. A closer look at this phenomenon warranted, because this shift implies a transition from hierarchical government control to a system of governance that is characterized by multiple parties at different levels of administration. Governance, seen as an analytical model or as a steering theory, provides us with a perspective that allows us to be sensitive to the many actors that are involved, at different levels, in the realization and alteration of policy. The replacement of government by governance is not per definition something new, but refers to the conceptual need to decouple state and government, as non-state agents are increasingly seen to function as 'government' in the more traditional sense. Furthermore, the demystification of human rationality and actual changes in the levels and places of policy making provide the concept of governance with a relevant perspective to be sensitive to issues of legitimacy.Legitimacy is characteristically a problem when the prevailing power and authority structures change. A change in authority confronts people with that authority; it might change the underlying conventions, which might trigger close scrutiny of that authority, or it may make people aware of initial implicit acceptance. The governance of Dutch nature shows us exactly that. Shifts in governance require shifts in legitimacy.In chapter 4 the Dutch situation is placed in an international perspective. This chapter provides an extensive summary of a volume on legitimacy in EU nature policy. The volume is the result of an international workshop that the Applied Philosophy Group from Wageningen University organized in November 2005. The findings of this workshop have aided the search for understanding legitimacy in Dutch nature policy and practices.What the international case studies nicely illustrate is that what is considered legitimate at one level of governance is not automatically considered legitimate at another. Good arguments can be given that Natura 2000 and the Birds and Habitats Directives that provide its legal basis are legitimate; they are products that were developed by means of negotiation between the member states that ultimately have to live up to the directives themselves. At the same time, we see that their content is contested, not only on the ground where the diverse constituencies are responsible for the actual implementation, but also at the level of the nation state where directives are the cause of political controversy. As a result, the importance for policy makers of enhancing the democratic legitimacy of their policy plans has increased. However, this shift does not seem automatically to result in a more legitimate nature protection as it has specific drawbacks, such as a representation deficit and contested results. Because of this process character of democracy, a conception of legitimacy is therefore best framed as one of activity, focusing on both results and processes.In chapter 5 an answer to the first research question is provided by presenting a conceptual framework of legitimacy. This framework combines Beetham's three dimensions of legitimate power (rules, justifications and consent) and three modes of democratic legitimacy production (input, throughput and output). The framework is developed to facilitate an examination of legitimacy. With the framework, different and tangled problems can be described. Furthermore, the framework facilitates the identification of ways to strengthen the legitimacy of nature policy and practices.Beetham's three dimensions of legitimate power proved to be helpful in understanding the different building blocks of the normative 'quality' or 'characteristic' of legitimacy. An informed statement regarding legitimacy requires an inquiry into all three dimensions of legitimate power. Strong statements whether power is, or is not legitimate, are therefore best nuanced within this framework. Rules or laws might be breached and supporting beliefs might alter or evolve and consent might be withdrawn, but it is rarely the case that legitimacy fails in all three dimensions to such an extent that the label 'non-legitimate' fits unconditionally.The three modes of democratic legitimacy production provided the structure and content of Beetham's three dimensions. Input legitimacy emphasizes 'government by the people' and is rooted in the tradition of direct democracy; it facilitates the intrinsic value of democracy and relies on active participation, which emphasizes the third dimension of legitimacy. Output legitimacy emphasizes 'government for the people' as in the representative tradition. Political choices are legitimate if and because they effectively promote the common welfare of the constituency in question. Because representative democracy relies on the rule of some over many, it is especially important that power is acquired and exercised in accordance with the 'rules' in order to claim legitimacy. Throughput legitimacy is based on the constructive power of democracy. Not the predetermined will of individuals or their representatives but rather the process of its formation is valued. Power is legitimate in that it facilitates deliberation in order to clarify disputes and possible solutions. It emphasizes the second dimension of legitimacy: legitimacy on the basis of shared beliefs or, better, legitimation through a search for shared beliefs.Although the presented conceptual framework emphasizes legitimacy as an activity, it does not automatically imply a fixed protocol for legitimacy production. The three different modes of production − input, throughput and output − all play their part in producing legitimacy, but their relation is not prearranged.Chapter 6 opens the second part of this study in which the theoretical account of chapter 5 is used to analyze four case studies. In this chapter the legitimacy of a participative process in Amstelland is explored. This process was part of the Future Amstelland project, the purpose of which was to develop a shared vision and action plan for the rural green wedge that penetrates the city of Amsterdam from the south. However, the outcome was criticized by international partners because of limited representation of interests and a rather conservative vision that failed to incorporate pressing issues. Nevertheless, emphasis on input and throughput legitimacy, rather than output legitimacy seems necessary with respect to the governance dimension of FA. More and more responsibility for the realization of spatial objectives is placed with provincial and municipal authorities. However, spatial challenges transcend municipal boundaries. Aware of its limited authority, the initiating municipality of Amsterdam considered a procedural approach necessary. Next to the constructive reasons that legitimate a procedural effort ‒ as participation can facilitate the clarification of problems and possible solutions ‒ the FA case shows that a procedural approach also can serve the instrumental goal of securing a certain outcome and impact.Chapter 7 discusses the implementation of the 2003 Policy Framework Fauna Management (PFFM) in three different provinces. This policy represents a new phase in almost half a century of managing wild geese populations in the Netherlands. In contrast to earlier initiatives, this policy does not address threatened populations but thriving populations of wild geese. Due to international and national initiatives taken from the 1970s onwards, Dutch wild-geese populations have increased by a factor of ten, which has dramatically increased damage to local agricultural crops. The mounting costs of indemnification and the growing distress of the agricultural community confronted with wintering geese populations led to the development of the PFFM, which foresees in the establishment of special foraging sites. The sites are the responsibility of the residing farmers, for which they receive remuneration. Analyzes of the implementation process in the provinces of Limburg, Noord-Brabant and Friesland exemplify the need for tailormade solutions if local support is of essence in policy implementation. Furthermore, these tailor made solutions depend on sound throughput procedures that allow for a process of discovery. Additionally, the evolution of the problem of wintering geese into that of summering gees, exemplify the post-normal character of Dutch nature policy and practices, in which it is difficult, if not impossible, to formulate an ultimate decision. The case of wintering geese illustrates the need to perceive legitimacy as activity, rather than evaluative concept. However, this also means that the contingent and post-normal condition needs to be taken seriously.Chapter 8 presents a diptych of two very different shades of green: the Oostvaardersplassen and Gaasterland. Both areas are part of the National Ecological Network but, where the Oostvaardersplassen is assumed to provide for 'real' nature, Gaasterland is an example of agricultural-orientated nature management. Both cases have led to controversy and have influenced the course of Dutch nature conservation policy and practices. The comparison of both cases is used to reflect on how legitimacy relates to long-term goals that are often at the foundation of conservation policies and practices. Both cases demonstrate that the need to produce legitimacy is a 'colour-blind' and ongoing necessity. In both the darker and lighter shades of green, input, throughput and output legitimacy are necessary to ultimately justify an authority's actions, and the results that it foresees.Chapter 5 provided an answer to the first research question. In chapter 9 - the final chapter of this study - I reflect upon the second and third research questions in relation to the theoretical and empirical findings of this study and conclude with recommendations that aim to further support the realization of legitimate nature policy and practices. An answer to the second research questions is given by comparing the different insights from the four case-studies. The case-studies have illustrated that legitimacy in Dutch nature policy and practices, regardless of the specific shade of green, is questioned. All observed problems are output related, but the context in which the output became contested differs from case to case. In all cases in this study the policies and practices build forth on non-contested policies and practices. Nevertheless, the case studies have shown that legitimacy problems can develop and that they do so at different stages of policy formulation or implementation. Although the Amstelland case shows that producing legitimacy is preferably done as a conscious act, rather than a forced reaction to surfacing legitimacy problems, the Amstelland case also shows that this does not guarantee legitimacy. The post-normal condition thus asks for a conscious ongoing effort in the production of legitimacy in both 'action' and 'reaction'. The case studies furthermore exemplify the governance condition in which official mandates of different authorities may conflict. Moreover, the case of the Oostvaardersplassen illustrates that if official authority is uncontested, it can still be challenged on moral grounds.The third research question 'what characterizes legitimate nature policy and practices?' has guided the more practical aim of this research to ultimately contribute to legitimate nature policy and practices. An answer is formulated by summarizing the findings of this study in six major insights. These are:(1) Legitimacy is work in progress(2) Producing legitimacy implies control over input, throughput and output(3) One size does not fit all(4) Take throughput legitimacy seriously(5) Take control and let it go(6) A high level of reflexivity is requiredThe conceptual framing of legitimacy in this study, the analyses of the legitimacy problems in different case studies, and the six major insights that follow from these analyses can aid in producing legitimacy. Nevertheless, this knowledge based contribution is modest and limited in scope. Although a contribution to knowledge is what is expected of an academic work, the real-life challenge asks for reflective action. In the final reflection I conclude that philosophy can make a further contribution to this challenge of reflective action. Although further academic and applied academic research may aid this real-life challenge, philosophy is of most use when it is practical. Because practical philosophy is focused on skill and virtue, rather than knowledge and wisdom, it has a capacity building property. By doing so, philosophy does not only succeed in making a contribution to the legitimacy of Dutch nature policy and practices, but it also succeeds in strengthening the legitimacy of philosophy itself.

TI  - Coupling Agent-Based Models with Bayesian Belief Networks in Social-Ecological Systems Modeling: The Role of Uncertainty in the Resilience of Semi-arid Riparian Corridors in the Sonoran Desert
AU  - Pope, Aloah J.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Resiliency, or the ability of ecosystems to absorb change, is a particularly challenging goal for systems with a high interconnectivity of their social and ecological sub-systems, dubbed social-ecological systems. Exploring potential effects of policy decisions and/or changes in climate are difficult to study under traditional research methods; however, social-ecological system modeling approaches have overcome many of these difficulties. Uncertainty, particularly in regards to human decision-making, remains a challenge. I developed a series of models to test the use of Bayesian modeling techniques in addressing human-based sources of uncertainty. The models were developed in two semi-arid river basins in the Sonoran Desert to represent model social-ecological systems with three sub-systems: social—urban and agricultural water demand, hydrological—pumping groundwater from the aquifer, and ecological—changes in riparian vegetation communities. The rancher decision-model, developed in the Rio San Miguel basin, used cognitive mapping and Bayesian modeling to express key decisions as a series of probabilities under a variety of environmental conditions. The social-ecological system model of the Rio San Miguel basin, which utilized the rancher decision-model to incorporate real-world uncertainty of the human decision-making process, exposed trade-offs between scenarios that benefited riparian vegetation versus rancher well-being. The Upper San Pedro River Watershed social-ecological system model tested the effects of policy decision-making, specifically on population growth and water conservation, on the spatial distribution of riparian vegetation. The model predicted degradation of the riparian corridor under all population growth/water conservation scenarios, particularly for marsh vegetation and in a specific stretch of the river. Additionally, the model demonstrated how changing the likelihood of adopting new water conservation programs could alter the probability distribution of varying levels of deterioration in the riparian corridor. Since many of the social-ecological systems models are created to aid in decision-making for natural resource managers, we believe that the outputs from models that incorporate Bayesian techniques will have a more accurate representation of the range of possible outcomes of management decisions.

TI  - The effect of urbanization on butterfly species diversity
AU  - Di Mauro, Desiree Kay
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - This dissertation investigates the impacts of urbanization on butterfly diversity in Washington, DC, northern Virginia, and Maryland and the role of butterfly gardens in butterfly conservation. Using weekly butterfly garden surveys from 135 gardens and 4th of July Butterfly Counts from 1990 to 2001, I investigated whether the matrix surrounding suitable butterfly habitat affects the diversity of the species found in this suitable habitat. The hypothesis of this study was that increasing levels of human development and population density in the matrix surrounding butterfly habitat will negatively affect the butterfly diversity found in the habitat. Results of this study indicate that local, not regional, butterfly diversity is negatively affected by increasing levels of human development (rural, suburban, or urban development) surrounding the habitat, but that the matrix is just one factor in generalist species diversity. Other factors include the size of the suitable habitat, the number of nectar plants blooming in the habitat, the use of pesticides in neighboring areas, and linkages to other suitable habitat. These results indicate that butterfly gardens do serve a purpose in butterfly conservation, most likely serving as stepping stones or corridors between larger tracts of habitat. Conservation efforts should include butterfly gardens, but larger tracts of natural habitat with less development or large gardens should also be included in any conservation plan. Future study should: (1) include species with more specific habitat needs than the twelve species used in the butterfly garden study, (2) more closely investigate the effects of pesticide use in neighboring areas, and (3) use mark-release-recapture techniques to study metapopulations in this area.

TI  - Contribution of Stormwater Ponds for Road Runoff to Aquatic Biodiversity
AU  - Sun, Zhenhua
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - The increased recognition that roads may impair the aquatic environment and ecosystems has led to a shift from conventional drainage systems toward blue-green solutions such as stormwater ponds. Research on blue-green stormwater solutions has until now mainly focused on water quantity and quality. The goals of this study are to evaluate the influence of environmental factors on the biological community composition in stormwater ponds receiving road runoff and to determine to which extent these green infrastructures can promote and maintain pond dwelling organisms.Biological community composition was investigated in 16 stormwater ponds along the highways E6 and E18 in the counties of Oslo, Akershus and Østfold of Norway. Multivariate statistical methods were used to explore the relationship between the biological community composition and the pollutants in water and sediments, as well as physical factors. Redundancy analysis combined with forward selection showed that the most important water quality and physical variables determining the variation in the biological community composition were pond size, distance to the closest pond from study pond, annual average daily traffic, concentrations of metals, chloride, dissolved oxygen, hydrocarbons and phosphorus. Most taxa were negatively correlated with metals. The results indicate that, compared with smaller ponds, larger ponds are better for supporting aquatic biodiversity due to a more heterogeneous environment and ability to dilute pollutants. Also, the presence of other ponds in the vicinity of the stormwater ponds would facilitate the movement of invertebrates between ponds through increased connectivity. The redundancy analysis showed that different taxa exhibited different responses to pollutants in the sediments, indicating potential differences in pollution tolerance among organisms. Therefore, the factors that may affect pollutant bioavailability in the sediments should be analysed. In addition, since different species, even within one family, responded differently to the same pollutant, it is important to identify organisms to the species level.

TI  - Neighborhood walkability and body mass index in New York City
AU  - Konikov-Titievsky, Lina
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The primary objective of this dissertation was to examine the association between neighborhood walkability and self-reported body mass index (BMI) among New York City residents. Neighborhood walkability was defined as mixed land use, population density, pedestrian injuries density, subway stops density, bus stops density, tree density, and street connectivity. In addition walkability index was created based on all available measures of walkability in this study. Although the literature review shows that the relationships between walkability and self-reported BMI are qualitatively consistent across studies, the use of self-reported BMI is not fully justified given the well-known error in BMI estimates that are based on the self-report of height and weight. Preliminary analysis suggests that the impact of such errors is not negligible and in fact may produce modeling results that could be misleading. Consequently, the secondary objective of this dissertation was to investigate the nature of these errors and develop prediction equations which were then used to correct for the reporting error.In order to address the primary objective, data from the Community Health Survey 2002 were linked with zip code level data. Cross-sectional analysis using multilevel modeling was conducted. Population density, subway stops density, bus stops density, street connectivity, land use mix and walkability index were all inversely associated with BMI. These associations were statistically significant for all walkability indicators considered, with the exception of land use mix and subway stops density. In contrast to my hypothesis, however, pedestrian injuries density was not positively associated with BMI. Instead, an inverse association that was statistically significant was observed. Prediction equations were developed using data from New York City Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Consequently, Beta coefficients from these equations were used to adjust for reporting error by calculating “measured” or corrected BMI in the CHS 2002 sample. When corrected BMI was used as an outcome in women, Beta coefficients for each walkability exposure changed by more than 10% as compared to Beta coefficients with self-reported BMI as an outcome, which indicated that results for self-reported BMI were biased towards the null. In men, only two exposures changed by at least 10% with corrected BMI as an outcome. Although the results based on the self-reported BMI and corrected BMI were quantitatively different, mathematical difference did not suggest conceptual differences. Since it is uncommon for epidemiologic studies to obtain clinically measured height and weight, these findings provide important evidence that the association between neighborhood walkability and BMI will be captured even if BMI is calculated from self-reported values of height and weight.

T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Spatial heterogeneity is an inherent part of landscapes and often has important consequences for the movements, distribution, or persistence of many wildlife species. Quantifying the composition, configuration, and connectivity of suitable habitat and its consequences for populations can provide valuable information about both the ecology and management of many species. This type of information may be particularly useful for informing the conservation and management of threatened or endangered species. The gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) is a species of high conservation concern due to the decline of populations across its range and its role in the ecosystem. To help inform conservation of this species, I assessed connectivity of suitable habitat across a broad portion of the gopher tortoise's range, quantified habitat connectivity under various management alternatives at selected sites in Alabama, and developed a spatially explicit population projection model to predict the future population consequences of various management strategies. This research provides evidence for a broad-scale pattern of changing habitat connectivity across a large portion of the gopher tortoise's range and highlights the importance of considering management effects on connectivity at finer scales. Results from the population projection demonstrate the importance of considering a spatial component when projecting population size into the future and indicate a need for further research on gopher tortoise survival rates. The models developed in this research demonstrate the utility of these types of spatial analyses for informing conservation and management, and could be adapted to other species of conservation concern.

TI  - Carbon in conurbations: Afforestation and carbon storage as consequences of urban sprawl in Colorado's Front Range
AU  - Golubiewski, Nancy Ellen
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - In the arid western United States, urbanization transforms landscapes from sparsely vegetated grasslands with tree-lined riparian corridors into matrices of asphalt, concrete, turf grass, and multi-strata wooded stands. This research sought to understand the consequences of urbanization upon carbon pools in the Front Range of Colorado, a metropolitan area undergoing expansive urban transformation. Vegetative and edaphic C, as well as biomass and other soil physical/chemical properties, were measured throughout the Denver-Boulder metropolitan area in 2000 and 2001. Anthropogenic activities leave clear signatures on all three C compartments measured. The comparison of C storage in the vegetated spaces of urban areas to that in grasslands and agricultural fields reveals a marked increase as well as a proportional shift in storage from belowground to aboveground. Lawn grass produces more biomass and stores more C than local prairie or agricultural fields. Introduced woody vegetation comprises a substantial C pool in urban greenspaces and represents a wholly new ecosystem feature. Established urban greenspaces harbor larger C pools than native grasslands on a per area basis. Rather than map the urban land-cover types, regional detection of the proportion of the urbanized landscape occupied by vegetated and anthropogenic components extracted biophysical information of the urban/rural matrix. Convex geometry and partial unmixing algorithms were used to extract major landscape elements from an AVIRIS image of Boulder, including six vegetation endmembers. Other scene components were also identified, including soil, water, and five impervious surfaces. The fractional abundance of urban vegetation equaled or exceeded that of vegetation in surrounding areas. In order to understand the effect of the per-area C increase in anthropogenic landscapes regionally, the distribution of carbon in land covers across the landscape was investigated. Regional C estimates were based on both fractional abundances and land-use/land-cover categories. A carbon hotspot exists in the urbanized areas where well-established urban vegetation occupies residential neighborhoods, urban greenspaces, and city streets. Other hotspots exist along riparian corridors and on vegetated foothills. Between 1930 and 1990, developed land almost quintupled in area in the Front Range of Colorado. During the same time period, estimates of the carbon pool trajectory range from −3% to +18%. The true direction, given the local context, is surmised to be neutral or positive.

TI  - Integrating Social, Political, and Economic Factors into Spatial Models of Grizzly Bear Conflict and Connectivity
AU  - Spragg, Shannon
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The rapid expansion of the global human footprint is forcing humans and wildlife to share more space. There is rising concern over human wildlife conflict and its effects on human and animal wellbeing. Investigation into the biophysical and social landscape features that shape conflict or how spatial patterns in conflict ultimately affect species’ movement or survival is limited. Characterizing landscape connectivity and identifying potential movement corridors is a key conservation strategy, but is challenged by the fact that many wildlife species navigate a mosaic of infrastructure, available habitat, land uses, and political boundaries. In this thesis, I investigated the social and biophysical factors that contribute to conflict with grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and how this conflict may impact connectivity for bears across southern British Columbia and northern Washington. I selected this system due to its rich cultural history with grizzly bear biological and social complexity. The region has current grizzly bear populations, extirpated areas, state/provincial and international boundaries, diverse land uses, and a variety of social values towards wildlife. I used two resource selection approaches to first determine the probability of conflict reporting across all wildlife species, and then to determine the probability of bear conflict specifically. First, I used presence and background sampling in combination with Bayesian logistic regression to identify important predictors of conflict across species using 5,606 reported instances of conflict and 8,703 background points. Then, I fit a second regression treating 2,062 bear conflict occurrences as presence points and 3,544 instances of other conflict as absences to characterize how bear conflict might differ from wildlife conflict in general.I found that predictors of conflict differed between species and that the probability of general wildlife conflict was substantially different than the probability of bear conflict across the study system. The strongest predictors of conflict for all species were human population density and both livestock and row-crop operation density. The strongest predictors of bear conflict were public opinion of bears, proximity to existing grizzly bear populations, and suitable bear habitat. Generating spatial predictions on these models indicates that the urban centers of the Okanagan (e.g., Kelowna, Vernon) are hotspots for general wildlife conflict while the semi-urban and rural agriculture landscapes (e.g., outside Penticton and along the US and Canada border) are hotspots for bear conflict (Chapter 1). I then incorporated spatial predictions of the probability of bear conflict into the resistance surface for a connectivity model across the traditional territory of the Sylix people to investigate how spatial patterns of conflict may impact bear movement and the ability to recolonize the traditional Sylix territory. I used Omniscape to model connectivity as a function of biophysical variables to identify the most likely available movement pathways and compared this to model outputs that incorporated the probability of conflict into the resistance surface to determine the effects of conflict on grizzly bear connectivity. My research highlights the role that social and institutional variables play in conflict and how these effects may differ between species. Further, my results illustrate the potential for conflict to constrain wildlife movement and highlight the need to treat connectivity conservation as a socio-ecological issue rather than just an ecological one.

Now, there is a large market demand at home and abroad. In recent years, wether the varieties or the planting areas are all in the rapid expansion. The Chinese herbal medicine has become a major pillar industries in Anguo city of Hebei province. S. miltiorrhiza is the authentic herb in Anguo city of Hebei province and enjoyde the name of "one of the eight drugs in Qi". However,it prone to low survival rate,pest disease and other issues in the cultivation process, resulting the yield and quality of S. miltiorrhiza in declining. AM fungi widely distributed in terrestrial ecosystems and has many beneficial effects on plant.It can promote plant growth and development , to improve plant disease resistance and stress tolerance. So, it has knowed as "bio-fertilizer". It also could improve the soil physical and chemical properties, maintenance plant rhizosphere soil ecosystem virtuous circle. In this study, the symbiotic relationship of the S. miltiorrhiza and the AM fungi were used as an entry point, the community composition, the spatio-temporal distribution, species diversity and their relations with soil factors were investigated and analyzed. Wish can offer the material and basis to screening of AM fungi dominant species, use of mycorrhizal biotechnology to improve yield and quality of S. miltiorrhiza. Main research results are as follows: 1 An abundant species resources of AM fungi was found in the rhizosphere of the S. miltiorrhiza. Isolation and purification of the mycorrhizal fungi led to the identification of 24 species belonged to 4 genera: 16 to the Glomus, 5 to the Acaulospora 2 to the Scutellospora and 1 to the Entrophospora. 2 Ecological distribution of the diverse species is different: Glomus and Acaulospora in the three sampling sits are all have distribution, Scutellospora only occurred in Qicun, Entrophospora only occurred in Shatou. Some species of AM fungi only occurred in one samplingsites, such as Acaulospora.laevis, Scutellospora.calospor, Scutellospora.erythropa only occurred in Qicun. Glomus.geosporum only occurred in Zhongyaocaizhongzhijidi. Entrophospora. Infrequens and Glomus.multicaule only occurred in Shatou. 3 S. miltiorrhiza can form well symbionts with AM fungi. The average colonization is up to 68.1%, and the average spore density reach 1714.9/100g soil. The roots of S. miltiorrhiza could be infencted by AM fungi and form a typical mycorrhizae, then growth form of vesicles and arbuscular. The mycorrhizal type is intermediate type. 4 A distinct spatial and seasonal variation of AM fungi from the S. miltiorrhiza was found. Spore density and colonization in Zhongzhijidi were higher than in other two sampling sites. The greatest colonization and spore density levels were found in the second layers, between 10~20cm. October spore density and colonization was significantly higher than in July. 5 The AM fungal species diversity and distribution in the three sites are different.The dominant species in three sites is not have a significant difference,scuh as Glomus.aggregatum is the common dominant species in three sites. However, there are differences in AM fungal species composition. There is a significant difference of the AM fungi composition between in Zhongzhijidi and Shatou. The AM fungi richness in Qicun is significant higher than in Zhongzhijidi and Shatou, but the evenness is the lowest. Shannon-Wiener indices at the three sites listed in order were: Shatou=Zhongzhijidi>Qicun. 6 The AM fungi species diversity is closely related with soil factors. The available N and organic matter content in Qicun was higher than in other sites,but the spore density and the species richnness lower than other sites.The spore density and species richnness had a correlated negative with available N and

TI  - Seeds, Hands and Lands: Maize Genetic Resources of Highland Guatemala in Space and Time
AU  - van Etten, Jacob
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Crop genetic resources are an important aspect of agricultural production. Agricultural innovation through plant breeding is generally seen as an efficient means to support food security and economic development in poor areas. Modern varieties of maize, a major cereal and the subject of this study, are at present used on roughly half of the tropical acreage of this crop. Several strategies are being developed to reach the other half, which involve farmers being more active in the innovation process. Field studies of farmers’ seed and crop management aim to support the design of farmer-participatory plant breeding activities. In these approaches and studies there is a tendency to focus on seed selection as the core process of plant genetic innovation. The present study concentrates on the gene pool of maize in the western highlands of Guatemala, as shaped by seed exchange and replacement by farmers. Maize is traditional in this area, and the main food crop.Chapter 1 gives a conceptual critique of existing models in participatory plant breeding. There is a tendency to focus on seed selection as the core process of plant genetic innovation. The present study argues that this model should be broadened and sees gene flow as a part of the creative process of crop evolution. This conceptual change implies that more attention should be paid to seed exchange, as seeds are a main vehicle for gene flow in cereals. Also, attention should not be paid only to individual decision making but also to the connections and structures which provide the conditions under which exchange takes place. Over longer periods, individual seed exchange transactions add up to a collective gene pool structure, with ‘emergent’ properties beyond the scope of individual farmers, but nevertheless important for the design of management strategies for crop genetic resources. The goal of this research is to gain insight into the shaping of the gene pool as a collective entity in the case of highland Guatemala. To reach this goal, this study combines different research methods in an interdisciplinary way to reconstruct historical change and explain the current geographical structure in the maize gene pool.Chapter 2 explores the historiographic and ethnographic literature on highland Guatemala to sketch five centuries of change in social connectivity and technological needs and identifying disasters with consequences for maize seed. It suggests that events like human disease epidemics of the colonial period, resulting in demographic decline, have had an important influence on the continuity and spatial distribution of maize genetic resources. Also it is pointed out that the twentieth century brought both regional social integration and local fragmentation, and that this, together with demographic recuperation, is important in relation to the maize biodiversity and farmers’ knowledge about it. Concerns about diversity conservation should not lead to attempts to resist economic integration; the formerly closed character of communities is largely a colonial product and historical connections between communities are perhaps deeper than often thought. The same may go for maize genetic resources. Instead, maize agriculture should confront the challenges of modernity in ways that support collaboration between communities.Chapter 3 elaborates a more detailed study on historical change in farmer knowledge about maize diversity between 1927/1937 and 2004. In 1927 and 1937, two lists with local cultivars and their characteristics were drawn up by ethnographers for the township of Jacaltenango. Close inspection made clear that these two lists were rather consistent, and that a useful comparison with data on farmer knowledge in 2004 could thus be made. By using a sample of informants spread across several communities and ecologies in the township, an unequal spatial distribution of farmer knowledge was anticipated. A technique from cognitive anthropology, consensus analysis, was used to assess the likelihood of consensus about the presence of each cultivar. The current study found that absolute diversity losses were few, and involved cultivars that are probably not genetically unique, since they were introduced before 1937 as a result of labour migration to coffee farms. Many newly introduced maize types were reported by farmers. Seed introductions corresponded to different forms of regional mobility, including forced migration and maize trade. This chapter further highlights the importance of taking into account spatial differences in knowledge between communities in the same township. A previous study in the same area, based on interviews in several township head towns, concluded, incorrectly, according to the present study, that substantial cultivar losses had occurred.Chapter 4 investigates contemporary farmer seed exchange and replacement based on 257 formal interviews in the highland townships of Chimaltenango. The study focuses on (1) the spatial distribution of cultivar names, (2) seed sources and flows, (3) reasons to discard seeds and (4) variables explaining choices between different seed sources. The fourth element was based on the application of classification trees to the interview data, supplemented with spatial data from another source. The distribution of cultivar names suggested that regional exchange of seeds of traditional and modern varieties occurs, but is constrained by altitudinal differences in the landscape. The data also indicate that most seed flows are local, and that regional seed flows are mostly taking place within the administrative department. Regional seed flows originate often in cities. When farmers discarded seed lots they were mainly motivated by their disadvantages (high plants and long growing cycles). This result was consistent with the finding that regional seed introductions were associated with seed lots with short plants and short growing seasons. This confirms that regional seed exchange is an important source of innovations. It is argued that farmers are dependent on regional sources to counteract the local tendency of cultivars to become taller and tardier. This tendency is probably the result of unintended selection for more competitive plants.Chapter 5 is a study of the spatial distribution of maize populations. By investigating a collection of 80 samples of maize seed from the department of Chimaltenango, and five modern varieties, it attempts to infer the seed exchange processes shaping the current spatial structure of the maize gene pool. Location, altitude, morphological, phenological, and molecular marker (SSR) data were analysed. The analysis identified altitudinal differences in the landscape as an important constraining factor in seed exchange, which is related to adaptation as measured by yield. Locally it found evidence for an isolation-by-distance effect, which points to a falling intensity of seed exchange over longer distances. However, over longer ranges (>8 km), this effect disappears. This was interpreted as evidence for the existence of different mechanisms for local and regional seed exchange. In this chapter, evidence for the influence of modern varieties is also presented. This influence was detected for the lower areas only.Chapter 6 argues on the basis of the findings in the preceding chapters that farmers in highland Guatemala maintain maize genetic resources in open systems. Although local seed exchange is common and is an important shaping force for the maize gene pool, occasional regional seed exchange is important in both past and present. The present spatial distribution of maize populations reflects dynamic processes and should not be conserved as such. To innovate, farmers take direct advantage of the differences between crop populations evolving in different places, in order to achieve phenotypic changes in their own fields. It is not artificial selection that is the main creative force in local innovation – the dominant view among advocates of participatory plant breeding – but the flow of seed lots in the landscape. Consequently, efforts to support seed-based innovation should not only focus on selection or local adaptation, but strengthen the capacities of innovation through seed exchange between locales. Innovation should seek to further exploit ecological complementarities between areas (and not only the representation of broader zones of ecological adaptation). For this end, new regional infrastructures to handle seeds and information may need to be created.

TI  - Molecular phylogeography of mongolian toad
AU  - Dong, Bing Jun
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorThe Mongolian toad, Bufo raddei, also known as the piebald toad or Siberian sand toad, belongs to Bufo, Bufonidae, Amphibia. The toad is one of Palaearctic species, and found in China, Korea, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Republic of Mongolia, and Russia. The most northern distribution of the toad reaches Lake Baikal and the Heilongjiang (Amur River) basin. In China, it ranges through much of Northern Part, and the southernmost population is found in Jiangsu and Anhui. This species is widespread in China, including Jiangsu, Anhui, Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Helongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning provinces, as well as Xinjiang-Uigur, Ningxia-Hui, Inner Mongolia autonomous regions and Beijing, Tianjin cities. In this paper, phylogenetic and population genetic approaches were employed to reveal the phylogeographic structure of the Mongolian toad. Intensive and homogeneous sampling was carried out as far as possible for finding as many genetic variation between and within populations as possible. A total of 195 samples were collected at 20 sampling sites in China, and additional three samples from Lake Baikal were donated by friends. Mitochondrial D-loop region of the toad was sequenced, and the length of the amplified sequences of D-loop was 1178 bp. The haplotype diversity of the collected populations of the Mongolian toad was 0.974, and the nucleotide diversity was 0.016, both of which indicated that there was a high genetic diversity in the toad. A total of 162 variable sites in D-loop sequences from internal populations defined 115 haplotypes, among which there were 7 haplotypes shared between populations, 21 haplotypes shared within populations, and 87 specific haplotypes. The range of genetic distances among haplotypes was 0%-3.6%, and the mean genetic distance was 1.6%. Both phylogenetic analysis and distribution of diagnostic sites indicated that all populations of the Mongolian toad could be grouped into two main clades, namely Northwest Clade (Clade A) and Mainland Clade (Clade B). The distribution of populations from the two main clades overlapped in the Northwest of China. The mean divergence between the two main clades was 2.64%. Mainland Clade (Clade B) could be divided further into two subclades, namely Subclade B1 and Subclade B2. Among parsimony informational sites from internal populations, there were 6 variable sites that could work as diagnostic sites to distinguish between Northwest Clade (Clade A) and Mainland Clade (Clade B). On the basis of phylogenetic tree, analysis of statistical parsimony network, and distribution of haplotypes in populations, we inferred that the eastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau might be the differentiation center for the Mongolian toad. Analysis of data suggested that the differentiation of the two main clades occurred approximately 2.1 Million Year Ago. As a matter of fact, it was pretty nearly coincident with the third phase of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau uplift, which might be responsible for the geographical isolation between the two clades. Lineages in Clade A evolved in isolation. And although they showed a trend of population expansion, lineages in Clade A were found only in a small area in West of China. By contrast, lineages in Clade B showed a strong trend of population dispersal, even some of them might undergo the dispersal in the opposite direction. All the dispersal had laid a foundation for the present distribution pattern of the Mongolian toad. The unsymmetrical unimodal mismatch distributions were found in all four starlike phylogenies, most obviously in Group D. There were significant negative values in Fu's test for the phylogenies, which indicated that all four starlike phylogenies had undergone population expansion that occurred presumably 147000-36000 years ago. Results showed that both the geographic isolation among different refuges and the remarkable dispersal pattern of one of lineages constituted the population history of the Mongolian toad. Results of sampling and phylogenetic data also suggested that there was an apparent decline in populations of the Mongolian toad; therefore, it was imperative to take protective measures for the toad. Considering the highest nucleotide diversity in Northwest of China, we suggested that the priority for conservation should go to the

TI  - Aquatic macroinvertebrate biodiversity of lowland rural and urban ponds in Leicestershire
AU  - Hill, Matthew J
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Ponds are common and abundant features in nearly all landscapes typical of European lowland landscapes yet research on freshwater biodiversity has traditionally focussed on larger waterbodies such as lakes and rivers. This has led to an increased need to understand and quantify the biodiversity associated with pond habitats to better inform the active conservation and management of these small waterbodies. This thesis examines the aquatic macroinvertebrate biodiversity (alpha, beta and gamma) and conservation value of 95 ponds in Leicestershire, UK, across a variety of urban and rural landscape types and at a range of spatial scales. In addition, the relative importance of local (physicochemical and biological) and spatial (connectivity) variables in structuring macroinvertebrate communities within ponds is investigated. At a regional scale, the greatest macroinvertebrate biodiversity and conservation value was recorded within meadow ponds compared to urban, agricultural and forest ponds. Spatially, ponds were highly physically and biologically heterogeneous. Temporally (seasonally), invertebrate communities were most dissimilar in meadow and agricultural ponds but assemblages were similar in urban and forest ponds. In urban landscapes, park ponds supported a greater diversity of invertebrates than other urban or garden ponds and typically had a greater conservation value. Garden ponds were the most taxon poor of those investigated. Perennial floodplain meadow ponds supported a greater biodiversity of invertebrates compared to ephemeral meadow ponds although conservation value was similar. Despite regular inundation from the River Soar, ephemeral ponds supported distinct communities compared to perennial meadow ponds. Aquatic macrophytes supported a higher diversity of taxa than other pond mesohabitats across all landscapes studied. Physicochemical factors were identified to be the dominant influence on macroinvertebrate assemblages although, a combination of local and spatial factors best explained the variation in community composition at a regional scale and for meadow ponds. Spatial factors were not identified to significantly influence urban pond communities. This study highlights the ecological importance and conservation value of ponds in rural and anthropogenically disturbed landscapes. Recognition of the significant contribution of ponds to freshwater biodiversity at regional and landscape scales is important for future conservation of pond habitats and will help focus and direct conservation strategies to where they are needed most.

TI  - Informing Landscape-Scale Management of the Greater Horseshoe Bat Rhinolophus Ferrumequinum
AU  - Finch, Domhnall
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Global land use is changing at an unprecedented rate and has been identified as a key driver of habitat loss, fragmentation and species decline in the natural environment. Understanding how land use influences spatial patterns in species abundance, and habitat connectivity at a landscape scale is critical for the survival of wildlife populations. The focal species of my research is the rare greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), which was once widespread across southern England and Wales. However, owing to changes in agricultural land management and the expansion of urban areas, its range has contracted considerably over the last century. Using a series of ecological techniques, including a novel predictive modelling approach, field experiments and social network analysis, this thesis aims to identify which ecological factors affect their activity and movement at a landscape scale. The work also provides conservation practitioners the ability to identify the locations of these impacts, pinch-points, in the wider environment; where strategic planning and mitigation measures can be applied to increase their overall occurrence and abundance in the wider environment. Using a field experiment, I examined how traffic noise can influence the relative activity levels of free-living bats. Overall, I showed that traffic noise can significantly reduce the activity levels of R. ferrumequinum, as well as other bat species, along linear feature. Using a separate field experiment, I determined that the sonic spectrum had a greater negative effect on bat activity than the ultrasonic spectrum. These results therefore suggest that the mode of action is likely to be through general deterrence and avoidance rather than through the masking of echolocation calls. R. ferrumequinum are widely considered to be dependent on linear landscape features such as woodland edges and hedgerows. My research supported this view, and highlighted the particular importance of treelines, which were associated with greater activity than even sympathetically managed hedgerows. However, an important novel finding from my research was that about a third of all activity recorded at paired detectors was derived from the middle of fields. It is therefore important to consider these more open habitats, as well as hedgerows, treelines and woodland edges, when designing and conducting ecological impact assessments for future developments. Bats use the landscape at a large spatial scale, and responses to any particular challenge (such as a new lighting scheme or urban development) are likely to depend on their context within a landscape. For example, the disruption of a commuting route is likely to have a greater impact where only one suitable route exists, compared with scenarios where there are numerous alternatives. To understand better how R. ferrumequinum interacts with the British landscape, I therefore created models of predicted functional connectivity around four maternity roosts using Circuitscape software. Using non-invasive static bat detectors as a method of ground validation, I created robust models predicting R. ferrumequinum movement; which allowed the identification of pinch-points in the landscape, either those areas limiting species movement or highly important for the species conservation. While most research, and the work of ecological practitioners, focuses on the maternity season, hibernation ecology has received much less attention. Yet given that horseshoe bats are known to move roost location frequently during the hibernation period, it is important to understand more about this behaviour. Using social network analysis, I demonstrate that adult males are significantly more central (connected to a higher number of individual bats) in the network during the hibernation period. I found that movements between hibernacula were associated with both age and degree centrality of individual bats, with those more geographically isolated hibernacula playing an important role for the movement of certain individuals at a landscape scale. This highlights that despite low activity in some of these smaller roost locations, they are a conservation priority to decrease the risk of fragmentation and loss of connectivity within the wider landscape. The results of my meta-analysis, which was based on 22 studies, demonstrated the significant negative effects endectocides on Aphodiinae dung beetles. My results suggest that ivermectin has the highest negative effect on the abundance of both adult and large Aphodiinae dung beetles. However, contrasting results were observed for dung beetle occurrence, with adult beetles showing an attraction to dung with endectocides and larvae showing the complete opposite, with poor survival rates and impaired development. Over time this could have significant negative effects on dung beetle populations. The results of this thesis indicate that the landscape-scale conservation of R. ferrumequinum is complex. Considerations need to be given to a suite of factors ranging from the prey items they consume to the physical habitat structures which they utilise. From this research, specific locations and features which have impacts on their movement and activity can be identified, allowing the outputs to be used by decision-makers as a tool to inform local management strategies. The prioritisation of conservation activity for the species can be aided by spatially-explicit models, such as the one I developed using Circuitscape, which bring together multiple input layers to create outputs readily interpretable to practitioners. However, to achieve a successful outcome for this priority species, collaborative efforts from many stakeholders, across boundaries, are required.

AB  - Urbanization offers unique challenges for wildlife.  The urban landscape is fragmented and changes available resources for wildlife.  Human-dominated landscapes can provide food, shelter, or cover through human-subsidized resources.  However, to thrive in human-dominated landscapes, wildlife must adapt or disperse, otherwise they will die. In this study, I investigated how the urban landscape and human behavior influence urban wildlife occurrence. I established 35 camera sites during April 2020.  I surveyed residential property dwellers around each camera site to determine what behavior they performed that could increase species occurrence. Gray fox and coyote site use decreased with increased isolation while no species responded to patch area.  Almost all species investigated responded to attractants but not all showed a positive response. Although number of survey participants was small, site use by wildlife tended to increase with owning a bird feeder and putting out trash the day before pickup.

AU  - Volker, C. M.
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Until recently, rural landscapes used to be largely the unintentional and self-evident by-products of agriculture, of farm-based labour. This situation has changed dramatically. Now recognized as public spaces, rural landscapes and the nature they include are expected to fulfil important functions for society as a whole. Farmers' management of such areas is increasingly being seen as necessary for non-agrarian functions such as recreation and tourism, the development of new nature areas and the preservation of the cultural heritage.In this dissertation, the transformation process is studied from a sociological perspective. Chapter 1 ascertains that the management of a landscape occurs in a very complex social environment. The various claims on rural landscapes mark them as contested areas. Valuable rural landscapes that combine several supralocal collective qualities depend on state intervention for their survival. At the same time, state intervention needs support, notably from farmers, who are the owners and users of agricultural land. Farmers are expected to incorporate politically expedient management measures in their social and agricultural practices. They have not yet done so. Taking care of the environment as a collective good in an affluent urban society is very different from controlling nature for the market-driven production of food and raw materials in advanced land-based agricultural systems.The aim of the study was to contribute to the debate on the future management of valuable rural landscapes, by achieving insights into the opportunities for sustainable management of landscapes by farmers. The study focused on management that accommodates the need for more features of nature in rural landscapes. Three facets are presented:1. A historical outline of the supralocal urban interest in nature-based rural landscapes in the Netherlands. This is followed by an outline of the modernization process in the agrarian domain paying particular attention to transformations in the system of agricultural production.2. Perceptions and practices in farm management, derived from a social survey of farmers in Northeast Twente, in Overijssel province, the Netherlands. In order to predict the strategic preferences of these farmers regarding the place of nature and landscape in their professional skills and market orientation, a model is developed and applied, using empirical data from the social survey.3. Finally, several strategies for achieving the support and participation of farmers are suggested, with the aim of increasing the likelihood that both valuable landscapes and farmers will survive.Chapter 2 discusses the views on nature and on landscape characteristics within three socio-political discourses. Rural landscapes in the Netherlands fit in a centuries-old tradition of planned land use, based on collective intervention in nature and in the physical environment. The discourses stress different opinions about functions of the countryside, nature and urban-rural interactions. Part of the growing public awareness of rural landscapes in the Netherlands is a new attitude to nature that is able to emerge in urban environments. This attitude is to do with admiring and enjoying nature rather than with taming and exploiting it. The rise of modern industrialized society brought with it a new function for rural areas: that of being a green and pleasant land. The twentieth century has seen the emergence of a new institutional field in which nature and landscape organizations have evolved to meet the growing demand for nature reserves and landscape parks. Late twentieth century Dutch public opinion is greatly in favour of nature, but less in favour of on-farm nature conservation and has a poor opinion of farmers as managers of nature.Chapter 3 discusses developments in Dutch agriculture, and state intervention in the conservation of valuable features of nature and landscape related to the agrarian domain. Parallel to the social movements that aimed to emancipate the urban working class, a process of emancipation of farmers emerged, followed by the modernization of the system of producing food by farming. Whereas small-scale farming assured a stable and rich semi-natural landscape that could be enjoyed by city dwellers, the agricultural production system developed in the opposite direction, of mechanization and industrialization. The post-war revolution in agriculture resulted in deruralization: that is, in agricultural production shifting from a territorial basis to a sectoral basis. Small-scale region-based mixed farms were replaced by modern specialized farms. This process was supported by land consolidation projects, that had enormous repercussions in terms of the loss of biodiversity, of valuable nature elements, of characteristic landscape features and of multiple land use.From the 1960s onwards, vehement conflicts emerged because of the claims articulated by the agriculture and nature conservation lobbies and the separated prospects for urban and rural development brought about by the distinctive planning systems. At the political level, a compromise was reached with the Policy Document on the Relationship between Nature and Agriculture (1975), which featured a zoning of agricultural land. Under this Policy Document, two types of valuable rural landscapes were to be protected against further optimalization of agricultural land use. The Nature Policy Plan of 1990 launched a more pro-active strategy for nature: a National Ecological Network was proposed, in which existing woodland, nature reserves and valuable rural landscapes were to be preserved and rehabilitated. In addition, transition zones and new areas designated for large-scale nature development were to be established on agricultural land. To meet these targets, the policy-making process had to be adjusted. Additional support was needed. In recent years therefore, policy making focusing on subsidizing the traditional state and non-governmental organizations for nature management has been replaced or complemented with result-oriented measures, open to more land users in rural areas.Meanwhile, Dutch agriculture has reached a cross-roads. The choice is between the transformation process continuing towards knowledge-based, capital-intensive, technologically advanced food production systems that have a narrow perspective on the sustainability of farms and the environment ('traditional modernization'), and the features of an impending second wave of modernization, comprising agrarian and structural diversification of rural areas ('rural renewal'). The result is the occurrence of two different and partly contradictory development patterns, making the future of Dutch rural landscapes more unpredictable.Chapter 4 outlines the prospects for Dutch farmers. Three processes of integration have entered their domain. In agriculture, farmers face a process of increased regulation and techno-economic commercialization of the production system. In nature and landscape conservation, they face the claims made by the social movement industries advocating the development of 'new nature' as a new mission and a new market. Finally, a process of increased state intervention and state support entails taking the environment into account as a collective good (the quality of nature, soil, water and landscape). This latter process is accompanied by new style regulation, in which farmers are challenged to assume more responsibility and to achieve more self-regulation to bring about rural development.The consequence of this is that the world of farmers has become much more complex. Now farmers have to learn how to deal with their shrinking freedom of action in conventional agriculture and how to manage the diversity of new claims made on their land. Large areas of the Dutch countryside have already been designated for de-intensified agricultural production. But how likely and inspiring do recent developments seem to Dutch farmers? Dutch farmers seem to be facing difficult choices and much uncertainty.Chapter 5 outlines to what extent Dutch farmers are willing to choose in favour of modified, sustainable practices to benefit nature and landscape in their farm management. It includes the results of a social survey conducted in Northeast Twente, covering 81 randomly selected respondents farming 5 ha land or more. These farmers contend that there are still considerable amounts of nature and landscape elements on their farms. With few exceptions, the perceived annoyance caused by such elements is low. In most cases the protective measures are restricted to promoting the conservation of meadow birds and small animals. The farmers are familiar with most initiatives for protecting and promoting the development of nature and landscape elements, but their interest in participating in such initiatives varies. It turns out that their stewardship of nature and landscape elements as part of their farm labour is modest. They prefer the skills needed for optimizing agricultural production. When questioned about preferred combinations of income, they give priority to income from conventional agricultural production. Many farmers are unimpressed by the incentives offered to steward nature and landscape. Questioned about the level of farm management, half of the respondents replied that they prefer the tasks of the skilled labourer, followed by organizational tasks. Only a few favour the true entrepreneur, capable of responding adequately to off-farm developments. Their plans for future development focus on enlarging the farm rather than on specializing or diversifying the farm business. They display considerable enthusiasm for new captial investments and personal improvement of knowledge and skills in agricultural production. Many respondents voice concrete objections to having more nature and landscape elements on the farm, basing their motives on economics and loss of freedom. When asked to range the actors in the networks important to ensure that their plans would be achieved, the respondents reported that stakeholders in the production network and the family were the most essential. Stakeholders for the management of nature and landscape occupy a marginal position in their networks.In order to construct a predictive model, chapter 6 explores some theoretical insights relating to farmers' preferences. Theories in rural sociology and the literature on strategic management yielded elements for this model. Chapter 7 discusses the entire model and its constituents, both conceptually and operationally. Strategic preferences, operationalized as a two-dimensional construct covering the interest of farmers in nature and landscape in their professional skills and in their market orientation, result in three groups of farmers. One group has no interest in nature and landscape (33%), the second group prefers the current balance (status quo) between production and nature on the farm (44%) and the smallest group (23%) shows interest in having more features of nature and landscape value on the farm. As a consequence, change-oriented farmers dominate over continuity-oriented farmers, but opinions about the likely prospects vary. The first group opts for traditional modernization paying attention to environmental problems rather than to nature and landscape. The smallest group prefers nature and landscape-included rural renewal.Regression analysis was used to determine predictive variables for these preferences. The number of variables with statistically significant influence on preferences is found to be limited. Perception variables prove to be much more important than structure and farm characteristics in agriculture, including the presence of nature and landscape elements. The external orientation of farmers, that is their interests in external initiatives and economic activities in nature and landscape, has by far the most predictive value. The internal orientation, covering the preferred level of farm management and the hindrance experienced from stewarding nature and landscape elements, is not decisive at all. The predictive value of the internal orientation, the farm characteristics and the presence of elements of nature and landscape are overshadowed by the external orientation of farmers.Chapter 8 focuses on how the contribution of Dutch farmers to the management of nature and landscape can be improved, making both the quality of the environment and the livelihood of farmers more sustainable. It is concluded that there is still a considerable cultural gap between the persons who have interests in one and the same valuable rural landscape. To the urban population, nature is part of a hedonistic value orientation. To farmers, nature is part of a rural way of life. As a consequence, state policy measures intended to do justice to dominant visions of nature in a highly urbanized society meet considerable resistence in local rural situations. This is particularly striking if measures are placed in the perspective of creating new nature ('nature development') in that situation. Though some Dutch farmers display interest in urban visions on nature and landscape, little of this interest is incorporated into modified farming systems and practices. For most farmers these urban visions are a 'narrow' farm target.It is recommended to integrate the communication and participation of farmers into an innovative policy-making process. So far, Dutch farmers have not provided the landscape that urban people desire. The latter would like to have a more natural landscape. The strategy for achieving a more sustainable future for valuable rural landscapes in which farmers perform as knowledgeable participants in the social process has four strategic elements:• First, a break-through of the status quo can be achieved by retaining external actors as innovators in the region.• Second, the relationship between demand and supply of valuable rural landscapes should be established. There are three feasible options. One option excludes farmers as future managers, devolving their contributions to a variety of other actors involved in the landscape. The two other options include opportunities for farmers, provided they are ready to adapt a more open and flexible attitude to the products and services urban people want. The first deals with the preservation and reproduction of traditional valuable features of nature and landscape. It implies development in favour of the cultural heritage. However, this option does not offer a structural solution for each valuable rural landscape and all farmers (the landscape as open-air museum). In the alternative option, the stewardship of landscapes should be based on 'normal' economic activities and services. In contrast to conventional agriculture, however, the alternative option means a wider and more flexible orientation to the environment as a natural resource and a more demand-driven economy (the landscape as part of rural renewal). The best prospect is offered by organic farming, if possible with profitable side-activities. In addition, stewardship continues to be necessary for non-marketable qualities such as the preservation of features of nature and landscape in the light of the cultural heritage and biodiversity. These stewardship activities are dependent on political decisions and government commitment rather than the mechanism of the market competition.• The third element is improved network management. At present, Dutch farmers qualify themselves as a group of outsiders in the network for nature and landscape management. Additional networks at the local and regional level could achieve the connection of the networks for agricultural production and nature conservation, featuring intermediary functions. Better network management should also improve the coherence of the conditioning, stimulative and challenging measures in the policy-making process.• Finally, more attention should be paid to incorporating measures in farm management. Dutch farmers do not lack information but they do lack instrumental knowledge about initiatives for nature and landscape management. This could be remedied by setting up regional centres for communication and innovation that bridge the gap between a programme of action at the institutional level and the implementation of measures at farm level.

TI  - Cumulative impacts of stream burial on network structure and functional connectivity in headwater stream systems
AU  - Weitzell, Roy Everett, Jr.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Stream burial is common during urbanization, and disproportionately affects headwater streams. Burial undermines the physical, chemical, and spatial processes governing aquatic life, with consequences for water quality and biodiversity, both within headwaters and in downstream waters. Network changes associated with headwater burial have not been explored, limiting our understanding of changes in biotic composition with urbanization of these critical ecosystems. To address this need, I predicted stream burial across the Potomac River Basin (PRB) from impervious cover data and training observations from high-resolution aerial photography. Results across the PRB urban gradient reveal consistent burial patterns related to catchment area and topographic slope. I discuss these results in the context of physiographic constraints on stream location and urban development, including implications for management of aquatic resources. Second, I examined burial-related changes to headwater network structure and habitat connectivity, using a series of topological and distance measures, and a novel application of circuit-theoretical modeling to stream networks. Results show stream burial significantly affects both the number and size of remnant stream segments and their spatial orientation. Significant decreases in landscape connectivity were observed with burial, around ecologically important features such as confluences, and for urbanized headwater systems as a whole. Third, I used biological data to compare environmental and spatial controls on species turnover in fish and insect communities across headwater systems. Turnover was analyzed using generalized dissimilarity modeling, which accommodates variation in rates of species turnover along and between gradients, and two novel measures of resistance distance, which combine aspects of space and environment, specifically the spatial extent, orientation, and relative favorability of habitat across the landscape. Results show headwater species are more sensitive to environmental parameters, with less mobile species more sensitive to habitat fragmentation and required dispersal distances. Rapid compositional turnover occurred within short distances from the sampled reaches, suggesting headwater taxa disperse only short distances, with even small obstructions or habitat loss having potential to impact diversity within headwater systems. Knowledge gained from this research is critical for understanding the cumulative impact to stream networks, and for future decision-making allowing for urban development while protecting stream ecosystem function.

AU  - Small, E.C.
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Carabid surveys were first conducted at a wide range of sites.  Three habitats were then selected for further study (derelict sites, wetlands and woodlands), representing a spectrum of disturbed to more stable habitats.  Sites were located across the rural-urban gradient, and at varying distances from potential corridors.  At each site carabids were sampled using pitfall and hand search, and various measures of the habitat and surrounding landscape structure were taken.  A study of the genetics of two species from urban woodlands was also conducted.   The findings indicate that urban derelict and wetland habitats are particularly important for carabid conservation at the local scale, containing rich assemblages and some nationally scarce species.  Grasslands, which dominate urban green space, are relatively depauperate.  A clear urbanisation effect was observed in woodlands and, to a lesser extent, in urban wetlands.  This was typified by a decline in the representation of large-bodied non-flying species and stenotopic wetland species, and an increase in more eurytopic species.  No effect was observed at derelict sites.  However, the main factors affecting the assemblages related to differences in habitat.  Derelict and wetland assemblages  were strongly related to the vegetation, and woodland assemblages to the degree of site disturbance.  The great majority of carabid species are not affected by the degree of habitat fragmentation in the city, showing no benefits from wildlife corridors.  The few that were sensitive tend to be large-bodied non-flying species, most of which are generalists.  These findings have considerable implications for the application metapopulation and island biogeography theories to urban conservation.  Other findings provide important insights on how site selection and management of urban habitat fragments can be optimised to maximise the number and interest of carabid species finding refuge in cities.

TI  - The distribution and habitat preferences of bats in a temperate urban landscape
AU  - Lintott, P. R.
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Urbanisation is a key driver in the loss, fragmentation and modification of natural habitats resulting in the global loss of biodiversity. As the human population, and consequently the rate of urbanisation, continues to increase exponentially it is important to understand how to sustain and enhance biodiversity within the built environment. Cities comprise a complex assortment of habitat types yet relatively little is known of how its composition and spatial configuration can influence species presence or foraging activities. It is therefore necessary to examine habitat use and biodiversity patterns at multiple spatial scales to fully understand how species are responding to the urban matrix. There are few other orders of animals that are as strongly associated with people as bats (Chiroptera); for some bat species human habitations provide roosts and adaptations of the environment provide food sources. However bat species richness generally declines with increasing urbanisation indicating that many species are not able to persist in highly urbanised areas. In this thesis, I show that the behaviour, habitat preferences, and distribution of bats are strongly influenced by the built environment at both a local and landscape scale. Although many animal species are known to exhibit sex differences in habitat use, adaptability to the urban landscape is commonly examined at the species level without consideration of potential intraspecific differences. I found that female Pipistrellus pygmaeus show greater selectivity in foraging locations within urban woodland in comparison to males at both a local and landscape scale. There was a lower probability of finding females within woodlands which were poorly connected, highly cluttered, with a high edge: interior ratio and fewer mature trees. The results have important implications for our understanding of how to manage areas for breeding females and highlight the need to supplement acoustic monitoring with trapping data to assess sex differences in habitat use. Determining how morphological or behavioural traits can influence species adaptability to the built environment may enable us to improve the effectiveness of conservation efforts. The morphological similarities between P. pygmaeus and P. pipistrellus suggest that both species should respond similarly to the urban matrix, however I found differential habitat use occurring within a variety of urban habitats (e.g. woodland and waterways) and at a landscape scale. In urban woodland there was a higher probability of P. pygmaeus activity relative to P. pipistrellus in woodlands with low clutter and understory cover which were surrounded by low levels of built environment. Many bat species are strongly associated with aquatic or adjacent riparian habitats yet we know little about the utilisation of urban waterways by bats. After surveying urban waterways throughout the UK, I was able to show that the built environment can negatively affect a variety of bat species from the riparian zone up to 3km from a waterway. This indicates that beneficial urban waterway rehabilitation schemes for bats require management at multiple spatial scales, from retaining a vegetated riparian zone at the local scale to highlighting the necessity for conservation funding to be spent on the implementation of landscape scale environmental improvement schemes that encompass the entire urban matrix. Undertaking surveys to confirm species presence or to estimate population sizes can be difficult, particularly for elusive species such as bats. I was able to demonstrate a variety of ways to increase surveying efficiency (e.g. the use of an acoustic lure to increase bat-capture rate) and a significant relationship between bat activity and the relative abundance of certain species of bat which can maximise the knowledge of diversity in an area whilst minimising wildlife disturbances. Urbanisation has also had strong negative effects on many insect groups, such as moths, which are important components of the diets of many bat species. I found that woodland vegetation characteristics were more important than the surrounding landscapes in determining the abundance, species richness, and species diversity of moth assemblages within urban woodland. This indicates that management at a local scale to ensure provision of good quality habitat may be more beneficial for moth populations than improving habitat connectivity across the urban matrix. The findings presented in this thesis have important implications for our understanding of the adaptability of species to the built environment and for the management and monitoring of bat populations. It also highlights that even common bat species are negatively affected by urbanisation and much greater attention should be paid to securing their future within the urban landscape.

TI  - Nutrient cycling in impacted stream ecosystems: From microbes to watersheds
AU  - Van Horn, David James
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - his dissertation explores the effects of disturbance on nutrient cycling in stream ecosystems at three spatial scales: the patch scale includes localized processes and assemblages, the reach scale encompasses tens to hundreds of meters of stream length, and the watershed scale consists of the hierarchical network of stream orders found in catchments. Additionally, the gut bacterial communities of three freshwater snail species were investigated to better understand the ecology and physiology of this important group of aquatic grazers. Snails are important regulators of periphyton growth, which plays an integral role in nutrient cycling in stream ecosystems. Freshwater snails are also intermediate hosts for a variety of parasites of medical and veterinary significance. Biofilm assemblages are patch scale communities which dominate the metabolism and biogeochemical cycles in stream ecosystems. To determine the effects of eutrophication, one of the most common disturbances to stream ecosystems, on the structure and function of heterotrophic stream biofilms, we created an enrichment gradient by amending darkened stream channel mesocosms with a stochiometrically balanced solution of sucrose, NH4, and PO 4.  Biofilm community productivity and function responded exponentially to enrichment. The observed nonlinear increase in functional capacity suggests biofilms are highly responsive to resource availability likely due to the physical structures and synergistic social interactions found in biofilm assemblages. Domestic and native ungulate grazers significantly alter riparian areas, stream reaches, and catchment characteristics. We examined nutrient cycling linkages between riparian soils and adjacent streams and the impacts of ungulate grazing on these ecosystems and processes at six grazing exclosure sites in the Valles Caldera National Preserve, NM, USA.  The results suggest ungulate grazing impacts terrestrial characteristics which are linked to ecosystem services provided by adjacent aquatic ecosystems. Management plans should carefully balance the positive effect of grazing on stream nutrient processing and retention reported here with the well documented grazing related loss of other ecosystem services such as decreased fish and aquatic invertebrate habitat and effects on water quality parameters such as turbidity and water temperature.Nutrient cycling in aridland catchments and rivers is controlled by a unique set of inputs and retention mechanisms. We investigated spatial and temporal variation in the sources and sinks of nutrients in the middle Rio Grande (MRG), a 300 km reach of aridland river in the southwestern United States that drains an agro-urban catchment experiencing rapid population growth. Wastewater treatment plant inputs were the dominant source of nutrients to the MRG, increasing loads of NO3-N, SRP, and NH4-N by 1000-2000% relative to upstream loading. The total retention of NO3-N and SRP inputs in the MRG corridor ranged from 6-99% and 34-99%, respectively. Retention was strongly and positively correlated with the percentage of water diverted from the MRG for agricultural irrigation. Little is known about the microbial gut flora of freshwater snails in spite of the important role gastropod mollusks play as grazers in freshwater ecosystems. This study used culture independent methods to describe the community composition and the variability of gut microbes within and among three species of planorbid snails, Helisoma duryi (North American species),  Bulinus africanus (African species), and Biomphalaria pfeifferi  (African species). Three hundred and fourteen unique bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs, DNA sequences with <98% similarity) were found in the guts of the three snail species. The results suggest the presence of highly diverse and relatively similar gut microbial communities in the three snail species in spite of varying levels of phylogenetic and geographic separation, and highlight the need for additional study to determine the roles gut microbes play in the physiology of these important intermediate hosts for digenetic trematodes of medical and veterinary significance.

TI  - Study on geography of reconstruction
AU  - Chen, Hua Jian
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Shiyang River Catchment locates in the eastern part of Hexi Corridor. It suffers from the most profound human interaction, and the relationship of nature and human in there is intensive. Due to irrational human interaction as well as absence of effective catchment management, the environment in down reaches degraded continuingly in the past. The research on geography construction in this region is significative both in theoretics and practics.Based on the field vegetation surveying in marginal areas of oasis in the down reaches of Shiyang River, and by analyzing the physiological features and spatial distribution diversity of the key and directive plants, it is found that there are spatial diversity in the causations of the environmental degradation in the down reaches of Shiyang River: excessive decreasing of groundwater table in the region of southward from Datan Township and irrational development in the marginal areas of northward from there. The further studies indicate that the main threaten to continuing environmental degradation in the down reaches comes from over-exploiting of groundwater. To find out the origin of groundwater over-exploitation, the analysis of hydrological processes of Shiyang River and actuality water requirement and actual water consumption in the Minqin County, which locates in the down reaches of the river, are carried out. The results show that water resources over-consumption in the Wuwei City, which locates in the middle reaches of the river, and irrational development model on the basis of agriculture, especially on farming system in the down reaches of the river are the underlying reasons. Finally, according to physical geography principle, on the basis of priority of ecological water requirement(2.58 x 108 m3, at least 1.59 x 108 m3) and equality of development right in the all catchemt, the water resources distribution framework in the Shiyang River catchment is putting forwards, considering that 4.06 x 108 m3 (at least 3.26 x 108 m3) water should enter down reaches (Minqin) from Wuwei. Furthermore, considering the rational utilization of water resources, 3 x 104 hm2 farmlands should be set back to grassland. The position of these farmlands and succedent constructing measures are proposed. Based on all mentioned above, theories and practices of social and economic construction in Minqin are discussed.

TI  - Understanding the Effects of Fox Movement on the Spread of Sarcoptic Mange in Urban Settings: An Individual-Based Modelling Approach
AU  - Dimitrov, Nikol
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The threat of disease spread to humans is greater in urban settings where contact between wildlife and human populations occurs frequently. Movement of host species plays a key role in maintaining transmission of direct-contact disease. Understanding how wildlife hosts move in fragmented urban landscapes is therefore imperative for disease control efforts. In cities, disease spread can be affected by the ability of a host to move through urban features, or by behavioural changes that are pathogen induced. Using the urban-adapted red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and its associated disease sarcoptic mange (Sarcoptes scabiei) in the city of Toronto, I ask: How does movement of foxes according to landcover type affect the spread of mange? And how does variable movement of susceptible and infected foxes influence mange transmission? These questions are addressed using an individual-based modeling approach, where two movement behaviours of foxes in a city are compared: random and least-cost path. To assess the effects of movement ability according to disease status (here, susceptible-biased, and infected-biased movement), I compare a range of movement probabilities. For each scenario, the number of effective contacts and the effective reproduction number (Re) are estimated. Findings suggest that mange spread may be accelerated when movement is based on landcover types and when there is equal movement ability of susceptible and infected foxes. This study emphasizes the importance of including realistic movement behaviours when modelling the dynamics of mange and disease spread in urbanized landscapes.

TI  - Botanical processes in urban derelict spaces
AU  - Austin, Kevin Charles
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - This thesis set out to investigate the processes that determine the richness and composition of plant communities on derelict land in the West Midlands. Experimental work included vegetation surveys, soil seed bank investigation, field mapping and seed rain trapping methods. Interpretation of the data involved a range of approaches including vegetation classification and ordination, comparative analysis of plant functional attributes and the development of regression models incorporating landscape and habitat variables. Derelict habitats were identified as holding a diverse array of communities at the early stages of succession which are poorly represented by current vegetation classifications, functional diversity is however much lower in pioneer communities. The majority of these species employing the expected strategies of early succession notably high reproductive capacity and seeds which are small, highly dispersive and form persistent seed banks. Dense seed banks were typically formed on sites and were dominated by a small set of consistently occurring species. Changes in seed bank density and composition were consistent with time represented both by the chronosequence of sites and increasing soil depth. Little evidence was found to suggest that diversity or species composition is linked to site connectivity related to either patch density or the presence of linear features. These findings have considerable implications for application of principles of metapopulation and island biogeography principles to urban conservation. In particular the trend for planners to designate urban wildlife corridors is questioned as being probably of no benefit to native diversity and indeed these features are identified as being instead potentially significant pathways for invasive alien species. The most important factors influencing the composition of sites were seen to be those linked closely with past and present human activity. Particularly significant are the nature of dereliction substrates and haphazard disturbances such as fire and tipping which influence vegetation succession temporally and spatially.

TI  - Protected Area Networks in an Urbanizing Landscape: Spatial Characteristics and Land Acquisition Strategies
AU  - Fenn, Katherine H.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The selection of land parcels for preservation and protection (i.e. the designation of a “Protected Area”) is inherently a human social process engaging a complex suite of economic, political, and environmental factors. Since the 1960s, the U.S. federal government has encouraged local engagement in land conservation through new funding opportunities. Consequently, in some states a diverse collection of agencies, both public and private, have participated in the selection process. The following research examines whether diverse conservation organizations, sometimes acting with coordinated goals and sometimes acting independently, can collectively assemble a Protected Area network which aligns with some basic principles of biological conservation network design. The spatial patterns of one emerging Protected Forest (PF) network in the New Jersey Highlands are used a case study. This PF network consists of all forested habitat within the New Jersey Highlands Protected Areas. The primary finding are 1) although most large forest fragments have more than 80% of their land protected, medium and smaller-size fragments have less protection, 2) land cover change within 250 meters of PF boundaries is highly variable and has both increased and decreased aspects of landscape permeability along those boundaries for forest species, and 3) land acquisition since 2000 has been proactive, relative to the threat of urban development. Because PA networks should represent and sustain regional biodiversity and ecosystem function, these findings have implications for future PA management. The pattern of protection of large habitat remnants in this region is favorable for sustaining existing ecological communities and processes. The increase in landscape permeability along the boundaries of some Protected Forests is also favorable because this facilitates species movements among protected habitat patches. However, because land acquisition has been highly proactive, the greatest amount of protection has occurred in the northern part of the region where urban development pressure is lower. The resulting uneven geographic distribution in this regional conservation network indicates that sustaining ecological forest communities and processes across the southern portion of the New Jersey Highlands may pose a significant future challenge.

TI  - Site effects on wildlife enteric bacterial diversity: You are where you eat?
AU  - Lankau, Emily Ruth Wheeler
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The study of microbial biogeography has made vast strides in recent years due, in part, to advances in the technological capacity to document microscopic biodiversity at the community, population and genomic levels. In this dissertation, we apply a combination of molecular and cultivation approaches to the study of enteric microbial diversity in a unique system of sister iguanid species, the Galápagos land and marine iguanas (Conolophus spp. and Amblyrhynchus subcristatus, respectively). We explored the spatial diversity of enteric bacteria in these two species at multiple levels, from communities to genetic traits. The unique host population history and geography of this island chain informed hypotheses about expected biogeographical patterns and the underlying processes that shape microbial diversity in this system. In Chapter 1, we reviewed current understanding of microbial biogeography and explored how incorporation of such ecological theory might benefit understanding of enteric microbial community structure and function across space and time. Chapter 2 explored the spatial community diversity of marine and land iguana enteric communities using a molecular approach based on 454 pyrosequencing. Firstly, we demonstrated that while host species was the strongest force shaping these communities, within a host species, geographical proximity also determined overlap in community composition at the genus level. In addition, we found that the degree of contact among host species can produce distinct local effects in community richness and composition, especially when host species have amplified opportunities for microbial exchange such as higher population densities or limited habitat area. Next in Chapter 3, we explored taxonomically finer-scale diversity patterns among marine iguana populations for the rich enteric genus Clostridium . In contrast to the expectation that each host population should have relatively distinct Clostridium communities, we found a surprising amount of phylogenetic conservation across all sites, despite also demonstrating evidence suggesting on-going taxonomic turnover—forces which might otherwise lead to rapid divergence of enteric communities in allopatric host populations. We then applied a more traditional cultivation and molecular genetic approach in Chapter 4 in order to document Salmonella enterica strain diversity among sites. We serotyped and genotyped Salmonella enterica isolates carried by land and marine iguanas across a geographical gradient and found nearly complete isolation among strain pools. However, we also found suggestions of geographically-dependent genomic similarity among sites, possibly due to long-distance transport of genetic elements by oceanic currents. Finally, in Chapter 5 we explored genetic trait biogeography in this system by documenting phenotypic and genetic patterns of antibiotic resistance. We found that sites farther from high densities of humans (i.e. major port towns) harbored fewer resistant bacteria. We also noted that these antibiotic resistance traits may not be retained within the broader endemic bacterial community of Galápagos wildlife for any appreciable length of time, as Salmonella enteric isolates did not share resistance traits found in Escherichia coli within the same site or even within the same individual fecal sample. Through this work as a whole we demonstrated that, within the context of a single study system, biogeographical patterns and mechanisms can vary widely across bacterial taxonomic levels, with both ecological and evolutionary forces acting in concert on enteric biodiversity. Increased understanding of the interplay among these forces for shaping microbial community form and function across taxonomic scales has potential to improve not only theoretical understanding of microbial ecology but also to advance management of pressing issues such as novel disease emergence or antibiotic resistance dissemination.

TI  - Effects of environmental factors on butterfly species in an urban setting
AU  - Niell, Lara E.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - This study examined butterfly species richness and composition and their relationships to various landscape and habitat variables in undeveloped areas within an urban matrix in Reno, Nevada, USA. In 2006, we gathered data from 20 different undeveloped canyons within the city limits, we gathered data on butterfly species presence, vegetation, and host plant presence along with environmental variables such as isolation from other undeveloped sites, water presence, building density, and time since the site was surrounded by development. We found that species composition across sites was nested, meaning that species compositions at sites with lower species richness were subsets of species found at sites with higher species richness. We also found that undeveloped area and presence of intermittent persistent water sources were positively correlated with species richness. Generalist species were positively associated with decreased isolation and increased edge, or perimeter to area ratio. Specialist species were negatively correlated with the presence of high use trails and increased amounts of herbaceous vegetation cover. Larval hostplants were not predictive of butterfly presence. These correlations suggest that although composition across sites was nested, there was some noise to this nestedness. General composition can be approximated as species richness increases, but composition cannot be perfectly predicted because different variables affect composition at sites. This emphasizes the need to examine both species richness and composition when looking to preserve the natural integrity of an area. Undeveloped sites within the Reno urban matrix appeared to maintain a large portion of the expected butterfly species.

TI  - Isolation and biodiversity analysis on bacteria of magnetite mine drainage
AU  - An, Xiu Fang
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorIsolation and phylogenetic analysis were carried out for bacteria from magnetite mine drainage samples collected from two Iron mines located at Shahe City of Hebei Province, China, and the biodiversity of magnetite mine samples was discussed preliminary. The isolation results showed that the bacteria quantity and species were different among different media and samples. 1/5 PCA was the best for magnetite bacteria isolation. Neutrophilic bacteria were the major bacterial group of the magnetite mine drainage, improved 9K and improved 9K' media were not suitable for bacteria isolation growing in neutral environment of magnetite mine. The position of bacteria isolates on genera level and the biodiversity of magnetite mine drainage samples were discussed preliminary. The results showed that 66 strains of Jiangfeng drainage sample belonged to 50 OTUs,of which 36 OTUs showed highest sequence similarities from 98.4% to100% with the phylum Proteobacteria, 12 OTUs showed the highest sequence similarities from 98.9% to 99.9% with the phylum Actinobacteria and 2 OTUs showed the highest sequence similarities from 98.9% to 99.9% with the phylum Bacteroidetes. 47 strains of Qianshan drainage sample belonged to 32 OTUs, of which 15 OTUs showed the highest sequence similarities from 90.4% to 100% with the phylum Proteobacteria, 9 OTUs showed the highest sequence similarities from 99.4 % to 100 % with the phylum Actinobacteria, 7 OTUs showed the highest sequence similarities from 93.0% to100% with the phylum Firmicutes and 1 OTU shared the highest sequence similarities of 100% with the phylum Thermus with. The above strains were identified preliminary based on a broad range of morphological and physiological characteristics, the results confirmed the phylogenetic analysis results, and some strains could be identified to species level within the corresponding genus. 52 strains including strain p1 etc. could be identified to 38 putative novel species with in 20 genera. Strains cp15 and cp26 were closest to their nearest neighbors Sneathiella chinensis CBMAI 737Twith the similarity from 88.2% to 88.3%, they should be formed a new genus position in the family Sneathiellaceae. The biodiversity analysis results showed that the biological diversity of magnetite mine drainages was relatively rich. The bacterial community composition on genera was different among the two samples and the dominant populations were diverse, Asticcacaulis rose supreme in Jiangfeng drainage sample (19.70%), Brevundimonas was accounted for absolute advantages in Qianshan drainage sample (25.53%). It was presumed that the different grade and the hide deepth may be influenced the bacteria groups, which leaded to the dominant populations were different between the two

TI  - The Influence of Flow Variation on Community Composition in Streams and Rivers
AU  - Saffarinia, Parsa
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Global change has severely impacted the flow regimes of river systems across the globe, and the species inhabiting those systems now find themselves adapted to hydrographs that no longer exist. This includes many of the flow regimes in California, as streams are experiencing an altered precipitation cycle and a system of dams, culverts, and wastewater treatment plants that have transformed rivers that were once naturally flowing into occasionally concrete-lined channels. In the following chapters, I report the results of several studies aimed at understanding the relationship between flow variability and the persistence of ecological communities in river systems, particularly diatoms and benthic macroinvertebrates. In chapter one, I utilize a set of high-elevation experimental stream channels to subject the stream benthic community to a gradient of drought treatments. In this study, I found that pool habitat serves as a better refuge to benthic macroinvertebrates than riffles, contingent on the presence of hyporheic flow. Additionally, perennial flow–adapted communities appear to resist flow reduction, up to the point when surface flow is lost. My second chapter examines the relationship between benthic macroinvertebrate community composition and flow regimes, spatial connectivity, and environmental variables at large spatial scales and long temporal scales. I found that spatial processes, such as drainage density and upstream area, and flow metrics, such as flow variability and zero-flow days, best explain temporal beta diversity in macroinvertebrate communities at the multi-catchment scale. Chapter three explores the impact of urban flow disturbance, in the form of effluent discharge from wastewater treatment plants and storm runoff, on benthic diatom and macroinvertebrate communities through space and time. I found that macroinvertebrates in such systems are resistant to flow perturbations, compositionally reflected in a relatively disturbance-tolerant community, while the diatoms reflected fast-paced resilience strategies. While erratic flow shutdowns from wastewater treatment plants result in losses of taxa and lower densities of individuals, large storm events further compound flow regime disturbance in the urban stream system. Overall in this dissertation, I demonstrate that flow disturbance is a strong predictor of benthic freshwater communities, and that determining the extent of hydrological disturbance at the correct timescale is critical to the conservation of freshwater biodiversity.

TI  - Study on the Frameworks, the Functions and the Landscape Ecology Planning Methods of Urban Green Corridors―A Case Study of Wuhan
AU  - Cai, Jing Chan
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - As an important aspect of landscape ecology, the studies on corridors are permeating urban ecology and urban landscape planning. Green corridor is a key landscape type. This paper communicates clearly about the definition and the classification of green corridor. Additionally, it analyses urban green corridor’s structure, pattern and function. Applying the method for landscape ecology planning to urban green corridor planning, this study notes five steps of green corridor planning, which are as follows, first, investigating basic data, secondly confirming targets and functions, thirdly ecology planning, fourthly implementing plans and designs and last, managing planning projects, and the former three stages are analyzed clearly. The four scales of green corridor planning and the methods for data analyzing, confirming functions, targets, width of various kinds of urban green corridors are studied.  This paper notes that according to the model of vehicle emission dispersion and the model of noises dispersion, the width of green road-side corridor can be confirmed exactly. The results show that when downwind distance is   meters, the surface pollution concentration is the max. Arranging green road-side corridor before this distance can effectively decrease the max concentration and the concentrations at different distance. When there isn’t enough room to arrange dividing strips, we can assume the pollution origin as the midline of road. If the half width of road is shorter than   meters, the sum of green road-side corridor width and half road width ought to be equal to or greater than   meters, and the greater the green road-side corridor width is, the better effect is. If the half width of road is greater than   meters, green road-side corridor should be arranged from roadside and the greater the green road-side corridor width is, the better effect is. If roads have dividing strips, and there is enough room to arrange diving strips, green road-side corridor should be arranged according to the above principles regarding each slab as a road. Considering its function of reducing traffic noises, green road-side corridor should cling to the roadside, and the wider the green road-side corridor is, the better effect is.The environments along the roads comprise six categories. The first category is shopping center, the second one is culture and education, habitation, the third one is heavy industry, the fourth is water area, the fifth is farmland and the last one is natural vegetation, mountain and park. The methods for planning green road-side corridors along different roads with different environments are studied exhaustively.This paper applies the above principles and methods to Wuhan’s green corridor planning, points out the problems of its green corridors by analyzing its corridors’ form, network, the relationship between green focuses and green corridors, the relationship between heat island effects and green corridors. The results show that Wuhan’s all kind of green corridors in each district, especially the green belts, are very scanty. The connectivity of green corridor network is so low, the width is so narrow, and inside environments can not be formed. Some of green focuses don’t be connected each other by green corridors. Considering Wuhan’s natural resources, regional status and the problems of its green corridors, the targets and the functions of Wuhan’s green corridors planning are pointed out and confirmed, which are as follows, building ecological network connecting each urban green focuses, urban and rural green focuses; conserving and improving the diversity of species and habitats, the quality of atmosphere, the productivity of agricultural and horticultural acts adjacent to green corridors; development controlling and urban containment; improving urban microclimate, reducing heat island effects.Lastly, this paper plans and confirms the width, the direction and the pattern of Wuhan’s green corridors. It points out that green network should be uninterrupted on the region scale, the urban scale and the district scale. When green corridors go through the thermal area, and their trends parallel the dominant wind direction, heat island effects can be alleviated greatly.

TI  - Matrix effects on individual and community-level responses of birds to forest fragmentation in Jamaica
AU  - Kennedy, Christina Marie
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Land cover between habitat patches (“matrix”) can impact species persistence in fragmented landscapes by altering resource availability, edge effects, or inter-patch movement. This thesis examines how the matrix affects the Neotropical bird community in central Jamaica in landscapes where forest is embedded in three human-dominated matrix types (agriculture, peri-urban development, and bauxite mining) and one natural “matrix” (continuous forest). First, I examine whether richness, community composition, and abundances of resident birds differ in ∼ 100 forest patches within the four matrix types, and relate species responses to traits influencing dispersal, resource acquisition, and/or population growth. Agricultural landscapes were found to retain avian diversity and community assemblages most similar to intact forest relative to peri-urban and bauxite landscapes. Traits related to resource acquisition best predicted species responses, indicating that resource limitation driven by the matrix may be a primary factor driving bird responses to fragmentation. Next, I determine the relative influence of patch area, isolation, vegetation structure, and matrix type on the occupancy dynamics of resident insectivorous birds. Within-patch vegetation and matrix type were the most important determinants of colonization and extinction, but the effects of patch area, isolation, and vegetation on occupancy dynamics were matrix- and species-dependent. Across the community, the matrix influenced extinction probabilities more than colonization, indicating that extinction processes likely drive population dynamics. Finally, I examine the relative permeability of peri-urban, bauxite, and forested landscapes on the movement of the migrant American Redstart ( Setophaga ruticilla) and the resident Jamaican Tody (Todus todus) by experimentally translocating > 140 birds 0.6–4 km from their territories across landscape treatments. Redstarts returned with greater success and faster speed than Todies. Return success was not impacted by landscape treatment, but both species returned more rapidly in forest relative to bauxite matrix, with return times intermediate in a peri-urban matrix. These findings indicate that bird mobility in fragmented landscapes is mediated by the landscape matrix. This research is among few empirical studies to discern the impacts of different matrix types on species patterns and processes. These results inform theory on fragmentation as well as bird conservation in an understudied system.

TI  - Modeling biological nitrogen removal with denitrification enzyme parameter estimation
AU  - Hamilton, Ryan K.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - As urban population density has increased it has been necessary to develop ever more sophisticated wastewater treatment technology. Waters that accept domestic wastewater receive pollutants in the form of nutrients (primarily organic compounds and ammonia) that, if left untreated, could spur a bloom of microorganism growth and cause disease in the higher organisms that consumed the water. Most modern wastewater treatment facilities use some type of activated sludge process in which naturally occurring microorganisms are cultivated in the wastewater under conditions that attempt to optimize the consumption of influent nutrients. This work presents models and techniques for predicting the performance of biological nutrient removal systems, both bench-scale and plant-scale. Presented is a model for diauxic growth of denitrifying bacteria in which nitrate reductase synthesis kinetics dominate the overall growth kinetics. The model is based on the assumption of the existence of a nitrate respiration operon, thereby linking the rate of nitrate uptake to the activity of nitrate reductase. I have shown that this approach can model diauxic growth of  Pseudomonas denitrificans by conducting experiments in which nitrate reductase activity was measured during both lag and ensuing exponential growth phases. I consistently observed the pattern of low nitrate reductase enzyme activity during the lag phase, increasing before the onset of growth. By fitting model parameters I was able to successfully match experimental data for growth, nitrate uptake and enzyme activity level. In cooperation with Gainesville Regional Utilities, a process model was developed for the Kanapaha Water Reclamation Facility (KWRF) predenitrification process in Gainesville, Florida. The process model incorporates a biochemical model for diauxic growth of pure cultures of denitrifying bacteria that is integrated with the industry standard Activated Sludge Model 1. I demonstrate, using real facility operating data, that by applying an extended Kalman filter to a single bioreactor I obtain estimates for both reactor composition and denitrification enzyme model parameters. This technique for parameter identification allows a semi-mechanistic model developed for pure cultures to be applied to a mixed culture population where isolation of enzyme kinetic parameters is not practical.

TI  - Relationships between spatial configuration of tropical forest patches and diversity of woody plants and soil millipedes in northeastern Puerto Rico
AU  - Galanes Rivera, Ileana T.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - A primary goal of landscape ecology is to reveal the relationships between ecological processes and landscape patterns. Landscape patterns may control the ecological processes that shape species diversity and composition. However, there are few studies about how the species diversity of plants and soil millipedes vary with different parameters of landscape structure, especially in tropical habitats. Moreover, there is very little information about the effects of landscape variables on soil biota, such as millipedes, and the relationships between millipede diversity and plant diversity is poorly known, even though millipedes play an essential role in litter decomposition and plant nutrient cycling. Woody plants and soil millipedes were sampled systematically from 12 forest patches (24-34 years old), surrounded by a matrix of mixed urban use and pasture, in northeastern Puerto Rico. Patch spatial characteristics were obtained from aerial color photographs from year 2000 that were digitized into a GIS package. Woody plant species diversity and composition were related mostly to the forest patch attributes such as area and shape, while soil millipede species diversity and composition were related to the forest patch surroundings (e.g. vegetation corridors, patch isolation, and amount of forest in the matrix). Thus, soil millipede and plant species diversity and composition responded to different aspects of the landscape structure, probably due to their different operational scales (e.g. mode of dispersal, habitat discrimination). The species composition of both groups of organisms correlated with the distance to the Luquillo Experimental Forest, and there was more similarity in woody plant and millipede species composition among more closely spaced forest patches. A linear regression analysis showed that there was no correlation between species diversity of woody plants and soil millipedes in each forest patch. There was also no relationship between the species composition of woody plants and soil millipedes in a patch; indicating that soil millipedes are not specialist feeders on woody plant leaf litter. These findings show the importance of considering spatial relationships on a landscape scale when developing biodiversity theories and for the conservation and management of species diversity as well as land use planning, especially in areas of urban development.

TI  - Consequences of landscape change on riverine food webs and aquatic-terrestrial linkages
AU  - Kautza, Adam Robert
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - River ecosystems are composed of a spatially and temporally heterogeneous matrix of aquatic, semi-aquatic, and terrestrial elements that are highly coupled via physical, chemical, and biotic linkages. Food webs in river ecosystems reflect this complexity as they can be highly variable over space and time and are characterized by longitudinal (upstream-downstream) and lateral (aquatic-terrestrial) connectivity, which provides energetic resources (e.g., nutrients, organic matter) to consumers in adjacent habitats. Food webs relate information about diversity, community composition, and ecosystem function. However, spatially-explicit food-web data remain scarce for river ecosystems and, thus, environmental determinants of food-web structure remain largely unresolved. In particular, anthropogenic gradients relating to river regulation and land-cover change disrupt hydrogeomorphic regimes, influence water quality, and alter fundamental properties of river ecosystems with potential consequences for cross-boundary linkages and food-web dynamics. At 12 riverine landscape study sites distributed along an urban-rural gradient of the Scioto River system, Ohio, I investigated the influence of anthropogenic and natural environmental factors on (1) reciprocal aquatic-terrestrial invertebrate flux dynamics, (2) trophic structure and food-chain length (FCL) of fish food webs, and (3) the contribution of aquatically-derived energy to terrestrial food webs.Anthropogenic impacts relating to modified riparian landscape composition, water quality, and dams, as well as natural gradients in river size exerted strong influences on river food webs. A landscape composition gradient from urbanization to grassland-dominated riparian land cover explained patterns in aquatic insect emergence and terrestrial invertebrate inputs to the river. In particular, urban landscapes were positively associated with reduced emergence flux density and biomass and reduced biomass of terrestrial inputs, whereas riparian grasslands were negatively associated with these factors. Fish food webs were characterized by fewer predator species and smaller-bodied prey above dams than below while FCL was shorter above dammed reaches (3.88) than below (4.19). Fish FCL also responded positively to natural gradients in river size (e.g., channel width) ranging from 3.66 -4.13 at narrower reaches to 4.24 - 4.35 at the widest reaches. Aquatic energy represented a considerable contribution to terrestrial consumers that forage across different spatial scales ranging from sedentary shoreline tetragnathid spiders (76% from aquatic) to riparian swallows (67% from aquatic) and raccoons (59%) that forage over 100s to 1000s of meters. Moreover, terrestrial consumers relied on both benthic algae (33% reliance across all consumers) and phytoplankton (32% reliance), highlighting the importance of separate aquatic energy pathways to terrestrial food webs in mid-size river systems.Collectively, my results indicate that anthropogenic changes to rivers can have appreciable impacts on riverine food webs. Additionally, I have shown that aquatic energy, in addition to terrestrially-derived energy, can fuel terrestrial food webs in mid-sized rivers and that the aquatic energetic signature can extend further from the river than previously considered. Finally, because of the inherent relationship between food webs and ecosystem function and stability, I anticipate results from this research will contribute to the ongoing development of a more holistic and functional approach to management and conservation of river-riparian ecosystems in the face of increasing anthropogenic influences.

TI  - Multi-Scalar Drivers of Native Bee Community Composition and Population Genetic Structure in Human-Altered Landscapes
AU  - Ballare, Kimberly Michelle
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - One of the most well-documented ecological impacts of human-caused landscape change is the fragmentation of natural habitats by human infrastructure, with potential implications for 1) community composition, and 2) species-level gene flow patterns. By including quantifiable measurements of local habitat composition, regional land-use, and the composition of the landscape matrix in ecological studies, we can better understand how multi-scalar environmental factors drive changes in wildlife community composition and dispersal processes, and infer subsequent consequences for ecosystem functions and services across human-altered landscapes. Pollination is a critical ecosystem service driven in part by wildlife community composition and dispersal processes, but despite the importance of bee pollination for ecosystem function, very little is known about how land-use drives native bee community composition and their population gene-flow patterns. This research addresses this literature gap by investigating native bee communities (Chapter 1) and native bee gene flow (Chapter 2) across heterogeneous human-altered landscapes in Texas, and proposes methods for expanding conservation genetic research of pollinators using curated bee specimens (Chapter 3).In Chapter 1, we conducted an extensive survey of bee communities across two urban landscape gradients in Austin and Dallas, Texas, USA comparing communities within agricultural and native grassland habitat types. In Chapter 2, we investigate the genetic structure and gene flow patterns of the native eastern carpenter bee, Xylocopa virginica across a 450 km corridor spanning multiple land-uses in Texas. In Chapter 3, we test the effects of sampling and curation methods on next-generation sequencing of three widespread North American native bee species. Our results indicate that the composition of regional land-use differentially impacts bee abundance and diversity depending on local habitat management and between bee functional groups, and that contemporary land-use as well as regional and fine-scale geographic distance influence the gene flow patterns of a large wood-nesting bee. Lastly, we find that sampling and storage method influence sequence assembly quality, and that curated and trapped specimens can be successfully utilized for next-generation sequencing research.

TI  - Solutions to spatial and computational challenges for large-landscape conservation planning
AU  - Leonard, Paul Brandon
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Systematic conservation planning is a fertile scientific discipline capable of examining global natural resource threats including land cover conversion, habitat fragmentation, biodiversity loss, and climate change. Many of these threats are acting in concert to accelerate the rate of change which increases the urgency of action. The scale of these changes creates unique spatial analysis and computational challenges. This study was designed to address several of these challenges pertaining to the analyses of publicly protected areas, habitat connectivity, and private lands conservation. I examine how using high-throughput and high-performance computing helps conservation practitioners ask and solve larger ecological questions. I describe when practitioners might consider using these technologies based on the types of questions that are asked. I improve upon existing circuit-theory based habitat connectivity modeling by using parallel processing and develop new methodologies which facilitate fine-grained analyses over broad geographic extents. I explore how species-level habitat connectivity can inform broad patterns of current and future landscape connectivity in the southeastern U.S. by incorporating species with a diverse group of dispersal abilities and including forecasted threats to connectivity. Since most of the conservation lands in the eastern U.S. are privately-owned, I explore the spatial patterns, distribution, and social covariates around private lands conservation (e.g., easements) throughout the Appalachian region.Harnessing the power of high-throughput and high-performance computing facilitated a 72-125 times speedup for several large-landscape spatial analyses. These improvements arm researches with the ability to ask questions which more closely capture the complexity seen in nature. Circuit-theory based habitat connectivity is notoriously computationally expensive and the results presented herein suggest computational bottlenecks can be overcome with a 160 times speedup. Moreover, the results illustrated circuit-theory based connectivity maps converge on a near solution much faster than previously thought and thus the description of this ‘convergence factor’ will save researchers many hours of computation and make broad-extent analyses practicable.Species-derived connectivity maps indicate far fewer large contiguous areas will be available to facilitate animal movements across ecoregions in 2100. Overall species potential habitat cores were reduced by 36% reaching as high as 72% for one species.  I observed a more simplified landscape connectivity in 2100 where values were dissected and depleted for the highest quantiles.  Despite these discouraging findings, private lands conservation may provide a ‘stop-gap’ measure to slow these changes. I found conservation easements throughput Appalachia nearer to urban developments, major road networks, on arable lands, and surrounded by areas of higher diversity than random. These results differ from that of global protected areas but the drivers of easement location may be more tightly linked with social processes, rather than environmental ones. Collectively, this research can help guide practitioners about what science and technology is needed and at the appropriate scale to match their conservation questions. Although the increasing threats to biodiversity conservation are well documented, strategies such as those presented here may help facilitate positive conservation outcomes.

TI  - Effects of Landscape Spatial Heterogeneity on Host-Parasite Ecology
AU  - Watts, Alexander Gordon
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Landscape spatial heterogeneity interacts with ecological processes that influence pathogen emergence and infectious disease spread. Modification of landscape composition and configuration is hypothesized to alter host densities, frequency of host-parasite interactions, host community assembly processes, and dispersal processes of host, vector, and parasite populations. Understanding the spatial and environmental dependence on host-parasite interactions is, therefore, critical in predicting the response of disease dynamics to widespread habitat modification. I combine wildlife disease ecology with landscape ecological concepts and varied modeling techniques (i.e., multivariate redundancy analyses, network connectivity models, bipartite mutualistic networks, beta diversity analyses) to test the mediating role of landscape spatial heterogeneity on the spread of a vector-borne disease system (chapter 2), and the effect of urban landscape spatial heterogeneity on host exposure to parasitism (chapter 3), host-parasite interaction structure (chapter 4), and host-parasite beta diversity (chapter 5). My results demonstrate that landscape spatial heterogeneity has a differential influence on tick dispersal than pathogen dispersal by the movement of a host community, most critically mediated by stepping-stone habitat. I also provide evidence that urban landscape spatial heterogeneity affects the exposure likelihood of a single host population, the structure of host-parasite interactions in multiple host populations, and the spatial contributions of host and parasite beta diversity. My work demonstrates that landscape spatial heterogeneity has a mediating role in multiple disease systems whereby spatial and environmental factors play a critical role in the likelihood of short- and long-distance pathogen invasion, the persistence of environmentally-mediated parasites, and the selection of generalist host and parasite species in urbanized habitat. Overall my research contributes to our theoretical understanding of the multi-scalar ecological interactions between landscape change and disease dynamics and our applied understanding of the role of landscape in the emergence of infectious diseases.

TI  - Can urban greenways provide high-quality avian habitat?
AU  - Hull, Jamie Rebekah
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - I investigated how forested corridor width, land use context, and greenway composition and vegetation structure affected avian community composition in urban greenways in Raleigh and Cary, North Carolina, USA. I surveyed breeding bird communities at 34 greenway study sites using 50-m fixed-radius point counts located at the center of 300m long greenway segments. Each greenway segment's forested corridor width and surrounding land use were determined in ArcGIS. Greenway composition (proportion of mature forest, young forest, managed area, and stream in the greenway study site) and vegetation structure were measured in the field. Landscape and urban planners can maximize native bird diversity and abundance by minimizing the width of the greenway trail and associated mowed and landscaped surfaces adjacent to the trail, maintaining vegetative structure within the greenway, and giving priority to the protection of greenways in areas of lower development intensity. Greenways wider than 50m provide habitat for a diversity of bird species, but many species of conservation concern require much wider greenways. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

TI  - Influences of adjacent land-use on avian community structure in sub-boreal peatlands of the Midwest
AU  - Wandrie, Lucas J.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Surrounding land use influences avian community structure; moreover, anthropogenic manipulation of habitat can alter bird species richness and composition. In the first chapter of my thesis work, I conducted avian surveys at 20 sub-boreal peatlands in eastern Minnesota and western Wisconsin to detect correlations between land development and bird community structure. Peatlands are wetlands that accumulate decaying organic plant material (peat) and provide valuable and diverse habitats to a variety of flora and fauna. I measured urban and cropland development at three spatial scales (500 m, 1000 m, and 2500 m radii). Effects of development on avian communities also were assessed with respect to distance from a major metropolis using three zones: counties inside the city (metro), counties immediately adjacent (collar), and rural counties adjacent to the collar (fringe). I predicted that the zone with intermediate levels of disturbance would have greater species richness (intermediate disturbance hypothesis) and that there would be a correlation between differences in community species composition (i.e., species turnover) and increased levels of development. Urban development influenced avian communities more than agricultural development and avian communities were different among the zones in species composition and partly in species richness. Statistical analysis identified negative relationships between urban cover and the proportion of human intolerant species at all three spatial scales. In the second chapter of my thesis work, I created a rapid-assessment model of habitat quality designed to detect relationships of landscape variables such as peatland area, degree of isolation from other wetlands, extent of adjacent economic development, and vegetative structure on bird community composition. I used rapid-assessment model, known as a hydrogeomorphic model (HGM), that numerically combines landscape features to predict the value of habitat to bird species diversity (functional capacity) Following HGM procedures, I predicted functional capacities at 20 sub-boreal peatlands When compared to observed species diversity, however, no relationship was found with predicted diversity levels. Of the model variables only vegetation structure was related to bird diversity. I suggest that a new model needs to be developed in order to assess the value of peatlands to support peatland bird communities.

TI  - Landbird demography and community structure along an urbanization gradient in the Lake Tahoe basin
AU  - Schlesinger, Matthew Daniel
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urbanization has profound effects on biodiversity, but few studies have addressed the consequences of multiple stressors along urbanization gradients on both populations and communities. I conducted three studies of urbanization effects on landbird demography and community structure, sampling landbird abundance and diversity at 375 sample points and monitoring 494 nests of 10 focal species at 97 points along a development gradient in the Lake Tahoe basin, California and Nevada. First, I examined effects of nesting strategy and body size on some key demographic parameters: abundance, nest success, and finite growth rate. Abundance of large-bodied species and nest success of cavity nesters stayed constant or increased as urban development increased, whereas abundance of most small-bodied species and nest success of open nesters declined. For some species, the entire basin was a population sink, and for others, points along the development gradient may be ecological traps. Identifying sinks and traps along gradients rather than assuming discrete subpopulations is a superior approach for many landscapes and can highlight opportunities for habitat restoration. Second, I used model selection to determine the relative importance of development, human activity, local and landscape vegetation, topography, and location in explaining richness, abundance, and dominance. Urbanization stressors were consistently among the principal forces structuring the community, and disturbance from human activity was often the most important factor, surpassing even habitat loss from development. My results suggest likely consequences for urban ecosystem function that call for local- and landscape-scale management, focused research, and long-term monitoring to retain biodiversity in urban areas. Third, I used metacommunity theory to guide a variation-partitioning analysis of the spatial and environmental structuring of the landbird community. Environmental variation generally exceeded spatial variation, but all groups displayed a significant component of spatial variation, demonstrating a likely mix of dispersal limitation with niche-based and source-sink processes. Structuring of urban avoiders, adapters, and exploiters differed in interesting ways. Substantial roles of space, habitat, and landscape configuration illustrated the value of retaining native vegetation, the need to consider connectivity in managing biodiversity in urbanizing landscapes, and the value of a metacommunity approach for addressing urbanization's multifaceted effects on biodiversity.

TI  - Ecology of kit fox (Vulpes macrotis) and coyote (Canis latrans) and the conservation of the prairie dog ecosystem in northern Mexico (BL)
AU  - List Sanchez, R.
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - This work was conducted in the Janos-Nuevo Casas Grandes prairie dog complex of north-western Chihuahua, Mexico, between February 1994 and June 1996, to study the ecology of the kit for Vulpes macrotis and coyote Canis latrans, and the degradation of the prairie dog ecosystem.  The coyote and kit fox are the most abundant of 13 carnivores species present in the area.  Kit fox mean home range size was 11.5 mk2 and density ranged from 0.32/km2 to 0.8/km2. Kit foxes preferred grassland habitat, probably because of reduced risks of coyote encounters.  Prairie dog population control can have a negative effect on the local kit fox population.  Coyote mean home range size was 90.1km2.  Annual coyote control seems to affect the spatial distribution of coyotes.  The main food item for both canids were prairie dogs Cynomys ludovicianus.  Insects, kangaroo rats, small mammals, lagomorphs and ground squirrels were important food items for the kit fox, whereas kangaroo rats, cattle and lagomorphs were important food items for the coyote.  Coyotes spend much time foraging in daytime, and their activity patterns coincided with prairie dog activity.  Comparisons of our work with data from 1988, showed a prairie dog geographic range contraction of 79% and a reduction in area occupied by prairie dog towns of 66.4%.  Fragmentation decreased average town size by 93.4% and increased tow isolation.  Our predictions suggest that small (<100 ha) and isolated (>5 km) towns are highly vulnerable to extinction, whilst large (>100 ha) and closer (<5 km) towns are likely to persist.  Scrub invasion followed dog town eradication.  The main cause of prairie dog decline was poisoning associated to cattle ranching, and agriculture is becoming a major threat to the prairie dog towns.  Conservation actions for the prairie dog ecosystem are suggested.

TI  - Space Colonisation Based Procedural Road Generation
AU  - Fernandes, Gabriel Dias
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Procedural generation of content has been studied for quite some time and it is increasingly relevant in scientific areas and in video-game and film industries. Procedural road layout generation has been traditionally approached using L-Systems, with some works exploring alternative avenues. Although originally conceived for biological systems modelling, the adequacy of L-Systems as a base for road generation has been demonstrated in several works.In this context, this work presents an alternative approach for procedural road layout generation that is also inspired by plant generation algorithms: space colonisation.In particular, this work uses the concept of attraction points introduced in space colonisation as its base to produce road layouts, both in urban and inter-city environments. As will be shown, the usage of attraction points provides an intuitive way to parameterise a road layout. The original Space Colonization Algorithm (SCA) generates a tree like structure, but in this work, the extensions made aim to fully generate a inter-connected road network.As most previous methods the method has two phases. A first phase generates what is mostly a tree structure growing from user defined road segments. The second phase performs the inter connectivity among the roads created in the first phase.The original SCA parameters such as the killradius help to control the capillarity of the road layout, the number of attraction points used by each segment will dictate its relevance establishing a road hierarchy naturally dependent on the distribution of the attraction points on the terrain. An angle control allows the creation of grid like or more organic road layouts.The distribution of the attraction points in the terrain can be conditioned by boundary maps, containing parks, sea, rivers, and other forbidden areas. Population density maps can be used to supply an explicit probabilistic distribution to the attraction points. Flow-fields can be used to dictate the flow of the road layout. Elevation maps provide an additional restriction regarding the steepness of the roads.The tests were executed within a graphic toolbox developed simultaneously. The results are exported to a geographical information file format, GeoJSON, and then maps are rendered using a geospatial visualisation and processing framework called Mapnik.For the most part, parameter settings were intuitively reflected on the road layout and this method can be seen as a first step towards fully exploring the usage of attraction points in the context of road layout.

TI  - Nomadic Animal Movement and Infectious Disease in Changing Landscapes
AU  - Teitelbaum, Claire Stewart
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Animal movements are an essential component of individual fitness and population dynamics, and also affect species interactions, community composition, and ecosystem functioning. Long-distance animal movements, such as migration and nomadism, are particularly important for community and ecosystem processes, including the dispersal and transmission of infectious diseases. Spatio-temporal patterns in resources (e.g., food, water, habitat) are key drivers of these long-distance movements. Human activities such as urbanization, agricultural development, and climate change alter the quantity and stability of resources available to wildlife, which can in turn alter the distance and frequency of animal movements. Understanding the interactions between landscape change, animal movement, and infectious disease transmission is crucial for informing wildlife conservation and public health in changing landscapes. In this dissertation, I focus on nomadic animal movements, which are irregular long-distance movements with little seasonal signature. First, I review the literature on nomadic movements and describe their prevalence across space and taxa; their general patterns and drivers; and their potential impacts on communities and ecosystems. Next, I build a mathematical model of nomadic animal movements in both naturally-varying and human-altered landscapes to understand the rules that animals might use when deciding when to move, and the effects of urbanization on animals moving according to different rules. I then extend this model to explore the consequences of changing movement patterns for infectious disease transmission in urbanizing landscapes. Finally, I apply this framework to two real-world systems. I analyze GPS tracking data from American white ibis (Eudocimus albus) in South Florida, USA, to understand how individual movement patterns scale up to affect habitat connectivity between urban and nonurban patches. I also perform a comparative analysis using a database of host-parasite associations to understand the relationship between movement patterns (resident, nomadic, or migratory) and parasite diversity in ungulates. Collectively, this research demonstrates that, for nomadic animals, movement forms a crucial link between landscape change and infectious disease transmission in wildlife; however, these effects are complex and their direction depends on the drivers and cues of movement. This work also provides multiple frameworks and avenues for further understanding the ecological effects of wildlife responses to human development.

TI  - Assessing the Effects of Habitat Restoration on Shrubland Specialists: Case Study on the New England Cottontail and Shrubland Birds
AU  - Bauer, Melissa L.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Loss and fragmentation of shrubland habitat in the northeastern United States due to succession, suppression of natural disturbance regimes, and development (Cronon 1983, Litvaitis 1993) have resulted in declines of populations of shrubland specialist species, including the New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) and shrubland birds (Litvaitis et al. 2006, Schlossberg & King 2007). The New England cottontail’s range has declined by over 86% (Litvaitis et al. 2006, Fenderson et al. 2014, Brubaker et al. 2014) and remaining populations are small and exhibit fine-scale structure, limited dispersal, and loss of metapopulation function (Fenderson 2011, 2014, Cheeseman 2017, Chapter 1). In the Northeast, declining species of shrubland birds outnumber increasing species three to one (Schlossberg & King 2007). In response to these losses, active management is ongoing to maintain and create shrubland habitat on the landscape to restore populations of specialists dependent on this habitat type. Given the extensive investments and collaboration focused on restoring shrubland habitats in New England, research is needed to monitor the effects of habitat creation on populations of shrubland specialists. Understanding how shrubland specialists are responding to ongoing habitat creation will inform additional restoration strategies in an adaptive management context, an iterative process of incorporating new information into management practices and learning from previous management outcomes. Shrubland habitat creation and management in New England is largely focused on restoring habitat for the New England cottontail, with the idea that other species will also benefit. The New England cottontail is a highly threatened shrubland obligate requiring multiple patches of shrubland habitat within a short dispersal distance to support viable metapopulations long-term. Much of this management has been initiated by the New England Cottontail Conservation Initiative in response to the cottontail’s nine-year candidate listing status under the Endangered Species Act, and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Keystone Initiative. Conservation efforts implemented for the New England cottontail have included the development of a range-wide inter-agency conservation strategy, designation of focal habitat restoration areas and habitat acreage and cottontail population recovery goals, engagement with private organizations and landowners to create shrubland habitat, implementation of a range-wide cottontail occupancy monitoring protocol, and public outreach and education (Fuller & Tur 2012). Habitat management underway incorporates techniques to set back forest succession, including harvesting trees, cutting and mowing to promote shrub regrowth, planting to improve old field habitat, and controlled burning on fire-maintained habitats like pitch pine-scrub oak. Landscape-level conservation design has been initiated to identify best parcels in terms of vegetation type and patch size that can be targeted for restoration (Tash & Litvaitis 2007, Fuller et al. 2011). Knowing how other species respond to widespread habitat management for cottontails is important to understand the full impacts and benefits of currently implemented management and to inform future management strategies. Given the resources invested in restoring shrubland habitat for cottontail populations, and the potential for other shrubland specialist species to benefit from this restoration, designating the New England cottontail a representative species could benefit strategic management for multiple species by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Representative species designations are a tool for strategic management to provide the greatest benefit for the most species with available resources. Research is needed to identify which additional species would benefit most from restoration to create habitat for cottontails. I investigated shrubland specialist birds as a suite of species that could benefit from habitat management for cottontails, given declining population trends for shrubland birds and their high conservation need in the Northeast. In this thesis, I investigated the effects of habitat restoration on shrubland specialists in three case studies focused on New England cottontails and shrubland birds. In Chapter 1, I used genetic tools to assess the population structure, genetic diversity, effective population size, and census population size of an isolated New England cottontail population in an urban landscape in Londonderry, New Hampshire. I documented attributes of small populations that pose conservation challenges, including limited dispersal and loss of metapopulation function (Chandler et al. 2015), low genetic diversity, high relatedness (Brook et al. 2002, O’Grady et al. 2006), skewed sex ratios (Tella 2001, Clout et al. 2002), and stochastic decline on isolated patches (Stacey & Taper 1992). I used a resistance surface approach to highlight areas of potential connectivity in the landscape, including powerlines, a shrub wetland, and rail corridor. I parameterized a spatially explicit individual-based simulation model that serves as a proof-of-concept for future work to compare the outcomes of alternate restoration scenarios on cottontail population size, genetic diversity, connectivity, and ability to persist in fragmented landscapes given best-case restoration scenarios.

TI  - Avian Communities and Ecoacoustics in a Tropical Human-Modified Landscape
AU  - Bradfer-Lawrence, Tom
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Large areas of the tropics have been cleared of forest and converted to agriculture. The consequent human-modified landscapes (HMLs) comprise a heterogenous mix of habitats; forest fragments and riparian strips are embedded in a matrix of cattle pasture, non-native timber plantations, and urban centres. These habitat changes can have dramatic consequences for wildlife, leading to range shifts and extirpations. In turn, this can influence the integrity of ecosystem services such as frugivory and seed dispersal. Understanding how habitat conversion affects natural ecosystems is critical to inform conservation interventions, but requires long-term biodiversity monitoring and detailed knowledge of species-level responses to HMLs. The research presented in this thesis was conducted in the Emparador HML, in central Republic of Panama. In Chapter 2, we show that the regional avian community is shaped by extent of forest cover across the landscape, and to a lesser degree, extent of forest fragmentation and distance to core forest. Effects of forest cover and fragmentation were examined at local (10 ha) and landscape (500 ha) scales. Species-level responses to these factors varied widely; while abundance of many species increased with greater local-scale forest cover, greater landscape-scale forest cover was often associated with declines. Generalist species that readily persist in HMLs still responded positively to local-scale forest cover, suggesting that even smaller forest fragments in these landscapes are important for maintaining diverse avian assemblages. Critically, we found that species’ responses were not associated with particular traits such as dietary composition or forest dependence, highlighting that species may often exhibit idiosyncratic responses to landscape structure. Chapters 3 and 4 address the wider issue of long-term monitoring, and the potential for data collection over large spatiotemporal scales using remote audio recorders. Ecoacoustics, the study of environmental sound is a relatively new discipline, and as such there is still considerable uncertainty surrounding best-practice for collecting and processing recordings. One of the most straightforward means of utilising audio recordings for environmental monitoring is via acoustic indices. These are objective measures of sound based on features such as pitch and amplitude. To date, attempts to use these indices have been hindered by inconsistent or inappropriate methodologies. In Chapter 3, we determine how many recordings are required to comprehensively capture a soundscape, the acoustic energy of a location. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there are habitat-specific patterns in acoustic indices values, suggesting that these indices reflect differences in vegetation structure and wildlife. We develop this further in Chapter 4, where we show that avian species richness and abundance are clearly linked to patterns in acoustic indices values. Critically, these patterns were coherent among habitat types emphasising their potential for monitoring. Acoustic indices sensitive to the frequencies occupied by bird song have the greatest potential for monitoring an avian community. The results from these two chapters suggest that acoustic indices can be effective tools for monitoring biodiversity, with values reflecting consistent differences across habitats, and among avian assemblages. Audio recordings are a source of permanent, verifiable evidence that can be collected at much greater spatiotemporal scales than traditional biodiversity monitoring data. As the use of audio recorders grows, it is important to compare their efficacy with standard methods of data collection. In Chapter 5, we contrast data derived from audio recordings with that gathered using standard point count methods, and consider whether recorders are a feasible means of surveying antbirds (Thamnophilidae), a disturbance-sensitive avian taxon. Both approaches revealed species’ responses to landscape structure, with qualitatively similar patterns in response to forest cover and vegetation quality. We show that common species can be readily monitored using audio recorders, with greater levels of detectability compared with point counts. However, rarer species were more likely to be detected using point counts. The work presented in this thesis helps to explain the patterns seen in avian responses to Neotropical HMLs. In particular we emphasise the importance of forest cover for maintaining bird assemblages in these landscapes. We demonstrate the utility of audio recorders for data collection, and highlight their potential for future biodiversity monitoring. In the face of human population growth, and ongoing habitat disturbance and agricultural intensification, conservation efforts are essential to avoid widespread species extinctions and ecosystem collapse. Interventions must take place in HMLs, to bolster ecosystem services, provide buffer zones for protected areas, and improve connectivity in the wider landscape.

TI  - Modeling the spatial differentiation in cloud-to-ground lightning: A case study in Atlanta, Georgia, USA
AU  - Strikas, Ona
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urban cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning enhancement has been well documented for Atlanta, Georgia. This study builds on those investigations using modeling techniques. Numerous styles of analyses and regressions were conducted to establish patterns of CG lightning over the North Georgia region. CG lightning demonstrated clustering for all years of data: 1995–2008. However, the first strike of each day with lightning was randomly distributed according to a Poisson distribution, demonstrating the clustering is not due to permanent features. Attempts were unsuccessful to model CG lightning clusters as either a Matern or Thomas Poisson point process. Regressions of CG lightning with built environment covariates—FAA aviation obstacle locations and heights, population density, road length density, distance to the center of Atlanta, PM10 emissions data, distance to highways, and coal plant locations—as well as natural variables such as projected coordinate easting, northing, and NWS severe thunderstorm status were executed at resolutions of 1km, 2km, 4km, and 8km. Analyses demonstrated significantly higher flash frequency near FAA aviation obstacles. With an R2 value of 0.22, taller obstacles are struck more frequently than shorter obstacles. Regressions with road length density revealed little explanatory power (maximum R2=0.19), but demonstrated a positive correlation independent of scale. A multi-level visualization technique demonstrates the road length density correlation loses accuracy within dense urban corridors. Distance from Atlanta shows a negative correlation, but only at larger scales. Subsetting both regressions by direction reveals a significant difference on the Eastern and Western sides of Atlanta. Subsetting both regressions only to Gwinnett County, Georgia illustrates road length density has no correlation with flash frequency, and distance to Atlanta is still a scale dependent process. PM10 emissions analysis suggests that CG amplification is most likely to occur between 15 and 33µg/m 3, but the data has significant flash frequency variability even within these PM10 levels. Immediate proximity to highways proves not to be a significant variable in modeling flash frequency at any resolution. Coal plant proximity has the potential to enhance CG flash frequency, but the inherent variability in frequency precludes a strong p-value compared to randomly generated areas. However, if the data is subset by flashes/day over 500, then the areas close to coal plants have significantly more lightning (p=2.19e-5).   Using a subset of the twenty-five highest frequency flash days in three equal area study areas (Haralson and Polk Counties representing rural, Cobb County representing developed and upwind of Atlanta, and Gwinnett County representing downwind and developed) Mann-Whitney tests are completed to determine if NWS severe thunderstorm storms are significantly different in CG flash frequency. In each study area, the NWS severe thunderstorms are not significantly different in flash frequency than non-severe storms. This analysis also suggests spatial tendencies of high frequency storms in each area.  This multi-scale analysis also suggests that when examining CG lightning, more than one scale of examination should be used. Some processes of lightning amplification appear to occur at very local scales (500m), whereas others are coarser (up to 8km). There appears to be no goldilocks scale of analysis for CG lightning. However, if only one resolution is to be used, 2km is recommended.

TI  - Analyzing Vertebrate Movement in and Around Natural Areas Through Road Surveys
AU  - Freter, Victoria
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - With the expansion of the human population, new roads are continually being built, leading to an increase in fragmentation or loss of natural habitats. These roads can act as corridors for vertebrates connecting natural habitats or aiding in migration, but they can also act as barriers or boundaries leading to fragmentation, isolation, and/or mortality on roadways. Research has focused mainly on larger highways, outside of the U.S., and away from larger urban areas. The Oak Openings Region, a biodiversity hot spot in northwestern Ohio, is a matrix of human dominated land use and remnant natural patches. This research focused on identifying vertebrate mortality hot spots and the spatial and temporal variables associated with vertebrate road mortality. From mid-April to the end of September 2019, we surveyed 38 road transects within and around three protected (natural) areas to record diversity, abundance, and distribution of roadkilled vertebrates and to identify influencing factors (e.g., land use, canopy cover, environmental data, road characteristics). We found an uneven spread of roadkill, with 45% of roadkill found on nine out of the 38 (24%) surveyed transects, highlighting potential areas to prioritize for mitigation. During the spring months (April 14 - June 20), nine of the transects had no roadkill, but in the summer months (June 21 - September 18), only one transect had no roadkill. This suggests that seasonality influenced the abundance and distribution of roadkill. As transects moved northward, there was a positive trend of more roadkill with increased developed land use. We found a total of 297 roadkill on or around the roads, with all vertebrate taxa included. Mammals made up 49.8% of the roadkill found. Mammal roadkill showed a significant positive trend with average canopy cover (p < 0.0001). Amphibians made up the second largest roadkill group, but showed a seasonal peak in August. These results can help land managers predict where animal dispersal is occurring, which roads negatively impact vertebrates, and identify where better connectivity of the landscape could improve conditions for vertebrate populations. This study suggests that human dominated land use increases mortality and seasonality influences roadkill abundance and distribution.

T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urbanization has profound ecological impacts that reach beyond city boundaries. Obvious ecological consequences of urbanization include habitat loss and fragmentation. Anthropogenic barriers reduce habitat connectivity, impede gene flow between populations and accelerate the loss of genetic diversity in populations due to drift. Urbanization may have also cryptic consequences such as the effects of human-introduced toxicants on wildlife populations. Toxicants are a leading cause of population decline for a variety of animal species worldwide and may directly threaten animal populations by causing direct mortalities, or indirectly through sublethal, chronic effects such as reproductive impairment, decreased immune competence, and increased disease susceptibility or emergence. If population-level impacts occur as a result of toxicant exposure, genetic consequences may also accompany reduced population sizes and connectivity. These include inbreeding depression that may increase the probability of population extinction and the loss of adaptive potential that reduces the ability of populations to respond to novel selection regimes. Overall, urbanization presents wildlife with many novel stressors to which they must adapt or perish. Urbanization is increasing at an unprecedented pace; understanding both the obvious and the cryptic threats to wild animal populations persisting near urban areas will be vital to promoting conservation and the maintenance of global biodiversity. To address the consequences of urbanization on wildlife populations, I focused on a well-studied population of bobcats (Lynx rufus) living in and around Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (SMMNRA). This region comprises a collection of protected park areas near downtown Los Angeles. Bobcats inhabiting SMMNRA have been monitored by National Park Service (NPS) biologists since 1996. Within a localized region of SMMNRA, the NPS has demonstrated that a major freeway (US-101) acts not only as a barrier to movement for bobcat and coyote (Canis latrans) populations, but potentially also as a social barrier. Further, from 2002-2005, a notoedric mange epizootic associated with secondary anticoagulant rat poison exposure was the greatest source of mortality for bobcats. During this period, the annual survival rate for radio-collared animals fell by > 50% and in 2003 the mange mortality rate reached a high of 51%. Long-term samples were collected from this population from 1996-2012, allowing the rare opportunity to make direct comparisons before, during, and after the population decline.Using these data as a foundation, my research focused on three main objectives. First, I characterized neutral and adaptively relevant genetic diversity in bobcat populations across SMMNRA in both fragmented urban and protected natural areas. Second, I examined anticoagulant rodenticide exposure in bobcats across southern California, contrasting seasonal, demographic and spatial risk factors in both natural and urbanized areas. Third, I characterized physiological and immunological parameters in bobcats across SMMNRA to evaluate the effects of disease and toxicant exposure on bobcat health in an urban, fragmented landscape.I found that two freeways are significant barriers to gene flow. Further, the 3-year disease epizootic, associated with secondary anticoagulant rodenticide exposure, caused a population bottleneck that led to significant genetic differentiation pre- and post-disease populations that was greater than that between populations separated by major freeways for > 60 years. However, balancing selection acted on immune-linked loci during the epizootic, maintaining variation at functional regions. With respect to anticoagulant rodenticide exposure, I detected high prevalence of exposure (89%, liver; 39%, blood) and found that for individuals with paired liver and blood data (N = 64), 92% were exposed most frequently to greater than or equal to 3 compounds. Prevalence and the amounts of contaminants were associated with human activities that included commercial, residential, and agricultural development. I found a strong association between AR exposure to greater than and equal to 0.25 ppm or greater than and equal to 2 compounds and an ectoparasitic disease, notoedric mange. Finally, I observed that AR exposure has both immune stimulatory and suppressive effects that may explain increased bobcat susceptibility to notoedric mange as a result of chronic exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides. Bobcats exposed to ARs had elevated lymphocyte, and specifically B cell counts, and decreased percentages of neutrophils. Overall, these data highlight that even for free-ranging animals that are considered relatively adaptable to urbanization, habitat fragmentation and toxicant exposure can have profound population level effects that threaten the long-term stability of wildlife populations in an increasingly urbanized landscape.

TI  - Urban landscape relationships with song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) population structure and connectivity and human health and behavior
AU  - Unfried, Thomas Mitchell
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urbanization converts native vegetation to novel land cover types, which may affect population connectivity. I studied this relationship in Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) at 18 sites in the Seattle, WA, metropolitan region. Genetic differentiation was best predicted by resistance distances in which resistance to dispersal was linearly related to age of development and a second set of resistance distances in which high and medium urbanization were 100 times more resistant than vegetation land covers. My results suggest that urban development reduced population connectivity for Song Sparrows. The relation to development age suggests that genetic differentiation in the urban system has not yet reached equilibrium, so the effects of connectivity loss will increase. Urbanization can decrease habitat quality that can result in source-sink population dynamics I combined a study of demographic rates with genetic methods to study source-sink population dynamics in Song Sparrows. I estimated juvenile and adult survival from mark-recapture analysis and fecundity from territory success and fledgling counts. Directional gene flow was investigated by several genetic methods. The trend in Song Sparrow relative abundance revealed an intrinsic rate of increase of −7.8% annually, and four of 15 sampled populations had finite rates of increase (λ) significantly less than one. Net immigration estimated from genetic assignments was negatively correlated with λ. Net immigration or λ were not correlated with landscape or local habitat metrics. Genetic methods suggest that gene flow is common throughout the region, and Song Sparrows exhibit source-sink population dynamics. I collaborated with an interdisciplinary team to examine the influence of destinations within walking distance and vegetation on walking trips and body mass index (BMI) for residents of Seattle, WA. We measured accessibility and greenness, and self-reported destinations, natural features, walking trips, BMI were measured through a postal survey. Objective accessibility was related to walking trips per month, as was subjective greenness. In areas with high accessibility, BMI was lower in areas that had more greenness. Objective and subjective measurements of accessibility and greenness led to an understanding of variation among walking trips and BMI in different neighborhoods.

TI  - The Ecological Drivers of Urban Tick-Borne Disease Emergence
AU  - VanAcker, Meredith C.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Tick-borne diseases cause in enormous burden on human, livestock, and wildlife health globally and are driven by the increasing abundance and geographic expansion of medically important tick species. More recently, tick-borne disease emergence is occurring in urban landscapes due to complex feedbacks between the environment, humans, wildlife, and ticks. In this dissertation, I focus on the ecological conditions that allow for tick-borne disease emergence in a city. I use a combination of spatial landscape modeling, empirical data collection, wildlife movement tracking to determine drivers of zoonotic hazards in New York City, NY, and employ vector genomics to examine vector dispersal in the northeastern United States. In chapter one, I pair tick collection throughout the five boroughs of New York City with landscape connectivity modeling to examine how green space connectivity and habitat availability affects the density and infection of questing nymphs – an important epidemiological measure of human risk for tick-borne diseases. I found that green spaces that were highly connected for deer had higher nymph density and infection prevalence for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease. In chapter two, I use camera trapping, live trapping, and tick collection on Staten Island, NY, to examine how landscape fragmentation – through changing habitat size and connectivity – shapes the host community available for questing Ixodes scapularis nymphs. Further, I examined whether patterns in host species abundance and activity correlate with the density of nymphs and their infection prevalence with three different pathogens that vary in host-specificity, B. burgdorferi, Babesia microti, and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. I found associations between host species and the size and connectivity of the park habitat, identified host species which amplified and removed ticks in the environment, and determined links between host activity and abundance and the infection prevalence of nymphs with host-specific pathogens. In chapter three, I utilize movement data from 59 white-tailed deer on Staten Island, NY, to assess the drivers of movement and its impact on tick-borne disease hazard across the landscape. I found that white-tailed deer avoid anthropogenic development at fine spatial scales when establishing home ranges but select for anthropogenic resources within their home range, increasing the potential to distribute ticks into environments that interface with humans. Finally in chapter four, I use double digest Restriction Associated DNA sequencing to examine the genetic differentiation of six I. scapularis populations across the Northeast region. I found high levels of gene flow across a spatial scale of 400 km, likely resulting from frequent host-mediated dispersal events combined with large I. scapularis populations. Taken together, this work emphasizes that host movement and ecology are critical determinants of urban tick-borne disease emergence through directing vector and pathogen dispersal, serving as pathogen reservoirs in urban habitats, and interfacing with humans in unique ways that increase human exposure to zoonotic hazards.

TI  - Study on the relationship between the damage of callosciurus erythraeus and landscape pattern and human activities in artificial forest in hongya sichuan
AU  - Wang, Ying
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorCallosciurus erythraeus, also called red-bellied squirrel, belongs to Rodentia, Sciuridae and Callosciurus. During recent years, red-bellied squirrels(Callosciurus erythraeus) have made great damage to artificial forests in some regions of Sichuan by debarking trees, mainly including Crypotomeria fortunei and Cunninghami lanceolata. The debarking of Callosciurus erythraeus influences badly on trees' normal growth, and even causes trees dead. Hongya County of Sichuan has suffered from Callosciurus erythraeus damage for many years, which has become the premier forest diseases and pests of Hongya. In order to find out the relationship between Callosciurus erythraeus damage and the environment, and to explore the reason for squirrel damage, we have conducted 240 samples in Yupingshan Mountain and Caoyutan Village of Hongya from March to April in 2009. Based on the information of these samples, we studied the relationship between the damage and habitat factors in different aged forest respectively. Besides, by combing remote sense, GIS techniques and landscape pattern analysis software (Fragstates Version 3.3), we studied the characteristics of landscape patterns of the damaged regions in Hongya according to landscape metrics. We analyzed the fundamental information of Callosciurus erythraeus damage of the whole county which was provided by local forestry department, and the results showed that squirrel damage occurred in 12 towns of Hongya which governs 15 towns in total, and mostly distributed over Yuping Mountain District, Bamian Mountain District, Muchan Mountain District, Panjiaozui District. There are a significant positive correlation between each town's damaged forest area rate and it's population density(r=0.623, P<0.05) and a very significant negative correlation between each town's damaged forest area rate and it's percentage of forest cover(r=-0.762, P<0.01). The research on the landscape patterns of mainly damaged regions showed that: ⑴ the CLUMPY and COHESION of warm coniferous forest patch type in severely damaged areas and less severely damaged areas are not very different, which indicates that the damage degree of an area has no necessary connection with the clumpiness and connectivity of warm coniferous forest patch; ⑵ the fragmentation of severely damaged areas is a little higher compared to the less severely damaged areas and the area propotion of farmland and shrub patch types in severely damaged areas is larger than in less severely damaged areas. We supposed that when the warm coniferous forest patches are more fragmented and there is a larger propotion of farmland and shrub in a region, it will be more difficulty for the squirrels to transfer to another patch when they face the lack of food, so they are more inclined to debark trees repeatedly in the same patch, which results in more severe damage;⑶ for the whole landscape level, CONTAG (contagion index) of severely damaged areas is a little smaller than the less severely damaged areas, and SHDI(Shannon's Diversity Index) is a little larger compared to less severely damaged areas. It indicated that the distribution of different patch types in severely damaged areas was more mixed, and the heterogeneity of these areas are also a little higher. By studying the relationship between the squirrel damage in different aged coniferous forests and the habitat factors, we found that: ⑴ In mature forests and middle aged and young forests, three habitat factors(slope aspect, slope degree and whether Crypotomeria fortunei and Cunninghami lanceolata are mix-planted or not) is likely to have relations with the damage occurrence;⑵ In mature forests, the trees with high coverage is more easily damaged by Callosciurus erythraeus; in the middle aged and young forest, however, the coverage factor showed no significant difference between the damaged samples and undamaged samples. And It is the same case for another habitat factor distance from water;⑶ the two human disturbance factors(distance from residence and distance from road) have some influence on the squirrel damage of the middle aged and young forests, but the influence in the mature forests are not significant. We believed that the human activities' influence on the squirrel damage to coniferous trees will become much limited as the trees grow into

AU  - Thornhill, Ian
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - The ecology of ponds is threatened by urbanisation and as cities expand pond habitats are disappearing at an alarming rate. Pond communities are structured by local (water quality, physical) and regional (land-use, connectivity) processes. Since ca1904 >80% of ponds in Birmingham, U.K., have been lost due to land-use intensification, resulting in an increasingly diffuse network. A survey of thirty urban ponds revealed high spatial and temporal variability in water quality, which frequently failed environmental standards. Most were eutrophic, although macrophyte-rich, well connected ponds supported macroinvertebrate assemblages of high conservation value. Statistically, local physical variables (e.g. shading) explained more variation, both in water quality and macroinvertebrate community composition than regional factors. Nonetheless, habitat availability within the wider landscape was important. Ecosystem functioning (leaf-litter breakdown) along a rural-urban gradient was confounded by habitat area, despite a decrease in functional redundancy. Ponds are identified that promote network connectivity and management of land-use within 100m may buffer against diffuse pollution with reductions in riparian shading required to improve growth conditions for oxygenating vegetation and to reduce nutrient levels. The results indicate that many urban ponds are threatened habitats that require active management to protect and restore water quality, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Plantation and Farm: Social and Economic Change in Orange and Greene Counties, Virginia, 1716 to 1860
AU  - Schlotterbeck, John Thomas
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Many upper South plantation districts in the antebellum period developed a distinct agricultural system characterized by staple crops for export, subsistence farming, slave labor, and local commercial and artisan services. During these years older sections of the region also experienced relative economic decline due to unstable foreign markets, falling farm prices, and growing competition from western producers. The history of Orange and Greene Counties, located in northern piedmont Virginia between Fredericksburg and the Blue Ridge Mountains, provides a case study of slavery, diversified agriculture, and economic stagnation in the old upper South.Tidewater slaveholders settled the area after 1725 for tobacco production. Their relative isolation encouraged extensive self-sufficiency, and production of wheat for export after 1760 further diversified plantation operations. By 1800, tobacco and wheat were part of a general farming system that included other grains, grasses, fruits, vegetables, livestock, and home manufactures. Individual farms differed in their orientation towards production for external markets or for subsistence and local sale.Slavery was adaptable to mixed farming. Blacks, the main source of local labor, were general agricultural workers, as slaveholdings were too small to create specialized roles. To augment their slave labor forces, masters relied on free laborers and hired slaves to create a variable labor supply adjustable to changing work demands.Mixed farming promoted local economic development and community self-sufficiency, but not urban or industrial growth. Individual households and farms had numerous economic ties linking them to others in the community. Although residents used cash in some local exchanges, they usually determined cash values of particular services or products and repaid obligations in equivalent values. Local economic exchanges reinforced existing social ties and created a web of interrelationships that united the free population.The long depression in Virginia between 1812 and the early 1850s strengthened diversified agriculture and the social economy and inhibited social and economic change. Mixed farming was the safest strategy in a period of market uncertainty. Depression weakened vertical ties to external markets and producers turned inward to the local community. Balancing population growth and local economic resources was crucial to avoid a Malthusian disaster. After 1800, increasingly constricted economic opportunities created "anti-fertility" pressures that gradually reduced white fertility and slowed white population growth. Heavy white out-migration alleviated potential overpopulation and at the same time reinforced parochialism. Low population density mitigated the necessity of adopting more intensive agricultural practices, and local agricultural reformers' ideas won only limited acceptance.Economic and demographic conditions facilitated unusually high slave fertility, but even heavier black migration followed white out-migration from Orange and Greene. This forced migration caused frequent separations from family and friends and battered the black community.Orange and Greene entered a new pattern of economic development during the 1850s. Railroad and turnpike construction linked the area to urban markets and high wheat and tobacco prices caused farm production to expand. Stronger vertical ties to external markets steadily eroded community self-sufficiency, as more farmers sent crops directly to urban markets and town merchants provided additional commercial and retail services. Although the initial redirection occurred in the 1850s, these changes were far from complete by 1860, and their full impact would not appear until long after the Civil War.

TI  - The influence of urban green spaces on declining bumble bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae)
AU  - Beckham, Jessica L.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are adept pollinators of countless cultivated and wild flowering plants, but many species have experienced declines in recent decades. Though urban sprawl has been implicated as a driving force of such losses, urban green spaces hold the potential to serve as habitat islands for bumble bees. As human populations continue to grow and metropolitan areas become larger, the survival of many bumble bee species will hinge on the identification and implementation of appropriate conservation measures at regional and finer scales. North Texas is home to some the fastest-growing urban areas in the country, including Denton County, as well as at least two declining bumble bee species (B. pensylvanicus and  B. fraternus). Using a combination of field, molecular DNA and GIS methods I evaluated the persistence of historic bumble bee species in Denton County, and investigated the genetic structure and connectivity of the populations in these spaces. Field sampling resulted in the discovery of both  B. pensylvanicus and B. fraternus in Denton County's urban green spaces. While the relative abundance of B. fraternus in these spaces was significantly lower than historic levels gleaned from museum records, that of B. pensylvanicus was significantly higher. Statistical analyses found that both bare ground and tree cover surrounding sample sites were negatively associated with numbers of bumble bee individuals and hives detected in these green spaces. Additionally, limited genetic structuring of bumble bee populations was detected, leading to the conclusion that extensive gene flow is occurring across populations in Denton County.

TI  - A multiscale investigation of snake habitat relationships and snake conservation in Illinois
AU  - Cagle, Nicolette L.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Snake populations in the North American tallgrass prairie appear to be declining, yet data unavailability impedes the development of enhanced ecological understanding of snake species-habitat relationships and also hinders snake conservation efforts. This study addresses both issues for the snakes of Illinois in two steps. In a two-year mark-recapture study at twenty-two sites within six northern Illinois prairie preserves, I investigated snake species-habitat relationships using habitat variables at three scales: microhabitat (< 100 m), landscape (1–10 km), and regional (> 10 km). A total of 120 snakes representing seven species was captured using drift fence arrays associated with funnel traps and sheet metal cover. The low numbers and diversity of snakes captured, when compared to historic evidence, indicate that Illinois snake populations have declined. At the microhabitat scale, non-metric multidimensional scaling and Mantel tests revealed a relationship between snake species composition and elevation. At the landscape-scale, snake species composition varied along an agricultural-urban cover gradient. Classification and regression trees and maximum entropy models (Maxent) were used to identify the scales at which snake species-habitat relationships were strongest. Six of seven regression trees for individual snakes species contained habitat variables at the landscape scale. Important landscape characteristics included patch size, isolation, and land cover, metrics that strongly covary with habitat loss. Microhabitat features only appeared in the regression trees of two species and in three Maxent models. This study indicates that habitat loss has shaped the current distribution of snake species in Illinois's remnant prairies and that snake conservation efforts should emphasize the landscape-scale. Finally, I developed a risk ranking system based on natural and life history characteristics to assess the conservation status of Illinois's 38 snake species. Cluster analysis identified eight groups of snakes, similar in terms of risk factors, with high risk species sharing characteristics such as large body size, long life span, limited habitat breadth, and a high anthropogenic threat ranking. Here, I emphasize the need for basic demographic studies on snakes and suggest that ranking systems be used with population data (when available) and expert opinion to identify snake species of conservation concern in other regions.

AU  - Rullman, Stanley D., Jr.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The field of urban ecology seeks to incorporate humans into ecological studies, particularly within the built environment. This can include both the study of urban landscapes, as well as the study of ecology in urban landscapes, with the latter often helping inform the former, strengthening our understanding of these manipulated landscapes and systems. Human preferences drive many decisions on land use, with both local and large scales influencing the landscape, distribution of wildlife and, ultimately, the functioning of ecosystems. In these three studies in urban ecology, I first investigate one such driver of land use change by examining patterns of second home development in an amenity-rich landscape. Using a mixed-method approach combining spatial data and interview analyses, my interdisciplinary colleagues and I investigate both the structural and behavioral aspects of amenity migration in San Juan and Okanogan counties in Washington State. Results indicate that second- homeowners' desire for privacy and escape is reflected in patterns of spatial isolation among second homes, with second homes more likely to be next to undeveloped parcels and public land (Okanogan County) or shorelines (San Juan County). I then focus on one guild of avian predators—diurnal and nocturnal raptors—and examine whether land cover characteristics or prey abundance better explains their presence along Seattle's urban-to-wildland gradient, finding a strong relationship between specific land use patterns and the presence of these often habitat and dietary generalists throughout the gradient. Lastly, I provide a detailed investigation into the effects of one of these raptor species—the Cooper's Hawk (Accipiter cooperii)—on the songbird  communities within which they live, finding a slight negative influence on the survivorship and nesting success of species they tend to prey upon, no significant influence on species they tend to not prey upon, and very limited influence on the overarching structure of the avian communities.

TI  - Forest Bird Demography in a Landscape Mosaic (hierarchy, Wisconsin)
AU  - Urban, Dean L.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - A tandem approach of simulation modelling and field studies in southern Wisconsin was used to examine avian demography in a landscape mosaic of forest patches. Species abundance patterns were framed as the consequence of individuals' demographics as constrained by their landscape context; this context was partitioned to emphasize habitat availability, accessibility (or isolation), and local factors affecting reproductive success. Each of these constraints was considered in turn.A forest simulation model was used to explore the community-level consequences of habitat pattern. Simulated patterns in habitat availability could provide for successional trends in species diversity, a relation between niche position and species abundance, the occurrence of more rare species than common ones, and a species/area effect. A mechanistic understanding of the agents affecting habitat pattern suggested scenarios under which empirical estimates of habitat diversity might contribute substantially to predictions of bird species abundance patterns.Habitat accessibility did not seem to be an effective constraint on bird species distribution in the Wisconsin mosaic. Neither species dispersion patterns nor species tallies per woodlot offered compelling evidence that any woodlots were so isolated as to affect avian vagility. Simulations suggested that path isolation becomes increasingly important as the mean distance between patches approaches the dispersal range of the bird species; in mosaics with still greater distances between patches, isolation decreases in explanatory power.Sensitivity analysis of natality terms in the demographics simulator implicated factors affecting reproductive success as potentially powerful constraints on bird species distribution. Analysis of model uncertainty suggested that predictions of population trends at the landscape scale cannot rely on mechanistic models, but should instead derive coarser-resolution models. The hierarchical framework developed in this study represents a synthetic general model for avian demography in a landscape mosaic.

TI  - Extent of Alabama's Terrestrial Nature Reserve system in representing ecosystem diversity: A coarse–filter gap analysis
AU  - Billue, Anna Keelin
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Numerous studies reveal that existing nature reserves do not effectively represent ecosystem diversity and biodiversity. In this study, Alabama's public and private reserve lands were analyzed to see how representative they were of biodiversity. The spatial distribution and characteristics of Alabama's nature reserves were examined using gap analysis, a technique used to assess the distribution of nature reserves. In Alabama, a gap analysis that includes public (including Department of Defense) and private nature reserves has not been conducted. This analysis had two objectives: 1) to examine the distribution and characteristics of nature reserves across ecoregions; and 2) to analyze where gaps in the Alabama nature reserve system existed and to characterize the drivers of the identified gaps in nature reserve coverage. GIS shapefiles of reserves were collected. A database featuring the total number of reserves, reserve ecoregion, reserve size, owner type (federal, state, local, landtrust), property type (public, private), and connectivity (distance between reserves) was created. Public property was comprised the majority of all nature reserve land area. However, private parcels were the most common land parcels in the four northeasternmost ecoregions (Interior Plateau, Southwestern Appalachians, Ridge and Valley, Piedmont). The two southernmost ecoregions (Southeastern Plains, Southern Coastal Plain) were predominantly comprised of public parcels. The results indicated that reserve lands cover the Southern Coastal Plain most effectively and Southeastern Plains and Interior Plateau the least. I hypothesized that the distribution of nature reserves based on property and owner type was influenced by race, socioeconomic status, and presence of cities. This study will fill a dearth in research and help researchers, private, state, and federal agencies to make well-informed decisions to set and meet conservation goals and policy.

T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Riparian forests are increasingly threatened by urban expansion and land use change worldwide. Understanding the impacts of urbanization on riparian forests is critical because riparian areas provide a variety of important ecological services and are biological hotspots for species diversity. The overall goal of this work was to describe the relationships among landscape characteristics and woody plant diversity, structure, species composition, and plant functional traits of small order riparian corridors along an urban-rural land use gradient in the Georgia Piedmont, US. The objectives were to: (1) examine the influence of land use and urbanization indices on riparian woody plant species diversity and composition, (2) quantify changes in riparian forest structure across an urban-rural gradient, (3) elucidate changes in woody plant functional traits along an urban-rural gradient, and (4) compare trends in diversity, composition, structure, and trait characteristics in the mature forest stand and forest tree regeneration. This work demonstrates that changes in species diversity, composition, and structure are occurring in response to land use and the surrounding landscape matrix. Non-native invasive species appear to be driving many of the changes, specifically the shrub,  Ligustrum sinense. Species richness was positively correlated to rural landscape characteristics and negatively related to urban characteristics. Shannon diversity was negatively associated with dominance of non-native species, especially for the forest regeneration layer. Urban sites were characterized by high richness of non-native species and several pioneer species. Developing sites were dominated by the non-native shrub, Ligustrum sinense, and several native overstory trees, mainly Acer negundo. While agricultural and managed forest sites were composed of ubiquitous species, the unmanaged forest type exhibited a structurally distinct midstory. Midstory tree biomass was positively related to forest cover and negatively related to impervious surface cover and shrub biomass was positively related to patch density. Urban and agriculture sites showed signs of recruitment failure. Species functional traits also varied across the gradient. Specifically, differences in leaf type, plant form, flood and shade tolerance, seed dispersal, pollination, growth rate, rooting characteristics, and life span were found. Flood tolerance was strongly reduced in the regeneration layer in urban riparian areas suggesting a potential shift in hydrologic function. Results from this study highlight the impact of urbanization on riparian forest plant biodiversity and structure.

TI  - The Influence of Urban Street Environments on Levels of Metro Use and Walk Access Mode Share
AU  - Alanazi, Naif Fluah K
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - The nature of the relationship between urban street environments and the levels of station use and walk access mode share of urban metro systems remains unclear in transport studies. This thesis explores these relationships (at station catchment level) in several different urban rail systems in the US - Dallas, Phoenix, Atlanta, and Washington DC - that are as comparable as possible with Middle East conditions (in terms of population densities, rail network size, spatial structure, climate, etc.); and then compares model relationships to one of the metro systems in the Middle East (Dubai Metro) in the United Arab Emirates. Aggregate socio-demographic, land use and service frequency data is assembled from different urban datasets within a 400 metre and 800 metre radius of selected rail stations. In addition, for each station catchment area, a newly developed street network connectivity (S-Conn) index (presence of sidewalks, completeness of sidewalks, presence of crossings, and presence of barriers) and a street network quality (S-Qual) index (speed limit, sidewalk condition, dropped kerbs, seating areas, street lights, and amount of street trees) is developed and applied to sample of the street network segments. In general, S-Conn and S-Qual scores more highly within 400m of stations than it does between 400m and 800m, in all cities. Using this collated data, statistical models have been developed to estimate the relationships between the various explanatory variables and average weekday boardings and walk access mode share at selected stations. The study is particularly interested to explore whether urban S-Conn and S-Qual are significant explanatory variables in these models, both within 400m and 800m of stations. The study finds that the S-Conn index is positively associated with the average weekday boardings in the four US cities; but S-Qual is only significant in a few of the models. The findings also showed that the S-Conn index is positively associated with walk access mode shares both in the four US cities and in Dubai models. However, this result does not mean that the S-Qual is not important; its significance may differ for different cities and models. The study concludes that transport planners should take more account of S-Conn around station catchments when planning public transport infrastructure projects, in order to increase station patronage and walk access modal shares.

TI  - Social Network Interaction and Behaviors on Recreational Greenways and Their Role in Enhancing Greenway Potential
AU  - Pippi, Luis G.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The urban sprawl, landscape transformation and fragmentation, spatial inequality, gentrification, social fragmentation and isolation have contributed to societal changes in terms of social contact, physical activity and contact with nature. The crux of the problem lies either in the lack of landscape and urban planning which takes into consideration both environmental and social issues, or in the non-implementation of such planning. Recreational greenways have the potential to mitigate these problems, because they connect the landscape systems with human society. They represent a resilient, new and effective democratic space in the urban and suburban areas that provide a myriad of functions: environmental, social, leisure, recreation and tourism. The greenway characteristics can connect people, landscapes and places thus enabling physical environment conditions that allow the occurrence of social ties, bridges and interactions among users and actors. However, many scholars have confirmed the necessity of more greenway studies that deal with social factors such as interaction, social ties and bridges and behavior. To understand the recreational greenways it is important to recognize the social life linked to them by understanding the relationship between greenway characteristics, social interactions and behaviors. These aspects are crucial to enhance the efficacy of such ecological networks. The main purpose of this study is to describe the social interaction that arises from the greenway environments, by analyzing the different types of social tie and bridge interactions that take place on the recreational greenways. The study hypothesized that recreational greenways create an environment that fosters social networks within the community, which affect and are affected by social interaction, behavior, ties/bridges and cohesion. The type of greenway characteristics may influence the type of user, type of actor, pattern of use and behavior, promoting social integration to differing degrees and among different types of people. Two greenway case studies with the highest volume of use in Cary, NC, were selected in an attempt to provide vital information regarding the capacity of recreational greenways to create and promote social interaction. Multi-methods were utilized, including greenway characteristics audit, social characteristic audit, behavior mapping, standardized survey questionnaire and mapping exercise. This protocol was effective for analyzing interaction, behavior and social ties and bridges on recreational greenways and to understand the relationship between the social network aspects and the greenway characteristics. The data were analyzed with GIS and the use of descriptive statistics and data mining analysis, including decision tree, clustering and regression for complex and large data sets, to present the quantitative and qualitative data that were analyzed to test the research hypotheses and assumptions. The results provided positive insights in terms of correlation of different greenway characteristics and different social network features. The greenway has the potential to bring people together as it provides a matrix of inner and intra interactions between users and actors. The study revealed that people tend to utilize the greenways for socialization pursuits with different types and levels, and may contribute to the development of successful greenway physical environments to promote the positive social network interaction and behaviors. The greenway structural network connection and features when well-designed contribute to social events and contacts, enhancing the quality of life and well-being of its residents. The findings provided useful knowledge for the development of new design norms and to find alternatives that encourage and support social integration and have an impact on social networks and connections, promoting the essential conditions for the establishment of social capital, gathering, lingering and social tie/bridge interactions. The results of this study provided some useful directions for the design guidelines of successful greenways with more functional and efficient characteristics.

TI  - Reconnecting rattlers: Identifying potential connectivity for an urban population of Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnakes
AU  - Choquette, Jonathan Daniel
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - In an urbanizing region of Southwestern Ontario, a declining population of Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnakes (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus) persists in taligrass prairie remnants. Maintaining an adequate level of landscape connectivity is a recommended strategy to encourage dispersal between habitat patches and to reduce the extinction risk of this genetically and ecologically distinct population. The goal of this study was to identify potential connectivity pathways between habitat patches for this species by using a GIS least-cost model and to evaluate the outputs with road mortality data. Results identified seven pathways between five core habitat patches which were validated with aerial imagery and mortality data. A subset of pathways requires further study. This research will guide the location of interventions aimed at increasing connectivity for this species, provide a basis for connectivity design for other species within the study landscape, and inform the use of a modelling approach to connectivity analysis in urban landscapes.

TI  - Creating Useful Road Mortality Models: Identifying Drivers of Road Mortality at Different Resolutions in the Greater Toronto Area
AU  - MacFarlane, Stephen Sohier
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Road propagation has led to landscape level threats due to habitat destruction, pollution, and mortality. Road mortality risk prediction converges on three drivers: habitat availability, landscape connectivity, and traffic volume. This study assessed the relative importance of mortality drivers in a peri-urban landscape at different taxonomic levels. Road mortality data and land cover data were provided by Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, and traffic data from governmental sources were used. I modelled landscape connectivity using circuit theory algorithms. Driver significance was assessed using univariate multiple regression models and multivariate redundancy analyses, using total road mortality, taxa-based road mortality, and species level road mortality for American toads and grey treefrogs. Local scale drivers such as wetland patchiness and amount had the greatest effects on road mortality. Greater divergence occurred at the species scale, though conserved patterns were seen across multiple taxonomic levels.

TI  - Urban wetland structure and its relationship to exotic plants, biodiversity, and West Nile Virus risk
AU  - Shappell, Laura Jean
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Wetlands provide crucial ecosystem functions that aid water security, stormwater management, and biodiversity conservation. However, the underlying mechanisms that influence headwater wetlands in urban landscapes are poorly understood. Further, biodiversity loss may reduce ecosystem function and increase the transmission risk for some enzootic diseases, such as West Nile virus (WNV). My research aimed to: 1) assess wetland vegetation structure and the importance of fragment size and landscape position on biodiversity; 2) test the importance of flooding conditions for mitigating invasive plant dominance in forested wetlands using Japanese stiltgrass (Microstegium vimineum) as my study system; and 3) identify relationships between vegetation structure, fragment size, and the relative abundance of competent avian WNV hosts and mosquito vectors. I used a combination of measurative and experimental research methods to address these objectives, the third of which was part of a collaborative interdisciplinary research grant. Vegetation structure was measured in 36 plots located in six forested wetlands and data loggers were used to monitor aboveground flooding. Avian and mosquito research teams coordinated  iii with my sampling points. My results illustrate the capacity for urban headwater wetlands to support a diverse flora, as well as the complex interactions between human activities and wetland structure and function. Red maple, oak, sweetgum, and green ash were the dominant tree species. Half of the 287 plant species identified only occurred at 1-2 sample points. Groundcover composition reflected the confluence of hydrogeomorphology, and past and present human actions. Connectivity via nearby streams or ditches had a greater impact on exotic plant richness than did wetland patch size. Aboveground flooding prior to seedling emergence significantly reduced the distribution of Japanese stiltgrass. Avian species richness was positively correlated with plant richness. In contrast, mosquito richness was negatively correlated to plant richness. WNV hosts and vector abundance both increased with maple (Acer spp.) tree canopy dominance. Cumulative host abundance averaged 24% and was composed primarily of American Robin, which showed large interannual shifts in fragments <15 ha. The relative abundance of competent vectors ranged from 5 to 26% and their populations demonstrated less interannual variation than were observed in the host populations.

TI  - Ecologies of the Passions in Early Modern English Tragedies
AU  - Biggie, Roya
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Ecologies of the Passions recovers a neglected model for understanding early modern relationality, one that turns the seemingly inward experience of emotion outward toward the environment. Drawing on early modern medical texts, I argue that the period’s dramatists imagine bodies as humorally vulnerable to other bodies, both human and nonhuman, within dynamically affective environments. As such, my project illustrates the intimate configurations of human and nonhuman life in early modern tragedies. Building upon recent work in the emerging fields of ecocriticism and affect theory, I argue that the period’s dramatic literature exposes the porous fluidity of the Galenic body—its embeddedness within ecologies composed of material objects, plant life, and other bodies. More specifically, through readings of tragedies by Thomas Kyd, William Shakespeare, John Webster, and John Ford, I show that early modern playwrights dramatize a bodily fragility that is simultaneously dangerous and productive. While scholars have drawn attention to the disciplinary and gendered implications of Galenic theories of embodiment, I argue that the period’s tragedies depict bodies extending beyond their contours and transforming through intimate entanglements with human and nonhuman life. As bodies open unto one another, forming affective channels through which the liquid passions move, they expose themselves to the sometimes tender and sometimes risky touches of the world and its inhabitants.Each chapter focuses on a different arrangement of bodies and examines how private experience brings individuals into contact with larger social and ecological networks. At the same time, I argue that the period’s medical texts, including Helkiah Crooke’s Mikrokosmographia  and Thomas Wright’s The Passions of the Minde, present the body as precariously and productively open to the exterior world. My first chapter orbits around questions of itinerant passions and disembodied sorrow in Kyd’s The Spanish Tragedy. I suggest that a disembodied understanding of sorrow inspires empathetic bonds, allowing the bereaved to merge with the deceased. In my second chapter, I argue for a conception of ecological sympathy in Shakespeare’s Titus Andronicus  through a focus on the elements, sylvan life, and interpersonal relations. Through examining the play’s interspecies relationships, I consider the possibilities and limitations of feeling for and with nonhuman life. Chapter Three explores the generative effects of mobile organs and parts in Webster’s The Duchess of Malfi. While the play acknowledges the risks involved in the lovers’ exchange of bodily parts, Webster illustrates the productive fertility of such openness by suggesting that moving organs culminate in the creation of hybrid flesh. My final chapter on Ford’s  The Broken Heart focuses on the dangers of ecological invasion. I argue that Ford engages with theories of infection and emotional contagion by dramatizing the affective movement of melancholy and the threat of corporeal permeability.

T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - River corridors have become important resources for the preservation of nature and habitat restoration of because they remain a continuous natural feature within urban landscapes. This study develops riverfront design principles to enhance habitats and species diversity, restore hydrological processes, and provide opportunities for human activities. The design principles are developed from an assessment of literature on waterfront design and landscape ecology, and a case study that integrates ecological and human concerns. The resulting principles were applied to a riverfront in Guelph, Ontario, to illustrate and understand their usefulness. Mitigation and restoration measures could be applied to enhance the ecological function of the riverfront. The principles were applied to re-establish the lost connectivity by enhancing vegetation on the riverbanks and part of the floodplain, and by removing barriers. In some sites, the principles could not be applied because of the presence of buildings. Their removal would represent a costly initiative and a loss of cultural landmarks. The design principles are considered useful for designers and planners because they have the potential to equip professionals with tools to establish and create healthier natural systems, while addressing human needs in riverfront environments.

TI  - Alien and native plants of urban river corridors: a study of riparian plant propagule dynamics along the river brent, greater london
AU  - Cockel, Christopher Paul
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - This thesis investigates the dynamics of alien and native plant propagules in relation to the standing vegetation of the urban riparian corridor of the River Brent, London and also experimental results regarding the effectiveness of physical management of Impatiens glandulifera, one of the most common riparian alien invasive species in the United Kingdom. The study has shown that viable plant propagules are well-distributed within the top 10 cm of urban riparian soils, with no significant difference in propagule abundance or species richness between 0-5 and 5-10 cm layers or with distance (0-1, 1-2, 2-3 m) from the low flow channel. Urban riparian propagule banks are as species rich as those in more rural situations, but they contain a greater proportion of alien species (>20%). Soil propagule abundance was greater in the autumn than in the spring but species richness varied little. The propagule bank species composition varied seasonally, more unique alien species being recorded in the spring than in the autumn. Using artificial turf traps placed within the riparian zone, the deposition of fluvial sediment and viable propagules was investigated. Significant correlations between sediment weight and propagule abundance and richness indicated the important role of hydrochory in delivering viable propagules to the riparian zone, particularly during winter. Lower sediment weight and propagule species richness of summer samples and weaker correlation between sediment weight and propagule abundance and richness indicated the importance of local seed-rain in summer. Comparison of species composition of the propagule bank and standing vegetation demonstrated little relationship between the two, with far greater abundance of alien species in the propagule bank, the majority of which were not found in the local vegetation. The propagule bank also contained more species with long-lived persistent seeds, than was observed in the standing vegetation. Impatiens glandulifera was the most frequently occurring species in the standing vegetation, while Buddleja davidii was the most frequently occurring species in the propagule bank. Investigating experimental plots, the study found a strong negative relationship between percent cover of Impatiens glandulifera and of other species. Experimental pruning and removal of Impatiens glandulifera at six-week intervals over two years had a marked positive effect upon vegetation species richness and the percent cover of other species, particularly on heavily invaded plots, with removal showing a stronger effect than pruning

TI  - An assessment of New Jersey trout production systems: A movement towards sustainability
AU  - Diglio, Luke J.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - New Jersey supports reproducing populations of three lotic salmonids. Only Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) are native and until approximately 100 years ago, were found in abundance throughout the northern part of the state. Presently, native populations have been documented in 115 streams or stream sections and declines are thought to be in response to anthropogenically originated environmental stressors. To evaluate the deterioration extent and assess numbers of breeding non-native Brown Trout (Salmo trutta) and Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), comparisons are made between sets of historical (1968–1977) and modern (2001–2010) young-of-the-year presence/absence and abundance data and several geologic and land use/land cover characteristics hypothesized to influence species’ occurrence. The range of reproducing Brown Trout populations have expanded, while groups of Rainbow and Brook Trout, as well as the overall amount of non-trout water have all decreased slightly. Results show that land use and land cover catchment value thresholds exist at < 12% agriculture, < 22% barren and urban, > 64% wetland and forest, and < 4-6% impervious cover to allow for natural Brook Trout reproduction. Values for Brown Trout reproduction include < 14% agriculture, < 27% barren and urban, > 58% wetland and forest, and < 5-7% impervious cover. Additionally, a previously undocumented Brook Trout metapopulation has been discovered with abundance estimates suggesting that a flourishing, reproductive and viable population is being maintained. Also, observed movement between connected waters allows for gene flow and overall isolation may permit the existence of one of New Jersey’s remaining relict Brook Trout groups. Conservation of the once endemic native species has become a regional priority and a review of current lotic salmonid management strategies has identified some practices that may undermine protection efforts. Suggestions to reverse declines and bolster unique populations include: 1) establishing a ‘Wild Native’ angling regulation, 2) creating stricter land use directives to support more natural flows, 3) curtailing or cessation of domestic salmonid stocking at larger catchment levels, 4) developing hatchery operation expansion to include indigenous origin fish, 5) removal of non-native fish from favorable standing within the State’s Wildlife Action Plan, and 6) obtaining new or reallocating current funds to support more research.

TI  - Structure and assembly of avian communities associated with black -tailed prairie dog ecosystems
AU  - Smith, Gregory Albert
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - I examined avian communities on the shortgrass plains and tested for associations with black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) towns. The black-tailed prairie dog is one of five members of the genus  Cynomys (Order Rodentia, Family Sciuridae) and is the only prairie dog species occurring in Oklahoma. Prairie dogs create and maintain a unique habitat by keeping vegetation clipped low to the ground and by construction of extensive, underground tunnel systems. Other species use dog towns as foraging sites, use burrows as dens or refugia from predators or severe weather, or use prairie dogs themselves as prey. Black-tailed prairie dogs have maintained a broad and relatively stable geographic range since the end of the Pleistocene and may have once covered from 40-100 million hectares. Today, they cover less than 5% of this area. The remaining towns are increasingly smaller, fragmented, and more isolated. I tested the hypothesis that black-tailed prairie dogs influence avian community structure on the shortgrass prairie and essentially function as ''islands'' in a sea of grass. I surveyed 36 prairie dog towns and 36 paired sites without prairie dogs during summer and fall of 1997, 1998, and 1999 in the Oklahoma Panhandle. Surveys totaled 9,040 individual observations for 73 avian species. Significantly distinct avian communities were present on prairie dog towns when compared to sites within four different macrohabitats of the surrounding landscape: open rangeland, scrub/sandsage (Artemisia filifolia) habitats, Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) plots, and fallow crop fields. Relative densities of all bird species combined was higher on prairie dog towns versus paired sites in summer and fall. Mean species richness of birds was significantly higher on prairie dog towns than paired sites during summer, but there were no significant differences in fall. Assemblages of avian communities differed significantly between prairie dog towns and the four macrohabitat types during summer. Burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia), killdeer ( Charadrius vociferous), horned larks (Eremophila alpestris ), and meadowlarks (Sturnella spp.) were positively and significantly associated with prairie dog towns during summer, while horned larks and ferruginous hawks (Buteo regalis) were significantly associated with prairie dog towns during fall. Richness was not significantly associated with town size or isolation. Richness was however associated with certain local habitat characteristics (percentage of forb coverage) and certain landscape-level variables (area of scrub habitat within 10 km of a focal town). Birds also show a strong geographic trend in richness, increasing significantly from west to east. These results are consistent with the emerging view that communities on relatively small islands are strongly influenced by characteristics of the surrounding landscape, variables other than area and isolation. It is clear that even in their current remnant state, black-tailed prairie dogs continue to play a significant role in the assembly of ecological communities across the Great Plains. Conservation of prairie dogs goes well beyond a single species, and is an important strategy for the preservation of the prairie ecosystem as a whole.

TI  - Climate Change, Species Range Expansion and the Institutional Response
AU  - Gilchrist, Anna Mary
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Climate change poses significant threats and opportunities to all life on Earth. Fundamental to the maintenance of biodiversity, in temperate latitudes, is the degree to which species can undergo range expansion to respond to poleward shifts in suitable climate space. However, in Europe, the ability of lowland species to achieve this may be impeded by the intensively managed and fragmented nature of the landscape, especially in heavily developed areas such as the Urban Mersey Basin Natural Area of North West England, the study area for this research. The thesis aims to further understanding of how species undergo range expansion in such situations, and through this to inform the development of possible adaptation strategies, and their integration into an effective institutional response. Butterflies are chosen as the indicator taxon because of their responsiveness to climate change and because their changing distribution through time has been logged very effectively in Britain by a national recording scheme. This data is used to explore the extent and regional variation of recent range expansion by 15 butterfly species through the British landmass. From this cohort, five generalist species are chosen for more detailed study within the Urban Mersey Basin. Data analyses showed that all five species have successfully extended their range through and beyond this area during the study period (1983-2004). However, the 'movement strategies' are distinctive between species. Two species (comma and speckled wood) were able to navigate successfully though the built up area, two were more associated with open land (purple hairstreak and gatekeeper) and one (small skipper) was intermediate. The analysis of distribution in relation to land cover and habitat type suggests that, for the more selective 'countryside' species, chains of interlinked habitat can provide effective 'movement corridors' or 'networks'. Corridor features within the landscape may impede or facilitate movement, depending on species ecology and behaviour. This knowledge was then applied to four specialist butterfly species, associated with woodland (2), grassland (1) and heathland (1) habitats. This analysis suggested that the availability of preferred habitat and species mobility will both influence potential for range expansion. To facilitate range expansion by specialists it is suggested that habitat specific networks need to be established through restoring, creating and extending habitat patches and by altering corridor management within and between these networks. Climate change adaptation for biodiversity in urbanised parts of lowland Britain should, it is argued, focus on the establishment of near continuous chains of high quality habitat, with strategic planning to 'engineer' effective connectivity for a range of habitat types. Whilst the policy framework at European, national and regional levels recognises the importance of increasing landscape connectivity in response to climate change, the thesis suggests that the facilitation of species range expansion, especially for 'specialists', will require more effective landscape planning and management at the sub-regional scale. This will need to involve a range of actors and agencies in a better targeted and more effectively coordinated response than is currently evident.

AB  - Landscape context can strongly influence wildlife disease incidence by precipitating shifts in host community structure and altering movement of hosts and vectors across the landscape. The black-tailed prairie dog ( Cynomys ludovicianus) has undergone significant population declines due to sylvatic plague (Yersinia pestis), and understanding the combined effects of human-mediated landscape change on disease dynamics and host demography are crucial for the conservation of this species. In this thesis, I investigated putative correlates between landscape structure and plague occurrence at prairie dog colonies in Boulder County, Colorado during the 2005 plague epizootic. I used AICc to evaluate the relative support of logistic regression models of plague occurrence, and predicted that disease occurrence would be negatively associated with streams, urbanization, water bodies, roads, and isolation from other plague-positive colonies. The best supported models of plague occurrence in this study included negative effects of urbanization, streams, isolation from plague positive colonies and positive effects of prairie dog colony cover, colony area, and water bodies at the 250m scale. Urban colonies were afforded some protection against plague, highlighting the importance of protecting urban colonies in Boulder County. In addition, I estimated prairie dog survival rates from 2003-2006 in Boulder County in order to investigate the short- and long-term effects of plague on prairie dog survivorship. Eight colonies infected with plague in 2005-06 suffered mortality rates exceeding 99%. Survival rates of prairie dogs in colonies founded since the 1994 plague epizootic were not significantly different from older colonies unaffected by plague in 1994, suggesting that demographic signals of plague events diminish over time. Finally, an investigation of prairie dog survivorship in relation to landscape and colony characteristics failed to uncover significant relationships between maximum survival estimates and measures of landscape composition, colony area, and prairie dog density, indicating that, in the absence of plague, landscape characteristics may be less important determinants of prairie dog survival than are patch-level characteristics. Taken together, these results underscore the ongoing threat plague presents to prairie dog populations in Boulder County, and suggest that the intervening landscape matrix plays a critical role in plague transmission by altering terrestrial animal movements.

TI  - Mind Playing Tricks: Individualism, Upward Mobility, and the Commitment to Self-Determination Among the Urban Poor
AU  - Bryerton, Will
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The ethos of the American Dream offers a popular and straightforward prescription for success: Work hard, rely on yourself before others, avoid bad choices, and prosperity will follow. It is a decidedly optimistic, largely undefined, and intensely individualistic promise with serious implications for Americans’ views on achievement and upward mobility. For all of these reasons, the validity of this ethos has come under attack. Philosophically, it is seen as illusory, ambiguous, and unrealistically demanding of individual exceptionalism. Sociologically, it is admonished for being too dismissive of structural constraints, systemic inequalities, and the value of relationships, social embeddedness, and mutual dependence.For the urban poor - facing down long histories of marginalization, reputations for cultural backwardness, and the harmful effects of concentrated poverty – the individualistic character of the American Dream poses an intriguing question: Does adherence to this ethos signify an assertive, “no excuses,” agency-affirming commitment to self-determination, or does it signify a seductive but quixotic pipe dream that allays feelings of failure, stagnation, and a lack of exposure to broader social contexts?This dissertation examines the concept of individualism among residents of a low-income, long disadvantaged urban community. Using participant observation and ethnographic fieldwork, I explore not just the meaning(s) of individualism but also its logical utility, or rationale as I call it, for explaining why and how so many residents insist that their efforts and good character will pay off - despite the abundance of evidence and public discourse that seem to suggest the contrary. On topics such as work ethic, employment, status, life chances, and social mobility, I observed residents of diverse backgrounds and social standings discussing their confrontations with community pitfalls, their aversions to contribute or succumb to surrounding misfortunes, and their visions of self-actualization in which their prospects were not seen as determined, shaped, or even limited by their experiences in the community. I deliberate upon these discussions to submit a view of individualism that is more heterogeneous than in the contemporary literature and that more accurately attests to the agency, aspirations, and rationality of a too often discredited population.

TI  - Biodiversity of Coastal Ecosystems: Exploring Spatial and Temporal Patterns in Intertidal Macroinvertebrate Communities of Sandy Beaches
AU  - Schooler, Nicholas Karraker
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Biodiversity plays a vital role in the function, stability, and resilience of ecosystems. Concern about biodiversity loss and the alteration of ecological communities has driven major efforts to catalog and monitor species in ecosystems across the globe and to quantify relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function. Evaluating responses of biodiversity and community structure to abiotic and biotic drivers, such as climate, disturbance, and species interactions requires comparisons across relevant spatial and temporal scales. Located at the boundary between land and sea, coastal ecosystems and the biodiversity they support are subject to increasing threats from escalating anthropogenic and climatic impacts. Sandy beach ecosystems, which support unique macroinvertebrate communities and provide irreplaceable ecosystem functions (e.g. nutrient recycling and wildlife support), experience heavy human use and manipulations making them particularly vulnerable to urbanization and environmental change. For temperate sandy beaches the degree of vulnerability is expected to vary with major trophic guilds due to differences in functional, trophic, and life history traits, with greater impacts expected for wrack-associated than lower beach species. To gain insights on mechanisms influencing ecological communities and functioning, I explored questions concerning responses of biodiversity, community structure, and composition of sandy beach ecosystems to environmental and anthropogenic factors operating over a range of temporal and spatial scales for my dissertation research. To evaluate these questions, we conducted 60 intertidal macroinvertebrate surveys at 41 study beaches spanning > 1800 km of California coastline (~9 degrees of latitude) from 2009–2015. These were the first quantitative surveys ever conducted at many of these beaches. In my first chapter, I addressed the important issue of comparing species richness across surveys conducted using different sampling methods by developing a calibration approach to adjust species richness for sampling effort. In my second chapter, I assessed the direction and magnitude of change in intertidal biodiversity over time by comparing values of species richness from surveys collected > 30 years apart (1970s and 2009–11) using the calibration from my first chapter. In my third chapter, I evaluated ecological impacts of coastal urbanization by comparing intertidal macroinvertebrate communities between urban beaches with intense maintenance regimes and reference beaches lacking such maintenance. In my final chapter, I evaluated spatial patterns in biodiversity, structure, and composition and the role of environmental factors in structuring intertidal macroinvertebrate communities of sandy beaches at different spatial scales. Overall, findings from my dissertation suggest sandy beaches are more diverse and biogeographically complex than generally acknowledged and that central and southern California beaches may represent a global biodiversity hotspot for intertidal macroinvertebrates. The peak in intertidal species richness of sandy beach macroinvertebrates in temperate latitudes is not consistent with the well-known pattern of a negative trend in species richness with latitude reported for a wide range of ecosystems and taxa. My results highlight the importance of connectivity to donor ecosystems and the strong influence of subsidies on intertidal macroinvertebrate communities of sandy beaches, particularly that of drift macroalgae on wrack-associated species. The functional, trophic, and life history traits of wrack-associated macroinvertebrates, a major component of intertidal diversity (> 40% of species), make this guild disproportionately vulnerable to human and climatic impacts compared with lower beach species. Human impacts associated with urbanization (e.g. mechanized grooming, sediment fills) strongly degraded intertidal macroinvertebrate biodiversity, structure, and function and appeared to influence sandy beach communities more at local than regional spatial scales. Though local scale processes masked the influence regional and global scale processes at most study beaches, we observed biodiversity declines consistent with habitat loss from sea-level rise.

TI  - Genomic and Ecological Dimensions of Malagasy Reptile and Amphibian Biodiversity
AU  - Kuhn, Arianna
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - A long history of isolation coupled with complex topographic and ecological landscapes makes Madagascar ideal for exploring the historical factors that have shaped patterns of population diversity and endemism. Many species-level studies have suggested Late Quaternary climate change may have influenced population dynamics in the tropics, but Madagascar’s ecologically unique biomes or individual species properties may have driven idiosyncratic responses to these shifts. Using community-scale population genetic data I implement a hierarchical approximate Bayesian computation (hABC) approach to evaluate the degree of synchronous population expansion during glacial cycles across herpetofaunal assemblages both within and across discrete biomes and taxonomic groups. I integrate results from Bayesian model averaging to identify whether intrinsic and extrinsic conditions played a role in driving individualistic demographic change. I find that demographic responses are not uniform across groups, with more than 50% of all populations showing signal of recent expansion. Our explanatory models indicate species occupying narrow elevational ranges had a higher probability of expansion, while amphibian assemblages showed higher genetic diversity and greater departures from population neutrality. Expansion events were largely asynchronous, with coexpansion found in less than half of all populations. Humid-restricted taxa are the exception to this trend, with around 69–74% of all populations coexpanding during the start of the Last Glacial Period at around 100 kya, supporting the hypothesis of a more extensive humid forest cover for Madagascar during this time. I show that exploration of trait and habitat-specific demographic processes is crucial to understanding and protecting the exceptional biotic richness and endemism found in Madagascar.In my second chapter, I use genomic data from population level sampling across the island’s snakes within a comparative statistical phylogeographic framework to investigate patterns of population structure and pulses of simultaneous demographic shifts for Madagascar’s pseudoxyrhophiine snakes to determine if demographic histories been individualistic or synchronous relative to Pleistocene climate change. I identified 21 populations with a high probability of recent expansion and 12 with a history of population bottleneck. I conducted a hierarchical Random Forest analysis to estimate the proportion of lineages experiencing synchronous demographic dynamics and the timing of these events. For expanding populations, I recovered a strong signal of synchronous expansion in the Late Pleistocene after the Last Glacial Maximum. Contracting lineages showed evidence of temporally concordant bottlenecks before the onset of widespread anthropogenic Holocene fire disruption, indicating historical climate was more important in structuring contemporary patterns of diversity. I find little evidence of geographic, ecological or taxonomic signal in population diversity estimates or probability of expansion. These results suggest that areas that promoted demographic stability are not shared among broadly distributed taxa, and instead demographic change in these populations is primarily influenced by localized habitat features and species interactions.Demographic processes like population expansion often result in events like population divergence that ultimately influence patterns of genetic diversity and richness. In my third chapter, I investigate previously proposed and novel hypotheses that address the historical processes driving these patterns on Madagascar. The many widespread lineages present in the snake fauna of the island span multiple landscape and climatic barriers and represent an unparalleled opportunity to investigate the origins of endemic diversity on the island. Using genome-wide sampling, I test whether these hypotheses explain phylogeographic patterns across four codistributed, endemic snake lineages widely distributed throughout Madagascar. I evaluated the performance of two advanced regression techniques, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) and Random Forest regression (RF) to estimate the timing of lineage divergence, migration, and historical demographic parameters of four species groups to highlight spatial and temporal patterns of differentiation. I find that GBM outperforms RF, but both approaches estimate divergence times for the most recent diversification events in the Mid to Late Pleistocene, when overall rates in speciation declined across Madagascar snakes. Divergence was coupled with low migration rates for all species groups examined here. For at least two species groups, I find strong evidence that both climatic stability, historical refugia, and current environmental gradients have jointly contributed to population divergence over time. For dispersal limited organisms with parapatric and sympatric distributions, Madagascar’s complex ecographic and topographic history may have contributed to rapid differentiation following extreme community turnover following glacial cycles in the Quaternary.

TI  - The Blackrock Yard: Reconsidering Transitional Landscapes of Infrastructure
AU  - Parylo, Jared
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The decline of industry has frequently lead to disinvestment into rail corridors in both the City of Buffalo and elsewhere throughout the United States and other First World countries. Rail companies and the industries they served historically used these rail corridors and immediately surrounding spaces, yet even after the decline of industry and disinvestment by rail companies, these spaces have continued to operate and function in ways unplanned for and largely uncontrolled by the official property owners and designers. After a large decline of rail use in these sites there were some initial overt and intentional and planned physical alterations, frequently including the physical demolition or removal of tracks, signals, switches, and storage units. Unplanned and undesigned alterations and occurrences, including natural (vegetation) regeneration, the proliferation of animal activity, and the increase in human activity, in the form of pedestrian, bicycle, and ATV travel throughout the site, can also be seen throughout many of these areas. Parts of the site are still active and facilitate active rail lines, but even where these “official” uses do not exist, there are well-maintained paths, and established and maintained trails, despite no grounds crew or maintenance staff. There are clearly defined spaces, despite there being no designer.These corridors are undefined but not abandoned spaces that are described by Ignasi de Solà-Morales Rubió as terrain vague, and operate separately from the defined and structured urban form around them. Despite their unofficial status and lack of widespread acknowledgment or recognition, these spaces continue to serve an important role to neighborhood residents, plant, and wildlife. The popularity and observed but largely undocumented busyness in these corridors stands is partly supported by new zoning codes and piecemeal planning in the City of Buffalo, but runs contrary to the residential development and exclusiveness uses occurring elsewhere in the city. Intentionally tentative and subtle interventions are proposed in and around these sites, with a primary focus on the Black Rock Yard in the northwest section of Buffalo. These interventions include access control and filtering structures and strategies coupled with branding and wayfinding, as well as observation and gathering structures located within the site, acting to further legitimize and offer a more defined sense of belonging to a diversity of site users. Further research will study the inherent equity of access these sites offer, as well more closely tied integration strategies connecting this site to the surrounding neighborhoods.

TI  - Habitat Associations and Occupancy Modeling of Marsh Birds in the Hudson Valley Region of Eastern New York
AU  - Jorgensen, Lauren A.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Populations of many North American marsh birds have declined over the past few decades, a trend commensurate with declines in wetland habitat area. Substantial declines in populations of breeding marsh bird species in New York State are associated with declines in wetland habitat area due to urbanization. The objective of this study was to examine what habitat and landscape features increase the probability of occupancy for nine target marsh bird species in New York State. This research was conducted in the Hudson River Valley region of Eastern New York, a region which is characterized by varied topography and geology, a diverse number of wetland habitat types, and which supports a rich fauna and flora. This region has also undergone high levels of natural habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation, due to encroachment by residential and commercial development. I evaluated marsh bird occupancy by conducting call-broadcast surveys at 173 randomly selected wetland points. Target species included six secretive birds, which rarely vocalize and are hard to detect: American Bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus ), Least Bittern (Ixobrychus exilis), King Rail (Rallus elegans), Pied-Billed Grebe (Podilymbus podiceps ), Sora (Porzana carolina), and Virginia Rail ( Rallus limicola). Due to the secretive nature of these species, existing monitoring programs have not adequately determined distributions of these marsh birds. Newly standardized methods at the national level have addressed the secretive nature of these birds. Three other target species were also evaluated, including Alder Flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum), Marsh Wren (Cistothorus palustris), and Swamp Sparrow ( Melospiza Georgiana). By implementing a standardized broadcast surveying method, marsh bird presence and absence can be more accurately determined. Surveys were conducted during the breeding season in New York, between the end of May and beginning of July of 2009. Two of the seven secretive marsh bird species were detected, as well as all three other target species, over the course of the study period. Habitat components that were evaluated included urban density, represented here as the percentage of four urban land use categories (open space, low density, medium density, and high density development) within a 3.14 km² buffer zone of each wetland, proximity to roads, wetland area, and vegetation cover type. Occupancy modeling was used to determine relationships between probability of detection and both survey methods and habitat features. Survey-specific variables correlated with detection varied with species, but occupancy model results suggest that wetland area was strongly correlated with 3 species; Virginia Rail, Alder Flycatcher, and Swamp Sparrow. Vegetation cover type was positively associated with occupancy for Virginia Rails, while urban density was negatively associated. Proximity to roads was negatively correlated with occupancy of Alder Flycatcher, while increasing wetland size was the only variable positively associated with Swamp Sparrow occupancy. Urbanization has been implicated as a primary factor in the reduction of mean wetland size, increase in wetland isolation, and degradation through pollution and other disturbances. However, variables associated with urbanization were not significant predictors of occupancy for this study. My results do suggest that larger wetlands are more attractive for a variety breeding marsh bird species. Wetland obligates, such as Virginia Rails, also chose nesting habitat based the spatial arrangement of emergent vegetation and open water. Conserving marsh birds amid urbanization may require more attention to protection of large, complex marsh habitats. However, given that this study was only conducted over one breeding season, longer term studies may be needed to better understand the relationship between urban factors and marsh bird declines in the Hudson Valley.

TI  - Conservation Status Of Lwafi Game Reserve, Tanzania
AU  - Martin, Andimile
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Rich in biodiversity, Tanzania's protected areas (PAs) are internationally recognized as of primary conservation value. Biodiversity loss continues, however, and limited understanding of ecological stocks and limited funding for management are making it harder to plan and carry out conservation activities.  Lwafi Game Reserve (GR) is an important part of the conservation network in western Tanzania that falls in the Katavi - Rukwa ecosystem in Rukwa Region, Tanzania. I examined the role of Lwafi GR in protecting wildlife and facilitating movements between Katavi National Park (NP) and Loasi and Kalambo Forest Reserves (FRs). In particular I assessed the abundance and distribution of Lwafi GR mammals, determined signs of movements of mammals between Lwafi GR and Loasi and Kalambo FRs and possibly further into Zambia, established and quantified threats to the survival of wildlife in Lwafi GR, and determined perceived and real boundaries of Lwafi GR.   My findings show that farming, hunting, logging and charcoal production take place inside and around the Reserves. Farming is dominant on the western boundaries especially adjacent to Loasi and Kalambo FRs both inside and around the border of the Reserves. The intensity of livestock incursion is similar between the eastern and western sides of the Reserves, but livestock graze more around the border on the western side than the eastern side of the Reserves. Additionally, I find that the distance from village settlements to the Reserves is much more important in determining the occurrence of human activities inside and around the PAs than the distance to town/market.     For the ecological part of the study, I found 38 species of mammals in the surveyed area. The mammals are more abundant in the northern part of Lwafi GR (Lyazumbi - Kabwe and Kakoma - Ninde transects) than in the south (Namanyere - Kipili, China - Wampembe and King'ombe - Kala transects).  The presence of some species declined with the distance from the nearest village center, some increased, and others did not change. Most of the species that showed a decline - eland (Taurotragus oryx), giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), impala (Aepyceros melampus), hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus), roan (Hippotragus equinus ), blue duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia), and dik dik (Madoqua kirkii) - could be attributed to hunting since they are consumed by locals; however some edible species did not demonstrate this trend. These species include buffalo (Syncerus caffer), bush buck (Tragelaphus scriptus), klipspringer (Oreotragus oreotragus) and bush rat (Thryonomys). Generally species including elephant (Loxodonta africana) were found throughout Lwafi GR with some declines towards the southern part of the GR, possibly due to the availability of food, shelter and cover. In particular, species such as African palm civet (Nandinia binotata), bush duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia), lion (Panthera leo), reedbuck (Redunca arundinum), sable antelope (Hippotragus niger), sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekii), topi ( Damaliscus korrigum) and zebra (Equus quagga),were seen in Lwafi GR only in the dry season and disappeared in the wet season. These species either migrated to Katavi NP during the wet season or are less detectable during that time.    I conclude that Lwafi GR is facing acute anthropogenic pressures. Additionally, Lwafi GR is an important depository for wildlife and a potential area for developing tourism; the presence of carnivores such as lion, aardvark ( Orycteropus afer), black-backed Jackal (Canis mesomelas ), leopard (Panthera pardus), and wild dog (Lycaon pictus) can offer a special attraction to tourists. This could be complimented by Kalambo Falls at the Tanzania - Zambia border.   I suggest that the Tanzania government should consider enlarging the size of Lwafi GR and that the Mahale - Katavi corridor be upgraded to a Wildlife Management Area (WMA), a status that ensures management by local people. Finally, there should be periodic ecological surveys in order to have long-term records on animal as well as other biodiversity in Lwafi GR. With regard to connectivity to Zambia's PAs, I suggest that wildlife authorities on both sides consider the protection of a wildlife corridor to Nsumbu NP in Zambia.  (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

TI  - Genetic structure in Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus): An assessment using multiple markers
AU  - Caballero, Isabel C.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - This thesis explores mating system, effects of reintroductions, and worldwide population structure of the Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus). The following chapters are based on a set of questions focused on different spatial and geographical scales, making use of nuclear and mitochondrial data to address these questions.Chapter 1: This chapter focuses on why birds make good subjects for these kinds of studies, why genetic data is used to reveal geographical patterns in widespread species, and the use of genetic data to validate subspecies designations. I present case studies highlighting the use of both mitochondrial DNA, the marker of choice for phylogeographic studies, and nuclear markers, which are used in population and landscape genetics. I describe my study species, the Peregrine Falcon, a cosmopolitan top-order predator which has faced several ecological and human generated factors that shaped population distribution and stability.Chapter 2:  I investigate the breeding and dispersal patterns in urban-dwelling reintroduced Midwestern Peregrine Falcons using molecular tools. Data for eleven microsatellite DNA markers, including eight newly developed for the species, were gathered from a total of 282 chicks and 68 additional birds from nine Midwestern cities representing 20 nest sites, with most extensive sampling from Chicago. I found high nest site fidelity, long-term mate fidelity, and two instances of extra-pair paternity. Field observations suggest that males preferred to breed close to their natal site, but this behavior left no clear genetic signal. My results are in accordance with previous findings for other raptors that genetic monogamy is the rule and nest site fidelity is frequent.Chapter 3: This chapter starts with an historical review of the extirpated Midwestern Peregrine, the nature of the recovery and how the reintroduced population successfully recovered. Samples included museum specimens ( n= 32, collected 1881-1963) representing the Midwestern-Eastern historical population, and contemporary samples (n=80, collected 1986-2009) from the recovered urban Midwestern population. I detected differences in levels of genetic diversity for both periods. Average observed heterozygosity was significantly lower for the historical population while haplotype and nucleotide diversity were significantly higher for the historical population. Bayesian clustering analysis of microsatellite data revealed a genotypic shift between historical and contemporary populations. The cause of this shift is likely the result of the use of non-native stock in the recovery process. Chapter 4: I found genetic differentiation among populations, and similar levels of genetic diversity across regions. Microsatellite data separate Western Peregrines into three distinct genetic clusters: (i) Channel Islands and Southern California; ii) Northern California and Oregon; and iii) Washington. These genetic patterns were concordant with previous ecological modeling studies. My results do not support the hypothesis that different management techniques have left an imprint on these recovered populations, but there is genetic structure consistent with the original groups on which management plans were focused.Chapter 5: This chapter focuses on understanding how Peregrines evolved such a wide-ranging distribution and how changes in migratory behavior or breeding dispersal have led to the formation of a distinct population structure. Two alternative hypotheses of range expansion and colonization are considered, Isolation by Distance, and Suspension of Migration. Genetic results based on 11 microsatellite loci show low to medium degree of genetic differentiation among northern hemisphere Peregrines while significant differentiation was observed between northern migrants and southern residents in both Old and New World. Mitochondrial control region data reveals a similar picture with lack of differentiation between northern Peregrines and significant differentiation between northern and southern populations.

TI  - Reproductive and Migration Ecology of Breeding and Wintering Northern Harriers (Circus hudsonius) in Suisun Marsh, California
AU  - Skalos, Shannon Marie
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Management and conservation plans often lack adequate data about population estimates, habitat selection, reproductive ecology, and even migration ecology of migratory species. Migratory and understudied birds, like Northern Harriers (Circus hudsonius), are no exception. The Northern Harrier is a widespread but declining North American raptor species that specializes in wetland and grassland habitats. They are a secretive raptor species with a unique combination of behavioral adaptations, like ground nesting, avoidance of urban development and human disturbance, and avoidance of traditional raptor trapping techniques, that make them challenging to study. Recent advances in technology, like the miniaturization of GPS/GSM transmitters, can greatly improve management and conservation of Northern Harriers and help fill knowledge gaps about their ecology and behavior across their range.The first challenge to studying Northern Harriers was finding efficient trapping techniques to capture an adequate sample size of individuals for transmitter deployment. In Chapter 1, we developed modified and novel trapping techniques for wintering and breeding Northern Harriers. First, we reviewed and tested successful trapping techniques from other Northern Harrier breeding populations. The most widely used technique in other populations was the use of a live or taxidermy mounted owl near a nest surrounded by mistnets or dho-gazas, which facilitates capture by eliciting an aggressive response by the breeding pair. Surprisingly, none of the published techniques were successful in our population, leading to the development of a new technique. We had the highest success flushing adult females into two dho-gazas placed in a “V” formation around the nest, a method that was modified from capturing nesting American Bitterns (Botaurus lentiginosus). Most females did not show behavioral responses to net placement at the nest and continued provisioning nestlings without visible stress or alarm calling. Unlike the use of an owl lure, our technique allows for passive capture with minimal disturbance to nesting birds. However, because this technique does not elicit an aggressive response, adult males are not amenable to capture with this technique. Winter trapping is typically not attempted for Northern Harriers because they rarely respond to traditional methods like bal-chatri traps baited with live lure birds or small mammals. Noose carpets can work well, but also result in incidental capture of multiple birds or different raptor species simultaneously, leading to potential injuries of captured birds. Knowing that Northern Harriers are scavengers of dead waterbirds in winter wetland habitats, we used remote-triggered bow nets baited with waterbird carcasses to capture wintering birds. This novel trapping technique was overwhelmingly successful, with nearly 80 individual birds captured across three winter trapping seasons. This technique also allows for targeted capture of individual birds, eliminating the risk of capturing multiple birds or non-target species. Our research suggests that trapping techniques are not necessarily universal across populations, and careful consideration of behavior and life history traits can improve targeted research for species like Northern Harriers.Equipped with the trapping techniques developed in Chapter 1, we studied the habitat selection of breeding adult female Northern Harriers across multiple spatial scales in Suisun Marsh, California, in Chapter 2. We measured fine-scale microhabitat characteristics at nests, extracted macrohabitat characteristics across the landscape, and examined breeding home range habitat selection in adult female Northern Harriers captured at the nest and equipped with GPS/GSM transmitters. At the microhabitat scale we found that Northern Harriers select tall emergent and terrestrial vegetation, which is consistent with habitat selection studies in populations across their range. This result also suggests a selection for both marsh habitat and upland habitat for nest sites. Specific to Suisun Marsh, we found that Northern Harriers also have a high probability of selecting nest sites with California Rose (Rosa californicus). Macrohabitat selection consisted of nest placement ~ 100 m from water and revealed an avoidance of shrub vegetation. These results combined indicate a selection for vegetation structure and nest placement in vegetation that provides protection from mammalian predators. A subset of nests on the Grizzly Island Wildlife area avoided nest placement near all-terrain vehicle (ATV) tracks, and spatially clustered nests revealing additional adaptations for predator and disturbance avoidance as well as semicolonial nesting behavior. Small mammal densities had no effect on nest site selection, despite the known importance of small mammals, particularly voles, on Northern Harrier reproductive success. Lastly, we found that adult females had a significantly higher probability of wetland habitat use over any other habitat type even as home ranges expanded, and females foraged farther from nest sites across the nesting season. Our results inform habitat managers to maintain tall, undisturbed vegetation in both upland and marsh habitats while ensuring dry areas for nest sites are available with complex vegetation and habitat structure, like California Rose and nearby water, to provide protection from mammalian predators.Chapter 3 builds on the research from Chapter 2 and examines the effects of multi-scale habitat characteristics on nest survival using logistic-exposure models. We found apparent nest success was relatively low (40%) compared to nest survival in populations across the Northern Harrier range, but Mayfield’s nest survival was similar to nests in Suisun Marsh three decades ago. Despite similar survival rates, the number of nests and nest density has declined over the past three decades, revealing a declining population with already low nest success. High spring small mammal densities had a positive effect on nest survival, and high summer small mammal density increased the number of fledglings. However, the California Vole (Microtus californicus) population is alarmingly low in Suisun Marsh compared to historical observations. Voles are an important prey species and improving their abundance could improve harrier nest survival and increase the breeding population in Suisun Marsh. Our results also show that a high proportion of live vegetation and the presence of residual vegetation at the nest are important microhabitat characteristics that influenced nest survival. Further, nests closer to California Rose also had higher nest survival, which is consistent with nest site selection determined in Chapter 2. Lastly, nest survival was highest in managed marsh habitat, despite potential selection for tidal marsh habitat. Lower nest survival in tidal marsh habitat may result from inappropriate habitat structure and extreme flooding events that could be exacerbated by sea level rise in the future. Restoring tidal marsh to large, contiguous habitat patches with numerous smaller channels to better diffuse the effects of high tides across the tidal plane could reduce nest flooding for harriers and other sensitive tidal marsh species in Suisun Marsh. Chapter 4 focuses on migration ecology of Northern Harriers wintering in Suisun Marsh. Using the winter trapping techniques developed in Chapter 1, we marked adult females with GPS/GSM transmitters in this first study of Northern Harrier migration ecology and habitat selection across their annual cycle. We recorded a total of 18 spring and 11 fall complete (round-trip) and partial (one-way) migrations for 14 individual Northern Harriers and identified nest sites across five Western United States (AK, CA, ID, OR, WA). We also recorded the three longest-distance migrations for any Northern Harriers to date across two individuals breeding in Alaska, ranging from 13,000 to nearly 20,000 km traveled roundtrip. Of the 11 fall migrations recorded, all birds returned to Suisun Marsh, highlighting its importance in Northern Harrier wintering ecology in Western North America. Mean spring migration was shorter than mean fall migration by nearly two months, with fewer stopovers and a faster migration speed (~ 200 km d-1) suggesting strong selection pressure to reach the breeding grounds early to secure a mate and territory, and to increase reproductive success. Migration timing is generally consistent with known timing for this species from raptor migration monitoring stations across North America. Migration routes were primarily along central and eastern corridors through California, Washington, and Oregon, and generally continued along inland intermountain regions through British Columbia and into Alaska for long-distance migrants. Wetland habitat was the most consistently selected habitat type across the annual cycle, with grassland and shrubland habitat also selected at stopover locations, and cultivated habitat also selected during the winter. Though habitat selection varied across the annual cycle, many breeding areas and stopover locations occurred on protected state and federal lands, which provide a unique opportunity for focused management and conservation efforts for migratory Northern Harriers. Raptor migration monitoring and banding stations located throughout Western North America may be misaligned with Northern Harrier migration, leading to low detections and population estimates because migration occurred along corridors where migration monitoring and banding stations are not located. Focusing migration monitoring along wetland habitat corridors and increasing breeding population research could improve Northern Harrier management and conservation efforts.

TI  - Patterns of genetic variation in populations of the Asian longhorned beetle, Anoplophora glabripennis (Coleoptera:Cerambycidae), in Asia and North America
AU  - Carter, Maureen E.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Central to the study of invasive species is identifying source populations in their native ranges. Source populations of invasive species can provide important information about species life cycles, host use and species-specific predators and parasites which could be deployed in a biological control program.I describe the first isolation of SSR markers for the Asian longhorned beetle, Anoplophora glabripennis, a pest of forest trees in China and urban trees in North America and Europe. Ten markers were developed using FIASCO (Fast Isolation by AFLP of Sequences Containing Repeats) with an (AC)17 probe. An additional five markers were identified in expressed sequence tags found on the NCBI database. Twenty seven beetles from a population in Gansu Province, China were assayed. The number of alleles ranged from three to nine, with observed and expected heterozygosities of 0.07 to 0.79 and 0.30 to 0.78, respectively.I analyzed mitochondrial DNA haplotype frequencies and microsatellite allele frequencies to characterize phylogeographical patterns in potential source populations of A. glabripennis. The data indicate that, while there are some significant affiliations of beetles within a single population and among neighboring populations in China, a substantial amount of genetic admixture has occurred. This genetic admixture is likely due to recent reforestation efforts in China where beetles from previously isolated populations moved into new areas of abundant, susceptible and stressed resources leading to outbreak populations. I analyzed mitochondrial DNA sequence data of invasive populations of A. glabripennis in North America and Europe, and microsatellite allele frequency data of beetles from North America. The data show populations in New York, New Jersey and Toronto to have limited genetic diversity compared to populations in China, and suggest that separate introduction events were responsible for populations in New York, New Jersey, Toronto and at European sites. In contrast populations on Long Island were likely initiated by movement of beetles from New York City, perhaps on cut wood. Compared to other invasive populations in North America, amounts of genetic diversity in the Toronto population are smaller, likely indicating fewer numbers of founders of this population.

TI  - Effects of the urban matrix on avian assemblages in forest fragments
AU  - Smith, Ryan R.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Habitat loss due to anthropogenic development is one of the greatest threats to birds, particularly in urban and suburban areas. While it is clear that avian assemblages are adversely affected by unsuitable habitat in such situations, there is less known about which aspects of this type of development are the important ones affecting birds. In order to explore anthropogenic impacts on birds influenced by cities, I monitored bird diversity at 25 woodlot study sites in and around Fort Wayne, Indiana, over the course of a breeding season. Point counts were conducted in each site and visited 3 times to obtain a species richness list. Study sites were characterized by area, the area to perimeter ratio, percent canopy cover, and mid- and overstory vegetation. The identity, number, and size of the vegetation was measured. The landscape matrix around the sites was characterized by distance to woodlots larger than the site itself, and distance to rivers, lakes/ponds, and wetlands. To obtain measurements of the urban matrix, the densities of habitable structures, distances of roads, and volume of vehicle traffic were measured in 5 concentric buffers ranging from 100 m to 3 km distance from the site.  After removing collinear factors with variance inflation factors > 5, within each buffer size multiple linear regressions were chosen on the basis of best subsets analyses with all significant predictors. The models were ranked with Akaike Information Criterion with correction.  Log transformed site area appeared in every model and had the largest positive effect on woodland bird richness. Greater mean area of an individual stem and distance to rivers were also positive predictors of richness in the 300 m buffer model. The densities roads, buildings, and vehicles adversely affected richness. Roads adversely affected richness in the 100 m buffer model. The effect of buildings extended to 300 m and had the largest negative impact, while vehicles appeared in the 300 m and 3000 m buffer models. The effect of vehicles, likely an indication of the degree of site isolation, was present out to 3 km demonstrating that urban and suburban development influences deciduous woodlot birds in a large radius around the site.  The results from my study reinforce the findings from other researchers that site area is a very important factor for predicting bird diversity. Consequently, maintaining suitable habitat in patches of substantial size is the best way to aid birds. While of less importance but still of significance, forests with larger trees, associated with a forest’s age, should be maintained. The ramification of this is that forests must be left alone without removal of the larger trees in order to best provide for birds. Building development should be kept to at least 300 m from these patches as a greater density of habitable buildings nearer than this distance significantly caused a decrease in the bird richness. With these things in mind, site preservation for birds should focus on large mature sites surrounded by the least amount of urban development.

TI  - Testing Biogeographic Predictions Derived from Quaternary Island Connectivity Using Genomic Data from Mammals in the Southern Philippines
AU  - Olson, Karen V.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Island archipelagos have long piqued the attention of evolutionary biologists interested in biogeographical patterns implying processes of diversification in terrestrial vertebrates. One model island archipelago, the Philippines, has emerged as an ideal geographical theater for testing hypotheses related to a 30 year biogeographical paradigm, derived from climatic oscillations of the Pleistocene and species pump expectations. To test predictions from the Pleistocene Aggregate Island Complex (PAIC) Paradigm, we generated the first ever Rad-seq datasets of thousands of genomewide loci from forest mammals restricted to the southern portions of the archipelago. We used genomic population-level statistics and demographic model selection techniques to test assumptions of the PAIC Paradigm and predicted differences among focal taxa based on life history and ecological preferences. Predictably, our analyses revealed pronounced differences in historical population demographics of forest rodents and understory bats in terms of geographical structure of populations and gene flow among populations, suggesting taxon-specific response to climatic and environmental variation across recent evolutionary timescales. In contrast to previous inferences derived from single-locus phylogeography of the same populations, our new genomic data warn against uncritical assumptions of highly divergent, geographically structured island populations. They also suggest that individual, species-specific, idiosyncratic response of small forest mammal lineages to the geographical and environmental template may become more prevalent in structured island systems, in strong contrast to the popularly hypothesized shared mechanisms of diversification that have been so prevalent over the last century.

TI  - Genetic and Phenotypic Differentiation in Impatiens capensis Meerb. in Riverine Networks: Identifying Patterns and Potential Drivers of Gene Flow, Local Adaptation, and Inbreeding
AU  - Toczydlowski, Rachel Helen
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Anthropogenic activities continue to erode and fragment habitats, creating a patchwork landscape that threatens the long‐term persistence of many populations and some species. Subsequent genetic isolation, low genetic variation, and small effective population sizes can increase inbreeding or otherwise limit adaptive potential of populations. However, genetic isolation can also facilitate local adaptation by restricting the introduction of maladapted alleles and homogenization of the regional gene pool. In this dissertation, I seek to understand how gene flow, adaptive divergence, and inbreeding interact in natural populations subject to habitat fragmentation. I studied patterns of phenotypic and molecular genetic variation and divergence within and among populations of Impatiens capensis, a common, native, annual herb with a mixed mating system. I focused on 12 populations occurring in small, remnant, floodplain forests, marshes, and lowland forests that were surrounded by an agricultural/urban matrix. These study populations were nested within four river systems divided between two major watersheds in Wisconsin, USA. I genotyped 24-25 individuals in each population at 12,856 SNPs using genotyping-by-sequencing to characterize patterns of molecular genetic differentiation among these populations and identified potential landscape drivers of differentiation. Genetic isolation and drift appear to play a strong role in structuring these populations. Limited gene flow may occur along rivers, but overall population differentiation was high (FST = 0.32). Population-level inbreeding (FIS = 0.2–0.9) was higher in smaller, more isolated populations. I next investigated how plasticity and potentially adaptive genetic differentiation interact to drive patterns of phenotypic differentiation by comparing morphological and reproductive traits of maternal plants within wild populations to those of their self-fertilized progeny grown in a common garden. Populations showed strong phenotypic divergence in their home environments but converged considerably in the common garden. Nevertheless, differences in morphology, survival, and reproduction remained. Phenotypic differentiation covaried with environmental gradients in expected ways suggesting both adaptive plasticity and local adaptation. Finally, I studied how maternal and progeny fitness relate to variation in individual, maternal, and population-level inbreeding. Progeny from chasmogamous seeds (CH – potentially outcrossed) were larger and produced more seed capsules than progeny from cleistogamous seeds (CL – selfed) in the common garden demonstrating inbreeding depression. In outbred populations, reproductive output increased with maternal heterozygosity, as expected, but this relationship reversed in more inbred populations, both for mothers in their home environments and for their progeny in the common garden. These results suggest inbred I. capensis populations have only a limited capacity to purge (or fully fix) their genetic load. In rapidly changing environments, species must migrate or genetically adapt. Habitat fragmentation limits both processes, potentially compromising the ability of species to persist in fragmented landscapes.

TI  - Relative Habitat Use, Occupancy, and Species Richness of Bats across the Gradient of Urbanization in an Arid Region
AU  - Dwyer, Jessie M.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urbanization is a primary driver of ecological change and occurs across a gradient from low- to high- density development. Wildlife species can exhibit different responses to urbanization, with some species being more sensitive than others. Further, wildlife communities can exhibit varying patterns of species richness across the gradient of urbanization, where species richness can either decrease linearly or peak at intermediate levels of urbanization, consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH). For chapter one, the objective was to evaluate the response of bats to urbanization across seasons. It was predicted that bat species would exhibit different responses to urbanization and that bats would increase use of urbanized areas in the summer season, where food and water resources were assumed to be greater. For chapter two, the objective was to evaluate species richness of bats across the gradient of urbanization in the summer season. Species richness of bats was predicted to either decrease linearly or peak at moderate levels of urban intensity. To test these hypotheses, 50 sites across the gradient of urbanization were sampled during four seasons using stationary acoustic bat monitors. Fourteen bat species were identified during 1000 nightly occasions. Consistent with chapter one predictions, bat species exhibited different responses to urbanization, with most bats being sensitive to urbanization. Counter to predictions, most bats did not appear to shift their response to urbanization across seasons. However, two bats (i.e., big brown bat and Yuma myotis) exhibited higher use of urbanized areas in the summer compared to other seasons. Consistent with chapter two predictions, species richness of bats decreased with increasing urban intensity. Results from this study demonstrate that most bats in the community were sensitive to urbanization, which is potentially related to species traits and has important conservation implications. First, it is likely important to maintain high-quality undeveloped habitat with low anthropogenic disturbance in wildland areas for species that are sensitive to urbanization and to maximize species richness. In addition, for bats that are tolerant of urbanization and to increase species richness in urbanized areas, it is likely important to preserve resources in urbanized areas and increase landscape connectivity.

TI  - Environmental filtering of wild bee assemblages in New York City parks and community gardens
AU  - Alamoudi, Alaa
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Evidence suggests that bee declines are occurring on a global scale. One contributing factor to these declines may be habitat loss and fragmentation associated with urbanization. Using bee abundance data from New York City parks and gardens, I examined how bee communities are partitioned within this large metropolitan area by looking at environment filters at the landscape and local scales. At the landscape scale, I examined factors that differentiate bee communities between parks and gardens by constructing a mitochondrial coxl-based phylogeny; clades were characterized based on their association with habitat type and functional traits for each species were overlain on the phylogeny to examine patterns of ecological clustering. At the local scale, I investigated environmental factors (i.e., available sunlight, floral diversity, garden size and surrounding green space) that might influence bee diversity patterns among community gardens. I performed multiple regression analyses to identify models which best explained differences in bee abundance, richness and diversity. At the landscape level, species commonly found in parks tended to be soil nesting species that emerge as adults in early spring. Species associated with gardens were more commonly cavity nesters or oligoleges of plants commonly found in community gardens. At the local scale, bee abundance was primarily influenced by available sunlight, whereas richness and diversity were influenced by a combination of sunlight, floral diversity and surrounding green space. We suggest that efforts to conserve bees in cities should consider issues related to sunlight availability, suitable nesting resources, and habitat connectivity.

AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorBiodiversity conservation is a global focus, and biodiversity assessment is the basis of the biodiversity assessment and management. To obtain precisebiodiversity information is a foundation of scientific decision-making for biodiversity conservation. The broadscale biodiversity assessment has alread-y become an urgent problem in the study and administration of biodiversi-ty. In this paper, we will search the literature and establish the species data, analyze the global regional biodiversity assessment in conservation imp-ortance, make up the biodiversity assessment index system and the compr-ehensive biodiversity assessment method on the Beibu Gulf area of the Hainan province, so, we can do the biodiversity assessment of the Beibu Gulf of Hainan. Finally, according to the results of the assessment and the development plan of Beibu Gulf of Hainan, we can give out the pertinently advice and measures about the biodiversity conservation in the Beibu Gulf area of the Hainan Province. The results were as follows: 1. After the research of the home and abroad regional biodiversity assessment in conservation importance, we formulate the biodiversity assessment index system of the Beibu Gulf area of the Hainan province, including six indicators: species richness consisted by the wild higher animals and plants species richness, diversity of ecosystem types, completeness of vertical stratification of vegetation, endemism, extent of threatened species and extent of alien species invasion. 2. Through the comprehensive biodiversity assessment method, we can obtain the results of the biodiversity conservation in the Beibu Gulf area of the Hainan province by county level; at last, the assessment results were classified into three grades. Changjiang, Ledong is the classⅠmeaning boast highly rich in biodiversity of the assessment as the highly rich not only in species and diversity of ecosystem types, but the endemism and the extent of threatened species; the biodiversity index(BI) is Ledong>Changjiang. Haikou, Danzhou and Dongfang is classⅡ what is boast quite high biodiversity as the quite high rich not only in diversity of ecosystem types and species, but the endemism and the extent of threatened species; and they have somewhere highly rich in species. Chengmai and Lingao have moderate biodiversity with the moderate rich with class Ⅲ on behalf of diversity of ecosystem types and species, including the endemism and the extent of threatened species; and they have somewhere moderate rich in species, the BI is Chengmai>and Lingao. These data are consistent with the actual biodiversity status, and generally reflect the distribution of biodiversity in Beibu Gulf area of the Hainan province. 3. On the basis of the results of the assessment and the development plan of Beibu Gulf of Hainan, we can make out the pertinently advice and measures about the biodiversity conservation in the Beibu Gulf area of the Hainan Province. The primary measures are as follows: to carry out the investigation of biodiversity in the Beibu Gulf area of the Hainan province. Biodiversity impact assessment and ecological compensation are needed in the Beibu Gulf area of the Hainan especially in the West Industial Corridor including Lingao, Danzhou, Changjiang, Dongfang. We should enhance the precaution and remedy about the alien species invasion especially in the Chengmai and Lingao which are developed under agriculture.

AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorWith the rapid development of the national economic society, hydropower construction also gets a rapid development. At the same time, environment problems caused by hydropower construction cannot be underestimated, such as effects to hydrological, effects to aquatic ecosystem, effects of construction, effects of the reservoir storage, effects of the operation, effects of the cascade development, and so on. After years of unremitting efforts, countermeasure research of the environmental impact for hydropower development has made some preliminary achievements. But when it comes to some of the ecologically sensitive zone,we still unable to put forward targeted countermeasures. Based on investigation to the natural ecological environment of the area, this thesis conducts a detailed analysis of environmental issues due to the construction of Angu Hydropower Station. At the same time, a systematic study to environmental protection measures for restoration of ecological functions of wetlands is also conducted. The purpose of this thesis is to provide a reference for the solution of ecological problems that caused by hydropower projects in ecologically sensitive areas across the country. Angu Hydropower Station of Dadu River, with a hybrid development approach, is located in Leshan City, Sichuan Province. This thesis firstly gives an overview to the project, then takes a systematic analysis to the natural conditions, development of the socio-economic, and the ecological environment of the field. The results show that the station located in the area with large population, more developed economies, strong human disturbances and seasonal flooded wetlands. The area is the typical region of artificial interference with strong agricultural wetlands, does not belong to the wetlands of International Importance, and does not belong to the wetlands with state protection. The thesis also takes a systematic analysis on the environmental impact to the areas for the construction of Angu hydropower station. The results show that the biggest impaction happens to the topography, the ecosystems, the structure and function of the wetlands. For example, the reservoir inundation, construction, backfilling create land and land use change in its topography; After the completion of the island station node flow will further shifting alliances, the river hydrological regime of wetlands changes; Project impact wetland vegetation types evolved to drought or water logging type of riparian vegetation; Also of amphibians, reptiles habitat and natural landscape works of certain impact areas, and many other issues. Therefore, combine the Angu hydropower station's construction area requirements of the actual situation and the State Environmental Protection. In this thesis, optimization of engineering plans, build connectivity engineering measures, and implementation of wetland restoration three aspects, give the typical countermeasure for environmental protection of these ecologically sensitive areas. By optimizing the engineering program to reduce the area, to reduce the project impact wetlands directly occupied; Construction connection mechanical control measure, let-down ecological flow rate, to ensure that wetlands and river left bank weeks wetland connectivity and integrity of the system; With the late resettlement project, implementation of wetland restoration engineering, remodeling micro-topography for the downstream floodway, Restore rivers in the region of typical wetland ecosystems and other countermeasures. This article analyzes that, the project environmental protection measures by taking the above greatly reduces the level of the rivers of this construction of the wetland ecosystem. And through artificial restoration measures, can improve species diversity of wetland ecosystems and biomass, thereby enhancing the ecological functions of wetlands.

TI  - Response of waterbird communities to habitat and landscape structure along an urban gradient in Phoenix, Arizona
AU  - Burnette, Riley
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urban riparian corridors have the capacity to maintain high levels of abundance and biodiversity. Additionally, urban rivers also offer environmental amenities and can be catalysts for social and economic revitalization in human communities. Despite its importance for both humans and wildlife, blue space in cities used by waterbirds has received relatively little focus in urban bird studies. My principal objective was to determine how urbanization and water availability affect waterbird biodiversity in an arid city. I surveyed 36 transects stratified across a gradient of urbanization and water availability along the Salt River, a LTER long-term study system located in Phoenix, Arizona. Water physiognomy (shape and size) was the largest factor in shaping the bird community. Connectivity was an important element for waterbird diversity, but not abundance. Urbanization had guild-specific effects on abundance but was not important for waterbird diversity. Habitat-level environmental characteristics were more important than land use on waterbird abundance, as well as diversity. Diving and fish-eating birds were positively associated with large open bodies of water, whereas dabbling ducks, wading birds, and marsh species favored areas with large amounts of shoreline and emergent vegetation. My study supports that Phoenix blue space offers an important subsidy to migrating waterbird communities; while alternative habitat is not a replacement, it is important to consider as part of the larger conservation picture as traditional wetlands decline. Additionally, arid cities have the potential to support high levels of waterbird biodiversity, heterogeneous land use matrix can be advantageous in supporting regional diversity, and waterbirds are tolerant of urbanization if proper resources are provided via the habitat. The implications of this study are particularly relevant to urban planning in arid cities; Phoenix alone contains over 1,400 bodies of water, offering the opportunity to design and improve urban blue space to optimize potential habitat while providing public amenities.

TI  - Movement Patterns in the Southern Flying Squirrel (Glaucomys volans) in Urbanized and Rural Environments
AU  - Howard, Jeremy
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - As the human population continues to grow, urbanization and expansion continue into untouched areas causing fragmentation of forests. Fragmentation restructures a landscape and impacts a variety of flora and fauna, including small mammals. Fitness effects on small mammals caused by forest fragmentation is nuanced, but is negative overall. The New World flying squirrels (genus Glaucomys) in particular, with their direct link to forest trees for food, shelter, and travel, make a good model to understand the effects of fragmentation on forest mammals. This study examined the southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans) in urban and rural fragments in southwestern Illinois. Urban study sites were the three forest patches on the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) campus: Bluebell Woods, Sweet William Woods, and the Western Corridor. The rural study site is privately-owned land north of Edwardsville, IL (McCracken Woods). Squirrels were collared and tracked using radio-telemetry both nocturnally and diurnally. Nighttime tracking was done to establish home range sizes. Daytime tracking was used to determine nesting tree preference. It was predicted that (1) home range sizes will be greater for males than females, (2) trees selected for nesting will be predominantly hard mast trees and (3) of larger size (diameter), and (4) squirrel dispersal will be limited between patches. Home ranges were determined via two methods: 95% minimum convex polygon and 95% kernel estimator. A two-sample equal variance t-test was used to determine differences in male and female home range sizes. General comparisons for home range sizes were also done for site as well as in the context of other studies. Nesting tree preferences for hard mast vs. soft mast were tested via Fisher’s exact test.  Nesting tree diameter size preferences were tested via a Chi-Squared Goodness-of-Fit test. Gap crossing potential was determined via trigonometric calculations. Male squirrel home range sizes were not significantly different from female home range sizes. The minimum convex polygon (MCP) approach indicated squirrels on the SIUE campus had smaller home range sizes than those in McCracken Woods. The 95% kernel density estimator (KDE) indicated no difference among sites. Home ranges in the study were among the lowest described for both MCP and KDE. Low home range estimates may be due in part to some squirrels having a low number of observations (minimum = 5). Flying squirrels selected soft mast trees for nesting significantly more than expected. This preference may be due to greater cavity availability or food source seasonality. Tree size preferences were found to be significant in regard to medium and large trees (> 40 cm diameter) versus small trees (< 40 cm diameter). The finding of larger tree usage was consistent with most other studies. Finally, one male flying squirrel was found to cross between forest patches on the SIUE campus. This dispersal event involved crossing from the Western Corridor to Sweet William Woods through a gap bisected by a road. The most likely route was via a peninsula of trees that extended outward from the Western Corridor. This gap could have been crossed successfully through the air by flying squirrels with near average glide angles. Fire resistant tree plantings should occur to encourage successful crossing by more squirrels. Such a course of action will aid in reconnecting fragmented habitat patches for southern flying squirrels within the campus area. This study on movement patterns in southern flying squirrels in fragmented habitat can inform management practices throughout Illinois with potential benefits for other forest species.

TI  - Narrating the Industrial City: Intellectuals and the Italian Economic Boom (1955-1965)
AU  - Gillen, Samantha
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - From the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s, the Italian economy underwent a massive economic boom that propelled Italy from the labeling of a “backwards” agrarian nation to a competitor on the international market. Exports skyrocketed as millions flocked to the industrial city, leaving behind their roots—both the literal crops nurtured for generations, and the connections that built families and sustained and social bonds. My dissertation explores the visual and literary culture of the so-called “miracle” years – in particular, the ways in which this culture represented the workers’ experience and the newly industrialized (often anonymous) spaces – to reinterpret the role of artists and intellectuals in confronting contemporaneity. Through industrial novelists Italo Calvino, Luciano Bianciardi, Paolo Volponi, and Ottiero Ottieri, I investigate the diversity of perspectives and the convergence toward criticism of the industrial age found in literature of the late 1950s and early 1960s, cultural and literary periodicals, and Michelangelo Antonioni’s cinematic tetralogy of the early 1960s.I argue that the industrial space (cities, factories, workspaces) should be considered a focal point in studying literature of the economic boom and it is through this urban lens that literary protagonists understand their new lives. I expand the image of the economic boom by showing how preestablished dichotomies like the city/countryside, natural/mechanical, North/South, industry/agriculture, public/private, integration/alienation, and harmony/disharmony are more nuanced than their contradictions suggest. I also show how the industrial space provokes feelings of alienation and isolation not only in the working class, but in the intellectual as well, who also becomes a “worker” that must bend to the will of the system he claims to resent. In studying industrial literature and how intellectuals represented industrialized spaces in their texts, I delve into several other fields of inquiry, including environmental studies, urbanism, cultural studies, phenomenology, affect studies, and media studies. I begin through the wide lens of environmental theory and socio-spatial relationships and conclude on the interior of the petrochemical plant that looms over Antonioni’s Ravenna in Il deserto rosso (1964). My dissertation thus merges intellectual writers, their semi-autobiographical protagonists, and the expanding urban world to show how the culture of these years was shaped by the omnipresent, industrial space.

TI  - Moving People for Tigers: Resettlement, Food Security and Landscape-Level Conservation in Central India
AU  - Neelakantan, Amrita
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Resettlement of humans from protected areas conserves habitats for wildlife. However, impacts of resettlement on the well-being of resettled communities and on broader conservation goals at the landscape level have been poorly quantified until now due to inadequate documentation and baseline information. Recent documentation and advances in measurements of human well-being enable studies that examine the impacts of resettlement for both people and conservation. In India, the current standardized resettlement policy by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) is explicit in its goal to create inviolate habitats for tigers within protected areas. More than 70% of the global tiger population lives in protected areas in India. The central Indian national parks hold approximately 40% of Indian tiger populations. Implementation of the NTCA policy provides an opportunity to study resettlement with relatively accurate records of where resettled households moved, a standardized monetary compensation and the potential for replication with large representative groups to study impacts in various landscapes across the country. This dissertation focuses on resettlement in Kanha National Park in central India, one of the most well-known and oldest tiger reserves in the country. The Kanha National Park (KNP) landscape mirrors the realities of many people-park interactions in human-dominated areas with high percentages of indigenous human populations, historical forced displacements, and current resettlements that follow a standardized national policy. From a conservation point of view, connectivity between KNP and other protected areas across central India is crucial for genetically healthy tiger populations. This dissertation consists of three analyses that combine data from field surveys and existing data sources to examine the impacts of resettlement on food security, landscape connectivity for wildlife, and human-wildlife conflict in the KNP landscape. In Chapter 1, I use household surveys to compare the food security and livelihood associations of resettled households compared to their non-resettled neighbors at new settlement locations. I show that resettled households have similar availability and access to foods as their non-resettled neighbors. Increases in off-farm income sources are associated with higher food access for all households. In Chapter 2, I explore the pattern of low food access in the KNP landscape using the five capitals model for sustainable development to illustrate significant associations between livelihood factors and household food access. Salaried stable incomes and kitchen garden diversity are significantly associated with higher food access. Financial capital dwarfs the contributions of social and natural capitals which have supplementary roles in times of financial stress. In Chapter 3, I address resettlement impacts on habitat connectivity between protected areas and human-wildlife conflict that resettled households face after relocating outside the park. Resettled households are not disproportionately moving into corridors between protected areas, especially when compared to the manifold more non-resettled households already residing in these areas. Resettled households however are moving into areas of high human-wildlife conflict due to their continued proximity to KNP. Outcomes from Chapter 3 also confirm that steady incomes can alleviate forest use and lower human activities in forests reducing human-wildlife conflict. In human-dominated landscapes such as KNP, financial capital and the stability of household incomes can aid both food security, lower pressures on non-protected forests and potentially lower human-wildlife conflict. The results counter assumptions that resettled communities continue to follow traditional natural resource reliant livelihoods. Local populations are not likely to engage in livelihoods that are heavily reliant on natural resources as rural populations become integrated into urban economies.  The results from this dissertation imply that managers in the KNP landscape can alleviate food security and aid landscape wide conservation goals by increasing off-farm salaried incomes. Finally, in India, there is a high potential for replication of this study around other protected areas, with nationally standardized resettlement in landscapes that vary geographically, ecologically and socially.

TI  - Ant and spider dynamics in complex riverine landscapes of the Scioto River basin, Ohio: Implications for riparian ecosystem structure and function
AU  - Tagwireyi, Paradzayi
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - In recent years, a holistic ecosystem conceptualization has emerged that structurally and functionally links the river, and its riparian and floodplain zones into an integrated ecological unit—the riverine landscape. The array of riverine landscapes distributed across a river system represents biophysical complexity over broad spatial and temporal scales. Internal riverine landscape patchiness (e.g., gravel bars, mudflats, swamps, etc.), on the other hand, represents heterogeneity at finer spatiotemporal scales. Collectively, an understanding of environmental drivers and consequences of riverine landscape patch dynamics is critical to both basic riverine science as well as to management and conservation efforts. However, despite the well-documented importance of river corridors (e.g., as biological refuges in human-modified landscapes), the role of riverine landscape pattern and composition on ecosystem structure and function is largely unknown. In this dissertation, I worked at 12 study reaches distributed along an urban-rural gradient of the Scioto River, Ohio, USA. To better understand environmental drivers of riverine landscape distribution and physical heterogeneity, I investigated the influence of internal (river size, lateral flow connectivity) and external (catchment land use and land cover) factors on site-specific riverine landscape patterns. At a finer scale, I used riparian spiders of the family Tetragnathidae and ants as model organisms to explore the associations between internal riverine landscape patchiness and the distribution, diversity, and trophic dynamics [e.g., trophic position (TP)] of riparian arthropod communities. Because of a growing recognition of the importance of aquatic-to-terrestrial energetic subsidies (largely in the form of aquatic insects that emerge from the water as adults) to riparian and terrestrial food webs, I gave particular consideration to the reliance of aquatic carbon [C (CA)] of riparian spiders and ants. Riverine landscape patchiness was measured using a combination of field (vegetation surveys, canopy photography, shoreline habitat measurements) and remote-sensing approaches [e.g., using a GIS, aerial photos, and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data]. Ants and spiders were surveyed on each side of the river at each study reach. A suite of analytical methods were used including Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), linear regression, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modeling, a model-selection approach using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS). I found that a mixture of external and internal factors were associated with riverine landscape pattern (patch area and shape and size) including drainage area (a proxy for ecosystem size), proximity to impoundment (a proxy for lateral flow connectivity), and catchment land use and land cover (e.g., % urban, % agriculture). Percent impervious surfaces in the catchment, for instance, was strongly related to more convoluted patch shapes in the riverine landscape. Riparian ant density and diversity were highly variable along the urban-rural gradient. Agricultural riverine landscapes exhibited lower ant density but elevated ant diversity. Patch area, edge, and shape emerged as important predictors of ant diversity whereas patch composition, as well as patch area, edge, and patch density were strongly related to ant density. However, MaxEnt modeling indicated that patch-type influenced ant habitat choice less than gradients in distance from surface water. Patch composition was strongly associated, with TP and CA of ants (Formica subsericea) greatest at crop patches (TP = 1.79, CA = 91%). I observed that both terrestrial (habitat) and aquatic (emergent insect food resources) were important environmental determinants of riparian tetragnathid distribution, trophic dynamics, and the capacity of spiders to ecologically link aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. For example, tetragnathid TP, which averaged 2.45 across all study reaches, was largely driven by emergent insect density. For both ants and spiders, CA was positively related to TP (R2 = 0.14 for ants, R2 = 0.48 for spiders), suggesting that algal-based energy pathways contribute to more complex riparian food webs. Collectively, these findings indicate that patchiness in riverine landscapes exerts strong influences on the distribution, diversity, and trophic dynamics of riparian arthropod consumers. Additionally, my results contribute to a growing understanding of the impacts of landscape change in river corridors, and suggest that integrating conservation efforts at both broad (e.g., catchment) and fine scales (e.g., the aquatic-terrestrial interface) will be an important step in maintaining diverse, functional river-riparian ecosystems. In particular, I found that urbanization is likely to prompt changes in riverine landscape structure as well as arthropod distribution, diversity, and trophic structure. Because these findings provide evidence that spatial habitat patterns within riverine landscapes can influence the structure and functions of riparian ecosystems, they also lend insight into the utility of landscape ecology to river science.

TI  - Small mammal communities and functional connectivity in the Lower Rio Grande Valley: A landscape perspective
AU  - Dolman, Richard William
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are major threats to global biodiversity, negatively affecting all major taxonomic groups. To mitigate these effects, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service manages three refuges in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of southern Texas with 1 goal of serving as a wildlife corridor connecting the Gulf coast with Falcon Reservoir. Since its creation in 1979, the LRGV National Wildlife Refuge (LRGVNWR) has grown to include 146 individual tracts, totaling about 44,500 ha primarily along the Rio Grande. The refuge offers the ability to conduct research in an increasingly common landscape pattern, a mosaic composed of native/restored habitat fragmented by agricultural and urbanized land use. My study first examined how aspects of the habitat and landscape influenced small mammal diversity in LRGV refuge tracts. I live-trapped small mammals in 14 refuge tracts and calculated standard diversity indices from the resulting captures. Of 5,115 total captures, 49.7% were white-footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus) and hispid cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus ), representing 2 of 4 species statistically shown to prefer edge habitat. Although this demonstrated refuge lands were dominated by edge-adapted species, comparison to previous studies from within the refuge revealed a decrease in magnitude of their domination. Canonical redundancy analysis identified the amount of habitat available within 500 m of capture sites and average vegetation density within 150 m as important landscape features contributing to occurrence of small mammal species. These results demonstrated that the refuges in the LRGV are achieving their main goals to restore and maintain habitat. Secondly, I examined effects of agricultural and urban fragmentation on genetic diversity and structure in populations of P. leucopus from 5 refuge tracts in the LRGV. Low nucleotide diversity combined with high haplotype diversity indicated a time of low effective population size of white-footed mice followed by recent population expansion. Localized population structuring suggested that P. leucopus was unable to effectively disperse through areas dominated by urbanization, while agricultural matrix offered no resistance. These results highlight the importance of preferentially acquiring and restoring land in areas dominated by an agricultural matrix to protect small mammal species from future urban encroachment.

TI  - Long-term Effects of Fire Hazard Reduction Treatments in the Southern Cascades and Northern Sierra Nevada, California
AU  - Chiono, Lindsay Aney
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Treating wildland fuels to reduce wildfire hazards has become a primary focus of contemporary forest management, particularly in the wildland-urban interface. The specific objectives of treatment are diverse, but in general, treatments address accumulated surface fuels, the fuel ladders that carry fire into the forest canopy, and surface and canopy fuel continuity.  This dissertation uses a chronosequence of treated stands to examine the temporal influence of treatment on forest structure, the understory plant community, and wildfire hazard.  The first chapter examines the effects of fuels reduction treatment on stand structure, overstory species composition, and ground and surface fuels. The stand structures and reduced surface fuel loads created by fuels modification are temporary, yet few studies have assessed the lifespan of treatment effects. The structural legacies of treatment were still present in the oldest treatment sites. Treatments reduced site occupancy (stand density and basal area) and increased quadratic mean diameter by approximately 50%. The contribution of shade-tolerant true firs to stand density was also reduced by treatment. Other stand characteristics, particularly timelag fuel loads, seedling density, and shrub cover, exhibited substantial variability, and differences between treatment age classes and between treatment and control groups were not statistically significant.   The second chapter evaluates fuel treatment longevity based on potential wildfire behavior and effects on vegetation. Forest managers must divide scarce resources between fuel treatment maintenance, which is necessary to retain low hazard conditions in treated stands, and the construction of new treatments. Yet the most basic questions concerning the lifespan of treatment effectiveness have rarely been engaged in the literature. In this study, field-gathered fuels and vegetation data were used to aid fuel model selection and to parameterize a fire behavior and effects model, Fuels Management Analyst Plus. In addition, a semi-qualitative, semi-quantitative protocol was applied to assess ladder fuel hazard in field sampling plots. Untreated sites exhibited fire behavior that would challenge wildfire suppression efforts, and projected overstory mortality was considerable. In contrast, estimated fire behavior and severity were low to moderate in even the oldest fuel treatments, those sampled 8-26 years after treatment implementation. Findings indicate that in the forest types characteristic of the northern Sierra Nevada and southern Cascades, treatments for wildfire hazard reduction retain their effectiveness for more than 10-15 years and possibly beyond a quarter century.  Fuel treatment activities disturb the forest floor, increase resource availability, and may introduce non-native plant propagules to forest stands. Non-native plant invasions can have profound consequences for ecosystem structure and function. For these reasons, there is concern that treatment for fire hazard reduction may promote invasion by exotic species. Several short-term studies have shown small increases in non-native abundance as a result of treatment, but the long-term effects have rarely been addressed in the literature. The final chapter examines treatment effects on the understory plant community and on cover of the forest floor, as mineral soil exposure has been linked to invasion. Regression tree analysis provided insights into the influence of treatment and site characteristics on these variables. Treatments increased forb and graminoid cover, but temporal trends in abundance were opposite. An initial increase in forb cover in the most recently treated sites was followed by a gradual decline, while mean graminoid cover was highest in the oldest treatments. Shrubs dominated live plant abundance. Shrub cover showed few temporal trends, but was negatively associated with canopy cover. Mineral soil exposure was increased by treatment and declined slowly over time, remaining elevated in the oldest treatments. Non-native plant species were very rare in the treatment sites sampled in this study. Despite the availability of bare mineral soil and the proximity of transportation corridors, a source of non-native propagules, non-natives were recorded in only 2% of sampling plots. This study suggests that forest disturbance associated with treatment for hazardous fuels reduction may not produce significant invasions in these forest types.  (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

TI  - Influence of a highly interactive species upon bird diversity within a gradient of urbanization
AU  - Salamack, Kristin A.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urbanization and subsequent habitat fragmentation have significantly reduced the range of the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus ). Studies suggest that prairie dogs are highly interactive species that can influence bird species diversity, abundance, and richness. Past research was conducted on native prairie and few studies investigated whether this relationship exists in an urban/suburban setting. The landscape changes that reduced the prairie dog's range also impact bird species directly, resulting in habitat loss and isolation. I performed bird counts on 20 habitat fragments stratified along an urban gradient in the Denver metropolitan area to examine the influence of fragment area, isolation, and distance from city center on bird diversity measures. I used 12 fragments (six colonized by prairie dogs, six uncolonized by prairie dogs) in a paired study to determine whether the presence of prairie dogs influences bird diversity measures in an urban setting. Diversity measures were generally higher on colonized fragments for every season except winter; however, these trends were not statistically significant. Diversity measures for the paired study increased significantly with increasing area and increasing isolation. When I analyzed all 20 habitat fragments, I found that larger fragment area and fragments further from the city center exhibited significantly higher diversity measures in univariate models. I found that diversity measures were significantly higher on fragments that were older, larger, and had higher forb cover in multivariate models. Future biodiversity studies along the urban gradient in Denver should include an analysis of the matrix adjacent to habitat fragments and should employ better indices for estimating urbanization. Future studies of the role of prairie dogs as highly interactive species in urban systems should also include an analysis of other taxa.

TI  - Associations Between Hydrogeomorphic Characteristics and Biotic Community Dynamics in Urban Streams of Columbus, Ohio, USA
AU  - Rieck, Leslie Opal
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urbanization of watersheds leads to myriad changes to streams, including modified sediment and streamflow regimes that can result in altered fluvial geomorphic processes and channel structure. Hydrogeomorphic features have been linked to community composition of aquatic biota, as well as to stream ecosystem functioning. Biotic communities in urban stream ecosystems can be markedly different than their counterparts in more natural streams, often exhibiting reduced abundance, diversity, and shifts in assemblage composition, though the specific mechanisms through which urban land use and subsequent hydrogeomorphic modification effects these changes remain unresolved. Hydrogeomorphic modifications may impact both instream habitat as well as connectivity to the surrounding landscape, influencing both biotic assemblage composition as well as ecological connectivity between streams and their adjacent riparian zones. In 23 small urban stream reaches in the Columbus Metropolitan Area (CMA), Ohio, USA, I investigated potential linkages between urban-induced hydrogeomorphic characteristics and: (1) fish assemblage compositional changes over time (3-5 years); (2) fish assemblage trophic dynamics; (3) aquatic-to-terrestrial nutritional subsidies to a common riparian consumer (spiders of the family Tetragnathidae); and (4) downstream drift of larval macroinvertebrates in the water column.Hydrogeomorphic features related to instream habitat, the hydraulic environment (e.g., slope, shear stress, D50 [median bed sediment particle size]) and stream-floodplain connectivity (e.g., entrenchment ratio, sinuosity, incision ratio) emerged as common influences on fish assemblage composition and trophic dynamics, aquatic-terrestrial connectivity, and invertebrate drift. At a subset of 12 study reaches, several hydrogeomorphic variables showed significant changes over 3-5 years, with many decreasing (e.g., discharge [by 39%], slope [by 0.1%], and shear stress [by 29%, which decreased in concert with slope]). Fish assemblage evenness decreased over the study period in study reaches with higher incision ratio (t = 2.16, p = 0.039), accompanied by species-specific relationships with hydrogeomorphic characteristics. These findings explicitly link hydrogeomorphic and fish-community changes over time, showing that fluvial geomorphic forms in urban streams are not static, and can exert effects on fish assemblages over relatively short time periods, likely via shifts in instream habitat.In a wider suite of 23 study reaches, hydrogeomorphic characteristics – including slope and bankfull discharge – influenced fish-assemblage diversity (H’), density, and proportion of generalist foragers. Mean reliance on aquatically-derived energy (i.e., reliance on energy pathways derived from benthic algae) of Creek Chub (Semolitus atromaculatus) was 0.60, which increased with slope (Z = 2.27, p = 0.023), suggesting that channel gradient, a measure highly associated with shear stress, may moderate the relative abundance of autochthonous vs. allochthonous basal resources consumed by stream fish. Sunfish species (Lepomis cyanellus and L. macrochirus) relied on aquatically-derived energy for 0.62 of their nutrition, which was positively related to discharge (Z = 1.98, p = 0.048), suggesting an underlying mechanism of discharge-mediated bed disturbance as a control of basal resource availability. Hydrogeomorphic variables did not influence mean trophic position or food-chain length (FCL; ranging from 1.83-4.69 across all study reaches), which was more closely related to water nutrient concentrations (i.e., total N).Tetragnathid spider trophic position (x ̅ = 2.41) was negatively influenced by D50, while tetragnathid reliance on aquatically-derived energy (x ̅ = 0.43) trended positively with sinuosity (t = 2.10, p = 0.054), suggesting that tetragnathid spider trophic position is influenced by the impact of instream habitat on emergent aquatic insects, while aquatically-derived energy was more closely related to stream-floodplain connectivity. Tetragnathid density decreased with slope (t = -2.51, p = 0.023), as did the flux of emergent aquatic insects into the riparian zone (t = -2.27, p = 0.037). The relative abundance of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa in emergent aquatic insect assemblages was positively associated with sinuosity (t = 6.84, p< 0.001), potentially as a result of increased habitat heterogeneity and stream-floodplain connectivity.Larval macroinvertebrate drift was characterized by very low densities (x ̅ = 0.061 individuals m-3) relative to previous studies (but note that few urban studies of drift are available), with fewer than one-third of samples containing larval macroinvertebrates. The probability of a sample containing macroinvertebrates was positively associated with incision ratio (Z = 2.29, p = 0.022), while drift density trended with many hydrogeomorphic variables (e.g., entrenchment ratio [negative trend; Z = -1.9, p = 0.059], sinuosity [positive trend; Z = 1.91, p = 0.066]). Drift density was also highly influenced by chemical water quality and nutrients (e.g., t = 1.96, p = 0.059 with a water quality principal component axis largely driven by total N, total P, and total dissolved solids). Drift assemblage attributes (e.g., diversity [H’], family richness) were not related to any physico-chemical parameters, but rather to benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage characteristics (e.g., positive relationships between family richness and H’ [R2 = 0.11, F = 4.62, p = 0.038]; family richness and %EPT [R2 = 0.20, F = 9.52, p = 0.004]. Thus, a complex suite of factors appears to drive macroinvertebrate drift in urban streams, including degrees of entrenchment and sinuosity, implicating the important role stream-riparian connectivity and the potentially strong influences of terrestrial organic matter on benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages, which serve as the “source pool” available to enter the drift.Collectively, these results highlight how urban-land development cascades, through hydrologic and sediment-related alterations (e.g., discharge magnitude, shear stress), to impact physical channel (geomorphic) form (e.g., sinuosity, floodplain connectivity) and, in turn, instream habitat (e.g., D50, slope) and biotic community structure and function (e.g., assemblage composition, food-web architecture, and energy flows). An ecogeomorphic approach, such as the one adopted in my research is, therefore, well supported as an avenue toward further understanding and potentially restoring critical physical-biological processes that are key to forming and maintaining resilient urban stream ecosystems. Incorporating hydrogeomorphic surveys into management and restoration activities may thus lead to a more mechanistic understanding of the underlying sources of stream impairment in cities.

T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The impact of deforestation on the genetic structure of mouse lemurs is poorly understood. In this project, I assess deforestation of Madagascar’s terrestrial protected regions, quantify genomic wide genetic variation in two sympatric mouse lemurs, and evaluate the role of landscape structure in genetic relatedness patterns within two sympatric mouse lemur species. Overall deforestation rates across the 98 terrestrial protected areas in Madagascar are increasing, resulting in an average annual deforestation rate of 0.68% per year, with approximately 10,600 km2 lost between 2000 and 2019. In a comparison of relatedness patterns between the sympatric gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) and Mme. Berthe’s mouse lemur (M. berthae), M. murinus displays a greater background relatedness, but both species exhibit female philopatry. Even though Critically Endangered, the inbreeding and relatedness estimates of M. berthae are comparable to the least concern, M. murinus. The landscape variables, distance to nearest town and land cover, as measured by a vegetation index, were not found to influence genetic connectivity in either species. Overall, deforestation rates are accelerating in Madagascar’s protected areas, but may have only a small effect on genetic connectivity of mouse lemurs.

TI  - The effectiveness of urban space corridors in meeting recreational habitat and wildlife needs (BL)
AU  - Briffett, C.
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Urban space corridors can be defined as linear tracts of undeveloped, vegetated land located in city centres and suburbs that accommodate the recreational needs of human users and the refugia requirements of wildlife. This research study investigated the planning, design, use and management of urban corridors in many locations throughout the world.  The hypothesis selected for the study was to determine if managed recreational use is compatible with habitat conservation and wildlife occurrence in open space corridor systems. To do this detailed site based surveys were conducted in Singapore and many completed corridor systems in the United Kingdom were investigated for selection criteria, design parameters and management practices. Other locations and corridors schemes were also researched in the literature and site visits were made to Australia, New Zealand, South African and America. The partially completed island-wide network of park connectors in Singapore provided a suitable resource for an on site assessment of recreational use, bird occurrence and corridor maintenance and management.It was determined that there was strong public support for and enthusiastic use of corridor trails and that good opportunities were available for improving biodiversity. Whilst there is still doubt on the viability of corridor resources to act as conduits for wildlife they are effective as wildlife refuges subject to habitat design. In cases where corridors are narrow or even partially disconnected continuity of recreational trails is considered important to achieve. For wildlife, such as birds, their general mobility tends to overcome minor fragmentation effects. The importance of the matrix that comprises the surrounding land adjoining the corridors was established for wildlife (birds), especially where corridors are narrow or are closely encroached by densely built developments such as city centres. Compatibility between recreational use and bird occurrence was determined through the surveys and a comparative evaluative framework was devised for ten corridor locations in Singapore to include environment, habitat and maintenance characteristics.

AB  - As one of the most important ecological corridor, river has deep influence on bio-diversity, energy transferring, water recycle, etc. The urbanization undertaking in many cities in China has caused serious ecological crisis, especially in water ecology and water environment security. City lakes and rivers, polluted by large-scale manmade construction, are facing problems such as eutrophication, loss of wildlife habitats, and excessive reclamation, etc. On the other hand, the urban space, devoured by commerce, residence, office buildings, etc., is lack of public open space. With living standard improving, green space in city is needed more and more. Based on such background, the project is due to study the river ecological restoration and recreational development. According to the general urban planning of Wuhan in 2020 and the East Lake water system restoration planning, this project chooses the site between East Lake and Yangchun Lake. The site is in the urban-rural ecotone and is now facing the problem of urbanization. It has serious contradiction between ecological security and urban construction. The project is focused on dealing with the contradiction and combining ecological restoration and recreation together.Among the many elements influencing eco-system in the site, I focus on transportation because large traffic not only has very deep influence on wildlife habitats, physical environment and vegetation distribution, but also brings with manmade construction and urban development. So take control of transportation is to some extent limit the urbanization of this site. The project plans a wetland system to control the impact of traffic and turns the adjacent area of freeway into a recreational wetland park.

TI  - Leptospira spp. in California Peri-urban Wildlife
AU  - Straub, Mary Helen
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Leptospirosis is a re-emerging, potentially fatal zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp. spirochetes. Leptospirosis is one of the most common zoonotic diseases worldwide and though typically associated with tropical and developing countries, the disease is increasingly being reported in temperate and developed countries. Globally, a wide variety of mammals are known to carry pathogenic leptospires and shed the bacteria through their urine therefore serving as potential sources of infection to humans and other animals. In California, where cases of leptospirosis in humans and domestic animals are thought to be on the rise, little is known about Leptospira spp. in most species of wildlife.To increase the understanding of Leptospira spp. epidemiology and leptospirosis in California wildlife, we first undertook a state-wide survey of peri-urban wildlife species and assessed the presence of Leptospira spp. by serology and real-time PCR. Leptospira spp. diversity was evaluated by both serological and genetic methods. Next, we focused on the two very common peri-urban mammals, raccoons (Procyon lotor) and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) and investigated their role as potential reservoirs of Leptospira spp. in California. Lastly, we sought to understand the pathologic changes that are associated with Leptospira spp. infection California’s wild felids, mountain lions (Puma concolor) and bobcats (Lynx rufus).Though most commonly associated with rodents, particularly Rattus spp., Leptospira spp. infection has been documented in many species of mammals, both domestic and wild. We sampled 723 individual wild mammals from 12 species throughout California and estimated the PCR- and seroprevalence of Leptospira spp. infection and exposure. We also assessed the importance of potential risk factors for Leptospira spp. infection or exposure using simple and multivariable logistic regression models. The genetic relatedness of Leptospira strains found in California wildlife was assessed using the rrs2 gene, which identifies Leptospira to species level, as well as multilocus sequence typing (MLST) which uses seven genes to determine sequence type (ST) of a strain and allows for comparisons to strains deposited in the MLST database. We found a state-wide seroprevalence of 39% and a PCR-prevalence of 23%. Leptospira spp. infection or exposure was detected in all species and in all regions of California evaluated. In northern California, the Bay Area, and coastal and inland central California, the overall prevalence (i.e. animals that tested positive by either PCR, serology, or both) ranged between 39 and 45%, while southern California had the lowest overall prevalence (20%). Leptospira spp. infection or exposure was most common in western grey squirrels (Sciurus griseus) (56%) and least common in opossums (Didelphis virginiana) (9%). Coyotes (Canis latrans), striped skunks, raccoons, mountain lions, tree squirrels (Sciurus spp.), and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were all significantly more likely than opossums to show evidence of Leptospira spp. infection or exposure. Adult animals were more likely than juveniles to show evidence of Leptospira spp. infection or exposure (p < 0.0001). Geographic region, host species, host age class and host sex were included in a multivariable model as potential risk factors for Leptospira spp. infection or exposure and all were statistically significant. Antibodies against Leptospira interrogans serovar Pomona (serogroup Pomona) were most commonly detected overall and predominated in raccoons, striped skunks, coyotes, red foxes, bobcats and mountain lions. Antibodies against L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni (serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae), were next most commonly detected overall and predominated in grey foxes, opossums and all squirrel species. The rrs2 gene was successfully amplified and sequenced from 24 individuals from four species and all sequences were identified as L. interrogans. All seven loci from MLST scheme #1 were successfully amplified in 14 animals which included five raccoons, six striped skunks and two mountain lions and all were identified as ST 140. Our findings show that Leptospira spp. infection and exposure are common in a variety of peri-urban wildlife species throughout California. Though no DNA sequences were obtained from animals in which Copenhageni was the predominant serovar detected, we found strong evidence that at least two major Leptospira spp. serovars are circulating in California with likely partitioning among wildlife species.Raccoons and striped skunks are reported hosts of Leptospira spp. in several regions of North America though their importance as reservoirs of the pathogen is unknown in California. We used real-time PCR to assess the presence of pathogenic Leptospira spp. DNA in urine and kidney samples from 86 raccoons and 137 striped skunks from 17 California counties. The presence of leptospires in either the urine or kidneys was evaluated for associations with sex, age, region, and season of sampling using logistic regression. Cohen’s kappa coefficient (k) was calculated to assess the agreement between renal and urinary Leptospira spp. identified by PCR assays. PCR-positive striped skunks and raccoons were found in all regions evaluated with 26% of raccoons and 29% of striped skunks having pathogenic leptospiral DNA in their urine and/or kidneys. Prevalence in raccoons did not vary significantly by region, while skunks from the Central Valley and Bay Area of California were significantly more likely to be PCR-positive than were skunks from the Northern Coastal region. Adult skunks were significantly more likely to be PCR-positive than were juveniles. Cohen’s kappa coefficient was 0.443 between urine and renal tissue Leptospira spp. in raccoons and 0.415 in striped skunks indicating moderate agreement between the assays in both species. The sensitivity of renal tissue PCR was higher than that of urine PCR in both raccoons and striped skunks yet each assay failed to detect some animals that were carrying pathogenic leptospires, highlighting the importance of using multiple methods when performing surveillance for Leptospira spp. infection. Our findings show that Leptospira spp. infection is common and widespread in raccoons and striped skunks in California. We found that a substantial proportion of these two species are shedding leptospires into the environment highlighting the potential for these peridomestic mesocarnivores to act as sources of infection for both humans and domestic animals.California is home to two species of native wild felids - mountain lions (Puma concolor) and bobcats (Lynx rufus) - which, as top predators, play important roles in the functioning of ecosystems throughout the state. Various threats exist for both felid species, including genetic isolation, habitat loss and disease. One disease suspected to be of importance in California’s wild felids is leptospirosis. We sampled 136 mountain lions and 39 bobcats and using serology, real-time PCR and histology estimated the prevalence of Leptospira spp. infection and exposure, assessed the association between renal pathology and Leptospira spp. and also investigated the significance of several risk factors for both Leptospira spp. infection and exposure, and nephritis. Overall, 46% of mountain lions and 28% of bobcats were positive for Leptospira spp. exposure or infection by serology, PCR or both. Age-class and geographic location were significantly associated with Leptospira spp. in mountain lions, though not in bobcats. The most common serovar detected in both felid species was L. interrogans serovar Pomona. Nephritis, predominately interstitial and lymphocytic, was diagnosed in 39% of mountain lions and 16% of bobcats evaluated histologically and was highly significantly associated with Leptospira spp. infection or exposure in mountain lions (p < 0.0001) and bobcats (p = 0.003). Our results indicate that infection with Leptospira spp. should be considered common in California’s wild felids. Besides the possible threat to the health of the individual animals, infection by Leptospira spp. in these mountain lions and bobcats has important zoonotic disease implications for those who study or otherwise directly work with these species or their samples and tissues. Much more work remains to be done to determine the clinical significance of Leptospira spp. infection in these species and also to further understand the epidemiology of this pathogen in California as a whole.

AB  - This thesis describes conceptual and methodological work that aims to advance the science of modeling and mapping wildlife habitat in human-modified landscapes. First, I review how researchers have defined and measured the quality of wildlife habitat over the past four decades. I then demonstrate a new approach to quantifying habitat quality by modeling habitat for the federally endangered Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis, RCW) across the Onslow Bight, a one million hectare region of North Carolina's coastal plain. Next, I describe the development and operation of a GIS toolbox for ArcGIS 9.3, called "Connect", designed to help conservation practitioners incorporate habitat connectivity considerations into land management and land-use planning. In two stakeholder-driven case studies, I use the Connect tools to prioritize private land parcels for connectivity conservation in fragmented habitats around Fort Bragg, NC, and evaluate the effectiveness of a proposed corridor in promoting dispersal for RCW in the face of urban development.

TI  - Studies of Resurgent Bed Bugs: Population Genetic Structure, Impact of Aggregation on Development and Molecular Screening for  Bartonella
AU  - Saenz, Virna Lisa
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The recent resurgence of bed bugs (Cimex lectularius L.) has created an unprecedented demand for research on its biology. The main objectives of this dissertation research were to investigate several aspects of bed bug biology: infestation and dispersal dynamics at a large and small geographical scale using molecular markers, to determine the impact of aggregation on bed bug development and to screen bed bug populations for a re-emergent pathogen.First, we studied the infestation and dispersal dynamics of bed bugs at large geographical scale (e.g., across cities, states). Although bed bug infestations are on the rise, there is a poor understanding of their dispersal patterns and sources of infestation. We conducted a genetic study of 21 bed bug infestations from the eastern United States. We genotyped samples comprised of 8 - 10 individuals per infestation at nine polymorphic microsatellite loci. Despite high genetic diversity across all infestations, with 5 – 17 alleles per locus (mean = 10.3), we found low genetic diversity (1 – 4 alleles per locus) within all but one of the infestations. These results suggest that nearly all the studied infestations were started by a small propagule possibly consisting of a singly mated female and/or her progeny. All infestations were strongly genetically differentiated from each other (mean pairwise  FST between populations = 0.68) and we did not find strong evidence of a geographic pattern of structuring. The high level of genetic diversity across infestations from the eastern United States together with the lack of geographically organized structure is consistent with multiple introductions into the United States from foreign sources. This work is described in Chapter 2 and was published in the Journal of Medical Entomology in 2012.Second, we investigated dispersal and infestation dynamics of bed bugs at a fine geographical scale within three multistory apartment buildings: one from Raleigh, NC and two from Jersey City, NJ. Here we describe the development of 24 high resolution microsatellite markers and their application to elucidate infestation dynamics within three multistory apartment buildings in the United States. Results reveal contrasting characteristics potentially representative of geographic or locale differences. In Raleigh, NC, an infestation within an apartment building seemed to have started from a single introduction followed by extensive spread throughout the building. In Jersey City, NJ, two or more introductions followed by extensive spread. Populations within single apartments in all buildings showed low levels of genetic diversity suggesting that few individuals are starting these infestations, possibly a singly mated female or her progeny. This work is described in Chapter 3 and was published in the Journal of Medical Entomology in 2012.Third, we studied the impact of aggregation in bed bug development. Although it is well known that bed bugs live in aggregations, the adaptive benefits of this behavior are not well understood. In this study, we reared first instars either in isolation or in groups of five from hatching to adult eclosion and recorded their development time. Additionally, we investigated the effects of group-housing on same age nymphs versus nymphs reared with adults. Nymphal development was 2.2 d faster in grouped nymphs than in solitary-housed nymphs, representing 7.3% faster overall development. However, this grouping effect did not appear to be influenced by group composition (nymphs vs. adults). Thus, similar to other gregarious insect species, nymph development in bed bugs is faster in aggregations than in isolation. This work is described in Chapter 4.Fourth, we investigated the prevalence of a re-emergent bacterial pathogen in United States bed bugs populations. Because reports of both bed bugs and  Bartonella have been increasing in the United States, and because their host ranges can overlap, we investigated whether the resurgence of these two medically important species are linked by screening for Bartonella  spp. in bed bugs collected from geographic areas where these pathogens are prevalent. We screened a total of 331 bed bugs from 39 unique collections in 30 geographic locations in 13 states for Bartonella spp. DNA using a polymerase chain reaction assay targeting the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic transcribed spacer region. Bartonella spp. DNA was not amplified from any bed bug, but five bed bugs from four different units of an elderly housing building in North Carolina contained Burkholderia multivorans,  an important pathogen in nosocomial infections that was not previously linked to an arthropod vector. This work is described in Chapter 5.

TI  - Population estimates, habitat requirements, and landscape design and management for urban populations of the endemic Big Cypress fox squirrel (Sciurus niger avicennia)
AU  - Ditgen, Rebecca Selfridge
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The Big Cypress fox squirrel (Sciurus niger avicennia) is endemic to open forests of southwest Florida. Rare in wild lands of southwest Florida, its remains on certain golf courses in Lee and Collier counties. This study was carried out from August 1995 to December 1997 to document squirrel population levels in a variety of golf course landscapes, to determine habitat use and requirements of course populations, and to provide guidelines for favorable landscape design and management in developing areas. Elements of vegetation composition and structure, and landscape configuration were recorded at 60 golf courses. Counts of squirrels were made at each course to determine fox squirrel population levels. A Landscape Evaluation Index, developed from cluster and factor analyses of landscape elements, allowed ranking of the 60 courses in terms of their suitability for fox squirrels. Radio-telemetry was used to examine home range size, habitat use, and population dynamics at 1 high quality course and 1 lower quality course. Tracking studies indicated a density of 42.4–49.8 squirrels/km2 at Site 1 and a density of 6.3–8.2 squirrels/km2 at site 2. Squirrels fed heavily on pine and cypress from late summer to mid-winter, and relied on native and exotic species between March and May. At Site 2, squirrels showed a heavy reliance on feeders between January and July. The Index identified 7 courses with high quality landscapes. All were part of 36 hole courses, contained large stands of open pine and cypress, and had large contiguous areas free of automobile traffic. The remaining courses had unfavorable landscape elements: isolation within developed landscapes, small stands of undesirable species, heavy understory vegetation, and complex development patterns. Twenty-three courses offer little opportunity for habitat. Thirty courses can improve habitat for present fox squirrel residents, but do not contain the landscape features required for long-term populations. Landscape design and placement are crucial in creating and preserving fox squirrel habitat. Courses, or groups of courses, must contain large areas free of roadways and development to allow safer movement within large home ranges. Vegetation must include large stands of pine, cypress, cabbage palms, and associated native trees with open understories.

AU  - Ribeiro, Stefan Martins

AB  - Com o atual crescimento das populações humanas, principalmente em zonas urbanas, o crescimento das áreas urbanas atingiu proporções nunca antes vistas. Este processo tem levado à destruição e fragmentação dos habitats e, consequentemente, à criação de habitats com novas características. Existe, então, a necessidade de estudar o impacto que o crescimento urbano provoca nas populações selvagens existentes nesses locais (parques e jardins urbanos). Perceber quais são os fatores que modificam a densidade e diversidade das populações de mamíferos é essencial para selecionar politicas de gestão ao nível da conservação da biodiversidade. O presente estudo visa avaliar o nível de adaptação dos carnívoros presentes nos dois locais de estudo (Jardim Botânico da Universidade de Coimbra e Mata Nacional do Choupal), bem como a densidade dos micromamíferos (presas). A foto-armadilhagem, capturas de micromamíferos e a análise de excrementos foram as técnicas utilizadas para a realização deste estudo. Considerando os resultados obtidos nos dois locais, foram observados maiores valores de diversidade e densidade no Choupal (peri-urbano). O Jardim Botânico (urbano) tem baixos valores de densidade de micromamíferos e uma quase inexistência de carnívoros. Os resultados de densidade registados no Choupal permitiram perceber que os habitats urbanos podem possuir densidades mais altas comparativamente às obtidas em zonas rurais. Relativamente ao nicho ecológico, a maior sobreposição de nicho foi registada entre a raposa e o texugo, o que indica que estas espécies podem coexistir e dividir os recursos disponíveis.Conclui-se que a fragmentação nos habitats, provocada pelo desenvolvimento urbano, pode provocar isolamento e perda de recursos, afectando populações selvagens. Estas alterações irão provocar mudanças nas estruturas populacionais, causando diferenças na adaptação das diferentes espécies, o que poderá levar à perda de biodiversidade. São então necessários mais estudos em ecologia urbana, de forma a propor acções para mitigar estesefeitos, como por exemplo a criação de corredores ecológicos, para que se permita a movimentação das plantas e animais entre os diferentes fragmentos

La literatura ha descrito este proceso de "expansión urbana" como un fenómeno que está cambiando el paisaje por el incremento en el consumo del suelo, que a su vez ha originado un proceso de conurbación con los territorios y centros poblados aledaños, a modo de un crecimiento desbordado que ha llegado a sobrepasar los límites político-administrativos.Esta investigación, que se encuentra dentro del marco del proyecto Fondecyt- ANID/Chile Nº 1180268 y la beca Senescyt-Ecuador, para estudios de Doctorado convocatoria 2015, toma como caso de estudio Quito y su área de expansión urbana, bajo la visión de dos componentes: lo urbano y sus dinámicas funcionales y la modelación de su crecimiento. Plantea una nueva configuración metropolitana: la movilidad entre asentamientos humanos localizados en diferentes circunscripciones territoriales que, a su vez, permiten la configuración de corredores urbanos y la integración del territorio.También analiza los cambios de uso del suelo que se han producido en Quito y su área metropolitana en un período de 19 años, producto del crecimiento urbano, para lo cual utiliza herramientas y aplicaciones tecnológicas como los sistemas de información geográfica SIG, percepción remota y modelación. Además, y como componente principal, se determinan las fuerzas motrices impulsoras del crecimiento urbano, las demandas, restricciones y como principal entrada la consulta a los stakeholders, todo esto mediante el uso del modelo Dyna-CLUE para la creación de escenarios futuros al 2050. Estos escenarios de simulación urbana consideran una visión holística de las dinámicas de cambio de uso de suelo junto con las políticas de planificación; este caso de estudio anticipa cómo la expansión urbana consumirá áreas agrícolas y naturales, en un claro proceso de deterioro que en su mayoría es irreversible.El nuevo enfoque propuesto en esta investigación, permite plantear recomendaciones que ayuden en la planificación de las ciudades y reorienten las políticas públicas para lograr ciudades más inclusivas, sustentables y resilientes.

TI  - The Dispersal, Storage and Remobilisation of Heavy Metals in the River Aire Contaminated by Urban and Industrial Wastes
AU  - Dawson, Emma Joanne
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Industrial and urban activities in the Leeds catchment of the River Aire have caused the widespread dispersal and contamination by a variety of pollutants, including heavy metals. This contamination is reflected by enhanced metal concentrations in the sediments and soils of the river and floodplain. The cycling of sediment and associated metals in the fluvial environment is highly related to hydrological, geomorphological and chemical phenomena. The main research objective is to investigate quantitatively the dispersal, storage and remobilisation of heavy metals in the Leeds reach of the River Aire. A wide variety of relevant processes are analysed. Metal pollution studies have often neglected urban and industrial catchments, where sources of pollutants to the river channel are diverse. In the past, heavy metals have entered the river from industrial activities, sewage disposal and coal combustion. The main present source of metals is the disposal of domestic and industrial effluent from sewage treatment works. The fluvial dispersal of wastes has caused enhanced concentrations of heavy metals in aquatic sediment and floodplain soils. This results in long-term storage of metals in river corridors and poses problems as sediments act as a source of contaminants long after pollution of the fluvial system has been abated. The pollution problem is most severe immediately downstream of sewage treatment works, through the city centre, where traffic and industrial density is greatest and where floodplains are frequently inundated with floodwaters. Heavy metals are not necessarily permanently fixed by the sediment and can be remobilised through mechanical, chemical and biological processes, affecting surface and groundwater quality and plant animal and human health. However, it is not the total amount of a metal stored in sediment, but how it is actually bound that is important in assessing its environmental impact. Results suggest that a significant proportion of each metal is held in a potentially mobile and bioavailable form, particularly cadmium. The data collected is used to compile mass budgets of sediments and associated metals for the alluvial area of the River Aire in Leeds.

AB  - O rio Leça tem uma bacia hidrográfica de 307.600 hectares sendo uma das linhas de água mais importantes da Área Metropolitana do Porto (AMP). Atravessa os concelhos de Santo Tirso, Valongo, Maia e Matosinhos, tendo o seu vale ocupação milenar, pelo que é alvo de contínua transformação, refletindo-se na paisagem do vale do Leça, a cada momento, a expressão no território da sociedade.A mobilidade é um dos fatores que mais contribui para a qualidade de vida na cidade. A mobilidade sustentável é hoje entendida como crucial para a sustentação das dinâmicas sociais e económicas da vida urbana. É nesta perspetiva que se considera ser necessário criar uma estrutura intermodal que atenda às necessidades de uso diário da população, sem descurar o recreio e o turismo e que atenda à compatibilização das características multifuncionais das deslocações e ao carácter da paisagem fluvial antrópica do rio Leça.Nestes termos, considera-se ser necessário definir um percurso destinado a ciclistas e peões ao longo do vale do rio Leça no concelho de Matosinhos, no entendimento de que este percurso contribuirá para a mobilidade sustentável no município, e que integrará também a preservação das áreas com elevado valor ecológico, cultural e paisagístico. Pretende-se que o percurso ao longo do Leça contribua para o reforço da identidade deste curso de água.Neste sentido propõe-se a definição do Corredor Verde Fluvial do Leça que incluirá o percurso pedonal, ciclovia, margens do rio leça e interligações com a paisagem do vale e estruturas de mobilidade, numa proposta que visa consolidar as estratégias de mobilidade e de implementação de corredores verdes do concelho, promovendo-se a mobilidade sustentável e a Estrutura Ecológica Municipal.O programa a desenvolver para o Corredor Verde Fluvial do Leça atenderá à requalificação das margens do rio Leça atendendo à recuperação das funções ecológicas e à valorização do património histórico, cultural e natural presente na paisagem.

TI  - The effects of urbanization and road development on carnivores in Southern California
AU  - Alonso, Robert Scott
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Habitat destruction and degradation is a serious threat to biodiversity, and urbanization and road development are driving factors in habitat loss. As the human footprint continues to expand, the natural landscape becomes increasingly fragmented and human development can create barriers to wildlife movement and gene flow. Carnivores in particular are sensitive to fragmentation and may be used as model animals for understanding how roads and urbanization can fragment wildlife populations. In this thesis, I investigate the effects of urbanization and road development on carnivores in southern California. Since southern California is one of the most populous areas of the country, coupled with high biodiversity, it is a unique area to study the effects of road development and urbanization on carnivores.  In the first chapter, I estimate the density of bobcats in a coastal reserve isolated by urbanization using mark-recapture and mark-resight techniques with camera trap data. The use of camera trap data to estimate carnivore abundance is increasingly common, and to date many such studies have utilized a mark-recapture framework and focused on carnivores with unique pelage patterns. The recent improvement of mark-resight estimators, however, provides an opportunity to estimate the abundance of carnivores without unique pelage patterns. We utilized both the mark-recapture and mark-resight frameworks to estimate bobcat population sizes in a geographically isolated urban reserve in southern California. Due to their sensitivities to urban fragmentation, bobcats have been a focal species in several studies throughout southern California, yet few population estimates exist for this region. Since bobcats are individually identifiable, and a subset of the study population was physically marked with GPS telemetry collars, we were able to compare the utility of both the mark-recapture and mark-resight frameworks for carnivore population estimation with camera trap data. We deployed a sampling grid of 30 cameras throughout the study area and recorded 109 bobcat photos during 4,669 camera nights from July 2006 through January 2007. Density point estimates were reasonably consistent with prior studies and ranged from 0.40 to 0.55 bobcats per km2 depending upon the estimator used, but the confidence intervals for all estimates overlapped suggesting that they were not significantly different. Percent confidence interval length ranged from 150% to 180% indicating a low amount of precision for all of our estimates. We conclude that mark-resight estimators performed comparably to the mark-recapture estimators and show promise for use with camera trap data to estimate carnivore population sizes. The low precision for both our mark-recapture and mark-resight estimators, however, highlights the sensitivity of both frameworks to small datasets typical of large carnivore studies. In future studies, it will be important to develop techniques to increase capture probabilities of target species to maximize the utility of camera traps for estimating population sizes.  In the second chapter, I evaluate the effects of a road expansion and mitigation project on underpass usage of three target species: bobcat, coyote and mule deer. Roads can negatively impact wildlife, particularly large mammals. In response, transportation agencies have implemented mitigation measures like the installation of wildlife fencing and wildlife crossing structures. The evaluation of these mitigation measures is crucial to determine the success of reducing road impacts. Herein, we evaluate a road expansion and mitigation project completed by the California Department of Transportation along State Route 71 (CA-71) through the Chino Hills southeast of Los Angeles. We designed a remote camera survey to study how the widening of CA-71 and implementation of mitigation measures affected large mammal movement and underpass use. Based on camera detections, bobcat underpass use was higher in the construction and mitigation zone after construction than before, but there was no difference in use of underpasses in the impact compared to the control zone in either time period. Underpass use by coyotes was higher in the control zone than in the impact zone, but there was no difference in use between the before and after periods. Small numbers of mule deer detections at few underpasses precluded a comparison between the control and impact zones, but a comparison of before and after periods revealed that mule deer underpass use was slightly higher post-construction. We cannot fully attribute increased detections post-construction to mitigation efforts, and other factors, such as habitat availability, urbanization, or demography, may have also influenced underpass use along CA-71. Nonetheless, even with the expansion of the freeway and subsequent increase in traffic volume, mitigation structures along CA-71 did allow for continued movement and hence connectivity across the roadway for the target species.

TI  - Evolution of Oviposition in Aedes aegypti in Forest and Domestic Habitats in Africa
AU  - Xia, Siyang
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The process of habitat change, common in nature, provides many opportunities to study ecological divergence. Environmental differences between habitats could lead to phenotypic and genetic differentiation. The mosquito Aedes aegypti presents an excellent opportunity to study such processes, for its recent evolutionary history featured a habitat expansion from sylvatic habitats to anthropogenic domestic habitats. Ae. aegypti is the primary disease vector of yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, and it is a major public health concern worldwide. Originating in African forests, this species successfully colonized local domestic habitats in villages and cities before spreading to the rest of the world. Non-African populations of Ae. aegypti display many human specializations, yet it is not fully understood how mosquitoes first moved into domestic habitats inside Africa.A crucial change during the initial forest-to-domestic transition is the selection of a site to oviposit. Ae. aegypti usually lay eggs on the edges of small water-holding containers. Mosquitoes living in different habitats utilize different oviposition sites: forest Ae. aegypti lay eggs in natural containers like tree holes, while their domestic counterparts heavily rely on artificial containers such as used tires. These habitat-specific containers likely have different environmental conditions, which could drive the divergence of oviposition behaviors in forest versus domestic mosquitoes. Divergent evolution caused by habitat differences could also lead to genetic isolation.In this dissertation, I investigated the evolution of oviposition associated with different habitats in African Ae. aegypti. I focused on two African locations where forest and domestic mosquitoes coexist, one in La Lopé, Gabon, and the other in Rabai, Kenya. In the first chapter, I investigated the genetic structure of Ae. aegypti populations across habitats. Analysis based on microsatellite markers and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) did not find strong genetic differentiation between forest and village populations within each location. This finding suggested extensive gene flow between habitats or very recent habitat changes.The second chapter investigated how habitat-specific water containers may drive the divergent evolution of oviposition. During fieldwork in Africa, I characterized the environmental conditions of natural forest and domestic oviposition sites, including multiple physical variables, larval density, microbial density, bacterial community composition, and volatile profiles. The data confirmed that forest and domestic containers present very different environmental conditions. Field oviposition experiments found some hints of ovipositional difference between the forest and domestic mosquitoes in both locations. Yet such differences may not directly relate to the aforementioned environmental contrasts. In the laboratory oviposition assays, forest and domestic mosquito colonies did not differ in preference for the conditions that represent field oviposition sites. Taken together, these results do not strongly support the hypothesis that environmental differences between habitats led to a significant divergence of oviposition behaviors in African Ae. aegypti.In the third chapter, I tested Ae. aegypti responses to four additional oviposition cues, using mosquito colonies that represent the three stages of Ae. aegypti domestication: African forest, African domestic, and non-African domestic populations. These oviposition cues were chosen as they had previously been studied in non-African population lab experiments. I discovered some significantly different preferences among colonies established from the different habitats, but such differences did not always follow the expectations of the domestication process. This study further exemplified the complexity of Ae. aegypti ovipositional evolution.In summary, results from this dissertation suggest that African Ae. aegypti in the forest and domestic habitat are using oviposition sites with distinct environmental conditions, but they do not display much differentiation in oviposition preference or genetic backgrounds. These observations could not support the hypothesis of ecological divergence. There are at least three possible alternative hypotheses: 1) African Ae. aegypti in both habitats are ovipositional generalists, which allows them to breed in various containers and migrate between habitats readily. The occasional use of natural larval habitats (e.g. tree holes) outside of Africa reported in previous studies further attests to generalist oviposition behavior. 2) Oviposition divergency may be driven by combinations of multiple environmental variables not tested here. 3) Extensive gene flow between forest and domestic habitats may prevent behavioral divergence. Future research should test these hypotheses to advance our understanding of how human activities shaped the recent evolutionary history of Ae. aegypti.

TI  - The Evolution and Assembly of a Pacific Island Frog Fauna
AU  - Travers, Scott Louis
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The island archipelagos of the Southwest Pacific provide a natural comparative system for studying the processes of evolutionary diversification and community assembly. These two processes are often tightly linked in remote island systems, where entire species assemblages can arise primarily through evolution by adaptive radiation. Here, I characterize an adaptive radiation of Melanesian Island frogs (Cornufer) that are found throughout the archipelagos of the Southwest Pacific and extend to the distributional limits of oceanic island amphibians. In chapter 1, I use phylogenomic and biogeographic model testing approaches to investigate the origins of Melanesian Island frogs. I reject the traditional ‘downstream’ stepping-stone dispersal hypothesis, which has been a dominant paradigm on patterns of biological colonization into the Pacific. Instead, I demonstrate support for an alternative model of non-sequential dispersal from Southeast Asia into a fringing outer arc system of the Southwest Pacific, which is consistent with geological models for this region at the time. These results offer new insight into one of the most extensive and oldest terrestrial vertebrate radiations within this outer island arc system of the Southwest Pacific. In chapter 2, I examine whether community assembly by evolutionary processes can have predictable outcomes. I integrate phylogenomic, morphometric, and ecological data to test the hypothesis of community assembly by replicated adaptive radiation in Melanesian Island frogs. Through a suite of comparative phylogenetic approaches, I find support for this hypothesis in the Solomon and Bismarck archipelagos. Adaptive diversification on a similar macroevolutionary landscape resulted in independent frog radiations exhibiting more overall ecomorphological similarity than expected by chance. This result adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that evolutionary assembly mechanisms (the combination of in situ speciation and adaptation) can have remarkably predictable outcomes. Finally, in chapter 3, I examine fine-scale patterns of within-archipelago diversification in a recent radiation of Solomon Island Cornufer of the subgenus Batrachylodes. I find that geographic isolation is a major driver of spatial patterns of intraspecific genomic variation in a widespread species. Despite this strong signal of allopatric diversification, there has been no buildup of multispecies Batrachylodes communities outside of a single paleo-island (Greater Bougainville). In contrast, within Greater Bougainville, recent speciation has led to the rapid assembly of up to nine species on a single island (Bougainville). However, this rapid accumulation of coexisting species does not appear to be matched with exceptional phenotypic differentiation. Overall, this dissertation provides evidence for an older timeframe of community assembly within the Melanesian Island archipelagos. Adaptive radiation has shaped a major component of the terrestrial biodiversity in this Pacific arc system, with highly predictable outcomes of evolutionary assembly in different island groups. And although this radiation of Melanesian Island frogs is relatively old, recent speciation is still driving the rapid assembly of multispecies communities within some islands and island groups.

TI  - The Effects of Monoculture Tree Plantations on Small Farmers' Livelihoods in the Mediterranean Region of Chile
AU  - Infante, Felipe
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The following study focuses on small farmers living in the Mediterranean region of Central Chile, specifically in the so-called Secano Interior  of the Biobio administrative region. This region has been proclaimed as one of the most successful cases of forest plantation expansion, a model characterized by high revenues and diverse associated benefits (Lara and Veblen, 1993; Miller, 2014; FAO, 2010) where the establishment of forest companies and their respective plantations has been encouraged, especially around small towns and rural communities with high levels of socioeconomic vulnerability (Contreras, 1988).However, local actors, including individuals, families, NGOs, neighborhood councils, among others, argue that the socio-cultural, economic and environmental implications of plantations’ expansion go far beyond the macro-economic figures provided by the Chilean Timber Corporation (CORMA) and other institutional reports. These issues include land grabbing, social and territorial isolation, loss of biodiversity, changes in the landscape, increase in wildfires, water scarcity, rural-urban migration growth, and traditional agriculture loss. Using landscape perception test, social network analysis and semi-structured interviews this research examines factors and implications associated with the social dimension and subjectivities affected in these rural households. It also focuses on a wide sample of rural configurations in the Mediterranean region of Chile, encompassing the diversity of socioeconomic and ecological realities found in the region. The objective behind this is to compare socio-environmental scenarios with diverse levels of plantation dispersion and magnitude, although sharing same macro ecological, cultural and economic characteristics. At its core, this research assesses the sociocultural dimension of monoculture plantations’ expansion, focusing on livelihood elements such as social structures, knowledge, adaptation strategies and landscape perceptions of small farmers’ households inhabiting the region.The results show a transversal agreement about which landscapes are considered more and less ideal for local producers having industrial forest plantations as the most rejected choice and production diversity as the most approved. Also, social networks shows how the level of encroachment due to forest plantations is associated with certain trends in networks metrics and attributes. Finally, ethnographic narratives show how respondent’s socioeconomic and environmental vulnerabilities are linked to the establishment and expansion of local monoculture forest plantations.

AU  - DiLeo, Michelle Francis
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Understanding the impacts of both natural and anthropogenic landscape features on genetic diversity, population structure and connectivity has important implications for conservation of species living in fragmented environments. Here, I combine population genetic data, detailed land cover information, and computer simulations to explore how landscape shapes genetic structure across two regional populations of the threatened eastern massasauga rattlesnake (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus) in Ontario, Canada: one along the eastern shores of Georgian Bay and the other largely confined to the northern half of the Bruce Peninsula. First I used spatial Bayesian assignment to quantify the genetic population structure within each regional population. I found marked subpopulation structure within eastern Georgian Bay with differentiation of island and mainland snakes, a north-south split within the mainland coinciding with the town of Parry Sound, and evidence of further subdivision within the cluster of snakes north of Parry Sound. In contrast I found no population subdivision within the mainland of the Bruce Peninsula, but genetic distinction of mainland and island snakes. Next, I identified the landscape features that shape spatial genetic structure within regional populations. In eastern Georgian Bay I found local variation in the effect of landscape on populations. North of Parry Sound I found no effect of landscape on inter-individual genetic differentiation, but a strong pattern of isolation-by-distance. In contrast I found that both open water and roads restrict gene flow of snakes south of Parry Sound. I found no evidence of isolation-by-distance or that landscape shape genetic structure within the Bruce Peninsula.Finally I used individual-based, spatially explicit simulations to identify the lag-time associated with the detection of contemporary landscape feature effects on genetic structure of massasaugas, and explore the consequences of using spatially correlated land cover elements in landscape genetic analyses. I found that the genetic consequences of roads could be detected within 2-12 generations when population sizes were small or juvenile dispersal was low. However, I also found that roads could be spuriously identified as impediments to gene flow when spatially correlated features such as water are included in genetic models.

TI  - Environmental Drivers of Dispersal in Black-and-White Ruffed Lemurs (Varecia variegata)
AU  - Mancini, Amanda N.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Dispersal is a fundamental aspect of primates’ lives, influencing population connectivity through gene flow, driving community structure and assembly, and having important consequences for adaptation and speciation. Primates disperse within an environmental context, with both intervening and local environmental factors affecting the motivation, capacity, timing, and success of dispersal at all phases. Direct evaluations of primate dispersal are challenging given the rarity of dispersal events and the large distances that animals often settle from their departure site, therefore indirect measures– such as the use of population genetic data– are more common.The field of landscape genetics enables researchers to combine population genetic data with landscape information to explicitly evaluate the influence of both local and intervening environmental variables in driving dispersal. To date, research in primate landscape genetics has primarily focused on the role of the intervening landscape in driving dispersal, while the effects of local habitat characteristics remain untested. Additionally, although the effect of environmental variables is likely scale dependent, no published studies have assessed the differential influence of environmental factors on smaller-scale gene flow resulting from typical dispersal events compared to multigenerational gene flow at larger geographic scales.Therefore, the primary goal of this dissertation was to use a landscape genetics approach to examine the influence of both between- and within-site environmental variables in driving short-range black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata) dispersal in the Ranomafana National Park (RNP) and adjacent Ambositra-Vondrozo Forest Corridor (COFAV) and compare results to published studies assessing the drivers of long-range dispersal. This dissertation had three main objectives: 1) Characterize habitat quality across the RNP-COFAV region using traditional botanical plots and transects to enable an evaluation of the role of local environmental quality in driving ruffed lemur dispersal; 2) Characterize ruffed lemur population genetic structure and diversity across the RNP-COFAV region to evaluate functional connectivity and dispersal characteristics of ruffed lemurs in the region; and 3) Combine data from objectives 1 and 2 to evaluate the short-range environmental drivers of ruffed lemur dispersal and functional connectivity across the RNP-COFAV region, and compare findings to previously identified drivers of long-range dispersal.This dissertation focused on the region of southeastern Madagascar containing the Ranomafana National Park (RNP), the park’s 3-km buffer zone, and the adjacent Ambositra-Vondrozo Forest Corridor (COFAV). This region is characterized by a broad diversity of historic and contemporary forest modification within both RNP and the COFAV. In Chapter 2, I found significant ecological variability between sites throughout the region, with the pristine and strictly protected site of Mangevo (in southeastern RNP) exhibiting significantly taller canopy, larger DBH, greater basal area, and greater species diversity than almost all other sites investigated. The sites differing the most from Mangevo and having the smallest canopies, DBH, basal areas, and lowest species diversity were also found within RNP, but were previously subject to intensive modification in the late 1980s. Interestingly, I found no significant differences in forest structure and floristic diversity between the strictly protected RNP compared to the park’s buffer zone and the COFAV, both of which are designated for sustainable extractive use.In Chapter 3, I found that ruffed lemurs in the RNP-COFAV region retain levels of genetic diversity comparable to or greater than those found in prior studies in the area, as well as compared to several other lemur species. Using both Bayesian and multivariate structure analyses I reveal that ruffed lemurs in the RNP-COFAV region constitute a single genetic population, suggesting significant functional connectivity throughout the region. This result is further corroborated by the identification of four first-generation migrants that were sampled within RNP but have an assigned natal location within the COFAV. Furthermore, my results indicate that both male and female ruffed lemurs disperse– corroborating recent work– although I was unable to determine if any biases exist between the sexes in frequency and distance of dispersal.Finally, in Chapter 4, I found that the most influential drivers of short-range ruffed lemur dispersal were between-site terrain ruggedness and canopy height, more so than any within-site habitat characteristic evaluated. My results suggest ruffed lemurs disperse through the least rugged terrain that enables them to remain within their preferred tall-canopied forest habitat. Furthermore, I noted a scale-dependent effect of the environment when comparing my results to landscape characteristics identified as driving long-range ruffed lemur dispersal, with forest structure driving short-range dispersal and forest presence critical for facilitating long-range dispersal and multigenerational gene flow. Taken together, my findings suggest that it is crucial that we retain high quality forests and forest connectivity to facilitate continued dispersal and maintain functional connectivity in ruffed lemurs.

AB  - The fisher (Pekania pennanti) was found throughout Pennsylvania prior to the mid-1800s but were extirpated due to habitat loss and overharvest. The species was reintroduced in 1996 into Pennsylvania following New York and West Virginia in 1967 and 1983, respectively. A sampling of genetic material and point locations of these and other fishers began in 2002 across Pennsylvania and were used to discern source populations using 12 microsatellite loci.For my thesis, I used this dataset to develop gene flow and movement models within the Isolation by Resistance theory framework. The models were built and validated using a training and testing set method with 70% and 30% of the sample points, respectively. Two results that need investigation is the role of rural development as a positive factor for fisher movement and gene flow and possible movement corridors near Scranton, PA and the Kittatinny Ridge in south eastern Pennsylvania.

TI  - The dispersal, storage and remobilization of heavy metals in the River Aire contaminated by urban and industrial wastes.
AU  - Dawson, E.J.
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Industrial and urban activities in the Leeds catchment of the River Aire have caused the widespread dispersal and contamination by a variety of pollutants, including heavy metals.  This contamination is reflected by enhanced metal concentrations in the sediments and soils of the river and floodplain.  The cycling of sediment and associated metals in the fluvial environment is highly related to hydrological, geomorphological and chemical phenomena.  The main research objective is to investigate quantitatively the dispersal, storage and remobilization of heavy metals in the Leeds reach of the River Aire.A wide variety of relevant processes are analysed.  Metal pollution studies have often neglected urban and industrial catchments, where sources of pollutants to the river channel are diverse.  In the past, heavy metals have entered the river from industrial activities, sewage disposal and coal combustion.  The main present source of metals is the disposal of domestic and industrial effluent from sewage treatment works.The fluvial dispersal of wastes has caused enhanced concentrations of heavy metals in aquatic sediment and floodplain soils.  This results in long-term storage of metals in river corridors and poses problems as sediments act as a source of contaminants long after pollution of the fluvial systems has been abated.  The pollution problem is most severe immediately downstream of sewage treatment works, through the city centre, where traffic and industrial density is greatest and where floodplains are frequently inundated with floodwaters.Heavy metals are not necessarily permanently fixed by the sediment and can be remobilised through mechanical, chemical and biological processes, affecting surface and groundwater quality and plant animal and human health.  However, it is not the total amount of a metal stored in sediment, but how it is actually bound that is important in assessing its environmental impact.  Results suggest that a significant proportion of each metal is held in a potentially mobile and bioavailable form, particularly cadmium.The data collected is used to compile mass budgets of sediments and associated metals for the alluvial area of the River Aire in Leeds.  The results suggest that this section of the Aire contributes large metal loads to the Humber Estuary and out into the North Sea.

TI  - The epidemiology of lagos bat virus and henipaviruses in straw-coloured fruit bats (eidolon helvum), using population genetics to infer population connectivity
AU  - Peel, Alison Jane
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - The straw-coloured fruit bat, Eidolon helvum, has been identified as a reservoir for potentially-zoonotic henipaviruses and Lagos bat virus (LBV) in continental Africa. Longitudinal studies at a large urban colony in Accra, Ghana aim to better understand E. helvum and viral ecology, as well as the nature of human-bat interactions. To assess whether the findings from these studies can be extrapolated across the species’ continental range, more information on the movement ecology of the species and connectivity of populations across its range was required. A multifaceted approach, using techniques from the field of genetics, population ecology, and virology, was used to understand the ways in which the structure and dynamics of fruit bat populations across Africa may affect the viral transmission dynamics within them. Given recent difficulties in using electronic positioning systems on E. helvum to track movement, genetic methods were proposed as the most appropriate way to assess connectivity between populations across such a vast range. Henipavirus and LBV serological analyses were undertaken on samples from 12 populations of E. helvum bats across its continental and offshore-island range. A combination of mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite markers were used to describe the genetic metapopulation structure of E. helvum and data were obtained in each location on population sizes, demographic structure, reproductive and migratory seasonality, as well as bat-human interactions. Consistent with expectations for a vagile migratory species, a panmictic continental population structure was detected across its continental range, although the extent of this panmixia was greater than previously detected in any other mammal or bird. Antibodies to henipaviruses and LBV were detected in all continental populations. Isolated island populations in the Gulf of Guinea were genetically distinct from each other and the continental population. Given the isolation of these island fruit bats and the lack of connectivity with other populations, it was expected that populations would be too small to allow persistence of any viruses that cause acute, immunising infections. Contrary to expectations, island individuals displayed evidence for exposure to both viruses. E. helvum is known to roost close in proximity to human populations across continental Africa, and these results could therefore have important public health implications. Further longitudinal studies across multiple locations and information on social structure, daily and seasonal movements are needed to make inferences about virus transmission dynamics and zoonotic risks within the complex population structure.

TI  - Floodplain connectivity and river corridor complexity: Implications for river restoration and planning for floodplain management
AU  - Tompkins, Mark Robert
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - River channels and floodplains are inextricably linked elements of river ecosystems, and hydrologic connections between the two affect geomorphic, ecological, and flood management conditions in river corridors. Many river channels and floodplains have been disconnected, making floodplain ecosystems among the most endangered in the world. Recently, river managers have begun to reconnect floodplains to restore degraded waterways. However, there is still considerable uncertainty associated with planning and design of floodplain reconnection. To begin to address this uncertainty, I evaluated relationships between floodplain connectivity and river corridor complexity at different scales (i.e., river reach to bedform) and in different settings (i.e., agricultural to urban). I measured changes in river corridor complexity after floodplain disconnection along lower Deer Creek, a tributary to the Sacramento River draining 229 mi2 in Tehama County, California. Using recent and historical aerial photography, I measured decreases in riffle habitat (up to 84%), pool habitat (up to 100%), cumulative channel length (up to 72%), shaded riverine aquatic habitat (up to 81%) and riparian vegetation (up to 94%), and increases in riffle spacing (up to 1162%), pool spacing (up to 178%), and low flow channel width (up to 84%) between 1938 and 1999. These results suggest that significant and persistent reductions in river corridor complexity can be associated with floodplain disconnection, and provide an estimate of restoration potential for floodplain reconnection on lower Deer Creek. Next, to link changes in complexity to river water temperature dynamics, I measured effects of hyporheic exchange on daily water temperature fluctuations in lower Deer Creek at sites of varying channel complexity. Comparing hourly temperature of upwelling hyporheic water with downwelling water, I observed up to 7.19°C reduction in amplitude of daily temperature fluctuation, up to 3.5°C reduction in daily peak temperature, and lag times between downwelling and upwelling peaks of up to 19 hours. Differences in downwelling and upwelling water temperature characteristics were strongly correlated with elevation difference between downwelling and upwelling sites (R2 = 0.61, 0.53, and 0.69; p < 0.008, 0.016, and 0.003 for amplitude reduction, peak reduction, and lag time, respectively), suggesting that channel simplification related to floodplain disconnection can affect processes occurring at the bar-unit scale. I also assessed changes in river corridor complexity associated with small-scale floodplain reconnection through post project appraisals (PPAs) of five compound channel projects in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. In most cases, these projects resulted in improved geomorphic and ecological conditions, with width and elevation of created floodplain surfaces (relative to low flow dimensions) apparently the most significant influence on project success. This research builds on previous studies of channel change to develop a new method to measure changes in river corridor complexity associated with floodplain disconnection. In addition, this research adds to recent studies of hyporheic exchange by placing it in the context of river corridor simplification. This research also provides a systematic assessment of post-project performance of compound channels, an increasingly applied but little studied approach to multi-objective flood management based on floodplain reconnection. Finally, this research proposes a new framework to more effectively put ecosystem restoration on equal footing with flood protection in planning processes for floodplain management.

TI  - On Ants, Islands and Evolution
AU  - Sorger, Daniela Magdalena
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Islands have long inspired ideas of evolution. Both Darwin and Wallace developed their seminal works by studying islands. Here, I step into their footsteps and explore divergence and diversification on islands by considering non-traditional islands such as sand ridges, mountains, and forest patches. I explore how isolation influences populations and species in the light of modern integrative approaches that include natural history, morphology, behavior, and genetics. I study these questions through the lens of ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) as my study system, a diverse and almost ubiquitous insect group that is dominant in most ecosystems. My research operates at the interface of micro- and macroevolution where I document differences at the population-level that intersect with species-level divergence. The first set of islands I explore are ancient inland sand ridges in Central Florida, about one million years old, that harbor a unique flora and fauna. A charismatic ant species (Odontomachus relictus) that is already considered one of the rarest ants in North America occurs exclusively on two of these ridges. I reveal genetic divergence of populations between ridges that points to species-level differences which suggests that these ants should be a conservation priority. I further document additional genetic isolation at the population-level within ridges. Next I consider isolation and divergence along a climatic gradient on a tropical mountain in Borneo where diversity is vast and understudied. I consider morphological, chemical and genetic variation within a widely distributed trap-jaw ant species (Odontomachus rixosus). I discovered that it actually consists of a cryptic species complex with two new species that I describe and name. My results show that only one of these species truly has a wide elevational distribution. In a next step I investigate divergence within this species (Odontomachus saltans sp. nov.) along the gradient using population genetic tools. While I did not find genetic structure, I found evidence of morphological structure consistent with macroecological theory. I also document a new behavior in these species, a leg-jumping behavior, in addition to the well-studied jaw-jumping behavior. Lastly, I study sacred church forests in Ethiopia’s highlands, forest islands of varying size in an otherwise barren landscape. Here, I encounter an ant species (Lepisiota sp.) that conspicuously behaves like an invasive species, defying the natural boundaries of these forest islands and instead using urban development and disturbance to spread. Despite exhibiting invasive ant characteristics similar to global tramp species like Argentine ants, my genetic results suggest that this species is native and is likely a “local invasive”.

TI  - Migration and Urbanization in the Ruhr Valley, 1850-1900
AU  - JACKSON, JAMES HARVEY, JR.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - During the last half on the nineteenth century, rapid economic and demographic expansion was the most outstanding symptom of a general transformation of German society that bewildered politicians, frightened owners of large Prussian estates, and frustrated social planners. Many feared that a sense of community cohesion could not be preserved in the face of massive technological and social change, undermining national solidarity and strength. They concluded that a distinctive urban way of life was responsible for the chaotic nature of modern life, for impersonality and isolation in German society, and for the decline of primary group membership and the dominance of formal organizations.But an analysis of the social development of one major smelting, manufacturing, and shipping center in the Ruhr Valley supports only part of this pessimistic theory of urbanization. Evidence from Duisurg does show that, as the city grew, the urban social structure became differentiated and specialized. Many young unmarried men were attracted by work in expanding factories and smelting plants, bringing with them their appetites for unconventional kinds of entertainment. But Duisburg was not merely a city of rowdy single men; it was a place for families with young children. These households supported a vigorous set of specialized shops that catered to their unique domestic needs. Relatively large concentrations of foreigners added further variety to the city's social fabric. Their presence increased the possibility of intermittent cultural conflict. The potential for this kind of confrontation over life-style and values was also present among native Germans of different religious affiliations.On the other hand, this study of Duisburg calls into question the essential process by which city size and diversity was presumed to produce deviance and conflict through weakening intimate social relationships. First, the performance of aggregate indexes of social behavior was not consistent with the views of urban critics. With the exception of crime statistics, all measures of social cohesiveness, such as rates of birth, infant mortality, marriage, child abandonment, and illegitmacy, did not appear to be associated with urban growth. Second, "rootlessness" and "marginality" do not best describe migrant behavior, in spite of increasing numbers of persons in the migratory stream. Critics of urban growth believed that the shift of population from the agricultural countryside to the crowded, alien worlds of the city and the factory, as happened in Duisburg, lay at the heart of contemporary social problems. But these mobile masses kept up regular contact with the countryside and actually became more residentially stable in the course of the late nineteenth century. The pattern of life-cycle transitions, occupational demands, the constraints of social values, and the support of close social ties provided the framework for migrant stability.Thus, Duisburg appears to have been a paradox, combining some elements of structural dislocation and individual stability. And if Duisburg was representative of cities in late nineteenth century Germany, the urban network must have played a paradoxical role in the nation's social and economic development, acting both as an integrating force and as a disruptive agent. Cities were the means by which the German economy was bound together. They were the channels through which migrants made their way into the new industrial world. Facilitating the concentration of so many varied types of persons, cities encouraged the formation of a multiplicity of small-scale worlds in which individual urbanites found meaningful existance. Whatever evidence there was of urban disorganization was not the product of a disturbed populace, possessed by alienation, anonymity, or impersonality. It was, rather, the result of the urban process itself.

TI  - Study on the Development Strategy of Pingnan County in Guangxi
AU  - Li, Ye Xi
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Pingnan County locates in the southeast of Guangxi, belongs to Guigang city of Guangxi with the county level Guiping city, Guangnan district, Guangbei district and Qintang district. The geography position is superior, which is the conjunction of the East Coastal developed areas and the resourceful western areas.Since reforming and opening, Pingnan County has developed quickly, but at present the traditional industries are the main industries, the urban-rural dual structure still exists in the region. Now Pingnan County is in the key period of urbanization and industrialization. Pingnan County can go an economical development pathway of the characteristic industries and the preponderant industries, regarding the mainstay and obviously advantageous industries as the breakthrough, concerning the regional realities. Studies on the development strategy of Pingnan county has both theoretical and practical significance. The intra-county economy is the important foundation, the comprehensive and regional basic cell of the national economy. The economy of Pingnan county is not only a complex of the macroscopic economy and the microscopic economy, but also a complex of the urban economy and the rural economy.  The paper attempts to explore the problems of the development strategy of Pingnan County by utilizing the theories of regional economics.Regarding Pingnan County which is becoming lagged comparatively as the object researched, the objective of the article is to find an overtaking method or way to exert the late-developing advantage to utmost by using the theories of regional economics and comparative analytical methods. The paper divides four chapters except Guide:Chapter one discusses the development situation of Pingnan county. Before Pingnan county was incorporated into Guigang city in 1996, the economic strength of Pingnan county had been at the medium level within the eight counties or cities in original Yulin district. After establishing of Guigang city at prefecture level, the economic development total quantity of Pingnan county stood at the second status in the whole city, the per Gross Regional Product was at the first, the agricultural development strength is relatively abundant, the per Industrial Value-added was latter, the per capita annual income of urban households stood at the reciprocal second. According to Channer’s judgment standard about the economic development phase, at present Pingnan county is at the transition stage from the pre-industrial society to the prophase of industrialization. At present, the economic increase of Pingnan county has been good. From 1996 to 2004, GDP increased from 2249000000 Yuan to 4409000000 Yuan. In recent years the biggest power of the economic increase was the gross investment growing quickly. The advantages of development of Pingnan county displays in several aspects，including geography, natural resources, agriculture, land and labor force. The regional advantages are obvious, the traffic is convenient, Pingnan county has the superiority along the Xijiang river. The natural resources are abundant. The reserves proven of the limestone are 4600000000 tons. The advantageous conditions are offered to develop the characteristic and ascendancy agriculture products, on account of the subtropical climate, the good foundation of planting and raising industry, the high producing horizon. The industrial land is sufficient; the development cost of land is much lower than the cost in the East Coastal areas. The labor force is rich; the percentage of the persons whose educational level of the senior middle school ＆ higher level occupies 8.06%, the percentage of the persons whose educational level of the junior middle school ＆ higher level occupies 42.13%. On the other hand, some factors are constraining the next development of Pingnan county, such as the delay of urbanization, the low-level industry and the shortage of human resources reserves. In 2000 the urbanization level of Pingnan county was 19.0%. The proportion of the traditional farming, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery is excessively high. Because of the small value of industry and the low level of industry, the field and scope of the whole industry loading technology is restricted. The professional technical personnel reserves insufficiently. The proportion of agricultural, engineering and economic professional technical personnel is too low. Moreover, this will cause the lack of talented in the primary industry and the secondary industry. However the problems of “Agriculture, Rural Areas, and Farmers” are the main problems that effect the integration of urban and rural. Chapter two analyses the external environment of the development of Pingnan county. Some factors such as the economic integration in the world, the global industrial transform and establishing of the China- ASEAN have brought some profound influences on the economic development of Pingnan county. Now China has entered the intermediate stage of urbanization and industrialization, Pingnan county should persist the guiding ideology of the sustainable development, catch hold of the opportunities of entry to WTO and the strategy of exploiting the west areas, accept initiatively the industrial transform from Guangdong province and Hongkong, strengthen the regional cooperation with “extensive Zhujiang delta” areas , cultivate some core industries or impetus industries in the economic coordination areas of “Yulin and Guigang corridor”.In chapter three, the paper insists the guiding ideology and gives a strategic orientation of the development of Pingnan county, concerning the actual situations.The overall strategic targets and the urban function of Pingnan county can be positioned as the following: the greatest building material industrial city in the southeast of Guangxi, regional assistant center, a base for yielding and processing extraversion subtropical farm produce, the front to accept the economic radiation and industrial transform from Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, the amenity landscape garden city by river possessing the characteristic of the south of China.A preliminary forecast of the level of the economic development and urbanization has said that GDP will be over 12580000000 Yuan by 2015, GDP per capita will approximately achieve 8810 Yuan, GDP will be over 37515000000 Yuan by 2025, GDP per capita will approximately amount 22990 Yuan, that the urbanization level will be 39.05% by 2010, the urbanization level will be 47.33% by 2015, the urbanization level will be 56.26% by 2025.In the future, the urban system of Pingnan county will be adopted possibly urban points and axes combination-network model. The group of regional cities and towns will develop according to three axes. The first will base upon the second-class road from Wuxuan county to Pingnan county and the main road along the Xijiang river. The second will base upon the second-class road from Nanning city to Wuzhou city. The third will base upon the second-class roads from Jinxiu county to Pingnan county and from Pingnan county to Rong county. In the future, the urban system will come into being two economic regions of the north and the south, regarding the county seat as the main development center, Daan town and Zhenlong town etc as the vice-center. The five towns of Danzhu, Daan, Sihuang, Daxin and Zhenlong will be selected as the central towns. The towns in the county seat and the central towns may be regarded as the optimization development towns, the other towns on the plains areas may be regarded as the emphatic development towns, the towns in the mountainous areas may be regarded as the limited development towns.The strategic targets above will be divided into two stages. In the first stage, it will take roughly 10 years to speed up the infrastructure, optimize and update the industrial structure, strengthen the basic status of the agriculture, make great efforts to promote the industrialization and urbanization. In the second stage, it will continue to consummate the infrastructure, adjust reasonably the layouts of the primary industry, the secondary industry and the tertiary industry and realize initially the city modernization and the urban and rural integration.The strategic focal points of Pingnan county are choosing and cultivating the leading industries and the new mainstay industries. Cement, chemical pesticide, handicraft manufacture and high quality highly effective characteristic agriculture may be determined the leading industries, because of their huge potential of development and their great advantages of resources, producing technology and producing cost. The cocoon silk industry, manufacture of paper, ceramics and manufacture of textile wearing apparel may be determined the new mainstay industries.Chapter four puts forward six strategic measures of the development of Pingan county as follows. First, the industrialization should be speeded up though recruiting business and drawing capital. We should improve the soft and hard environment of investment, accept actively the industrial transform from Guangdong and Hongkong, and construct prominently the industrial gardens. Second, we should strengthen the human resources development. We should exert great efforts to improve the basic education, establish and perfect the vocational skill training system, and build a good environment to attract talented. Third, we should develop positively the non-government economy.  The government must give macroscopic instruction, guide the innovation of system and management, support the technical innovation and strengthen the service function. Fourth, we should transform the government function and improve the administration efficiency. Fifth, we should push forward the integration of urban and rural and promote the harmonious development of urban and rural. We should solve the problem of the rural surplus labor force shift, expand the way of the farmers’ additional income, establish and perfect the social security system of the rural areas. Sixth, we should insist the sustainable development of agriculture, industry and population to go the way of the sustainable development.The innovations in the paper are chiefly expressed: Firstly, the development strategy of Pingnan county is studied in a new visual angle using the regional economic correlative theories. Secondly, the towns of Pingnan county are divided into optimization development towns, emphatic development towns and limited development towns for the first time, according to the guiding ideology of dividing functional areas in the 11th 5-year planning. Thirdly, the guiding thinking is brought forward first that the colony of the regional towns in Pingnan county must be developed in term of three axes. Fourth, six material and operable measures of the development strategy of Pingan county are brought forward concerning the situations of Pingnan county.Key words: Development strategy，Strategic measures

TI  - Land-Water Interstices: Soft Strategies for Red Hook’s Coastal Resilience
AU  - Desu, Mohitha
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Coastal areas are contested zones; they are attractive for real estate development, they are exposed to the risk of rising waters, and are critical habitats for many avian, aquatic and land-based species. Loss of these wetlands through sea level rise could pose a threat to coastal economies and water quality. Re-naturalizing a river’s beds and banks and then replacing them with vegetation results in restoring biodiversity, which in turn helps in mitigating floods.Land-Water Interstices argues that a coastal community is resilient only if neighborhoods, buildings and infrastructure can withstand and recover from potential flooding, rising water and other climate occurrences. The research adopts a multidimensional approach to solving the challenge of coastal resilience by combining principles of urban design, landscape and sustainable design, flood mitigation, climate adoption and placemaking.By re-naturalizing Buttermilk Channel and designing a wetland system that connects Red Hook and Governor’s Island, the project addresses the issue of flooding, rising sea waters and climate change. This system forms multiple islands (emerging and proposed) that can serve not only as a ‘sponge basin’, but also as a soft defense edge and can accommodate new ferry connections. These islands can be catalysts oriented towards connectivity and resiliency in the urban realm.

TI  - Amphibian Communities Within a Coffee-Forest Matrix Outside the Protected Buffer of Celaque National Park, Honduras
AU  - Krygeris, Catherine
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The coffee agricultural industry is one of the largest worldwide and is growing in Honduras. Coffee plantations are putting pressure on forested lands and are one reason for the rise of deforestation in the tropics. Outside the protected border of Celaque National Park, Honduras, an increase in deforestation has been documented due to coffee agriculture creating a mixed matrix of coffee agriculture and forest fragments. Amphibian populations respond differently to land use change and the associated physical changes in the environment that comes with deforestation. In some cases, the edge effects along the coffee-forest matrix act as habitat for amphibian species and are a corridor for migration between forested fragments. In other cases, loss of amphibian diversity and species richness occurs. This study found the latter to be true, where both coffee and forest fragments demonstrated low levels of amphibian richness and diversity. While additional research and replication should be done to further study this system, initial analysis show that canopy cover, vegetation density, and microhabitat complexity may be important factors supporting more diverse amphibian communities and species sensitive to human disturbance. With coffee agriculture on the rise in the tropics, exploring these systems and the impacts on amphibian communities will be a necessary field of study for conservation biology.

TI  - Stigma-induced property value diminution from nuclear waste transportation
AU  - Conway, Sheila
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Stigma resulting from an amplified perception of risk has been associated with all aspects of nuclear power plant siting and operations, including a decline in property values in areas affected by nuclear power plant operations. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) will soon commence a massive, first of its kind program to transport spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and high-level nuclear waste (HLNW) from civilian nuclear power plants and the nation's weapons facilities to a repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. A substantial portion of the SNF and HLNW resulting from this program will travel through Clark County, Nevada. This study seeks to determine the extent of property value diminution that may occur in Clark County, Nevada as a result of this program. Several methodologies have been developed for estimating property value diminution. These methodologies focus on measuring either comparable current sales or the statistical change in a large number of past transactions. Since a massive shipment campaign of HLNW has never occurred, there are neither comparable current sales nor past transactions that can be used for comparison. To evaluate the range of potential property value diminution that may result from the transportation of HLNW and SNF, this research design combines a survey of real estate appraisers and lenders for residential, commercial, and industrial property; an analogous case study; and a survey of Clark County, Nevada residents. The range of outputs from these techniques was applied to the market valuations for residential properties in Clark County, and then the results were compared and evaluated. There is a consistency in the direction of all of the results from this research. Specifically, the findings from the analogous case survey from the Waste Isolation Pilot Project (WIPP) in New Mexico align closely with the results of the survey of Clark County residents. Further, the results of both of these surveys are consistent with the range of impacts identified by both expert groups, i.e., lenders and appraisers under the serious HLNW accident scenario. Lesser but still significant impacts were found when the lenders and appraisers were asked to identify potential impacts under scenarios where there is only a minor HLNW accident and under a no accident scenario.

T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - I surveyed songbirds and lizards adjacent to dry rivers throughout metropolitan Tucson and related species richness to recreational use and habitat using stepwise multiple regression. Habitat characteristics included vegetation structure and floristics in river-edge areas, adjacent land uses, and land uses of the surrounding landscape.Bank stabilization had a negative effect on species richness of all bird groups. Total vegetation cover, mesquite (Prosopis velutina) density, and natural open space had a positive effect on species richness of most bird groups. Tall vegetation was important for species richness of lizards.River corridors could function as conservation corridors for five bird species and two lizard species. However, habitat for many other species was not continuous across the metropolitan area.Recommendations include protecting mesquite bosques without bank stabilization, protecting wide areas of upland vegetation near large protected areas, and increasing structural diversity and use of native plants in river parkways.

TI  - Mammalian carnivores, mesopredator release, and avifaunal extinctions in a fragmented system
AU  - Crooks, Kevin Robert
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Habitat fragmentation has been identified as a primary threat to biodiversity, and mammalian carnivores are thought to be particularly vulnerable to extinction in fragmented habitat. Further, the disappearance of dominant predators from fragmented systems may result in the ecological release of smaller carnivores and increased predation on small prey species, a process termed “mesopredator release.” I first examine the effects of habitat fragmentation on the distribution and abundance of mammalian carnivores in scrub habitats in coastal southern California. My results suggest a combination of landscape biogeographic descriptors (fragment area and isolation), local habitat variables (percent cover and distance to urban edge), and species characteristics (body size) help determine patterns of occupancy and relative abundance of a suite of mammalian carnivores. Second, I exploit an ecological experiment—spatial and temporal variation in the distribution and abundance of the coyote among urban habitat fragments in San Diego—to assess the direct and indirect effects of this top predator on community structure. My results, providing support for the mesopredator release hypothesis, indicate that the disappearance of coyotes result in elevated numbers and activity of smaller carnivores that exert strong predation pressure on scrub-breeding birds and other native prey. Third, I calculate local extinction and recolonization rates of scrub-breeding bird species in the San Diego urban habitat fragments by comparing recent surveys with those conducted in this system a decade ago. The results suggest ongoing local extinction and recolonization of native birds, dynamics that are a function of both extrinsic forces (fragment area, age) and intrinsic factors (density, body size). Finally, in a general review of my research, I use differential fragmentation sensitivities of mammalian carnivores to evaluate their roles as targets for conservation and management plans in the region. I argue that the choice of target species depends on the scale or intensity of fragmentation in an area, and the corresponding responses of carnivore populations.

TI  - The comparison of hoarding behavior of red squirrels between urban green area and liangshui nature reserve
AU  - Ma, Ying
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorA comparison of the hoarding behavior of red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) between urban green area and Liangshui Nature Reserve was made in this paper from March 2009 to February 2010. The contents of this research include: finding the difference of squirrels' activity rhythm, food selection, and hoarding-retrieving behavior between urban green land and Liangshui Nature Reserve. The main research results are as follows: Because urban red squirrels lived in urban green area, a kind of special environment with more human disturbance, the activity rhythm of squirrels, hoarding-retrieving behavior had adaptable changes. In urban green area, squirrels were feed by food of fixed quantity at fixed time. Their activity showed apparently regular pattern throughout the whole year. Squirrels went out of nests about 6:00, and the peak of activity in the morning was during 7:00-8:00, and the peak of activity in the afternoon was during 14:00-15:00. However, temperature had great impacts on the activities of squirrels in Liangshui Nature Reserve, and the activities of squirrels fluctuated intensely in winter. The food of squirrels in urban green area was different from the Nature Reserve. In urban green area, the food type of squirrels was controlled by people, including nuts, fruits, vegetables, even some cooked food and bread. Under the condition of fixed-quantity feeding, squirrels hoarded the remained food after forging, and also hoarded the rest food even if the ground surface was covered by snow, which showed the preference of excessive hoarding. Averagely each squirrel hoarded about 12150±3078 caches in a year. When food supply was insufficient, squirrels in urban green area retrieved the cache. The retrieving behavior of squirrels had no connection with season, but with the abundance of food supply or not. The squirrels in the Nature Reserve mainly selected some nuts food such as pine seeds, walnuts, some plants burgeon and epiphyte. Generally, squirrels of Liangshui Nature Reserve only hoarded food in autumn, and pine cones, hazelnuts were main hoarded food. At hoarding period, each squirrel hoarded about 7077±927 caches averagely, and retrieved these cached when food shortage in winter, but the proportion of retrieving was just about 8%-17% of the total caches. The squirrel population of urban green area was small but with big density, and distributed at concentrated areas, so they had intense competition for food. In the course of hoarding, squirrels adopt the method of rapid isolation: they usually set up the caches around the food source for the purpose of obtaining more food during shortest time. Squirrels in Nature Reserve had obvious territories and usually selected big and full pine cones seeds for hoarding. The feeding experiment indicated that: in urban green area squirrels had no choice on the size and quality of pine cones originally, but squirrels can adopt the optimal method to carry and handle pine cones like squirrels in Nature Reserve after only 5 days, which showed the study ability of urban

T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - This dissertation provides a partial explanation for transience in Jubail Industrial City (JIC) in Saudi Arabia despite abundant housing and employment opportunities. A quantitative analysis of a self-administered questionnaire sample of 540 JIC employees revealed that five community attachment factors related to residents' demographics, concrete and perceived housing attributes, and future housing expectations contribute to approximately 45% of the residents' overall satisfaction variance while the latter explained almost 35% of the variance in their mobility decisions. Open-ended response in the latter sample, and the response of nine additional interview cases revealed that inadequacies in social climate and dwelling maintenance were primary contributors to dissatisfaction and the intention to move by JIC residents. Dissatisfaction with the social climate was determined by the nature of JIC as a remote town from the homeplace and major urban centers, and as a work-dominated place with little time for leisurely social activities. Dissatisfied movers attributed their perceptions of declining housing conditions to profit-oriented maintenance contracting at the expense of quality, a perception that is heightened by residents' concern about the long-term effects of sand-storms and air pollution on housing upkeep. In order to enhance residents' commitment to stay in JIC, officials need to enhance the town's connectivity with the rest of the country, diversify leisurely pursuits, expand maintenance policy options for the residents, involve them in the decision-making process, and intensify the use of heat-resistant vegetation along community borders with desert and industrial areas.

TI  - Mammalian habitat use along a residential development gradient in northern Colorado
AU  - Goad, Erica H.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - "Exurban" development occupies nearly five times more land in the United States than urban and suburban development combined. Understanding the effects of exurban development on biodiversity thus has important and wide-ranging implications for the planning, construction and stewardship of sustainable communities and surrounding rural lands. To assess the impact of exurban development on mammalian habitat use, wildlife cameras were placed along a unique development gradient designed to capture landscape permeability in a rapidly growing rural region of Colorado. Multiple-season species occupancy and relative activity (frequency of detections) were measured in summer and winter seasons and these data were analyzed in conjunction with a novel, acoustic-based approach to assessing human activity. Impacts of exurban housing varied by mammal species, with some species, such as bobcats, elk, and coyotes, showing decreased activity and occupancy levels at higher housing densities, whereas others, including red foxes and Abert's squirrels, occurred more frequently in these areas. Human-sourced activities associated with development and non-natural sound levels emerged as top models for most species. Relative activity rates corroborated occupancy results, indicating that some species not only use habitat in high density areas, they use it more frequently. In addition, some species, including black bears, preferentially used embedded greenbelts in high-density exurban subdivisions, suggesting that greenbelts may be important for structural and functional connectivity. This study demonstrates that the impacts of exurban development are species-dependent. However, incorporating well-designed and naturally vegetated open spaces into development projects and minimizing human disturbance may be critical to mitigating development impacts to most wildlife in regions undergoing continued exurban expansion.

TI  - An 828 Year Streamflow Reconstruction for the Jordan River Drainage Basin of Northern Utah
AU  - Tikalsky, Bryan
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Mountain water resources are essential to those living along the Salt Lake City urban corridor. Water resource planners base their policy on twentieth century climate conditions and streamflow records. Often these records only account for a small amount of the natural variability in streamflow and climate. By utilizing dendrochronology this study seeks to better understand variability of streamflow in the Jordan River Drainage Basin over the last 828 years. A GIS model was used to identify potential sampling sites where tree growth would be sensitive to climate and factors affecting stream run-off. Over eighty samples from ancient limber pine (Pinus flexilis) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) were obtained to perform the reconstruction. Results indicate significant correlation between tree growth and streamflow. A multiple linear regression model created with tree-ring width as the predictor of October - March American Fork River streamflow explained 51.7% of streamflow variance. Analysis of the reconstruction indicates that present records do not adequately represent potential streamflow variability, and several droughts of greater severity and length occurred before the instrumental period.

TI  - Demographic and genetic response of woodland amphibians to landscape change in southern Connecticut
AU  - Gibbs, James Peter
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - A critical question in conservation biology concerns how changes in land-use patterns affect the persistence of plant and animal populations and the distribution of genetic variation within them. This dissertation focused on woodland amphibians occupying forested habitats arrayed along an urban-rural gradient in southern Connecticut for examining these issues. My objectives were: (1) to identify determinants of the structure of the forest mosaic, the arena within which demographic and genetic processes in woodland amphibians operated; (2) to examine whether amphibian dispersal occurred randomly with respect to several prominent, natural and anthropogenic features of the landscape; (3) to determine thresholds of sensitivity to habitat fragmentation for different species of woodland amphibians; and (4) to test several hypotheses about microevolution in amphibian populations subjected to induced subdivision.Distinct trends in the structure and dynamics of forested lands, and hence the habitats available to woodland amphibians, occurred along a spatially continuous urban-rural gradient. Primary determinants of forest occurrence in 1990 included slope and drainage attributes of underlying soils, proximity to transportation corridors and urban centers, and historical 'common land' designations. Amphibian movements, measured from captures in strategically placed pit-fall traps, were generally facilitated by stream beds, hindered by roads, and variously affected by ecotones between forested lands and open lands. Notably, the most dispersive species with bi-phasic life cycles (Rana sylvatica and Notophthalmus viridescens) were the least tolerant of habitat fragmentation, whereas the least dispersive species with direct development (Plethodon cinereus) was the most tolerant. Tolerances to habitat fragmentation could be largely predicted with a spatially explicit population model. Genetic differentiation, measured with molecular genetic markers and morph frequencies in the redback salamander (Plethodon cinereus), was greater among fragmented subpopulations than among contiguous subpopulations. Among fragmented populations, differentiation was greater among those lacking historical forest connections than among those retaining such connections. Furthermore, genetic divergence was correlated with geographic distance in a population occupying continuous forest, whereas no such pattern was evident in a population occupying fragmented forests. Notably, overall levels of genetic diversity appeared to be affected little by population fragmentation.

TI  - Mountains and Migrations: Using Biogeography, Population and Landscape Genetics to Elucidate Patterns and Processes of Diversification in a Biodiversity Hotspot
AU  - Chan, Kin Onn
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Elucidating the tempo and mode of diversification is a major goal of evolutionary biology and represents a fundamental step towards understanding how biodiversity is generated and maintained. Achieving this goal is challenging due to the multidimensional complexity of macro- and micro-evolutionary forces that act across time, space and different phylogenetic levels. Furthermore, these evolutionary forces can involve both adaptive and neutral processes that form confounding interactions with landscape/environmental characteristics. Understanding how genes, geography, and ecology interact to generate, maintain and distribute biodiversity, therefore requires numerous datatypes and analytical resources that span different disciplines such as biogeography, population, and landscape genetics. The primary goal of this study is to provide a better understanding of the patterns and processes involved in the diversification of frogs from the family Ranidae through the use of genomic data and recent advances in analytical methods.  Malaysia is one of the most biodiverse and environmentally threatened countries in the world. It is part of Sundaland, a biodiversity hotspot that has undergone dramatic climatic fluctuations in the past few million years. The dynamic geological history, coupled with the highly heterogeneous landscape of Malaysia, provides an ideal system to study the patterns and processes of diversification within a spatial and temporal context. Such studies are of particular importance in Malaysia as it is the country with the highest rate of deforestation in the world. Moreover, most biodiversity research in Malaysia revolves around systematic revisions and species descriptions with relatively few studies focused on understanding the evolutionary underpinnings that generate diversity. This study will fill a significant gap in the region’s biodiversity research, especially as it represents the first genomic study on Malaysian amphibians. Chapter 1 examines the broad biogeographic patterns of Ranid diversification at the family and generic level. Using the most comprehensive and robust time-calibrated phylogeny to date, we estimated the timing and patterns of major dispersal events to test the hypothesis that colonization of new geographic areas triggers a concomitant acceleration in diversification rates. Additionally, we determined whether the Eocene-Oligocene extinction event (EOEE) had a significant impact on the diversification of Ranids. Our results showed that the EOEE had no effect on diversification rates; most major dispersal events occurred over a relatively short period of time during the end of the Eocene, and the colonization of new geographic areas was not followed by increased net-diversification. On the contrary, diversification rate declined or did not shift following geographic expansion. Thus, the diversification history of Ranid frogs contradicts the prevailing expectation that amphibian net-diversification accelerated towards the present or increased following range expansion. Rather, our results demonstrate that despite their dynamic biogeographic history, the family Ranidae diversified at a relatively constant rate despite their present high diversity and circumglobal distribution. Chapter 2 compares the efficacy of commonly-used species delimitation methods (SDMs) and a population genomics approach based on genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to assess lineage separation in the Malaysian Torrent Frog Complex currently recognized as a single species (Amolops larutensis). First, we used morphological, mitochondrial DNA and genome-wide SNPs to identify putative species boundaries by implementing non-coalescent and coalescent-based SDMs. We then tested the validity of putative boundaries by estimating spatiotemporal gene flow to assess the extent of genetic separation/cohesion among putative species. Our results show that SDMs were effective at delimiting divergent lineages in the absence of gene flow but overestimated species in the presence of marked population structure and gene flow. However, using a population genomics approach and the concept of species as separately evolving metapopulation lineages as the only necessary property of a species, we were able to objectively elucidate cryptic species boundaries in the presence of past and present gene flow.  Chapter 3 builds on the findings of the previous chapter to determine the spatiotemporal factors that generated the genetic differentiation in  Amolops. We tested the significance and relative contributions of (1) geographic distance (isolation-by-distance, IBD); (2) landscape/environmental variables including mountain ranges, river basins, forest cover, and habitat suitability (isolation-by-environment, IBE); and (3) historical events (isolation-by-colonization, IBC) towards genetic differentiation. Results showed that interspecies diversification was primarily driven by historical events (IBC); IBD was responsible for intraspecies population structure, and IBE did not play a significant role in the diversification of Amolops. Additionally, demographic analyses detected significant population bottlenecks, indicating that speciation was most likely due to founder effect speciation.

T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Due to habitat loss and disease, conservation efforts for Corynorhinus townsendii should be grounded in a deep understanding of this species’ habitat associations and population connectivity. I investigated associations between roost occupancy and mine roost characteristics and external environmental features. I found that no external mine features were associated with occupancy. On smaller spatial scales, proximity to water and habitat types were associated with occupancy. I tested the use of DNA barcoding to identify C. townsendii eDNA in roosts and found that this method is not viable. Finally, I assessed the population structure of C. townsendii in White Pine County, Nevada. I found significant genetic variance among roosts, with a percent variation that suggests some genetic mixing (P = 0.001, Ф = 0.252). It is important that no aggregation becomes isolated, as this will impede gene flow and could leave isolated groups more vulnerable to disturbance, disease, and genetic drift.

TI  - Plant distributions and dynamics in urban habitat fragments
AU  - Bastin, Lucy
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - 1)  Data on plant species incidence in patches of habitat around Birmingham were analysed for correlations with patch attributes including area, isolation, habitat heterogeneity, shape and relation to surrounding habitats.  Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions broadly supported three predictions based on metapopulation theory, implying that relatively large-scale metapopulation dynamics may play a significant part in determining the distributions of a variety of urban plant species.  Options for conservation and landscape design are discussed.2)  Transect studies were made across urban woodland edges, to assess 'edge effects'.  The distributions of species characteristic of grass, edge and wood were successfully modelled with logistic curves, but few of the woodland herbs in the study were predictably restricted to woodland cores.  Mapping of woodland herbs was then carried out within woods.  A combination of small woodland fragments was found to include more of the selected species than larger fragments, or single woods, of equivalent area.3)  A patchily-distributed species, Melampyrum pratense, was mapped and studied.  Experimental plantings were made, and monitored over two growth sessions.  There appeared to be abundant suitable habitat which was unoccupied, probably due to the restricted dispersal of the species.  On the other hand, less suitable habitats were occupied when they occurred close to existing colonies, despite the low recruitment observed experimentally in these habitats.  Overall, distance effects rather than habitat availability were seen to be the primary restriction on the distribution of this species within Sutton Park, Birmingham, and over larger areas.

TI  - Conservation Through Population Assessments Across Variable Landscapes
AU  - Huang, Ryan Marshall
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Few areas of the planet are untouched by human actions, be they marine or terrestrial. Marine habitats face disturbance from overexploitation of fisheries and pollution while terrestrial habitats face significant threat from land cover conversion and degradation. To address these threats, conservationists utilize a variety of population viability analyses to both assess and manage species’ health. The results of these analyses often play a key role in determining when intervention is necessary and which actions will be the most successful. Within this dissertation, I used several population modeling approaches to advance our understanding of changes in the landscape on the persistence of populations and by extension, species.This dissertation may be broadly divided into two halves, the first assessing a single, local population and the second evaluating metapopulations. In Chapter 2, I combined telemetry data on sooty terns (Onychoprion fuscatus) with a long-term capture-mark-recapture dataset from the Dry Tortugas National Park to map the movements at sea for this species, calculate estimates of mortality, and investigate the impact of hurricanes on a migratory seabird. Included in the latter analysis is information on the locations of recovered bands from deceased individuals wrecked by tropical storms. I present the first known map of sooty tern migration in the Atlantic Ocean. The results indicate that the birds had minor overlaps with areas affected by the major 2010 oil spill and a major shrimp fishery. Indices of hurricane strength and occurrence are positively correlated with annual mortality and indices of numbers of wrecked birds. As climate change may lead to an increase in severity and frequency of major hurricanes, this may pose a long-term problem for this colony.In the latter half of this dissertation, I utilized a variety of metapopulation analyses for conservation at multiple scales. As a landscape becomes increasingly fragmented through habitat loss, the individual patches become smaller and more isolated and thus less likely to sustain a local population. Metapopulation theory is appropriate for analyzing fragmented landscapes because it combines empirical landscapes features with species-specific information to produce direct information on population extinction risks. Combining a spatially explicit metapopulation model with empirical data on endemic species’ ranges and maps of habitat cover, I could calculate the metapopulation capacity— a measure of a landscape’s ability to sustain a metapopulation.Mangroves provide an ideal, model landscape for my analysis in Chapter 3. Of conservation concern, one can easily delineate their patch boundaries. I calculated metapopulation capacity for 99 metapopulations from 32 different mangrove-endemic bird species globally in the years 2000 and 2015. Northern Australia and South East Asia have the highest richness of mangrove-endemic birds, with some hotspots also occurring in Guyana and French Guiana. The areas with the highest metapopulation loss are the Caribbean, the Pacific coast of Central America, Madagascar, Borneo, and isolated patches in Southeast Asia in Burma and Malaysia. Regions with the highest loss of habitat area are not necessarily those with the highest loss of metapopulation capacity. Often it is not a matter of how much, but how the habitat is lost since fragmentation of patches has a complicated relationship with extinction risk.After analyzing the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on a species’ risk of extinction, it is natural to examine the reverse, the restoration of habitat. In Chapter 4, I used metapopulation models to prioritize locations for potential habitat corridors. I compared these results to standard connectivity models that have grown in popularity to illustrate how together they provide a more complete set of recommendations for the recovery of species. For this chapter, I use the golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia) as the focal species. Endemic to the highly fragmented Atlantic coastal forest of Brazil, the golden lion tamarins are a highly studied species of top conservation concern. I identified the best locations for habitat restoration to increase metapopulation capacity and how they compare with movement of individuals in the current landscape. I also evaluated how a previous corridor restoration ranked according to these methods and how it effects future conservation planning. While large, occupied patches are significant for both sets of models, metapopulation models also indicate the importance of nearby, medium-sized empty patches that if connected by a corridor would facilitate the growth and recovery of tamarin populations.In summary, I applied a suite of population modeling techniques to an assortment of landscapes and species for conserving biodiversity. Despite the variety of models used, I illustrate the flexibility and utility of population ecology to conservation management.

TI  - Shared-Use Pathways Located in Natural Settings within the Urban Context: A Multiple Case Study Exploring How Design Affects Use by Children
AU  - Cox, Adina J.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - With an increasingly urbanized world, children have less opportunity to move freely about their neighborhood environments, interact with nature, and engage in free-play behaviors. Vehicle traffic and parental concerns about safety have limited biking and walking for children. Pathways provide opportunities for multiple healthy behaviors for children, including opportunities for physical activity, contact with nature, active transportation, access to play, and independent mobility. Pathway use by children has not been studied, although the federal government provides transportation funding for pathways and children have need for such recreation and transportation alternatives. Understanding children’s use of pathways is essential for communities that they may effectively utilize transportation dollars in planning and designing high quality pathways for use by children.A case study approach that includes four pathways in four states and utilizes multiple methods informed this research. Two types of pathways were selected as cases: pathways located within destination parks that incorporated play equipment in play pockets, located in Springfield, Missouri; Chattanooga, Tennessee, and pathways located along neighborhood greenways, located in Richardson, Texas; and Cary, North Carolina. Behavior Mapping was used to observe pathway affordances and behavior in settings that occurred along pathway corridors. Parental perceptions of benefits, safety, and independent mobility were determined through surveys conducted at all four sites. Pathway traffic counts conducted on site provided information on the age of.Results suggest the following conclusions: 1. While vegetation may provide benefits such as shade, wildlife habitat, contact with nature, and scenic beauty, dense vegetation my discourage use by increasing parental fears. 2. Installation of play pockets may lead to more frequent pathway visits and increased duration of visits. This is important as time spent outdoors is associated with higher levels of physical activity for children. 3. Children are attracted to wildlife along pathway corridors. This important attribute may be encouraged by pathway planners and managers through careful attention to pathway location and landscape quality. 4. Parents ranked ‘family fun’ highest as a desired pathway benefit, followed closely by physical activity, contact with nature, and scenic beauty. These family benefits may be useful information to public health, and park and recreation system officials to promote pathway use. 5. Parents are concerned about social safety of children in natural environments but high visibility along pathway corridors may decrease parental fears.

T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Conservation biology is an application of science to solving conservation problems.  The goal of conservation biology is to provide the principles and the tools to preserve biological diversity, which can range from preserving genetic diversity within species, to preserving many species within a given region, to preserving even the ecological functions and ecosystem services that species provide.  Conservation biology is used to inform two elemental issues:  resource management and reserve design.  In this dissertation, I present a case study of urbanization effects on ants and their associated ecosystem services in the Lake Tahoe basin that informs resource management and a case study of an imperiled butterfly species in disjunct wet meadows in the Great Basin that informs reserve design.  In the first case study, I examined the effects of urban land development in the Lake Tahoe basin on ant community structure and found that ant species richness, total abundance, and the abundance of aerator ants peaked at intermediate levels of development, while generalist ants had an opposite pattern of abundance and decomposer ants decreased and compiler ants increased with increasing land development.  I also found that these service-providing groups of ants were particularly sensitive to changes in dead wood removal and exotic plant invasions.  Declines in abundance of ant service-providing units provide evidence that ecosystem provisions, such as water infiltration, are diminished at sites subject to greater levels of urbanization. Thus, these data indicate that the two major environmental goals at Lake Tahoe, improving lake clarity and reducing forest fuel loads, could be advanced from focused attention on aerator ants and the water infiltration services that they provide. In the second case study, I examined patterns of habitat variability of the imperiled silverspot butterfly (Speyeria nokomis carsonensis) to determine whether determinants of occupancy differed between habitat types and to determine how the inclusion of this sort of habitat-specific data affected an optimal reserve design for the species.  The immediacy of conservation demands often forces conservation planners to proceed with conservation actions with incomplete habitat data, which may lead to misguiding appropriate conservation actions.  I observed a system with apparent habitat types within which the silverspot occurred.  I found that habitat features differed substantially between habitat types and that the determinants of patch occupancy concomitantly differed between habitat types.  Given that conservation planners may design reserve networks for an imperiled species only based on data that are immediately obtainable, such as patch area and isolation (i.e. 'traditional'), I examined how reserve systems differ between a 'traditional' approach and a habitat-specific approach.  I found extremely differences in which sites were selected for inclusion in an optimal reserve system between the two approaches, thereby demonstrating that by only incorporating area and isolation into a reserve design can greatly misrepresent an appropriate reserve network for an imperiled species.

TI  - Multiple-scale approaches to the restoration of deciduous forest in southwestern Ontario, Canada
AU  - McLachlan, Stephane Marc
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Intense agricultural and urban land-use has reduced forest cover to 3% in Essex county, southwestern Ontario, Canada. The remaining forest has been degraded by over-grazing, non-native species, recreational use, and, in some cases, poor management. From 1994 to 1996, field studies were conducted in and around Point Pelee National Park (PPNP) with the overall objective of assessing various approaches to habitat restoration.A preliminary landscape-level analysis of three areas near to PPNP used satellite imagery and geographical information systems (GIS). Forest cover in the area directly north of PPNP (Pelee-north) was less than 3%, while that of nearby Cedar Creek and Pelee Island was 9% and 14%, respectively. The relatively large number of forest patches $<$10ha and great inter-patch distances in Pelee-north suggested that the management focus in this area should be on habitat protection. In contrast, restoration efforts might be more effective elsewhere, where land values are lower and possibilities of increasing the connectivity between the forest remnants are greater.Since the 1960s, cottages and roads in PPNP have been removed and these sites allowed to regenerate (passive restoration). Since 1988, many sites have been actively restored. Although actively-restored sites were still dominated by ruderal non-natives, results suggested that passively restored sites increased in similarity to relatively undisturbed reference sites as time-since restoration increased. After 35 years, some mesic sites seemed to have recovered completely. In addition, there was no overall difference in native diversity between restored and reference sites. However, multivariate analyses showed significant differences in native species composition between reference and restored sites. Spring ephemerals with restricted seed dispersal were highly vulnerable and will likely have to be reintroduced. Non-native species diversity showed a significant decline over time, especially in wet/mesic sites. Ruderal non-natives declined most rapidly as time-since-restoration increased, while regeneration-inhibiting non-natives showed a less rapid decline. The non-native garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) had little longterm effect on the native understorey plant community.The success of agroforestry and afforestation was examined in a post-agricultural field outside of PPNP. The effects of fertilisation, weed control, and corn shelter treatments on the growth of three native deciduous tree species was studied from 1994 to 1996. Fertiliser significantly increased tree growth, but only when weeds were adequately controlled. Trees in clover treatments had less growth than those in either full-weed or mown-weed treatments, while trees in weed-free and inter-weed treatments had the greatest growth. Silver maple (Acer saccharinum) and green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) growth was greatest under the corn shelter when plots were fertilised and controlled for weeds. In contrast, growth of bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa) was adversely affected by the corn.The restoration of deciduous forest holds great promise for this region, whether it create new natural habitat or accelerate the recovery of existing but degraded habitat. However, this region is so highly fragmented that restoration should be co-ordinated at the landscape level if generations of neglect are to be successfully reversed.

TI  - Pedestrian corridors in downtown Dallas, Texas and their implications on the movement of downtown residents
AU  - Lively, Lori Molitor
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The City of Dallas has embarked upon an aggressive economic redevelopment effort in the downtown area. Economic goals of this redevelopment effort are closely tied to and dependent upon a critical mass of downtown residents. The target number of residents is 10,000 by 2015 (Strategic Engagement: Dallas' Economic Development Plan. City of Dallas, Office of Economic Development, 2005.) However, the urban form of downtown Dallas is a vehicle-oriented network of streets. Although downtown residency numbers have climbed from only 896 (excluding institutionalized persons) to 2,277 in the decade between 1990 and 2000 (Census.gov) and was estimated by the metropolitan planning organization to be 5,646 in 2005, no study has documented the location and travel mode choices of these residents. However, recent planning efforts have created physical pathways for pedestrian movement in the Main Street area. Using concepts pioneered by landscape ecology, a wildlife behavior model theory, and surveys of downtown residents and key decision makers, patches and corridors utilized by downtown residents were mapped and analyzed. A new network of corridors was also recommended to better connect the patches identified in the study. In addition to the current land uses and activities, future nodes of activity were predicted along the corridors. These new were nodes predicted based on accessory activity attracted by the presence of large numbers of pedestrians. An active street life is generally understood to be a desirable quality in attracting redevelopment to downtown areas. This study found that the lack of existing pedestrian corridors connecting patches of downtown activity inhibited pedestrian activity and promoted vehicular options, thus decreasing an active street life. The connection of patches within the habitat of downtown residents through designated corridors is applicable to any large urban centers with downtown populations. However, to be effective, the process of identifying patches relevant to populations must be conducted prior to corridor implementation and public entities, such as city planning and zoning regulations, must recognize and support creation of these corridors.

TI  - From Second Creek to New Pangea: A multi-scale analysis of patterns and trends in aquatic biodiversity
AU  - Duncan, Jeffrey Robert
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The Earth's freshwater ecosystems are undergoing a period of dramatic change. The simultaneous expansion and contraction of aquatic species' ranges is leaving an indelible mark on the evolutionary histories of the world's freshwater species. This dissertation represents a compilation of research efforts that quantify, explain, and propose policy recommendations concerning current trends in aquatic biodiversity. Part II provides an appraisal of the status of the world's freshwater fishes that asks two primary questions—are all taxonomic groups equally susceptible to extinction, and can we identify a unifying suite of extinction risk factors? Although I concluded, that extinction risk is not randomly distributed among freshwater fish families, the identification of a unifying set of extinction predictors remains elusive. In Part III, focusing on the U.S., a species list was compiled for each of the lower 48 states to represent their historic and future freshwater fish faunas. Species richness was calculated for each state, and the degree of change in faunal similarity was estimated between neighboring states. Comparisons indicated that states are likely to become more distinct from their neighbors in the future. In Part IV, I evaluate aquatic diversity trends along a natural gradient within the state of Tennessee. Changes in species richness and faunal similarity occurring between historic and future faunas were calculated between ecoregions. Species richness was found to decrease statewide. Similarity increased for virtually all ecoregion-taxonomic combinations indicating that Tennessee is losing its historic biological distinctiveness. Part V represents a study of biophysical homogenization at a fine spatial scale. I compared the frequency of debris dams in a forested reference stream to a stream in a heavily urbanized watershed. I found that debris dams occurred in greater frequency within the forested reference stream compared to the urban stream. A follow-up analysis determined that although there was a significantly greater amount of riparian canopy litter within the urban stream corridor, the quality and timing of litter inputs prevented debris dam genesis and retention. It is believed that the scouring flows that typically accompany highly impervious urban watersheds contributed to decreased frequency of debris dams in the urban stream.

TI  - Evaluating and Improving Current MetapopulationTheory for Community and Species-Level Models
AU  - Urban, Natasha A.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Ecological models that attempt to unite biodiversity and biogeography concepts have been used to describe and predict the distribution and abundance of species. Mechanistic ecological models theorize that demographic and distributional dynamics affect the success and persistence of the species making up the community. The community-level metapopulation model is one such model and assumes that the species at a particular island are determined by species-specific extinction and colonization rates which vary with island area and isolation from the mainland. In this dissertation, I tested the extent of the model's ability to capture the underlying mechanisms shaping the community and compare that to another mechanistic model and a null model. I used simulated island-mainland systems with varying number of islands, island sizes, and distances to mainland along with mainland communities with varying numbers of species and densities. I found that there was a limited range of system and community variables where the community-level metapopulation model could accurately describe the species richness on islands created using metapopulation dynamics better than the alternative models. Using these guidelines for system and community structure, I empirically tested evidence for metapopulation dynamics structuring small mammal, tree, and moth communities within an island-mainland system that fit the requirements. The community-level metapopulation model was not found to be better than a null model for describing the species richness patterns of all three functional taxa. The moth taxon was best described by the diversity of host plant species. Lastly, the descriptive ability of the community-level metapopulation model is dependent upon the accuracy of the underlying single-species model. An assumption of the metapopulation model that is often violated is the assumption of a constant density-area relationship. I incorporate a method to correct for variable density-area relationships within the single-species metapopulation model estimate of extinction risk. I then compared estimates of extinction risk with and without accounting for variable density-area relationships on empirical data: the density of mammals, trees, and moths in an island-mainland system. I found 63% of species across the three taxa violated the assumption of a constant density-area relationship. I found variability in the relationship between density and area. Estimates of extinction risk were inflated for most species before accounting for a variable density-area relationship on smaller islands.

TI  - Fish Assemblages and Potential Barriers in Urban Streams
AU  - Favaro, Corinna
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urbanization and associated infrastructures may fragment habitats, particularly within streams. This thesis examines the impacts of culverts on fish assemblages near Vancouver, Canada. I compared fish communities across 26 streams with and without culverts. Densities of cutthroat trout (O ncorhynchus clarkii) increased whereas coastrange sculpin ( Cottus aleuticus) and prickly sculpin (C. asper) densities decreased, on both sides, relative to unculverted reference streams. I also found that simple retrofits for improving culvert passage may increase fish diversity over decadal timescales. I then examined the effects of four culverts within one urban watershed and show that successive culverts had a cumulative effect on fish distributions, particularly for prickly sculpin and cutthroat trout (negative and positive, respectively). Overall, this thesis demonstrates that culverts may drive changes in fish communities through speciesspecific impacts that are consistent both within and across watersheds. Understanding biotic responses to stream fragmentation can inform urban watershed restoration and conservation efforts.Keywords: barrier; connectivity; culvert retrofit; fish passage; road crossing; river restoration.

TI  - The role of urban climate and land cover in phenology, nest success, and habitat use
AU  - Becker, Miles
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urban development is the fastest growing global land use and it increasingly brings drastic environmental change to natural systems. Climatic variability and spatial habitat heterogeneity within a city could influence species in habitat remnants.  The objectives of this project were to investigate the relative importance of temperature variation and urban land cover for nest survival, the function of thermal refuges for habitat use by breeding birds, and the relationship between urban climate and phenology.  Temperatures, leaf phenology, invertebrate abundance, nest habitat, and nest fate were monitored over a four-year study period at nine sites along an urban to rural gradient.  The sites were located in a riparian corridor passing through the cities of Reno and Sparks, Nevada.  Study area temperature anomalies from the 20-yr normal strongly impacted nest survival rates of American Robins (Turdus migratorius), Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura ), and Black-headed Grosbeaks (Pheucticus melanocephalus ).  Nest survival increased at warmer than normal temperatures and to a lesser extent at colder than normal temperatures.  Canopy cover within a 20m radius of the nest and pedestrian traffic at a site were positively associated with nest survival. Microsites available to nesting birds that had more vegetation were cooler at night and warmer in the day when they had more bare ground, less impervious surfaces, and less canopy cover.  The nests of doves and robins were constructed at cooler locations when air temperatures were warmer.  Temperature varied between sites with the warmest temperatures recorded in rural sites, followed by the more urban sites, and with coolest temperatures in suburban sites. The timing of nesting by robins occurred earlier in the warmer sites and at sites with earlier bud break by Populus  spp.  Peaks in foliar invertebrate abundance were also weakly associated with leaf out, while the sequence of peaks by aerial invertebrates was related more to the level of urbanization at a site.  The results from these studies demonstrate the ability of urban development to differentially affect phenology across trophic levels, have an additive effect with temperature variation on nest survival, and offer opportunities to provide thermal refuges to buffer the impacts of regional climate change.

TI  - Habitat, Connectivity, and Gene Flow of Mexican Spotted Owl in Southwestern Forests
AU  - Wan, Ho Yi
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The Mexican spotted owl (Strix occidentalix lucida ) has experienced population decline and has been listed as Threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1995. The cause of its decline has traditionally been attributed to habitat loss and fragmentation as a result of human activities, including even-aged timber management and urban development. Over two decades have passed since the listing, with new information acquired and protection measures being in place to maximize the persistence potential of the species. Yet, the future of the species remains unclear as new threats emerge to negatively affect the species populations. In the southwestern United States, wildfires have increased in size and severity in many forests, and are expected to continue to increase with projected warmer and drier climate. The increased risk of large, high-severity wildfires has raised concern about its effects on the Mexican spotted owl, which typically nests in dense and old-growth forests that are prone fires. This dissertation contains 5 chapters that review current literature on threats to the spotted owl, evaluate habitat suitability, connectivity, and gene flow of the spotted owl under current landscape condition, and evaluate fire effects on the habitat of the spotted owl. Results from my dissertation provide much needed information for managing the Mexican spotted owl. The modeling and analytical approaches demonstrated herein lay the groundwork for quantitative assessments in improving the understanding of impacts of emerging threats on the threatened species.

TI  - Scenarios of future changes in land use, open space, and habitat connectivity around the National Wildlife Refuge System and other protected lands
AU  - Hamilton, Christopher M.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Conservation in the face of land use change, a primary threat to biodiversity, requires understanding both the threat changes pose to conservation efforts and the drivers of change.  Protected areas, our primary approach to conservation, are often surrounded by land being used for agriculture or houses, which affects their conservation value.  Considering current land use and identifying future threats is critical to effective conservation, both within protected areas and without.  My dissertation goal was to assess threats to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) from land use change.  To do this, I first quantified land use change around refuges under different economic policy scenarios.  Second, I quantified and projected housing growth effects on structural habitat connectivity.  Third, I projected changes in functional habitat connectivity under land use and climate change scenarios for Blanding's turtle, a species with limited dispersal ability. \My primary result was that there will likely be significant land use change regardless of economic policy scenario.  However, differences among scenarios were minor with the exception of restricting urban growth, which had stronger effects than other policies and preserved natural habitats as well as a policy specifically designed to preserve natural habitats.  In addition, relying on habitat connectivity to mitigate the effects of global change is unlikely to be broadly effective because urban use has already precluded restoring connectivity for many refuges.  In both of these cases, land use change patterns were strongly regional in nature.  Finally, climate change had a stronger influence on changes in habitat connectivity than land use change for the Blanding's turtle, which demonstrated a "trailing edge" effect wherein populations at the southern edge of the range lost habitat connectivity more quickly than in the northern part of its range.  My findings indicate that a single national policy is not workable without the flexibility to account for regional differences change, that conservation planning should occur at the ecoregional as well as the individual protected area level, and that protected areas managing for a single species should assess the effects of global change on their focal species and conservation goals.

TI  - Research on the landscape design of the resort hotel of conghua imperial spring project-based on the landscape design of congdu resort hote
AU  - Jiang, Min
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorSo far, the development of international resort hotels has enjoyed a history of hundreds of years, while in China, leisure vocation does not have a rapid development until in the past 20 years after the Reform and Opening-up. However, as for the development and construction of resort hotels, there is still a big gap between China and the rest of the world. People are paying more and more attention to the landscape design, which is an important part of the image of resort hotels. Although holiday resorts are developing rapidly, some problems still exist, including a lack of local characteristics and the variety of the facilities. What's more, many people develop resorts blindly without considering ecological environment, which destroys natural landscape resources. As a backyard garden of Guangzhou City, Conghua has picturesque scenery and abundant tourism resources. Scenic spots such as Liuxihe National Forest Park, Qiangang Ancient Village, etc. constitute the 80km Gold Tour. In addition, Conghua is famous for radon sodium carbonate hot spring, which is well known as the First Hot Spring of Lingnan Area. All these have made Conghua a famous destination for leisure vocation both at home and abroad. However, problems still occurred. For example, the urbanization of the Conghua Hot spring Resort is more and more serious. On the other hand, the hot spring resources are over exploited, leading to the resource exhaustion and deterioration of natural environment. Besides, the landscape of resort hotels is simple without unique features of themes and image. The Imperial Spring lies in the riverside of Liuxihe River of Liangkou Town in Conghua, covering an area of 29.28 Kilometers, with rich natural and cultural resources. As an important part of an ecological protective screen of forests in northern part of Guangzhou City, the resort plays a vital role in protecting the eco-system, conserving water resources and soil & water conservation. Therefore, the resort focuses on afforestation and protection of vegetation so as to create a green space. In this way, it assures the link of ecological corridor and the exchange of material and energy so that the ecosystem can maintain a steady and healthy status. With a setting of ecological landscape and a corridor of wet land the resort takes hot spring as the theme. The resort is characterized by A Valley,Three Areas, namely commercial conference area, hot spring area and public leisure area, which form a banding landscape structure with pleasant environment and attractive scenery. Congdu Resort Hotel is located in the commercial conference area and its landscape design optimizes the structure of ecological view. By combining the landscape layout of Congdu Resort Hotel, the landscape space, functional structure and the landscape of courtyard with the buildings in a harmonious and unified way and analyzing the modern unique landscape factors with Chinese characteristics, it can be summarized that Imperial Spring has generated a beautiful environment with rich Chinese cultures and a relaxing atmosphere. By studying the landscape design of Imperial Spring, this paper concludes that resort hotels should be different from city hotels in terms of the protection and development of natural and ecological environment, the uniqueness of landscape style as well as the creation of the atmosphere of leisure vocation. The above conclusion can serve as a reference for the development and construction of resort hotels in the

T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - In The Granite Garden, Anne Spirn envisions a future city where "The paths on which people move into and through the city are designed with care. Every street and highway, and every other transportation corridor, is designed for efficient movement, for pleasure, and as an asset to the neighborhood through which it moves" (Spirn 1984, 270).This practicum provides an examination of one of those "paths on which people move into and through the city", a Winnipeg traffic corridors, Pembina Highway, between the Killarney Ave., Kirkbridge Dr. Intersection, and the Perimeter Highway. The practicum looks at what traffic corridors are, what factors have contributed to their present structure, appearance, and character, and what can be done to improve the experience both of being in the corridor and of moving through it. The focus of the proposal is on community liveability and the pedestrian environment.The practicum begins by reviewing various historic and current factors which have influenced the evolution of cities and streets. The corridor, Pembina Highway and its context are analyzed, and factors which affect the use of the site are examined.The results of a literature review are presented in an overview of current design ideas and issues associated with streets, cities, and neighborhoods. Issues identified by the research are used to generate a functional, cohesive, and aesthetically pleasing design for the site. Plant material, pedestrian walkways, open space, bicycle paths, signage, and lighting are all part of the requirements for an attractive, more human scale street environment that reflects the character and identity of the community, provides opportunities for people to move easily through the area, and is supportive of local businesses. This design presents the Pembina Highway traffic corridor as a meaningful and vital urban place as well as an important gateway to Winnipeg.

TI  - Analysis of Variation in Influenza a Virus Genes
AU  - Baez, Melvyn
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The genes of several influenza A viruses were examined by using various biochemical techniques and molecular cloning.The genetic compositions of eleven high yielding recombinants of influenza virus were determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the ('32)P-labeled RNAs obtained from the recombinants and their parents. The enhanced growth capacity of the recombinants, constructed for use in vaccine production, was associated with the presence of genes derived from the high yielding laboratory strain A/PR/8/34. In particular, all of the examined high yielding recombinants derived the M gene from the A/PR/8/34 strain.Two dimensional electrophoresis of ribonuclease T1 resistant oligonucleotides was used to estimate the extent of genetic variation among five different influenza viruses isolated during the beginning, middle and end of the H2N2 subtype period (1957-1968). It was demonstrated that genetic variation occurred among all the corresponding RNAs of these influenza viruses and that the extent of variation was similar for all genes. It is suggested that the maximum mutational changes of 3 or 4%, that were estimated for all the genes of the H2N2 viruses, may represent the extent of genetic variation that occurred during the eleven year interval which separates the isolation of the earliest and latest H2N2 strain examined in this study.The NS genes of the human influenza virus, A/PR/8/34, and the avian influenza virus, A/duck/Alberta/60/76, were cloned into pBR322. The complete nucleotide sequences of these two NS genes were determined and a comparison of these sequences showed a 27.3% difference. In contrast, the differences among the NS gene of the A/PR/8/34 virus and the previously sequenced NS genes of the avian virus A/FPV/Rostock/34 and the human virus A/Udorn/72 were fewer in number and ranged from 8-11%. The extensive sequence similarity among these latter three strains does not support the suggestion of species specific homology groups among the NS genes of avian and human influenza viruses. The NS genes of the A/PR/8/34, A/Udorn/72 and A/FPV/Rostock/34 strains were shown to contain open reading frames in their virion (-) RNAs which potentially encode polypeptides of 167 and 216 amino acids. Although the NS segment of the A/duck/Alberta/60/76 virus lacks an agnogene sequence in its negative strand sequence, it conserves the overlapping NS1 and NS2 gene arrangement identified in the other NS RNA segments. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the A/duck/Alberta/60/76 and A/PR/8/34 virus NS genes showed that the NS2 polypeptides are more highly conserved (18.2%) than the NS1 polypeptides (33.0% difference). Surprisingly, the NS1 polypeptides of the two strains showed this high degree of variation over their entire lengths, including the amino acids encoded by the conserved RNA domain of the NS1 and NS2 gene overlap.

TI  - Scenic beauty estimation of urban greenway greening in the central district of guangzhou
AU  - Li, Jun Jie
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorNowadays, with rapid urbanization and increasing nature environmental pollution, people call for a nature space urgently to escape the noisy city life. And the emerging of the greenway solves such problem well. It is considered as an eco-corridor functioned with ecological, connective, aesthetic, recreational and cultural. And it also satisfies city residents' request for nature. Pearl River Delta Regional Greenway is constructed with such purpose. It's a regional greenway in China, represents that regional ecology protection makes a great leap from theory research to practical item. Urban greenway is a part of the Pearl River Delta Regional Greenway. It locates in the centre of the city, serves all of the city residents. Its aesthetic and recreational function is more important than any other function in greenway. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and analyze urban greenway in the central district of Guangzhou, discuss the influence of different landscape factors to scenic beauty estimation values (SBEs) with Scenic Beauty Estimation (SBE) method belonged to psychophysical paradigm, and finally provide the suggestions based on the classification of such greenways. The study process with SBE method shows below: Select 50 typical landscapes of 26 urban greenways in the central district of Guangzhou, then take photos of the landscapes and investigate the quadrats. Acquire the public preference rating for each photo in three ways, including slides survey, field investigation and internet survey. Calculate the standard SBEs for each landscape with 200 available questionnaires and the landscape factors for each quadrat with the investigation data. Then build the multivariate linear regression model with SBEs and landscape factors: SBEs=6.193+77.983×Arbor Green Looking Ratio+2.521×Species+0.451×Arbor Mean DBH -2.508×Tree Form Diversity, to analyze the influence of landscape factors to standard SBEs. Additionally discuss the differences between three investigation ways and the consistency between different research groups. Finally classify the greenways according to the surrounding site differences into five classifications: park type, river type, brook type, suburban type and street type, and provide suggestions based on the classification. The study results shows below: (1) The preference to the greenway greening for public relates to the classification of greenway, which shows the surrounding landscape and the location of greenway. The greening landscape of park type greenways is more attractive to city residents, such as Datong Road, Shamian Street and Luhu Road. They rank first three. And the SBEs are all above 110. Because in this kind of landscape, the trees are tall and old, the crown is broad, and the park scenery around is beautiful. On the contrary, the SBEs of street type greenways, such as Zhongshan 8 Road, South Kangwang Road, Fangcun Avenue, are all below 15. They rank bottom three, are the most unpopular of all the greenways. So it's a necessary to decrease or shorten such kind of greenways. The river type and brook type greenways receive mixed reviews. We should tighten the bonds of the greening and the environment around during the designing. And the evolution of suburban type greenways relates closely on the greening itself. (2) The landscape factors of arbor green looking ratio, species, tree form diversity and arbor mean DBH has great influence on the SBEs to the landscape. In the regression model, we find that the landscape factor of tree from diversity is in inverse proportion to the SBEs, and the other three are proportional to it. So the ideal greening mode of greenway in people's mind is that of numerous species, tall trees, thick trunk, broad crown and uniform crown style. (3) In SBE method, slides survey could take the place of field investigation, and internet survey should be also used together. Different degrees of familiarity to the greenways makes no difference to the evaluate result. There is no significant difference between slides survey with field investigation. Though analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of these investigations, it is found that slides survey should be used primarily. Since the result of internet survey makes different to them, it should be used together with slides survey. The evaluate result by different groups with different degrees of familiarity to the greenways shows no significant difference, and it also proves that office-based evaluation could take the place of field evaluation well. So it's unnecessary to consider such factors during using the SBE method about choosing study groups and survey

TI  - Breeding success, prey use, and mark-resight estimation of burrowing owls nesting on black-tailed prairie dog towns: Plague affects a non-susceptible raptor
AU  - Conrey, Reesa Catheline Yale
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Introduced pathogens such as the bacterium (Yersinia pestis) that causes plague can have far-reaching effects on native ecosystems that go beyond the mortality of infected individuals. We investigated the effects of plague, prairie dog town dynamics, and rainfall on burrowing owls ( Athene cunicularia) nesting in black-tailed prairie dog ( Cynomys ludovicianus) burrows in the shortgrass steppe of northern Colorado. We examined effects on prey use, nest density, and breeding success, and used mark-resight methods for owl population estimation. Prairie dogs experience high mortality from plague, and their colonies are periodically extirpated by outbreaks. Plague does not make owls sick, but they may be affected as unmaintained burrows collapse, vegetation grows taller, and the anti-predator benefits of prairie dog association are lost. From 2005–2008, we monitored 322 nest attempts by 311 burrowing owl pairs on the Pawnee National Grassland and collected regurgitated pellets and prey remains. We banded owlets in 2007, and our first objective was to use a mark-resight protocol to estimate abundance, apparent survival, and temporary emigration. The Poisson-log normal mark-resight model (McClintock and White 2009) has recently been implemented in Program MARK (White and Burnham 1999). This model improves upon previous mark-resight models because individual identifications are not required 100% of the time, and individuals may die or be temporarily unobservable. Modeling showed that owlets in better condition that weighed more at first capture had higher survival throughout the summer and were more likely to be above ground. Our suggested improvements to field protocols should improve abundance estimation in the future. Our second objective was to examine the effects of precipitation, nest density, and plague on prey use and to determine whether prey composition influenced nest or fledging success. We quantified prey use and then analyzed diet composition using multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP) and indicator species analysis. Burrowing owls ate a huge variety of prey dominated by beetles, grasshoppers, ants, rodents, and songbirds. Insects comprised 95% of their diet by number, but only 11% by biomass. Owls in the driest year of our study and those at successful and very productive nests ate fewer birds and more mammals. Owl diet was unchanged by plague outbreaks, except that several bird species were less commonly eaten following epizootics. It appears that burrowing owls often forage outside of prairie dog towns, making town-level differences less relevant to owl diets. Our third objective was to determine the effects of plague, prairie dog town dynamics, and rainfall on nest fate, fledging success, and distances from each nest to its three nearest neighbors. Generalized linear modeling showed that rainfall was the strongest predictor of nest and fledging success, with higher rainfall associated with lower breeding success. Nests were more likely to succeed when plague events were more recent, and they produced more fledglings on towns where any extirpation was brief, and prairie dogs were otherwise resident on site for a longer time. Nests were closest together on recently plagued towns where prairie dog activity had been nearly continuous for a long time and recolonization was rapid. Although ubiquitous on active prairie dog towns, burrowing owls were nearly absent from towns that were not recolonized after plague epizootics. Both precipitation and plague influenced population dynamics of breeding burrowing owls. We found strong relationships among rainfall, prey species composition, and owl breeding success, and only half the owlets that emerged from burrows survived to fledge during the wettest July of our study. Precipitation regimes are expected to become more extreme in the future, which will likely have consequences for burrowing owls and other dryland species and may affect the size and frequency of plague outbreaks (Stapp et al. 2004). Although owls were absent from towns that were not recolonized after plague epizootics, it appears that burrowing owls can adapt to plague and even benefit in some cases. If conservation of burrowing owls is a primary goal, our results suggest that it will be more useful to preserve prairie dog habitat and connectivity between towns at a landscape scale than to intensively manage plague.

TI  - Historic Ohlone Resource Distribution Within the Alameda Creek Watershed
AU  - Fazeli, Naseem
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The Alameda Creek watershed is located within the ancestral homeland of the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe of the San Francisco Bay Area. Their ancestors historically utilized a variety of plants for food, medicine, ceremonies, and building materials, with their understanding of the value of the plants based on traditional ecological knowledge (TEK). The arrival of Spanish, and later Anglo/American, colonists beginning in the mid-18th century introduced urbanization and European agricultural practices, which have degraded wildlands and impacted species richness and diversity. As interest in environmental restoration has been increasing in recent decades, the present-day Muwekma Ohlone Tribe has an opportunity to once again access ancestral lands and educate the public on their TEK practices. A vegetation survey was conducted to analyze the distribution of historic plant resources, native plants species, and non-native species in a riparian corridor in the Alameda Creek watershed. Areas with greater anthropogenic land use, specifically grazed lands and seasonal service roads, had the lowest levels of biodiversity, traditional plant resources, and native species presence. Undisturbed and restored sections of the corridor, in contrast, were found to have the greater amounts of resource presence and diversity. Although the effects of Western urban expansion have drastically altered the traditionally managed environment, reintroducing Ohlone TEK could help support ecological biodiversity and allow a marginalized group to reclaim their culture and traditions.

TI  - Home Range of Rehabilitated Antillean Manatees in Belize and the Role of Benthic Vegetation in Visitation
AU  - Deardeuff, Amanda Kay
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Antillean manatees, Trichechus manatus manatus, are an endangered subspecies of the West Indian manatee, with fragmented populations throughout their range. Belize is thought to support the largest population of Antillean manatees (800 – 1,000 individuals). As coastal development and tourism increase, destruction of vital manatee habitat, including seagrass beds and mangroves, and watercraft collisions are also increasing. Chapter 2 focused on estimating the home range of two rehabilitated manatees in Belize, F1 and M1. The objectives were to (1) estimate home range of two rehabilitated and released manatees in Belize and identify areas frequently used by the manatees, and (2) identify differences in home range size and make inferences about potential causes for such differences. Kernel density estimators were used to calculate home ranges and core areas in R v3.2.5, using the adehabitat library. It was predicted that M1 would have larger home range and core area sizes, potentially attributed to mother calf bonding time in the wild. Post release 95% home range for F 1 was 49.51 km2 and 50% core area was 3.79 km 2. Post release 95% home range for M1 was 971.69 km 2 and 50% core area was 161.38 km2. Results of the range analysis and movements patterns show differences between both individuals for post release, but relatively similar movement patterns and home range for soft release, which could indicate bias in soft release movement based on care taker influence. The results of this study show that F1 made clear and repetitive movements within a cluster of habitats near where she was released, unlike M1 who only stayed in the Corozal Bay Wildlife Sanctuary (CBWS) for about a week, after which he traveled down the coast to Belize City and The Drowned Cayes. Studies have shown that males tend to show less site fidelity and travel further distances. This study reflects similar results. However, as time in the wild progresses, behavior and movement patterns could change. Future studies should focus on tracking individuals for as long as possible during post release to observe changes.The objective of the second study was to infer relationships between movement patterns of the M1 and the vegetation in those areas. A quadrat was used to estimate percent cover and species richness along a 10 m transect. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed significant differences among Places, Primary Corridors, Secondary Corridors, and No Visit sites, with regards to percent cover of T. testudinum (P= 0.002) and combined cover of seagrasses (P= 0.019). Spearman’s correlation coefficients between visit number and the independent variables show a positive correlation. After applying a Bonferroni correction and adjusting the calculated P-values, only three of the comparisons were significant: visit with T. testudinum  (P< 0.001), visit with combined seagrasses (P= 0.006), and visit with combined cover for all species (P= 0.042). This study demonstrates that more highly used areas were positively correlated with T. testudinum,  the combined cover of T. testudinum and  H. wrightii, and the combined cover of all species. Future management strategies, as well as research, should focus on identifying and protecting critical habitats of manatees in Belize.

TI  - Predicting Suitable Habitat for the Critically Endangered Yellow-Tailed Woolly Monkey (Lagothrix Flavicauda) in Peru
AU  - Zarate, Melissa Ann
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The Tropical Andes Biodiversity Hotspot holds a remarkable amount of species at risk of extinction due to climate change and human activities. One of these species, the Critically Endangered yellow-tailed woolly monkey (Lagothrix flavicauda), has experienced alterations in its known geographical range, along with a recent sighting in the region Junín, 206 kilometers south of previous observations, calling for a re-evaluation of potential suitable habitat. In this thesis, I fit, evaluate, and apply predictions of a habitat suitability model within the country of Peru. I used a generalized linear modeling approach across various range constraints, incorporating bioclimatic variables, forest cover, distance to cities and elevation as predictor variables. Precipitation features most strongly influencing observations of species presence in my model and evaluation measures showed the elevation-constrained model accuracy to be around 95%. Habitat suitability maps illustrate novel areas of potentially suitable habitat in central Huánuco, Pasco, and limited areas in Junín. The newly discovered population was found to be in an area of low suitability, calling for further investigation of the species in this area. Areas of suitable habitat should be surveyed to decrease bias in occurrence data, increasing the accuracy of habitat modeling for this species. Surveying these areas may also reveal corridors of gene flow between these populations, and could facilitate landscape genetics studies to characterize the viability of this taxon. Better characterization of the true distribution of the species will provide information to conservation stakeholders in priority areas, helping to protect this species and associated threatened wildlife.

TI  - Studies on the genetic diversity and applied ecology of some species in Palmae
AU  - Tan, Qi Zhong
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Palmae is a very distinguished colony in the monocotyledon and a very important component of the tropical flora. It is one of the three most important economic families in the world. Palms are widely regarded as being second only to the grasses in economic importance and whole communities in the tropics and subtropics may depend on palms for their livelihood. Besides this, they are widely cherished and used in modern life and urban greening around the world due to their rich species, widely habitat fitness and unique ornamental values. This has also happened in Xiamen and other cities in southern China. But in fact, difficulty in classification has been an obstacle in the utilization, conservation and application of the palm resources for the specialty of their geological distributions and morphological structures, and the lack of research on the physio-ecological principles in cultivation and appliance with the palm resources has not only coursed waste in plant introduction and acclimatization but also severely influenced the elaboration of the ecological efficiency of palms as an emblem of tropical plant landscape in the construction of urban green system.In this work, some species of Palmae cultivated in the Xiamen botanical garden had been selected to be analyzed their genetic diversity with RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) technique. According to the result of genomic DNA amplified with PCR (polymerase chain reaction), genetic distance and similarity between different palm species were calculated on Nei’s estimate of similarity and genetic distance. A primary but first time research at the phylogenetic relationships of some genera and species, the molecular classification and identification of some puzzling species of Palmae was carried out through UPGMA (unweighted pair group mean average) cluster analysis of the genetic distance together with comparative study of the morphological structure characteristics. The shade tolerance and caloric ecology of some palm species were also studied. No former research reports on palms in these areas have been issued by now. Results and conclusion of the work turned out like following:1.Among the three methods used in the experiment of DNA extraction, only CTAB, adding PVP in the DNA isolation step, had effectively reduced the disturbance from fiber or other plastids and extracted suitable genomic DNA as template for RAPD process. PCR amplifications were performed in a final volume of 25 mm3 containing 0.5 units Taq Polymerase, 2.5 mm3 dNTPs(1mmol/dm3) , 2 mm3 primer(5umol/dm3), 2 mm3 MgCl2(2 mmol/dm3), 10 mM Tris-HCl, and 20 ng template DNA. The reaction system was covered with 20 mm3 paraffine. Forty cycles ( including denaturation 1 min at 94℃, annealing 1 min at 36℃, elongation 2min at 72℃) were followed by a final elongation step of 7 min at 72℃. Amplification was performed in a T3 PCR thermocycler. The amplification resulted with abundant polymorphic bands, better stability and repeatability.2.Genetic diversity of 12 species in Rhapis, Chuniophoenix and Trachycarpus was analyzed with RAPD molecular marker technique. 13 effective primers from 29 arbitrary 10-oligonucleotide primers were used and amplified 837 DNA bands from the 12 samples, of which 657 bands were polymorphic RAPD loci, covering 78.49% of the total. UPGMA cluster analysis on the RAPD bands and comparative study on their morphological structure demonstrated that 1), the average genetic distance between 8 species of Rhapis be 0.45, they shared a high genetic similarity and small difference in morphology; 2), the genetic distance between Rhapis humilis and R. humilis cv. was only 0.24, while the distance between R. excelsa and R.sp.(usually treated as R. excelsa var. vastifolius) reached 0.44. The later pair could be treated as two different species based on the DNA molecular taxonomic analysis; 3), genetic distance between the two species of Phoenix, which were very similar in appearance and easily confused in horticulture and appliance, was 0.33, differences in DNA molecular and morphological structure indicated they were two species i.e. Phoenix roebelenii (clustered) and P.loureierii (single).3.The character of palm leaf, palmate or pinnate, is a key to the identification and taxonomy of palmae. Which one occurred first, the palmate and the pinnate palm, is also a focus question in the discussion on the evolution and phylogenic research of palms. Based on 9 effective arbitrary primers, RAPD analysis was conducted on 10 species of two leaf-types, among which, 4 were pinnate Caryotas while the other 6 were palmate ( 2 species respectively of Trachycarpus, Chuniophoenix and Livistona). A DNA molecular dendrogram generated from the Nei’s estimate of genetic distance and similarity based on UPGMA cluster analysis on the  RAPD bands, and it indicated that palmate species and pinnate ones distributed in two different clusters, while species of the same genus clustered in a sub-group respectively among the two clusters. The average genetic distance between 6 palmate palms was 0.47, while the 4 pinnate shared 0.55, but the distance between the 6 palmate and 4 pinnate reached 0.72. Genomic DNA fingerprints showed that there were no similar DNA bands among the 10 samples, but DNA bands of the 4 pinnate shared a high similarity. This indicated that the obvious but important morphological difference in leaf-type of palms, palmate and pinnate, had evidences at the level of DNA molecular structure. But the DNA molecular marker for the character of pinnate or palmate should be probed or examined through further experiments and researches. Proof in morphological structure, chromosome number and the result from cluster dendrogram of genetic distance and similarity demonstrated some transitional/interim characters among the 4 species of Caryota, of which, C. urens and C. cumingii were ancient species.Genetic distance between Chuniophoenix hainanensis and C. nana was 0.38, and Trachycarpus fortunei and T. nana shared 0.23. But it was quite different with the two species of Livistona that genetic distance between L. chinensis and L. rotundifolia reached 0.71. L. chinensis distributed in southern China while L. rotundifolia originated in Malaya, the difference in geological distribution might have some influence upon their genetic and evolutionary relationship. 4.RAPD analysis with 7 effective primers on 11 species of different genera in Palmae was conducted to probe their genetic diversity and phylogenic relationships. 364 DNA bands, out of which 265 bands were polymorphic ones (covering 72.8% of the total), were amplified from the seven arbitrary 10- oligonucleotide primers. The genetic distance between the 11 samples was no less than 0.53, and the DNA fingerprints also showed evident differences at the DNA molecular level. According to UPGMA analysis on the genetic distances and the Nei’s index of genetic diversity, 11 species (each representing one of the 11 genera) could be divided into 3 evolution colonies. That was, Corypha, Trachycarpus, livistona， Licuala→Pinanga，Wallichia，Caryota →Ptychosperma，Phoenix，Calamus，Chamaedorea. This conclusion was in conformity with the tendacy from the plant evolutionary principles. It was also consistent with the conclusion by Moore, Uhl and Dransfield in 1987, according to the evidence from morphological structures and cytological taxonomy.5. Through qualitatively observation of the growing and existence status and quantitatively measurements of the growth rate, components and contents of leaf chlorophyll, changes of water capacity and ratio of dried and fresh leaf weight, studies on the shade-tolerance of 13 species of palm bonsais cultivated in different artificially controlled shade environment were carried out, in which, the obtained data were analyzed with the SAS 8.0 statistics soft (SAS Institute Inc., 2000). The result turned out that the 13 species could be divided into three grades according to the ability of shade-tolerance. The more shade-tolerant species included Chamaedorae cataractarum, Dypsis lutescens and Chuniophoenix nana; while Ravenea rivularis, Archontophoenix alexandra, Howea forsteriana and Phoenix loureirii were less shade-tolerant species, and Caryota mitis, Chamaedorae elegans, C. seifrizii, Licuala fordiana, Livistona chinensis and Rhapis excelsa were moderate ones.The lowest light intensity needed by the 13 bonsai palms was about 1200~2100lux (about 3% of the full sunlight 40000-70000lux at noon). The optimum light intensity for the plants of Howea forsteriana, Chuniophoenix nana, Chamaedorae cataractarum, Licuala fordiana, Livistona chinensis, Caryota mitis and Rhapis excelsa was 1200~7000lux (about 3%~10% of the full sunlight), and these palms fitted to grow in communities of high cover rate or be used indoor decoration. The optimum light intensity for Phoenix loureierii, Ravenea rivularis, Archontophoenix alexandra and Chamaedorae seifrizii was 7000~24500lux (about 10%~35% of the full sunlight). These species are suitable to be planted in the middle layer of different communities. Do not last too long when they are used in indoor arrangement. Although the 13 palms grew more leaves and improved their ornamental value, their leaf area enlarged but became thinner, water capacity and chlorophyll contents in leaves increased, leaf color turned deep green in a comparatively shade environment, they would grow thinner and thinner or even die when put into a bitter shade environment (about 1% of the full sunlight) for a longer time. It is better to maintain them outdoor alternatively for a certain time (every month or every season), when they are used in indoor decoration.6. Studies on monthly changes in caloric values and ash contents of 8 species palm leaves were also conducted for the first time with an oxygen bomb thermometer. From high to low in the 8 palms, the sequence of ash contents was: Chamaedorea brachypoda> Caryota mitis> Chamaedorea cataractarum> Rhapis gracilis> Sabal minor> Areca triandra >Butia capitata > Chamaerops humilis. Gross caloric values from big to small were: Butia capitata > Chamaedorea cataractarum ≈Chamaerops humilis ≈Sabal minor > Rhapis gracilis > Areca triandra > Chamaedorea brachypoda  > Caryota mitis, Ash free caloric values from big to small were: Butia capitata> Chamaedorea cataractarum >Chamaedorea brachypoda> Rhapis gracilis> Sabal minor> Areca triandra> Chamaerops humilis> Caryota mitis.The changes of ash contents and leaf caloric values of the palms indicated the adoptability to their cultivating environment at some extent. This would guide the cultivating and applying practice on the plants.Results of the research demonstrated that palms held high ash contents, but the monthly change trends differed from each other around a year. The average gross caloric values of leaves of 8 palms was 19.8kJ/g. It was lower than that of the coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest (21.34kJ/g) and that of the mosoon evergreen broad-leaved forest (20.63kJ/g) in the neighbor area of Dinghushan mountain in Guangdong, but it was close to the average ash contents of leaf of both mangroves (19.51kJ/g) in Dongzhaigang in Hainan and 10 species of Ficus(19.05kJ/g) in Xiamen, and it was much higher than the ash contents of bamboo leaves (17.67kJ/g) which belonged to the same monocotyledon with palms. The average ash-free caloric value of 8 palm leaves was 21.70kJ/g, it was lower than the average ash-free caloric value of leaves  of 8 trees in the arbor layer of coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest (22.43kJ/g)in Dinghushan mountain in Guangdong, but it was higher than that  of 46 species of bamboo leaves (20.85kJ/g)in Hua’an county of Fujian, and it was near to the average ash free caloric value of 8 tree leaves in the arbor layer of mosoon broad-leaved forest in Dinghushan mountain in Guangdong. This indicated that palms could become effective components in enriching the biodiversity of the urban and suburb area, and they could yield evident ecological benefits,as well as landscape values in the construction of urban green system.Among the 8 palms, Chamaerops humilis, Rhapis gracilis and Sabal minor were palmate-leaved palms, the average ash-free caloric value of their leaves was 21.12kJ/g, while the average ash-free caloric value of the other 5 pinnate palm leaves (Chamaedorea brachypoda, Caryota mitis, Chamaedorea cataractarum, Areca triandra, Butia capitata) was 21.88kJ/g. the ash-free caloric values between these two leaf-type palms were not interrelated.

TI  - Circum-harbour afforestation plan around Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong
AU  - Loh, Kwai Lam Dorothy
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Harbourfront greening to make better use of the unique harbour assets is Hong Kong Government's long-term vision of waterfront gentrification. Land reclamation in the Victoria Harbour has always been a cardinal way to cope with rapid urbanization in Hong Kong, producing more than 60 km2 (5.5%) of land within the 1,100 km2 territory since 1870s. With very limited public open space in built-up areas, impermeability and compactness of the city has generated extensive areas of saturated site coverage and negligence of plantable areas. Waterfront greening and circum-harbour hillslope enrichment were investigated to yield pragmatic recommendations to improve city greenery. This study evaluates greening constraints in the city, finds potential sites for greening improvement, assesses feasibility of reviving degraded peri-hillslopes, and selects appropriate species to faciliate vegetation establishment. Solutions are proposed to increase green spaces along the coastal zone, connectivity among green spaces, pedestrian accessibility to the waterfront precinct, and per-urban woodland expansion. The study is carried out at two locations: (1) the waterfront of Victoria Harbour including one to two street blocks adjacent to the coast; and (2) the urban fringe hillslopes which constitute a viewshed visible from the harbour. The waterfront section is divided into four harbourfront zones according to land use, prospect of potential development and land formation characteristics. Nearly 6 km2 of coastal land are included in the assessment. Major trunk roads and district distributors are included for a comprehensive site analysis. Peri-urban hillslopes in five zones are delineated by natural topographic boundaries of prominent hills. Sluggish natural forest succession at some sites is attributed to instability of slopes and poor site conditions. There is room for improvement in terms of species selection, silvicultural treatment, and maintenance to accelerate woodland establishment at poor sites. To serve as indicators of planting capability, the site assessment of underlying constraints included slope steepness, aspect and instability, landform, parent materials and terrain components. The Greening Potential Index (GPI) in five classes, developed to measure greening possibility of individual coastal sites, shows many high potential sites among 14 districts, of which 42 specific locations were identified for specific on-site and roadside greening recommendations. The Hillslope Suitability Index (HSI) in four classes was formulated to indicate hillslope planting suitability for a 5-year customised afforestation plan. With 43% of the sites in the second unfavourable class, tree planting requires special treatments and efforts. This plan aims at rehabilitating poor sites in the first stage, and enhancement planting of better sites thereafter. Mixed planting with more native species is preferred to enrich plant diversity of woodlands. The greening endeavours aim at the quality and quantity of natural elements, allowing the limited plantable areas in the city to accommodate the optimal vegetation. All vacant or underused space should be enlisted in the greening programmes. The findings hint strongly the need for a different mindset and methodology to bring more green parcels in built-up areas and to enhance the natural backdrop of the city.

TI  - The Relationship Between Species Diversity and Genetic Diversity in a Fragmented Forest System: A Case Study of Carex leptonervia in the Montérégie, Québec
AU  - Polcz, Catherine
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The fragmentation of native temperate forests is a defining issue of rural and urban development in southern Québec. From a forest plant perspective, as natural forest habitat is reduced and subdivided into smaller, more isolated patches, environmental conditions are altered, population size is decreased, and species dispersal may be interrupted. Thus, fragmentation may cause reduced species and genetic diversity in plant systems. Traditionally, ecological and population genetic studies have assessed the impacts of fragmentation on the two measures of diversity separately. In this thesis, we consider both fundamental aspects of biodiversity in a fragmented system. We chose to compare the genetic diversity (GD) of Carex letponervia with species diversity (SD) at two levels: study site and community level. Study site SD measurements approximate the diversity of all plant species growing in a forest, and community SD measurements describe the diversity of plant species growing with C. leptonervia. In chapter 2 of this thesis we describe the development of seven simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers we developed for C. leptonervia. In chapter 3 we describe our overall goal of relating landscape structure, genetic diversity, and species diversity. We hypothesize that site area, connectivity, and environment will similarly impact SD of C. leptonervia communities and GD of C. leptonervia and that SD and GD are positively correlated.To address this, we assessed overall plant species richness in 20 forest patches ranging from six to over 2000 hectares. Within each forest, we also measured species diversity of the plant community associated with C. leptonervia by centering seven 4 m² quadrats on focal C. leptonervia plants. Thirty individuals of C. leptonervia, including one from each of the focal quadrats, were sampled at each site to assess genetic diversity. Genetic diversity was characterized using six of the SSR loci that we developed in chapter 2. We found that species richness (SR) at the forest patch level shows a strong positive trend with patch area, but not with connectivity among patches. We found that at the point-community level, high SR related to high values of SR at the overall site and that Shannon diversity was positively correlated to community extent. We found no evidence that soil characteristics (pH and percent organic matter) impact values of point-community diversity. To assess patterns in genetic diversity, we ran tests of isolation-by-distance, Nei's GST, and a Bayesian clustering analysis. These results all show that C. leptonervia has low population structure and that there is gene flow throughout the Montérégie. To test for a species diversity-genetic diversity correlation (SGDC), we conducted Pearson correlation tests between all GD measures and SD measures (site and point-communities). We found that gene diversity exhibited a positive significant correlation to species richness at the site level but was not significantly correlated to the diversity of C. leptonervia point-communities. These results indicate that processes important at the level of site are also important in maintaining GD. We conclude that for an ecologically flexible and well-dispersed species, it is likely that the point-community diversity as estimated by quadrat sampling underestimates the actual diversity of species co-existing with C. leptonervia, and that the diversity of site may provide a more accurate approximation. We conclude that the parallel process driving the correlation is likely study site area. Surprisingly, we found that landscape connectivity was not an important determinant of SD or GD. In conclusion, we propose that linking population genetics and community ecology can further an understanding of natural systems and also that isolated forests are important in maintaining diversity in the Montérégie.

TI  - Ecophysiology and genetic variation in domestication of Sphaeralcea  and Shepherdia species for the Intermountain West
AU  - Sriladda, Chalita
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Low-water landscaping is an essential tool for water conservation in the arid Intermountain West (IMW) for managing limited supplies and population-driven increased demand. The IMW harbors a large number of drought-tolerant native species that have potential for use in the low-water use landscape (LWL). However, many species are not available in the nursery trade due to their morphological confusion and establishment difficulty in the managed landscapes. The overall goal of this study is to elucidate morphological, ecophysiological, and genetic distinctions within two IMW native plant genera containing species with high urban low-water landscape potential.For the first study, morphological and genetic variations among populations of four putative Sphaeralcea species were evaluated using canonical variate analysis (CVA) on the basis of morphological characteristics of their type specimens, and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP). The putative S. grossulariifolia was not significantly different morphologically and genetically from S. coccinea, similar to the relationship between S. munroana and  S. parvifolia. The results in the Mantel’s correlation tests suggest there are con-specific species due to isolation-by-distance within each composite group, and the putative S. munroana appeared to be an ecotype of S. parvifolia.In the second study, environmental conditions, morphology, and AFLP genetic variations among populations of Shepherdia rotundifolia in its native habitats were evaluated. Environmental conditions in selected six populations varied among populations in terms of elevation, precipitation, temperature, relative light intensity (RLI), and soil properties. Leaf area, specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf trichome structure exhibited adaptive traits to shady environments as well as hot and dry summer and cold winter environments in its native habitats. The SLA was significantly correlated with RLI, soil organic matter, and potassium.In the third study, interspecific hybrid S. rotundifolia x argentea was created to achieve the aesthetic quality of  S. rotundifolia and wet soil tolerance of S. argentea. The hybrid was intermediate morphologically and genetically (AFLP) to its parents. Trichome structure and physiological responses in terms of diurnal stomatal conductance (gs), photosynthetic light response curve, midday photosynthesis assimilation (Pn), and midday quantum efficiency (PhiPS2) of the hybrid were also more similar to  S. argentea than to S. rotundifolia. The physiological responses of the hybrid compared to its parents may suggest tolerance to regularly watered conditions.

TI  - The Viability of Conservation Subdivisions as Habitat for Urban Carnivores in North Central Texas Suburbs
AU  - Wood, Sherry Fabricant
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The purpose of this research is to examine perceptions of conservation subdivisions as habitat for urban carnivores in North Central Texas suburbs. This research was conducted through the University of Texas at Arlington; Landscape Architecture Program. The literature review examines the history of conservation subdivisions and their use within North Central Texas as well as their application as an ecological solution to present-day threats to biodiversity with a focus on mammalian apex carnivores. It further explores their use as habitat in the context of urban patches and corridors. Additionally, the practice of bioregionalism was reviewed in contrast to current political boundaries governing North Central Texas cities as related to conservation subdivisions. This study targets conservation subdivisions located within the North Central Texas Councils of Government (NCTCOG), the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) metropolitan statistical area of North Texas. The subdivision ecoregions represented include Cross Timbers and Blackland Prairies.The study employs qualitative research methods to gain insight into participant perceptions. Phone interviews were compiled from 14 Interview subjects chosen for their professional work related to or knowledge of conservation subdivisions or urban ecology in the study area. All respondents consented to be named and are considered experts in their field. Findings were attained through a process of rigorous coding methods and domain analysis.As the profession of landscape architecture increases its reach and influence in our natural and built world, it is important to gain awareness of urban development in various contexts. In the context of conservation subdivisions in North Central Texas suburbs, this research furthers public and professional knowledge concerning urban wildlife habitat for urban carnivores and its implications towards conservation efforts overall.These data support the view that conservation subdivisions are, in part, a viable solution as a conservation tool and are perceived as viable habitat for urban carnivores in the study area. However, further community education and research are needed to expand the effective use of conservation subdivisions in North Texas. The development of conservation subdivisions in the study area is perceived as a developer marketing tool to increase profits and fall short of intended conservation goals lacking actionable long-term maintenance plans. Recommendations based on the findings and for future research are presented to improve the future sustainability of urban wildlife habitat and therefore increase wildlife diversity and open space conservation within high-density, metropolitan areas.

AU  - Shoemaker, Douglas Allen
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The shift of global populations to cities heralds a new epoch marked by human impact, the Anthropocene, and with it radical changes to the biosphere. Some of the most significant change has occurred in developing countries, where amenity migration to rural areas within commuting distance of expanding urban centers has fundamentally restructured the configuration, hydrology and ecologies of surrounding watersheds. The export of urbanization to the countryside is manifested by rapid conversions of greenfields to impervious covers designed for human use, conversions that have consumed and fragmented networks of green infrastructure supporting growing populations. While the benefits of urbanization to human populations have been substantial, the ability of novel and evolving landscapes to sustain the production of environmental services, such as the ability to purify water, sequester climate-changing carbon, and harbor biodiversity, is poorly understood and historically shown to be compromised. The pace of urbanization, and particularly the combinatorial effects of climate change and development-caused hydrological alteration, has made the task of managing landscapes for human well-being increasingly difficult. Given the persistence of land change drivers such as urban population growth, there is a critical need to describe the trajectory of land cover change using both theory and projection, and anticipate impacts associated with urban form in order to proactively respond to environmental vulnerabilities. A socio-ecological systems approach to the challenge of sustainable environmental provisioning has facilitated efforts to understand the dynamics of co-evolving human and environmental systems. However, a lack of concise theory regarding urban pattern and process, and the paucity of representative case study, has left the role of spatial structure in modulating ecosystem function largely unexplored. To overcome some of these challenges, I describe a series of three related studies where I used a novel integration of land change and ecosystem services simulations in order to map and measure the co-evolution of human and natural systems in transitioning socio-ecological landscapes (SEL), and generate ecosystemscale cause and effect data. In the first study I used this data to estimate the costs of waterborne non-point source pollution, carbon sequestration, and land cover based revenues for a rapidly urbanizing model system over a 24 year period. I also compared the effect associated with alternative patterns of urban growth, contrasting sprawl, infill and de-regulated scenarios with business as usual trends to gauge the effectiveness of environmental planning paradigms, such as “smart growth”. In the second, I tested the capacity a leading theory to explain the role of spatial heterogeneity in modulating ecosystem function in urban systems, to induce the integrated simulation results. Using structural equation modeling to translate the conceptualizations of Alberti (2005) into testable hypotheses, I tested for direct, indirect and modulating effects of landscape composition, connectivity, form, and land use intensity on the production of NPSP and carbon storage. In the third I examined land cover projection data for the presence of patterns suggesting that landscapes evolved in predictable ways. Using a dynamic proxy to bridge human and environmental effect, I tracked the evolution of connectivity in urbanizing watersheds by holding magnitude of change constant for three pattern alternative, and analyzing spatial configuration using distance-based, structural and circuit-based methods. These methods represent a move to predictive, rather than reactive, analytical paradigm, and allow us to move beyond the focus of managing current problems. They emphasize the utility of integrated urban growth-ecosystem service analyses in order to anticipate environmental trade-offs likely required by society. My findings emphasize the need for ecosystem service analyses to more adequately understand development tradeoffs in the metropolitan context. We conclude that not all urban growth impacts environments evenly, and that by controlling the compositional mix, configuration and connectedness, not just the amount of development, we can influence more benign environmental outcomes. To reduce environmental impacts regionally, planners are advised to manage amplifying effects of development by maintaining land cover diversity, and limiting the connectivity of developed land covers along hydrological gradients.

TI  - Effects of vegetative structure and surrounding land uses on avian communities in the floodplain forests of Maryland
AU  - Ruth, Janet Marlise
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Conservation of forest-associated birds requires an understanding of the effects of forest fragmentation on bird communities. Previous studies have shown that forest area and isolation, local vegetation, and nest predation/parasitism are important factors affecting birds in fragmented landscapes. Less work has been done on the effects of specific surrounding land-uses on forest bird communities.Point counts were used to compare the bird communities in eight floodplain forest sites bordered by upland forest or residential development along the Patuxent River in Maryland. Birds were classified into several life history guilds to determine which were the best predictors of community differences. Data were tested for treatment effects with nested ANOVA, and to identify vegetation and surrounding land-use characteristics with greatest influence on the bird communities by multiple regression and ANOCOVA.Habitat use guilds were better predictors of differences in the bird communities than any other life history criteria. Interior and area-sensitive species were negatively affected by surrounding residential development, possibly due to avoidance of edge habitat; edge and urban species were not negatively affected, and appeared to benefit, likely due to increased availability of edge and open habitat. The patterns observed in the habitat use guilds appeared to drive the patterns (and lack of patterns) observed in the other life history guilds, particularly the migratory status, foraging, and nesting guilds.Vegetative structure also differed--percent ground cover and variation in foliage density were both greater in sites adjacent to residential development than in those adjacent to upland forest. Both local vegetation and surrounding land-use were predictors for some individual species and avian life history guild abundance.The effects of surrounding land-use factors are complex. Biological researchers and resource managers should exercise caution when using life history guilds, avoiding those criteria that might obscure important results. Those managing for forest-associated Neotropical migrants should focus resources on protecting interior or area-sensitive species. Species specific information is important in supplementing the general predictions based on habitat use guilds. Land development and acquisition planning should give priority to preserving floodplain forest sites which are contiguous with upland forest.

T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Relationships between isolating land use and amphibian populations in sub-boreal peatlands of the Midwestern United States  Jeana Albers  Master of Science in Biology  Minnesota State University, Mankato  Mankato, Minnesota, 2014  Successful conservation efforts of amphibians depend on the knowledge of habitat preferences because the biggest threat to amphibian populations is considered to be habitat loss.  Sub-boreal peatlands in the Midwest may be a refuge for amphibian populations, but little is known about the flora and fauna of these peatlands.  My study examined amphibian species richness and species diversity in 17 sub-boreal peatlands in Minnesota and Wisconsin in 2011 and 2012.  I assessed the relationship between land use of lands adjacent to peatlands and use of those peatlands by amphibian populations at three spatial scales by examining landscapes surrounding peatlands in circles with radii of  500, 1000, and 2500 m.  I tested for linear relationships of both species richness and species diversity with habitat variables including peatland area, aqueous pH, geographic isolation, canopy cover, and the proportions of forest and isolating land use (agricultural and urban) in the three radii. I hypothesized that high levels of isolating land use isolate peatlands via habitat loss and degradation of surrounding land.  I predicted that species richness and diversity would be low in peatlands that experienced high levels of agricultural and urban land use because they were more isolated.  I found no support for my prediction for the correlation of isolating land use with lower amphibian diversity and    richness, but isolation was an important indicator of species richness, with more isolated peatlands having fewer species present.  Canopy cover was also an important predictor of species richness at all three spatial scales in 2012, with greater canopy cover correlating with lower species richness.  Other studies corroborate my findings in regard to isolation and canopy cover having negative effects on amphibian populations, and because of this and my findings, I suggest that conservation efforts for amphibians in sub-boreal peatlands be focused on maintaining connectivity between peatlands, and prioritize those that have little canopy cover to be refuges for remaining populations.

TI  - An investigation of the industrial ecology of business start -up survival
AU  - Renski, Henry C.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - This study examines the influence of external economies on the survival and longevity of new independent businesses in the continental U.S. It hypothesizes that new firms with access to the sources of specialized inputs, labor, product markets and knowledge spillovers will outlive those in areas of relative isolation. The size of the region and the diversity of its industrial base are also considered as possible sources of beneficial external economies. The findings show that while external economies have a statistically significant influence on new firm survival, the effects are typically very modest. The most consistently significant effects are found for localization, which lowers the risk of new firm failure in five of the nine detailed study industries examined: farm and garden machinery, metalworking machinery, motor vehicle parts, advertising and computer and data programming services. After controlling for other sources of external economies, the size of the region is insignificant for most industries. By contrast, regional industrial diversity reduces hazard rates for new firms in drugs, advertising, computer and data processing, and research and testing services. Measures representing the specific sources of localization are statistically significant in fewer industries than the broadly defined measures of localization, but when significant they often have a stronger influence on new firm longevity. Among the specific sources of localization, proximity to specialized input suppliers is the most consistently significant, reducing hazard rates for new firms in metalworking machinery, advertising, and computer and data processing services. Proximity to intermediate product markets is only significantly beneficial in the professional services sector. Labor pooling is either insignificant or found to increase new firm hazard rates, but only after the other sources of localization are controlled. Industry knowledge spillovers significantly reduce hazard rates for new firms in the drugs and motor vehicle parts industry, but the accuracy of the variable may be sensitive to industry-specific differences in the economic value of patenting. This study also investigates whether and how the size of the establishment influences new firms' ability to benefit from their external environment. The evidence suggests that smaller businesses are the most common beneficiaries of external economies, but not in all cases. There are several examples, most commonly for urbanization, where external economies increase the failure rates of larger plants while having little effect on smaller ones. There are also several industries where an increase in external economies produces a relative reduction in hazard rates for medium sized plants, but have little effect on smaller plants. Overall the research implies that entrepreneurial development strategies are likely to be more effective if designed to capitalize upon a region's existing strengths and assets. The beneficial influence of localization and diversity are often strongest when estimated at larger spatial scales, i.e. those approximating the size of commuting sheds and labor market areas. That provides some conditional support for rural development strategies aimed at strengthening ties to nearby metropolitan areas.

TI  - Urban Alaskan Moose: An Analysis of Factors Associated with Moose-Vehicle Collisions
AU  - McDonald, Lucian R.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - As human populations continue to grow and encroach into wildlife habitats, instances of human-wildlife conflict are on the rise. Increasing numbers of reported wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) provide tangible evidence of anthropogenic impacts on wildlife as well as increasing threats to human health and safety. Increasing WVCs are of particular concern, especially those involving large-bodied ungulates such as moose (Alces spp.), because of the increased risk of property damage, personal injuries, and human fatalities. Motorists directly involved in a WVC are at risk of injury or mortality, but other motorists are also put at risk due to road obstructions and traffic congestion associated with WVCs. Mitigating these impacts on motorists and wildlife requires investigation into the temporal and spatial factors leading to WVCs.In Alaska, most WVCs involve moose (Alces alces), a large bodied ungulate capable of threatening human life when involved in a collision. Each moose-vehicle collision (MVC) in Alaska is estimated to cost $33,000 in damages. With this analysis, I analyzed the plethora of factors contributing to moose and motorist occurrence on the road system and motorist detection based on a historical dataset of MVC reports throughout Alaska from 2000 to 2012 and a dataset of field-derived measurements at MVC locations within the Matanuska-Susitna Borough from 2016 to 2018. My first analysis focused on the daily and annual trends in MVC rates as compared to expected moose and human behavioral patterns with a focus on guiding mitigation strategies. Fifty percent of the MVCs reported between 2000 and 2012 occurred where the commuter rush hours overlapped with dusk and dawn in winter, and the artificial lighting differences between boroughs suggest a link between artificial lighting and reduced MVCs.To focus more specifically on roadside features contributing to MVC risk, I collected and analyzed local and regional scale land cover and road geometry data at reported MVC sites in an area with a rapidly growing human population. I compared these data to similar data collected at random locations near documented MVC sites and at locations where moose that were fitted with global-positioning system (GPS) transmitters crossed highways. I used generalized additive mixed models to delineate which of the variables impacted the risk of both moose road crossings and MVCs. Moose road crossings were influenced by approximations of spatial, seasonal, and daily moose density as well as the proportion of deciduous-coniferous and coniferous forest in the area and the number of possible corridor or land cover types surrounding the site. The best MVC risk model was described by expected seasonal and daily changes in moose density and local scale measurements, including the sinuosity of the road, the height of vegetation near the road, and the angle between the road surface and the roadside. Together this information should guide transportation and urban planners in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough to use roadside vegetation removal, seasonal speed reduction, improved lighting strategies, dynamic signage, or partnerships with mobile mapping services to reactively reduce MVCs and to focus future road planning in areas with lower moose abundance and build roads that increase visibility and detection distances in areas where moose are common.

TI  - Comparative phylogeography, phylogenetics, and population genomics of East African montane small mammals
AU  - Demos, Terrence Constant
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The Eastern Afromontane region of Africa is characterized by striking levels of endemism and species richness which rank it as a global biodiversity hotspot for diverse plants and animals including mammals, but has been poorly sampled and little studied to date. Using mtDNA and multi-locus nDNA sequence data, genome-wide RAD-Seq SNP data, and morphological data, I identify major cryptic biogeographic patterns within and between 11 co-distributed small mammal species/species groups across the Eastern Afromontane region. I focus on two endemic montane small mammal species complexes, Hylomyscus  mice and Sylvisorex shrews, co-distributed across the Albertine Rift (AR) and Kenya Highlands (KH) of the Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity Hotspot. I characterize patterns of phylogeographic structure, demographic history, phylogenetic relationships and undescribed biodiversity across these taxa. Putative independently evolving lineages are inferred using a combination of distribution data, coalescent species delimitation and historical demographic inference.  Hypotheses put forward to account for the high diversity of the region include both retention of older palaeo-endemic lineages across major regions in climatically stable refugia, as well as the accumulation of lineages associated with more recent differentiation between allopatric populations separated by unsuitable habitat at the LGM. Populations have persisted since the Pliocene to mid-Pleistocene across a climatic gradient from the AR in the west to the KH in the east for both focal taxa. Deeply divergent and sympatric cryptic lineages, previously unidentified, are strongly supported in both mice and shrews, highlighting the broad temporal scale at which cyclical climatic changes over the last 5 Ma may have contributed to high species diversity and endemism in the Eastern Afromontane Hotspot. Complete genome-wide SNP matrices for Hylomyscus and Sylvisorex are used in population genetic analyses that support lineages not uncovered by the 3-6 locus dataset. Graphs of population splits and admixture support substantial gene flow from AR into KH shrew populations subsequent to isolation that occurred 2.5-3.5 million years earlier, possibly by intermittent colonization. A new species, Hylomyscus kerbispeterhansi, is described from Kenya using combined morphological and multi-locus data sets.

TI  - Multiple Controls of Carbon and Nitrogen Processes in Freshwater Wetlands of the Mid-Atlantic United States with Implications for Ecosystem Restoration and Disturbance
AU  - Korol, Alicia
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen and carbon supports the structure and functioning of all ecosystems and provides valued products and services essential to human well-being. Understanding the controls on these cycles and their interactions with ecological components at multiple scales predicts spatial patterns and response to environmental disturbance, guides management of these resources, and informs environmental policy. This dissertation synthesizes research conducted in three different freshwater wetlands to demonstrate interacting drivers of carbon and nitrogen processes that are important for understanding how ecosystems will respond to large anthropogenic modification. The first two studies in freshwater mesocosms involved tests of the effects of macrophyte planting diversity on biomass production and on three nitrogen cycle processes. Empirical evidence and theory link plant diversity to greater ecosystem functioning. Thirty-four mesocosms were planted with four functionally-distinct macrophyte species across a richness gradient (1, 2, 3, or 4 species). The elevated aboveground biomass of communities in the most species-rich mixtures at the end of the first growing season was temporary, and monocultures of a single species on average produced greater aboveground biomass compared to the most species-rich mixtures by the end of the second growing season. The suppression of biomass production in the two perennials was attributed to a dominant annual found commonly in palustrine wetlands of northern Virginia and early successional vegetation communities. The second study evaluated whether plant richness, along with biomass and tissue N content, had positive effects on soil N processing—ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification—at the end of the second growing season. Greater species richness was related to greater net ammonification potential, but lower net nitrification potential and denitrification potential. By contrast, lower biomass and/or lower tissue N content, characteristics of the two annuals, had stimulatory effects on all three nitrogen processes. The results of the first two studies inform the design of newly-planted restored wetlands and highlight the tradeoffs between managing for multiple ecosystem functions. This research adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that restored ecosystems may not maximize all ecosystem functions and demonstrates that establishing plant diversity in early-successional wetland plant communities may come at the expense of plant productivity and soil biogeochemical development. At the same time, the identification of mechanisms that inhibit these wetland functions suggests restoration designs for alleviating that inhibition ( e.g., spatial or temporal heterogeneity in hydrologic conditions) to best promote multiple functions in restored wetlands. The third and fourth studies were investigations of the controls of denitrification in floodplains of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Largescale characteristics of floodplains, including hydrogeomorphic or landscape features ( i.e., climate, physiography, or ecosystem patterns), are of practical use for the prediction of denitrification due to emerging largescale datasets and because these characteristics may aggregate the effects of local vegetation or soil biogeochemical characteristics on denitrification. Results from the investigation of 18 nontidal floodplains indicated that the highest rates of denitrification are likely to be found in agricultural and urban watersheds with stream-floodplain hydrologic connectivity promoting sedimentation. All largescale predictors, including seasonal air temperature and channel width-to-depth ratio, explained between 43–57% of variation in the denitrification measurements and should be useful for prediction across the Chesapeake Bay watershed. In a study of TFFWs in Virginia, potential for denitrification and nitrate-limitation of denitrification were studied along two adjacent rivers that differed notably in concentrations and loads of nitrogen (Pamunkey River carries more nitrogen than the Mattaponi River). Patterns of denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) in TFFWs were found along a longitudinal gradient but not between rivers. DEA was greater in all tidal wetlands (three sites on each river) than nontidal forested wetlands (one site on each river). Further, DEA was positively related to soil organic matter, carbon, and nitrogen, and negatively related to bulk density in tidal hummocks, relationships which were all mediated by a longitudinal gradient with highest DEA rates at the lower tidal sites. Modification to hydrogeomorphic processes from accelerated sea level rise may alter these longitudinal gradients in TFFWs. The results of the third and fourth studies inform currently poor understanding of denitrification patterns in floodplains at landscape and regional scales. The studies both demonstrate the existence of largescale predictable patterns in denitrification that have only rarely been demonstrated in the literature. The identification of these patterns alleviate uncertainty in the process given its highly variable nature, which has stymied attempts to confidently extrapolate denitrification rates from one floodplain to another. As such, the research findings on hotspots of the process guides the prioritization of nontidal floodplains for the purposes of restoration as well as predicts how nitrogen removal capabilities of TFFWs will change given quickening sea level rise.

AU  - Siddiqui, Selima Jehan
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Synoptic coverage of Southwestern Luzon provided by remote sensing images and new digital terrain data yields new insight into the geomorphology, geologic history and structure of Taal Volcano. Structural evidence for the occurrence of extension at Taal is determined, and a mechanism linking extension and volcanism at Taal to termination of a proximal right-lateral fault, is proposed. The morphologies and structure of other volcanic centers in SW Luzon are also examined, and similar mechanisms of control to their locations are proposed.Taal is characterized by both historically frequent, highly explosive eruptions, and by prehistoric eruption(s) of colossal proportions. The current eruptive center (Volcano Island) occupies a prehistoric, lake-filled volcano-tectonic depression, previously interpreted to be a graben containing caldera(s). Taal is located within an ENE-aligned volcanic region called the Macolod Corridor, which lies broadly normal to the trend of the Bataan-Mindoro subduction-related volcanic arc. The Macolod Corridor is characterized by recently erupted primitive basalts and NE-striking normal faults; therefore previous investigators have argued that Macolod Corridor volcanism is controlled by extension or trans-tension. A major goal of this study is to more closely examine structural evidence for extension.The development of a complete structural understanding of Taal has been impeded largely by poor field access and exposure, due to ubiquitous dense vegetation. This study therefore employs eight remote sensing and digital terrain data sets of SW Luzon as sources of geomorphic and structural information. The data sets include radar backscatter data, the most useful of which is Shuttle Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C) multi-channel data; two Digital Elevation Maps (OEMs), one of radar derivation, and one of topographic map derivation; a Digital Bathymetric Map (DBM) of Lake Taal; and a SPOT multispectral scene of Taal VTD. The DBM is mosaicked with the two DEMs to provide comprehensive views of Taal VTD.

AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorAs an important component of eco-city construction, improving the ecological property of urban parks is the development direction of modern urban parks, however, there is still lack of a valid index system to evaluate ecological property of urban parks. The present study focused on the connotation of ecological property, set up an index system for evaluating ecological property of urban parks with Delphi Method and Analytic Hierarchy Process. Thereafter, seven typical urban parks in Xiamen were taken as a case to verify the index system. Firstly, this study set up an index system for evaluating ecological property of urban parks taking the rationality of ecological structure as well as the efficiency of functions as the criterias. The index system consisted of four aspects, which were community structure, landscape pattern, ecological service function and garden ornamental function. Then the degree of ecological property was divided into four grades according to their scores, which were excellent(grade I), good(grade II), fair(grade III), and poor(grade IV). Secondly, we measured the principal indexes such as vegetation quantity, tree species diversity, landscape diversity, birds diversity, and carbon fixation and oxygen release, decrease of temperature and increase of humidity, dust-retention and noise reduction in seven typical parks of Xiamen. According to their vegetation characteristics, seven parks were classified to semi-natural parks(Huweishan Park, Xianyue Park and Zhonglun Park)and artificial parks(Zhongshan Park, Nanhu Park, Bailuzhou Park and Huli Park). Finally, these seven parks were evaluated using the index system and the evaluating scores were in the order of Huweishan Park(0.6830, II)>Xianyue Park(0.6698, II)>Zhongshan Park(0.6365, II)>Nanhu Park(0.6120, II)>Zhonglun Park(0.6057, II)>Huli Park(0.5181, III)>Bailuzhou Park(0.5067, III). According to our investigation and evaluation, the structure and function of the seven parks were further analyzed. The results indicated that Huweishan Park and Xianyue Park had higher green space ratios and native species percentages, richer community levels and more diverse bird species than artificial parks. Their average patch areas were larger and plaque integrity and connectivity were better, but the landscape diversities were lower. These two parks thus had better ecological service functions, but weak garden ornamental functions. In Zhonglun Park, the community structure was simplified after artificial modification, and its ecological service functions were poorer than the other semi-natural pakrs. In the artificial parks, Zhongshan Park and Nanhu Park had more diverse tree species than the others, with more rational collocation of native species and exotic species. The landscape types were diverse, but their fragmentation degrees were high. In Bailuzhou Park, the community structure was simple and tree species were poor. In Huli Park, there was a large number of recreation facilities and water surface area and the green space ratio was low. With regard to functions, Zhongshan Park had strong ecological service functions while the other three artificial parks had weak ecological service functions, but strong garden ornamental functions. In a word, there were better ecological structures and ecological service functions in semi-natural parks, but stronger ornamental functions in artificial parks. This study set up the index system for evaluating ecological property with strong scientificity and feasibility. It had certain reference value to ecological construction of urban

TI  - Effects of urbanization on pattern and typical function of regional wetlands
AU  - Zhao, Hui
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorGlobal urbanization has dramatically impacted various kinds of wetlands in the last decades. China has also been experiencing rapid urbanization due to the intensive economic growth and industrialization since market-oriented economic reformation in 1978. During the past three decades, large areas of wetlands in east and south estuarine cities of China disappeared and the remaining areas became vulnerable due to urban industry, agriculture and domestic developments. In the paper, two regions with different development patterns of urbanization were choosed as typical examples. There is cluster-style development pattern of urbanization in the Pearl River estuary (PRE), and decentralized development pattern of urbanization exists in Longitudinal Range-Gorge Region (LRGR). The objectives of this paper are to: 1) conduct a systematic and holistic quantitative studies on the wetland pattern and ecological function under the stress of varous activites of urban based on the change of wetland pattern caused by urbanization; 2) discuss the spatial pattern of evolution of wetlands, the changes of typical ecological function, and the relationship between spatial pattern of wetlands and the main ecological functions; 3) examine the driving mechanism of degradation of wetland functions; 4) divide function zones base on the wetland function and establish rational control strategies. The research results can be summarized as follows: 1) The evolution characteristics of wetland patterns were studied in three decades in the Pearl River Estuary. From 1979 to 2009, the net loss of area of wetlands was 1/3 (12383 km2) and the occupied area ratio also decreased from 53.36% to 38.91%. We found that the tendency that nature wetlands changed to constructed wetlands and then to urban land was obvious in the process of transfer of wetlands and the direct and major way for degradation of wetland was cluster-style development of urban land. The urbanization can greatly exacerbate the transition activities of different types of wetlands resulted from that the total transition index (TTI) were far greater than the net transition index (NTI). Meanwhile, based on the analysis methods of river network and landscape network, wetland network in PRE was constructed using the vector data of wetland. The length, connectivity and complexity of river corridor have already been reduced from 1979 to 2009. Wetland networks in PRE have a trend of evolution, inverted "V" type to "# "type, then to main river-way. 2) Water purification functions of wetlands and drive mechanism from urbanization were studied from 1979 to 2009 in PRE. The wetland network structure index Dr,β,γ,α are closely related to the capacity of water purification. The good corridor connectivity and patches near degrees are the important conditions for network water purification. Estuary wetland pattern changes have a direct impact on the water purification in regional wetland system, which is irreversible with lands for city construction lack gradually. 3) The evolution characteristics of wetland patterns were studied in three decades in the LRGR. Highway construction is closely related to urban development. Perfect highway construction is not only the base of city development, but also an important style of urban system formation. The relationship between mountainous city land and highway density can be described by the linear regression equation. Highway development in mountains is the foundation conditions of urban sprawl, and also is main ways of urbanization impact on wetlands. By analyzing wetland pattern driven by the highway construction, the wetland density in the highway buffer (2000m) is decreased from 0.10 km-1 to 0.06 km-1. Patches density and edge density of the natural wetland and artificial wetland in the buffers present the increasing trend, and the increasing trend is evident. The results indicated that natural wetlands and artificial wetlands were gradually fragmentation. 4) The biodiversity function of wetlands and drive mechanism from urbanization were studied in LRGR. Highway construction influences wetland pattern and biodiversity in mountainous. As a representative activity in the mountains, highway construction has detrimental side effects on maintaining biodiversity function in the regional wetlands. In influencing zone of highway, construction activities mainly influence the single block wetland, such as, lake, reservoir and swamp; and decrease biodiversity of wetlands. The Shannon diversity index is nearly proportional to wetland area with polynomial exp (S2), which is consistent with Gaussian regression model. 5)The Pearl River Estuary is divided into two primary function zones and six secondary function zones; Yunnan mountainous area is divided into two primary function areas and five secondary function zones. The protection policies were formulated separately based on regional typical wetland

TI  - A Modeling Approach to Wildlife Corridor Creation: An Assessment Using ArcGIS and the San Joaquin Kit Fox in San Luis Obispo County, California, USA Project
AU  - McElwee, Lauren Rachelle
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - This study is a presentation of a corridor methodology and a proposed wildlife corridor between the Carrizo Plain and Camp Roberts in San Luis Obispo County, California, USA, using the federally and state listed San Joaquin Kit Fox as an umbrella species for corridor delineation. Since the Kit Fox has such a wide range, it is thought that many other federally and state listed species will be protected. Historic evidence has shown Kit Fox migration between these two core habitat areas. To keep the areas from becoming isolated patches of habitat, which inhibits genetic diversity and ultimately species survival, a corridor was proposed. ArcGIS was utilized to assess the viability and location of a potential wildlife corridor. Functions such as weighted overlays and neighborhoods were used to score and therefore indicate the best habitat area, the location of the corridor, highest development pressure areas, and priority sites for conservation. Further, a discussion on conservation tools is included to set up a “toolbox" for protecting the corridor.Using the two ArcGIS algebraic functions, a corridor location in the eastern portion of the County was identified, which splits in two and reconstitutes in the northern part of the county. Upon corridor identification, development pressure was analyzed by the use of a weighted overlay and revealed high development pressure along the route 46 highway, which bisects the proposed wildlife corridor. Priority areas were determined by overlaying habitat values with development pressure values to determine the best habitat areas under the greatest development pressure. Those areas within the identified corridor under the highest development pressure were considered high priority sites. Conclusions were that antiquated subdivisions located directly in the path of the corridor need further study to determine their ultimate effect on the corridor; 46 highway is a high development area and those areas of the corridor which are crossed by 46 are in need of immediate attention for conservation; ground-truthing needs to be done to verify findings; and that a combination of conservation tools will be needed to effectively protect the wildlife corridor identified.

TI  - Phylogenetics and biogeography of mouse opossums (Didelphidae: Marmosa)
AU  - Gutierrez, Eliecer Eduardo
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - This research focused on the systematics and biogeography of mouse opossums of the genus Marmosa (Mammalia: Didelphimorphia: Didelphidae), with special emphasis on species found in the complicated geography of north-central South America.  Via the four chapters of this dissertation, I presented information obtained through fieldwork, examination of museum specimens, DNA sequencing, phylogenetic analyses, georeferencing (including consultation of field notes and collectors), and ecological niche modeling.  In Chapter 1, I conducted phylogenetic analyses of species of Marmosa based on sequence data of the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene (CYTB), in part to test the monophyly of species previously recognized based on morphological criteria.  This study revealed the existence of unrecognized species and identified novel interspecific relationships.  All trans-Andean species of the subgenus  Marmosa were recovered as a clade, suggesting that the uplift of the Andes might have played an important role in the diversification of the genus.  In Chapter 2, I documented the presence of M. waterhousei  in the Venezuelan Andes.  This finding implied that the species might have crossed the dry Depresión del Táchira during a glacial period.  In Chapter 3, I investigated the phylogeography of M. robinsoni , a species predominately distributed across the dry forests of northern South America.  I conducted phylogenetic analyses based on sequence data of one mitochondrial and one nuclear gene.  The results confirmed the monophyly of a dry-forest clade formed by M. robinsoni and  M. xerophila and showed the existence of two major clades within  M. robinsoni that corresponded roughly to an east/west division.  Results of ancestral area reconstructions identified multiple dispersal events out of the greater Maracaibo basin.  Lastly, in Chapter 4 I used ecological niche modeling to test the geographic predictions of competition between a sister species pair, M. robinsoni and M. xerophila .  The results strongly suggest that M. xerophila may isolate populations of M. robinsoni in the Península de Paraguaná of northern Venezuela—representing a novel example of geographic isolation caused by competition.  Together, these studies contributed to a better understanding of the taxonomy, phylogenetics, and biogeography of the genus Marmosa; provide novel information relevant to the biogeography of dry-forest species in northwestern South America; and propose a refinement of the concept of ecological vicariance to incorporate the possibility that biotic interactions could lead to geographic isolation.

TI  - The Functional Morphology of Ingestion in the Platyrrhine Sclerocarpic Harvesters (Platyrrhini, Primates)
AU  - Klukkert, Zachary Stoffel
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The identification of anatomical correlates of diet and feeding behavior in nonhuman primates is an important area of research in biological anthropology. The morphology of the jaws and teeth reflects the phylogeny and adaptations that distinguish taxa and their different ecological niches. Studying the form-function relationships of jaws and teeth in modern species provides a framework for interpreting the diets of extinct species and for inferring the ecological pressures that may have contributed to the evolutionary diversification of primate craniodental morphology. Previous work on modeling primate jaw mechanics has focused largely on the functional context of a closed jaw. Little attention has been given to the biomechanical arrangement of the system’s ingestive morphology whereby the anterior teeth and the musculoskeletal anatomy function in open-jaw positions. This dissertation advances the state of knowledge of the evolution of the primate feeding apparatus by considering the functional significance of the morphology of the anterior teeth, masticatory muscles and the jaws as they would operate in an open-gape context.The taxonomic focus of this thesis is a group of platyrrhines characterized by an intensive form of ingestion. These “sclerocarpic harvesters” include the pitheciids Cacajao, Chiropotes, Pithecia, and Callicebus, and also the cebid Aotus. These primates feed on fruits with hard or tough outer coverings, and the pitheciins (Cacajao, Chiropotes, Pithecia) frequently prey on the variably soft seeds within. By comparing these taxa with other platyrrhines, this research aims to to shed light on the possibility of biomechanical tradeoffs favoring either the ingestion or mastication of foods that may reflect adaptive priorities in the feeding complex, optimized for a particular set of functions. As a group, the sclerocarpic harvesters exhibit deep mandibles with expanded gonial regions where two adductors of the jaw insert, i.e., the superficial masseter and medial pterygoid muscles. These taxa are distinguished dentally from similarly-sized platyrrhines by their relatively large incisors, tall and narrow among the pitheciids, broad in Aotus, similarly used for scraping and scoring the outer protective rinds and/or gouging out the soft flesh from within hard-skinned fruits. The pitheciins are further distinguished in having robust triquetrous canine teeth—approximately triangular in cross-section—that are used to breach and pry open relatively large whole fruit with wide open jaws. Together the mandible and the canine teeth are two structures in the feeding complex that particularly distinguish the sclerocarpic harvesters and form the basis of this research.Jaw shape is routinely used in discussions of relationships among living and extinct platyrrhines, though few efforts have aimed to parse the phylogenetic and functional signals that affect the variability in this morphology. Chapter 3 of this dissertation begins the analytical section of this work by testing for functional correlates of the mandibular morphology that largely distinguish the pitheciids from the predominately-frugivorous, and similarly-sized cebids (except Aotus). 3D geometric morphometrics (3DGM) and principal components analysis was used to identify the leading sources of the variability in the shapes of 145 landmarked mandibles of pitheciids (Cacajao, Chiropotes, Pithecia, Callicebus) and cebids (Sapajus, Cebus, Aotus, Saimiri). Biomechanically-significant measurements of the mandibles were derived from the landmark coordinates, i.e., inter-landmark distances were calculated that span morphological features that aid in the mitigation of stress in the jaw during loading. These functional signals were regressed against the PCA shape components to test for correspondence between the phylogenetic and functional signals in the shapes of the jaws.Results of the 3DGM mandible study in Chapter 3 link the variability in the study sample with jaw function and distinguish these taxa in terms of feeding strategies more consistently than phylogeny. These results are support a new mechanical explanation for the diversity in jaw shape whereby Aotus and the pitheciids are unified as sclerocarpic harvesters, i.e., a group that emphasizes anterior-tooth loading during the first phase of feeding—ingestion—while the jaws of pitheciins and Sapajus overlap in values associated with support for eccentric loading during the second phase—mastication—e.g., cracking and masticating seeds. This two-phase mechanical explanation for jaw shape diversity poses a problem for the use of mandible shape for phylogenetic analyses, particularly in platyrrhines wherein the cebids Aotus and Sapajus both exhibit patterns of mandibular morphology that appear to reflect a process of convergence on the pitheciid-like emphasis on ingestion. However, this success in characterizing jaw shape diversity as a composite response to challenges associated with both phases of feeding suggests that a similar approach to evaluating the feeding behavior of extinct platyrrhines from fossil mandibles may add significant definition to what is known about the paleobiology of this radiation.Another component of the feeding apparatus is the musculature of the jaws, and aspects of the shape of the mandible are related to the organization the muscles.  Broadly, the musculoskeletal anatomy of primate jaws is understood to be influenced by feeding behavior, phylogeny, and body size. Jaw shape and muscle anatomy act together in life but are typically studied apart, and while the discrete components of the masticatory complex provide useful insights into feeding adaptations and trends in primates, the interaction of components may not be obvious when studied in isolation. In Chapter 4, the skeletal morphology and muscle performance are integrated to study the effect of variability in jaw shape on muscle force with changes in gape. To consider the effect of body size, two larger-bodied platyrrhines were added to the comparative sample for this study, i.e., Ateles and Alouatta. Patches of virtual landmarks were applied to the attachment sites of jaw-closing muscles on 3D models of skulls using Landmark Editor software. The distances between attachments were measured with skulls set to different gape configurations, then length-tension formulas and muscle physiological cross-section area (PCSA) data from the literature were used to model maximum muscle force in each position.The results reported in Chapter 4 show that variation in muscle position with respect to the jaw joint produces a pattern of heterogeneous excursion that distinguishes each muscle, and together form patterns that are differ across the taxa studied. The relative rate of decline in muscle force outputs with increasing gape varies in the platyrrhines modeled with body size driving this relationship such that the sum of jaw muscle forces declines more gradually with increasing gape in smaller taxa while in larger taxa the decline is more acute. The scaling of the force-gape relationship with body size may therefore constitute a baseline strategy among platyrrhines to cope with the physical properties of foods that is most limiting to their ecological niche. The jaws of smaller primates favor the retention of muscle forces at higher gapes, which is consistent with the expectation that relative fruit size poses a more significant challenge for ingestion in these taxa. Conversely, larger platyrrhines exhibit a pattern that favors greater force production at lower gapes in support of diets that incorporate mastication of tougher foods that are relatively smaller on account of their greater body size.In the second half of this dissertation, the definition and functional significance of canine robusticity is explored. Robust canines are a hallmark of the pitheciin seed predators and prospective pitheciids in the fossil record exhibit similarly-robust, but more conical canines beginning in the early middle Miocene of Patagonia. Canine tooth crown height is understood more generally to correspond with diverse competitive regimes and mating strategies among primates, but little is known about the potential function of canine tooth robustness, i.e., whether proportionally wider canine teeth confer some social or dietary advantage over a more gracile crown. Canine bending strength is believed to correspond with canine tooth robusticity but does not vary with social factors such as group size and antagonism among primate species. In contrast, bending strength is higher in the robust-toothed pitheciins and capuchins (Cebus and Sapajus), several of which use these teeth for mechanically-intensive challenges associated with feeding on protected fruits and seeds. As a result, it was presumed that canine tooth robusticity is an evolutionary response to fracture risk, and it was predicted that the pitheciins and capuchins experience a lower risk of canine fracture than in other primates.In Chapter 5, the prediction that variability in canine bending strength and canine tooth robusticity corresponds with fracture risk was tested by surveying museum collections of wild caught platyrrhines of seven genera (i.e., Cacajao, Chiropotes, Pithecia, Cebus, Sapajus, Saimiri, and Ateles) for canine teeth broken before death, and then fracture rates were compared with those published for carnivores. Results demonstrate the rarity of fractured canine teeth in platyrrhines including both seed-eating and non-seed-eating species; on average one in twenty individuals exhibit one or more broken canine teeth. This consistently low prevalence of fractures among platyrrhines suggests that higher canine bending strength does not lessen the risk of breaking a canine tooth. Alternatively, it might be argued that more robust, stronger canines serve to retain a comparatively-low frequency of fracture on platyrrhines rely on these teeth to access more resistant foods. However, published surveys of carnivore fracture rates suggest that the fracture rate may vary a great deal in taxa that depend on their canine teeth for prey capture, and thus it is unlikely that primates should have resolved this problem more perfectly than carnivores. Further, primates were reported to have higher bending strength values in their canine teeth than carnivores, but the prevalence of fracture does not strictly fit this generalization. Overall the results of this study suggest that previously-reported bending strength values do not predict risk of fracture in canine teeth, and an explanation for any functional significance of variability in canine tooth robusticity is lacking.In Chapter 6, finite elements analysis (FEA) was used to evaluate an alternative hypothesis for the constraints on canine tooth shape, i.e., that the width of the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) is a response to the buildup of stresses in the surrounding alveolar tissue when the tooth is loaded during biting. A geometrically-simplified digital model of a canine crown was constructed and set in a virtual jaw bone and loaded with simulated forces, then modified in its dimensions and tested again to study the effect of changes in CEJ dimensions on the peak stresses in the modeled alveolus. Estimates of bite forces derived from published platyrrhine muscle PCSA data were used in conjunction with canine tooth measurements to model the effect of taxon-specific forces on the canine tooth model with an array of different geometry that approximates the dimensions in the platyrrhine sample (i.e., Cacajao, Chiropotes, Pithecia, Cebus, Sapajus, Saimiri, and Ateles). An optimization program was run using an iterative approach to simulate the effects of different geometry and loading conditions in the modeled canines. The program identifies the geometry that best balances between the goal of minimizing the CEJ diameter (to facilitate greater mechanical advantage for penetration) while not exceeding a set stress criterion in the alveolar bone (i.e., critical failure resulting from stresses exceeding yield strength). Finally, optimized model results are compared with the dimensions of the platyrrhine sample to consider the expectation that the geometry in these taxa are the result of similar drivers and constraints as those specified in the FEA simulations.The results of FEA simulations in Chapter 6 suggest that canine shape reflects the optimization of competing pressures to maximize mechanical advantage for penetration while minimizing the stresses in the alveolar bone in which the tooth is rooted, particularly during moderate to high-gape biting. The optimized canine models generated are sensitive to the magnitude and orientation of forces applied to simulate canine biting. The models that were vertically-loaded resulted in a narrow-crowned optimal output because the stresses in these models are easily dissipated along the tooth root surface, permitting an unnaturally narrow crown without damaging the alveolar tissue. Oblique loads used to simulate biting during open-gape functions on these models produce an uneven distribution of stress in the alveolus where compressive stresses are concentrated opposite of where the oblique load is positioned. To mitigate the concentration of stresses in the alveolus, the CEJ diameter is broadened during the automated optimization process, resulting in more geometrically robust optimal output that closely approximate the dimensions of the canines from the sampled platyrrhine taxa. Strong correlations between the real geometry of the platyrrhine sample and the optimal model outputs for the obliquely-loaded trials provide support for the hypothesis that canine robusticity is a response to stress in the alveolar tissues, not the canine tooth itself.Taken together, the results of the four analytical chapters of this thesis add definition to the gross morphological patterns in the anterior teeth and jaws among the sclerocarpic harvesters, principally the pitheciins, that have been presumed to have evolved in support of their specialization on large, hard-skinned fruits and seeds. The mandibles of the pitheciids and cebids signal a malleability of mandible shape that is sensitive to mechanical challenges during both ingestion and mastication phases of feeding. However, the sclerocarpic harvesters are not exceptional in the organization of their musculature in support of ingestion at high gapes, and instead they follow a trend in the organization that scales with body size. Caveats to this observation include the special roles that canine teeth of the pitheciins and Callicebus play as potentially different approaches to the similar problem breaching relatively large foods (i.e., tall laterally-splayed in pitheciins and shortened upright crowns in Callicebus) that may modify the force-gape relationship in the jaws by increasing the clearance and facilitating less stretch and more muscle force when biting a food of a given size. Additionally, the shape of the canine teeth themselves appear to be responses to the stresses produced during loading in the first ingestive steps when the resistant outer components of whole foods found in nature present the most intense mechanical challenges to alveolar tissue around the canines as the food is opened.Finally, while the anatomical diversity of pitheciins is related to functions that are specific to the feeding strategies among these taxa, the mechanistic relationships and biomechanical constraints on the morphology identified here are common factors in the evolution of the feeding apparatus in all primates, e.g., the yield characteristics of cortical bone and enamel, the diversity of loading regimes at different gapes, and the effect of muscle length and position on the excursion and force in jaw muscles. Thus, advances to the understanding of interactions between these factors bears significance for the evolution of feeding mechanics on a broader scale and may also benefit the evaluation of the functional morphology of the feeding complex throughout the order Primates and mammals more broadly.

TI  - Using false rings to reconstruct local drought severity patterns on a semiarid river
AU  - Morino, Kiyomi Ann
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - In this research, I describe the use of false rings to reconstruct local histories of seasonal drought in riparian ecosystems in semiarid regions. In tree-ring analysis, false rings are boundary-like features often formed as a response to drought within the growing season. Drought can be a common feature in hydrologic regimes of dryland rivers but in recent decades drought has been intensifying due to climate change and increasing water use by cities, agriculture and industry. Identifying when and where water availability has decreased along the river course is critical for understanding, and therefore managing, these generally endangered ecosystems. The higher density of trees compared to instrumental data make them ideal candidates for reconstructing site-specific drought patterns. The first part of this dissertation is an observational study conducted on the San Pedro River in southeastern Arizona during 2002. I used dendrometer data and local hydrological data to show that a period of negligible radial growth in cottonwood during the middle of the growing season coincided with a channel drying event. Tree-ring core samples confirmed that false-rings had formed in each of the instrumented trees. The second part of this dissertation is an experimental study designed to evaluate the effect of different levels of water stress on false-ring formation in cottonwood and willow. I showed that experimental decreases in water availability for periods as short as ten days were enough to induce false-ring formation in willow. Longer periods of reduced water availability were generally required to induce false-ring formation in cottonwood. In the final part of this dissertation, I reconstructed false-ring occurrence in Fremont cottonwoods at three sites along the San Pedro River. I infer from false-ring frequencies that the severity of summer drought has been increasing over the last four to six decades but that the drought severity varies along a hydrological gradient. Overall, the findings in this body of research confirm that false rings in riparian tree species can be used as indicators of seasonal drought and underscore the importance of identifying site-specific responses to reduced water availability along the riparian corridor.

TI  - The Economically Important Nitrogen Pathways of Southwest Florida
AU  - Malkin, Elon M.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The global phenomenon of burgeoning coastal population growth has led to coastal watershed landscape transformation and ecosystem degradation, prompting policy-makers to set limits on freshwater withdrawals and labile nutrient loads. Important components of Florida's economies lie in the state's expansive coastal zone; the organisms driving the billion-dollar recreational fishing industry are rooted in coastal habitats, while the agriculture and real-estate industries sprawl throughout numerous coastal watersheds. This study aimed to identify the connections between anthropogenic land use and essential juvenile fish nursery habitats within the coastal zone, which is the first critical step for sustaining the ecology and related economies of the region.   The need for this study arises from the fact that these economies are interconnected through nitrogen, and therefore nitrogen management can influence their prosperity or collapse. Juvenile fish nursery habitats are located in waters that receive nitrogen from adjacent landscapes. Runoff delivers nitrogen derived from human nitrogen use and processing within the watersheds to the juvenile fish nursery habitats. Ecosystem managers must understand that although copious amounts of nitrogen applied to land may ultimately support nursery habitat foodwebs, overwhelming nitrogen loads may also create algal blooms that decay and cause lethal hypoxic events leading to ecosystem degradation. This study aims to pinpoint the specific nitrogen sources that support primary production and ultimately fish production in watersheds dominated by agricultural landscapes and residential neighborhoods.Stable isotopes are versatile tools used to identify these connections. The nitrogen and carbon compounds that make up the moieties of an ecosystem inherently carry information on major nitrogen sources, trophic structure as well as the crucial information concerning dominant nitrogen removal and transformative processes that occur within sediments. Specifically in this study, the stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, primary producers, and fish were used to identify 1) the connections between urban and agricultural landscapes and the nutrients that percolate through the foodweb, 2) the primary producers that support fish biomass, 3) the origins of sedimentary organic matter that can provide new nitrogen via recycling, and 4) the heterogeneous function of fish nursery habitats in polluted systems. This study was conducted during the region's wet and dry seasons and in over thirty watersheds that differ from each other in terms of size and anthropogenic influence.  In agricultural watersheds, nitrogen derived from row crops and tree crops ultimately supported fish production during the wet season. Convective afternoon thunderstorms coupled with runoff delivered nitrogen from the landscape to receiving waters. These nutrients supported phytoplankton which deposited into the sediments and supported benthic foodwebs. During the dry season, nitrogen derived from row crops and nitrogen transformation in the sediments ultimately supported fish production. In this case, irrigation water used for agriculture delivered nitrogen from lands covered with row crops to the nursery habitats in receiving waters.   The dry season was characterized by the nitrogen transformation process known as dissimilatory nitrogen reduction to ammonium (DNRA), where biologically available nitrate is converted to biologically available ammonium. Phytoplankton deposits, most likely delivered during the wet season, were recycled through the slow burning DNRA processes, which provided nitrogen for the benthic microalgae that dominated in the dry season. These organisms in turn supported benthic communities which ultimately supported dry season fish production.   In small urban watersheds, nitrogen derived from septic tanks, lawn irrigation, leaky sewage pipes, and atmospheric deposition ultimately supported fish production via phytoplankton, but unlike the nitrogen sources in agricultural watersheds, these sources (with the exception of atmospheric deposition) were seasonally consistent because a mechanisms to deliver nitrogen derived from septic tanks, lawn fertilizer, and leaky sewage pipes were, at least to some extent, available during both seasons.  In polluted, tidal, fish-nursery habitats, the specific mechanism that allowed nursery habitats to decrease the ratio of mortality over growth rates of juvenile fish was not consistent among systems. These mechanisms were likely dependent on physical-chemical parameters and stream geomorphology. If the geomorphology or physical-chemical characteristics of nursery habitats are not adequate to set up an efficient nitrogen transfer process to fish, these habitats become more of a haven from predators rather than a source of food for fish.   This study has several implications for management. Managers must first recognize that microalgae are dominant supporters of tidal nursery foodwebs. Managers must define the relationship between nitrogen loads and fish abundance. If this relationship is unknown, the results of increasing nitrogen loads on fish production will remain uncertain; foodwebs in nursery habitats may collapse due to eutrophication, or fish abundance may increase due to increases in food supply. Connectivity factors derived from stable isotope mechanistic mass-balance models can be used as measurable targets for groups of watersheds. The use of wetlands as nitrogen remediation tools may not be effective at removing nitrogen; nitrogen transformation processes such as DNRA likely outweigh removal processes in wetland soils.

TI  - Extinction of Chromosomes Due to Specialization Is a Universal Occurrence
AU  - Wilson, Jason Ryon
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The human X and Y chromosomes evolved from a pair of autosomes approximately 180 million years ago. Despite their shared evolutionary origin, extensive genetic decay has resulted in the human Y chromosome losing 97% of its ancestral genes while gene content and order remain highly conserved on the X chromosome. Five ‘stratification' events, most likely inversions, reduced the Y chromosome's ability to recombine with the X chromosome across the majority of its length and subjected its genes to the erosive forces associated with reduced recombination. The remaining functional genes are ubiquitously expressed, functionally coherent, dosage-sensitive genes, or have evolved male-specific functionality. It is unknown, however, whether functional specialization is a degenerative phenomenon unique to sex chromosomes, or if it conveys a potential selective advantage aside from sexual antagonism. We examined the evolution of mammalian orthologs to determine if the selective forces that led to the degeneration of the Y chromosome are unique in the genome. The results of our study suggest these forces are not exclusive to the Y chromosome, and chromosomal degeneration may have occurred throughout our evolutionary history. The reduction of recombination could additionally result in rapid fixation through isolation of specialized functions resulting in a cost-benefit relationship during times of intense selective pressure.

TI  - Tuning into Toxins and Channels: The Characterizations of Tv1 and a Human Cardiac Sodium Channel Voltage-Sensor Domain
AU  - Bhuiyan, Mohammed H.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Voltage-gated sodium channels play crucial roles in many physiological processes, and when these processes are disrupted, due to malfunctioning ion channels, they lead to diseased states known as channelopathies. It is believed that some channelopathies can be corrected through fine tuning of the gating properties of the diseased channels through the use of drugs or peptide toxins. Here, I have taken the following steps towards an increased structural understanding of ion channel-toxin interactions:  Firstly, we have shed light on the first high-resolution structure of a novel class of peptide toxins known as teretoxins with the determination of the structure of Tv1. Tv1 was isolated from the terebrid marine snail Terebra variegata in nanogram quantities and its sequence determined by direct mass spectrometry sequencing. The peptide  was chemically synthesized and refolded, and then subjected to solution-state NMR experiments. We were able to solve the structure of Tv1 to a resolution 0.74 Å using 2D-homonuclear/heteronuclear NMR techniques. Although Tv1’s target remains elusive, structural features suggest that its natural target is an ion channel. We have demonstrated the ability to isotopically label the voltage-sensor domain in a bacterial expression system. 15N-labeled voltage-sensor domain was subjected to 15N-TROSY experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of structural studies. The Voltage-Sensor Domain under study produced little to no signal in n-DPC micelles, but marked improvement was obtained in a bicelle system. In spite of such improvement, system conformational heterogeneity seems to be apparent. We were also able to pull down a toxin from the venom of the tarantula Grammastola rosea using immobilized voltage-sensor domain, with the potential establishment of a method for the discovery of novel site 3 toxins by pull down with NaV1.5. Paddle motifs are the target of many gating-modifier toxins and have been shown to bind toxins independent of their background (placement into non-native channels) and in isolation. Here we present the synthesis (both chemical and biological) and characterization of a mammalian 37 residue NaV paddle motif. We subjected an isotopically labeled paddle motif of DIV of the human cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel (NaV1.5) to various 2D and 3D NMR experiments and assigned 86% of the backbone residues. We also recorded NMR spectra of the paddle motif in the presence of ApA, a known site-3 gating modifier toxin, which yielded complete loss of NMR signal, indicating that an interaction is occurring. Through the establishment of our backbone assignments, interactions of known site 3 gating-modifier toxins and NaV1.5 DIV S3-S4 paddle motif can be characterized, yielding mechanistic insights and knowledge that could be used in drug design.  Peptide toxins and voltage-gated ion channels have been used to unravel the secrets of each other for years, and our work continues in that direction. With Tv1 we have shown the ability to structurally characterize a peptide toxin using limited resources, which will open the door to structurally characterizing toxins thought to be restricted due to sample size limitations. With the NaV1.5 VSD and paddle motif of DIV we have presented a strategy to express and structurally characterize transmembrane fragments of a eukaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel in the absence and presence of gating-modifier toxins by NMR spectroscopy. Taken together, the experiments we conducted have increased the atomic level knowledge of toxin and eukaryotic voltage-gated ion channel biology.  (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.)

TI  - Amphibian populations at the Celery Bog Nature Area and the potential effects of land use and water quality
AU  - Brown, Dane
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Amphibian populations have been declining worldwide for the last century and the major cause of these declines have been habitat destruction. The Celery Bog was once drained for agricultural purposes but has since been restored to a wetland. Amphibian populations had not previously been studied at the Celery Bog Nature Area. This study provided baseline data on amphibians at the Celery Bog Nature Area for the city of West Lafayette. Amphibian mating calls and search and seize surveys were conducted in 2008 and 2009 to monitor amphibian populations. In 2008 and 2009 water samples were collected and analyzed for nitrate/nitrite, phosphate, and pH. The land use was analyzed using ArcGIS. The study found eight species of amphibians living in the nature area. The pothole wetlands not connected to the Celery Bog had the highest species richness both years. The nitrate/nitrite and phosphate levels were below levels that would impact amphibians. In 2009 the pH levels in the Celery Bog were higher than 8.5 on average which could potential impact amphibian populations. There was a negative correlation between species richness and pH in 2009. There was a positive correlation between the species richness and percentage of natural habitat inside each of the four buffer zones (30m, 60m, 289m, and 1km). The Celery Bog Nature Area provides multiple types of habitat for amphibian populations and safe corridors for amphibians to migrate through.

TI  - Systematics, population structure and demography of the African dwarf crocodile (Osteolaemus spp.): A perspective from multiple scales
AU  - Eaton, Mitchell Joseph
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Wildlife harvest is the most geographically widespread form of resource extraction in equatorial forests. The illegal trade in wildlife is worth billions of dollars annually, with some estimates placing it second only to the global trafficking in illicit drugs. In competition with the commercial harvest, many rural inhabitants of tropical forests subsist on wildlife as a protein and economic resource. Lack of understanding of the biology of the system and the inability to implement management controls are cited as the two main impediments to sustainable-use practices in the tropics. To achieve long-term sustainability of wildlife resources, we seek an integrated understanding of the dynamics regulating resource populations and the dynamics of extractive activities influencing the fate of population trajectories. To pursue these goals, my research focuses on a poorly known reptile in tropical Africa that is widely consumed in rural diets but threatened by commercial hunting. African dwarf crocodiles (Osteolaemus spp.) remain an important subsistence food resource throughout Central and West Africa, but are now threatened by overharvesting. The ability to address harvest issues and conservation priorities for crocodile populations is limited by a lack of knowledge of their biology, ecology and evolutionary history. My research approaches this problem from multiple perspectives. I first seek to resolve an 80-year-old debate on the taxonomy of the dwarf crocodile across its range, which has impeded our understanding of evolutionary significant units (ESUs) and the magnitude of the threats facing regional populations. Novel methods for monitoring the trade in crocodiles and other bushmeat species are needed to understand the magnitude of wildlife use in the tropics. I employed a molecular method to identify commonly hunted African wildlife species. I then attempt to gain inference on population genetic structure, connectivity and landscape factors influencing individual movements at the local and regional scales. At the population level, I used field surveys and capture-recapture methods to estimate demographic parameters and model population growth, incorporating empirical estimates of harvest rates and size-selection bias to evaluate their impact on long-term viability. I offer recommendations for new conservation management units, new techniques for monitoring the bushmeat trade and suggestions for spatial harvest management.

TI  - The Human Impact on a Montane Oak Forest in Costa Rica
AU  - Schubel, Richard John
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Man's impact on the cloud oak forest of the Talamancas typifies the ongoing process of deforestation in the highlands of Costa Rica. The transforming of forests to agricultural lands, in particular into pastures, has dictated the form of land exploitation and resultant ecological consequences.The area between El Empalme and Division aside from infrequent intrusions by man remained relatively undisturbed until the construction of the Inter-American Highway in the 1940's. This is documented by a series of air photographs flown in 1941, 1956, and 1974, with the earliest flight exhibiting practically a continuous oak forest and later years demonstrating the rate of deforestation and changes in land use. Furthermore, in order to understand the changes in the composition of the flora attributable to huma activity, 31 vegetation belt transects were conducted in disturbed and undisturbed sites occupying varying environmental conditions.The completion of the road changed the isolation of the area into accessibility to human exploitation. Gathering of edible palm hearts increased rapidly, resulting in the depletion of Euterpe sp. The second stage of human occupation resulted in the establisment of small sawmills that converted the larger oaks into fence posts and railroad ties. The third, a transitory stage, has been the making of charcoal by individual carboneros who clear the land mostly for dairy pasture dominated by the introduced African kikuyu grass, Pennisetum clandestinum. Locally, potatoes and truck crops have been planted for sale to the cities. Conservatively estimated, this form of economic activity has eliminated 400,000 oak trees in the study area and countless other woody plants from the ecosystem.With the elimination of the forest and the formation of a new vegetative cover maintained, either by deliberate cleaning of pastures or the activity of the cattle that selectively browse on young oak trees, certain physical changes have occurred in the ecosystem. Microclimatic alterations are evidenced by an increase in the number of frosts and desiccation of springs due to forest cover removal. Expected increases in total runoff and stream sediments associated with accelerated erosion as a result of deforestation did not materialize. It appears that the loss of moisture from fog interception by the forest has offset the gain from the lessened evapotranspiration. Also, expected erosion was minimal because the land is generally planted with a vigorous cover of kikuyu grass.Charcoal making, the establishment of permanent agricultural lands, and the introduction of European dairy cattle keep the ecosystem in a state of arrested disequilibrium. Because of the rapid encroachment on the limited area of cloud forest in the Talamancas, the government of Costa Rica has established reserves to preserve the oak forest. The exclusion from use of large tracts of oak forest and the difficulty of obtaining a permit to fell trees elsewhere are contributing to the decline of charcoal making in the area.When pastures or croplands are abandoned in the cloud forest region, the native flora simply outcompetes the kikuyu grass, as is documented by vegetation transects.

TI  - A comparative study: Utilizing data mining techniques to classify traffic congestion status
AU  - Mirakhorli, Abbas
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Performance measure is a process of evaluating and quantifying a system. Performance measure provides us with information about how good a system is working and how well the predefined goals are met. In order to analyze the performance of a transportation system, the traffic data such as speed, volume, occupancy and travel time of the system need to be collected. These data will generate valuable historical database that can be used to develop models to improve the quality of service of transportation system. The performance measures in transportation studies can be categorized to following main groups: Congestion, Mobility, Accessibility, Reliability, Safety and Environmental. Traffic congestion is one the important issues in any transportation system. Growing congestion in urban transportation network has enforced significant economic burdens to our current society. It causes waste of time, money, fuel and energy for the commuters and consequently impacting daily life of people in the society. Based on 2011 Congested Corridors Report presented by Texas A& M Transportation Institute, traffic congestion incurred $121 billion cost for drivers. Based on this report, 5.5 billion additional hours are wasted waiting in traffic in 2011. It means $818 additional fuel and time cost for each commuter. Being aware of the status of congestion in future can help, decision makers, intelligent systems and apps improve their accuracy and help commuters in their travel routing. To achieve these goals accurate traffic status classification techniques is required. Achieving higher accuracy is still one of the influential driving factor for research in this area. The objective of this thesis is to utilize data mining techniques to classify traffic status to congested or non-congested for some point of time in future based on historical traffic parameters (Vehicle Count, Occupancy, Speed). Moreover, to compare the performance of different data mining techniques on this problem. This dissertation examined several classification techniques including J48 Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector machine, PART and K-Nearest Neighborhood to classify future traffic status to Congested or Non-congested. The one minute traffic data from I-15 Northbound from I-215 up to Desert Inn, Las Vegas, NV were used to run these experiments. Based on the comparison of these algorithms, the J48 algorithm has the best performance.

TI  - Microbiological and Physico-Chemical Characterization of Khadi, a Traditional Non-cereal Based Alcoholic Beverage of Botswana
AU  - Motlhanka, Koketso
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Khadi is a traditional fermented alcoholic beverage popular in Botswana. There is little documented information about the brewing processes, the microorganisms responsible for fermentation as well as the safety despite its popularity in local markets. Such information is vital for production of a standardized beverage with a consistent quality to aid its entrance into the modern commercial markets. This thesis explored the brewing processes, microbiological quality and safety, as important aspects towards a bioprocess development of khadi. Firstly, the methods of brewing khadi were investigated by administering survey questionnaire to traditional brewers in 1 town and 5 villages in Central and Northern Botswana. The findings suggest that the beverage is produced from the spontaneous fermentation of Grewia flava fruits supplemented with brown table sugar. Next, the microbial biodiversity was investigated by isolating microbes from G. flava fruits and subsequently genotyping through sequence analysis of D1/D2 domain of the 26S rDNA for yeasts and molds whereas 16S rDNA was used for bacteria. Microbiota responsible for fermentation were further characterized by an in silico restriction fragment length polymorphism of sequenced amplicons (D1/D2 PCR-RFLP). Findings show that fruits predominantly harbored bacteria (77.8 %) with a surprisingly low abundance of yeasts and molds (22.2 %). Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces yeasts dominated the fermented product despite the dominance of bacteria in the fruits before fermentation. Specifically, Saccharomycescerevisiae was the most predominant species (50%) in khadi followed Candida ethanolica (12.2%) and Saccharomycodes ludwigii (10.8%). On average khadi contained ethanol concentrations of 5.27 ± 2.02 % (v/v) with an average pH of 3.1 ± 0.31. Further probing of the identity of the fermenting yeasts using in silico PCR-RFLP, surprisingly, suggested that the S. cerevisiae isolates were more genetically identical to the commercial baker’s yeast, instead of either the brewing or wine yeasts as the most common fermentation strains for production of alcoholic beverages. Isolation of spoilage molds such as Cladosporium sphaerospermum and Aspergillus ochraceus prompted further investigation using the Randox Evidence Investigator and Myco-10 biochip to ascertain the presence of mycotoxins that could render the beverage unsafe for consumption. A variety of mycotoxins were detected although at concentrations below the acceptable limits. Of notable concern, was deoxynivalenol (11.10 ± 5.82 ppb) and diacetoxyscirpenol (22.94 ± 8.15 ppb) with their concentrations being higher than the acceptable limits for a beverage to be deemed safe for consumption. This work is the first to expand the knowledge of the microbial and physiochemical properties of a popular beverage, khadi. In addition, this work highlights that a consortium of yeasts is responsible for fermentation of khadi. Such findings are critical for recommendation of potential starter cultures for possible commercialization of khadi with a consistent quality from standardized processes. The work further characterizes the brewing attributes of yeast isolates such as the ability to utilize different carbon sources, and tolerance to brewing-associated stresses such as high temperature, low pH and high ethanol concentrations. Overall, the results from this work provide perspectives on the strategies for production and improvement of the overall quality and safety of khadi.

TI  - Transparent Traces

T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - I have come to believe that every personal story is a landscape story. We frequently forget that our lives are not only our own but a contribution to a web of stories that shape the history of the land. Personal stories of life that make us who we are and our landscapes what they are, often are lost if not documented or passed down to other generations. What stories does the landscape hide and which stories does the landscape reveal? The only way our histories can survive is if we share them. The memories and stories we stow away in our landscapes, come back to us in other circumstances: they reflect us, and we reflect them. So, what are the stories of life? And how are these stories a metaphor of a landscape? The possibility to trace the stories of a life through the land, the soil, the plants, and the water inspires this exploration. Historians, theorists, artists, and environmentalists have explored the phenomenon of connection between human and landscape. The bond of life and land exists through our strong family ties, like that of a woman who stays constant in our stories like the landscape. Women are the life, strength, and stability of our legacies. The aspect of deep genealogy is an exploration of oneself in the landscape. What do we find when we explore it? Our discovery of self in the landscape touches on the notion of what we call home and what we come to find as our identity. Being a participant observer of one’s own genealogy delves into the topic of topographies of memory, meaning, loss, and discovery. When we embed ourselves in the land, it creates a different kind of ecology; one that is closer, more intricate, crucial, and not always rational. Creating a family archive allows for the exploration of one’s life and the purpose behind it. You discover parts of yourself, when you uncover truths of your family; hidden memories waiting to be recovered through the telling of a story. We create new relationships through this journey, not only with people but with the landscape. A river is a place where these connections come together, with the combination of complex concepts of culture and history. As noted by Irine J. Klaver, there is a notion of the atmosphere of a river or “riversphere” as a concept that contains social, cultural, political and emotional dimensions of life by combining hydrology, biology, and ecology with lived experience.  Intertwining environment with the experience of life through storytelling is what enriches the atmosphere of rivers and reveals hidden histories. My exploration of these thoughts began when I was walking to my maternal Grandmother’s house in the Southern Serbian city of Nis, I passed a tributary river to the Nisava that was barely flowing, moving slowly with green muck and miscellaneous trash. The sight of this river prompted me to take a picture before going on my way. I began to think about this river and how its contents are connected to a larger system. I pondered the deeper meaning behind its connectivity: how do collective histories, known and unknown, forgotten, and erased, all contribute to the circumstances that we have today? The composition of invisible traces and transparent ones are revealed through the existence of a river. The color of the water, the shape of its bends, the intensity of its flow is inclusive with the course of a life. Visible form of land is harmonious with the occurrences of our daily lives. The riversphere holds our secrets, revealing some and keeping others buried deep in its sediments; rivers hold the truth about us. This fascinates me because it enters a realm of undocumented stories of history. The idea of tracing history along a river prompted me to begin my personal journey of loss and discovery through deep genealogical archival research along the waterways of Serbia.

TI  - Isolation and identification of organisms in Bethlehem (Pennsylvania) municipal compost
AU  - Wenrick, LeRoy Frank
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Bethlehem Pennsylvania Municipal Compost, known as "Christmas City Compost", consists of leaves which are collected each fall from the streets of the city, shredded, piled into heaps and bi-monthly overturned to maintain an aerobic system. Sampling was done three times a year and systematically evaluated for the presence of organisms from every consumer level. Percent moisture, pH and temperatures were monitored at the time of each sampling. A Baermann (Wet) Funnel and a Berlese (Dry) Funnel were utilized to isolate nematodes and arthropods, respectively. A Rossi-Cholodny contact slide was employed for studying of soil microflora in situ. Bacteria and fungi were cultured on nutrient agar, fixed on microscope slides and gram stained. Water extracts were observed under the microscope for the presence of rotifera, protozoa and algae. The pH of the compost was determined in an equal volume of deionized water using an Orion 801A pH meter. Percent moisture was determined by drying in an oven 24 hours and calculating percent weight loss. Nematodes and arthropods were absent along with all other second-level (2o) and third-level (3o) consumers, with the exception of Hymenoptera vespula maculifrons. Actinomycetes were dominated by the species Micromonospora, Streptomyces and Actinomyces, with Micromonospora absent in the winter sampling. The fungi included Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium sp., Fusarium and  Agaricus sp., none of which were seen in the spring sampling. Bacteria and yeasts were abundant during all three seasons and included the bacteria  Cytophaga and Bacillus. No algae were observed. No pathogenic or parasitic organisms were isolated or identified. The results of the physical measurements are consistent with that found in the literature. The pH was found to be 7.9 to 8.0 and percent moisture averaged 59.8 percent. Since the system was maintained aerobically and contained no manure, refuse or sewage sludge, the formation of pathogenic organisms and parasites was prevented. The absence of second and third-level consumers can be attributed to (1) the lack of second-level consumers on which to feed and (2) the lack of certain larger first-level consumers on which to feed. The absence of second-level consumers can be attributed to (1) the lack of fungi during the spring to sustain the springtails (Collembola), mold mites (Acarina), beetle mites (Oribatei) and the feather-winged beetles (Ptiliids) and (2) the lack of sustained water films to maintain rotifera and protozoa. Evidence indicates that nematodes were not present because of the presence of fungal mycelia. The fact that only certain first-level consumers were isolated indicates that the organic residue was in the very early stage of decomposition.

TI  - Land use change in maasailand: drivers, dynamics and impacts on large herbivores and agro-pastoralism
AU  - Msoffe, Fortunata Urban
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - The Maasailand of Kenya and Tanzania supports one of the richest wildlife populations remaining on Earth. However, over the last century, Maasailand has experienced land transformation notably through conversion of former rangelands to croplands. With the anticipated human population increase in East Africa, more impacts should be envisaged on these rangelands. This thesis investigates the root causes and underlying drivers of land-use change in the Maasai-Steppe ecosystems, stemming from historical, socio-cultural, political as well as the biophysical conditions. To analyse the different drivers of change, an integrated methodological approach was employed. This included a collation of historical data and information derived from both gray and published literature, analysis of remote sensing and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data, field surveys, workshops, observations, as well as personal communications. Observed land-use change from savannah rangelands to expansive croplands are mainly linked to government policies, land tenure, human population growth (which is also likely to be the largest future driver) and climatic conditions. Consequently these changes have impacted the agro-pastoralist community, whose main incomes for their livelihoods depend on pastoralism. Subsequent loss of formerly communal grazing lands to establish protected areas; large-scale farming and/or private ranches have aggravated the problems of sedentarization due to villagization and privatization policies of the formally mobile agro-pastoral communities. Land-use change also had negative impacts on migratory wildlife species, particularly those utilizing both protected areas and dispersal ranges in communal and/or private lands. The impacts ranged from loss of their migratory routes and corridors to massive declines of populations due to the loss of access to grazing resources. The study recommends government’s interventions for keeping the land open for access to grazing resources as well as opening up wildlife corridors, where it is deemed necessary for national interests.

TI  - Observations of atmospheric reactive nitrogen species and nitrogen deposition in the Rocky Mountains
AU  - Benedict, Katherine B.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Many national parks are experiencing increased nitrogen deposition due to increased emissions of reactive nitrogen, especially in the western United States. Excess nitrogen deposition can adversely impact ecosystem function, in some cases leading to degradation of water quality and forest decline. One region of particular interest is the Rocky Mountains, where large increases in wet deposition of oxidized and reduced nitrogeN·have been observed in recent decades. Here we present results from several field campaigns in Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) and a field campaign in Grand Teton National Park (GTNP) focused on identifying important nitrogen deposition pathways and factors that are contributing to nitrogen deposition. To understand nitrogen deposition in RMNP we focused on understanding the spatial variability of reactive nitrogen concentrations across the state of Colorado. We observed large gradients in the reactive nitrogen species that reflected the different source regions across the state. In eastern Colorado, home to large agricultural operations, we observed high concentrations of ammonia and ammonium. Concentrations decreased moving westward toward the Front Range urban corridor and the Rocky Mountains. Concentrations of nitric acid, an important oxidation product of nitrogen oxides emissions, were highest in the Front Range urban corridor. Concentrations of gaseous ammonia and nitric acid were much lower in RMNP than at the sites to the east. Particle concentrations of ammonium and nitrate were generally lower in RMNP as well; however, concentration gradients were sometimes not as strong as for the gas phase compounds. Wet deposition of ammonium and nitrate were the two largest reactive nitrogen deposition pathways in RMNP, yielding inputs of 1.97 kg N·ha -1 or 56% of total nitrogen deposition. Dry deposition of ammonia and wet deposition of organic nitrogen were the next most important deposition pathways; together they accounted for 40% (1.37 kg N·ha-1) of annual total nitrogen deposition. These two pathways are of special interest because they have not historically been monitored as part of regional deposition budgets. The remaining deposition pathways (dry deposition of nitric acid, and PM2.5 ammonium, nitrate, and organic nitrogen) accounted for approximately 3% of total nitrogen deposition. In GTNP there was a strong gradient in ammonia concentrations, with higher average concentrations to the west (0.6 µg/m3) and lower average concentrations to the east (0.3 µg/m3), consistent with the presence of large agricultural operations west of the park. Concentrations of nitric acid, nitrate, and ammonium did not exhibit any clear spatial trends. Ammonia concentrations were higher at GTNP than at RMNP while PM2.5 nitrate and ammonium concentrations were similar in the two regions. Average nitric acid concentrations were similar between the two parks as well, with the exception of one high elevation GTNP site where higher concentrations were observed. Wet deposition of ammonium and dry deposition of ammonia were the largest reactive nitrogen deposition pathways in GTNP followed by wet deposition of nitrate and wet deposition of organic nitrogen. Previous ecological assessments have led to the establishment of a critical load for wet deposition of inorganic nitrogen to RMNP and GTNP. A critical load is the maximum level of nitrogen input that can be sustained by an ecosystem without irreversible damage like loss of biodiversity. Our observations reveal that the critical load is currently being exceeded in both RMNP and GTNP. It is important to recognize that substantial additional inputs of reactive nitrogen are occurring in both parks through dry deposition of ammonia and wet deposition of organic nitrogen. Neither pathway is currently considered in the U.S. critical load framework. In both RMNP and GTNP organic nitrogen was an important component of deposition.  (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

AB  - The greenway movement has been evolving since the 19th century, with the creation of axes in cities, along with boulevards, and Olmsted’s parkway concept. The industrial revolution caused an increase of awareness in ecology, along with a set of park and ecologic network projects that aimed towards conservation and sustainability. At present, these corridors are mainly known as the term greenway, with various authors highlighting their connecting, recreation, leisure, environmental and patrimonial conservation and protection functions. They also fall into different categories, such as river corridors, recreation corridors, ecologic corridors, historic/scenic/cultural corridors and greenway network. Integrated inside recreation corridors’ typology are trails that used old rail-ways, canals, waterlines and ridgelines, so, linear routes that obtain new functions. Railways have been highly intervened upon, in the last decades, with very well-known projects such as the Promenade Plantée, in Paris, and the High Line, in New York. Portugal has been reusing old railroads, following REFER’s (current IP, S.A.) “Ecotrail” Strategic Plan (“Plano Estratégico de Ecopistas”), in order to project trails, for the inhabitants, in non-motorized paths that preserve the environment and quality of life. With 11 of these trails inaugurated and 5 to intervene, Aljustrel’s railway is one of the later, inserted in a municipality rich in mining history and ecologic value. A proposal for a greenway in Aljustrel, inserted in recreation corridor’s typology, has all the potential to also be considered an ecological and historic/scenic/cultural corridor. Therefore, the intervention of this path aims at sustainable corridor that offers a recreational, ecological and patrimonial space to the locals and visitors, through a plan that includes three different yet combined routes.

TI  - The utility of digital aerial surveys in censusing Dipteryx panamensis, the key food and nesting tree of the endangered great green macaw (Ara ambigua) in Costa Rica
AU  - Chun, Sara L. M.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Remote sensing technologies offer an innovative way to study tropical forests and complement research from forest inventory plots. From a logistic standpoint, remote sensing mitigates some of the physical, political, and economic challenges that complicate terrestrial studies of tropical forests. From a biological standpoint, remotely sensed data can elucidate ecological phenomena and dynamics of tropical forests that may be challenging to observe on the ground. I conducted a digital aerial survey during the peak blooming period for Dipteryx panamensis. D. panamensis is a canopy-emergent, keystone tree species within the lowland Atlantic forests of Costa Rica. The aerial survey occurred over Maquenque National Wildlife Refuge, which is situated in the proposed San Juan-La Selva Biological Corridor. Maquenque was decreed in 2005 to protect the last breeding habitat for the endangered Great Green Macaw (Ara ambigua) in Costa Rica. The Great Green Macaw depends on D. panamensis as its primary food and nesting resource. However, because of Costa Rica's complex deforestation history, the Great Green Macaw remains imperiled due to habitat fragmentation, degradation, and loss. Only 25 to 35 breeding pairs and 250 individuals likely persist in the country. My research had three main objectives. First, I evaluated a classification technique that capitalized on the unique spectral signature of blooming D. panamensis in order to detect this species using a pattern recognition approach. Second, I determined the landscape density and distribution of this tree species using results from the aerial survey and classification. I also noted environmental factors predicting potential  D. panamensis habitat using a classification and regression tree (CART) model, and I subsequently calculated how much potential habitat exists in Costa Rica. Third, I identified environmental conditions that indicate potential breeding habitat for the Great Green Macaw using a CART model, and I calculated how much potential breeding habitat exists in Costa Rica. Results of the classification work indicate that D. panamensis can be identified based on its unique spectral signature. In particular, the IHS (intensity, hue, saturation) color space was effective at resolving this tree. Results of the density analysis suggest that canopy-emergent D. panamensis  trees occur at densities as high as 2 trees/hectare. This work demonstrates that D. panamensis exists in denser patches than previously determined from forest inventory plots. Environmental conditions that will support high densities of D. panamensis habitat occur between 45 and 125 meters in elevation and on soil with an acid and clay profile. Nearly 240,000 hectares could support high density patches of D. panamensis  in Costa Rica. Potential Great Green Macaw breeding habitat is defined by the density of D. panamensis trees within its 550-hectare breeding territory. Approximately 67,000 hectares of Great Green Macaw breeding territory exist in Costa Rica. Ultimately, the conservation of both  D. panamensis and the Great Green Macaw in Costa Rica may require a multinational partnership between Costa Rica and Nicaragua.

AB  - Chinese agricultural civilization as well as the traditional rural landscape stranded a high position in the world history. Chengdu Longmen Mountain is located between the first steps (Tibet Plateau) with the second step (Sichuan Basin) of the Chinese geological steps. Because of the complexity of the natural resources, Longmen Mountain has the diversity of the rural landscape. Linpan sites in the Chengdu plain, the decentralized style shows the different with the normal Chinese centralized villages. This style is also chosen by the ancient Sichuan people, by the pattern of the local mountain and water system. After the 5.12 earth quake, the rural landscapes in Longmen Mountain have been greatly changed by the rebuilding and development projects. This research object tries to use the Linpan rural landscape style to change the future of some areas.This paper chooses the Chengdu, Dayi, Sanba as the research area. We can find 6 typical rural landscape elements, by the ecological analyze of Point, Line, Area as well as the Patch, Corridor, Pattern in Sanba village. They are: Mountain, Water, Forest (Natural Oriented) and Farmland, Road, Village (Human Oriented). The Clips are also used as one research method to find the patterns in the Linpan for planning and design. The six rules are found in this research: Linpan centralization rules: Number, Area, Rate between trees and houses; Linpan decentralization rules: Water system, Distance, Classification. The way to plan and design the Sanba rural area uses both these centralization and decentralization rules to rebuild the new Sanba.It can help the other researches to reorganize the village by local traditional landscape style and the method of downscaling, clips and elements and patterns.

TI  - Studies on the isolation, culture and DNA identification of mycelia of saprophytic and symbiotic edible fungi
AU  - Zeng, Fang Dong
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Spawn is necessary for both cultivation of edible fungi and tameness of wild mushroom. The reliable method of spawn identification is to produce carpophores by the culture, which is not only time-consuming for domestic fungi but also unuseful for untamed wild mushroom. The DNA identification method was developed for mycelial isolates of saprophytic and symbiotic edible fungi in the studies by comparing the DNA fingerprintings of isolates with their original carpophores.1.DNA identification of isolates of Lentinula mushroom. The DNA fingerprinting patterns were made by RAPD-PCR using 12 random primers. The results showed that there are same RAPD fingerprintings among the mycelial isolates, pileus (including lamellae), lamellae, and stipe from one basidiocarps of Lentinula mushroom, also between the mycelial spawn and its culturing basidiocarps. The results also suggested that there are a little DNA variation among different origin basidiocarps, and their similarity coefficients vary from 0.886 to 0.986.2.DNA identification of isolates of Pleurotus mushroom. The RAPD-PCR analyses were conducted with different colour basidiocarps from different origin Pleurotus mushrooms. The results showed that there are same DNA fingerpringing patterns among the mycelial isolates, pileus (including lamellae)and stipe from one basidiocarps, but the similarity coefficients between different origin and colour basidiocarps vary from 0.779 to 0.976.3.Survey of vegetation of mountain growing Tricholoma matsutake. The vegetation survey were conducted in a mountain located in Longjng , Jilin province. 74 species belonging to 38 family plants, and 15 species belonging to 8 family large fungi were identified and recorded. Those easily found plants and fungi are Pinus densiflora, Querces mongolica, Lespebeza bicolor, Rhododendrum chrysanthum, Melampyrum roseum, Ramaria stricta, Cortinarius collinitus, etc, among which, 22 species of plants and 3 species of mushrooms were first reported occurring beside fairy rings of matsutake.4.Studies on DNA polymorphisms of symbiotic edible fungi, Tricholoma matsutake. The DNA fingerprinting of wild baidiocarps of matsutake, collected from the scenes of major production regions in China, were analyzed based on RAPD (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA)-PCR patterns were optimized by example experiments of two DNA templates in this study. The RAPD-PCR conditions were optimized by example experiments of two DNA templates from different ecological regions, and 18 of 40 arbitrary decamer nucleotide primers were also screened with good ampliation and repetition. The 17 sets of DNA fingerprinting patterns were sharply made for 20 basidiocarps tested. The similarty coeffecients of DNA fingerprintings among the materials tested ranged from 0.50 to 0.90. And 15 of 20 pine mushrooms tested were clustered together at 0.72 similarity level by UPGMA cluster analysis, and were demonstrated to be the same species Tricholoma matsutake, distrubuted in Yunnan, Sichuan and Jilin provinces of China. The DNA fingerprinting patterns in this study are made to help identification of wild matsutake resources and their tissue isolates under various ecological environments fit for the artificial taming of matsutake.5. Mycelia isolation and culture of Trichotoma matsutake. Tissue isolation of different positions of 9 matsutake were made with 8 media in 810 test tubes. The results showed that lamellae were fit tissue for mycelia isolation, and success percentages of mycelia isolation with media PDAS, PDAW, BM, PDA are 74.4%,35.5%,15.6% and 8.9% respectively. The results also showed that stipe, mycorrhizae, and soil with the fungi are not fit for Tricholoma matsutake isolation.6. DNA identification of Tricholoma matsutake isolates. 24 samples including matsutake basidiocarps and different origin isolates were analyzed with RAPD fingerprinting comparison using 17 arbitrary decamer nucleotide primers. The results showed that all slow-growing mycelia isolated from lamellae have the same DNA fingerprinting patterns as their origin basidiocarps tissues such as pileus (including lamellae) and stipe, among which the similarity coeffecients all are 1.000. In the clustering dendrograph, all 9 matsutakes collected in Jinlin, China and their respective mycelial isolates from lamellae were clustered together with those slow-growing mycelial isolates presented by Prof Fu weijie in jinlin, Prof. Wang Bo in Sichuan, China and by Dr Akiyoshi Yamadea in Nagano, Japan, whose similarity coeffecients of DNA fingerprintings varied from 0.934 to 0.994. The studies identified all slow-growing mycelia isolated from lamellae as true Tricholoma matsutakeand identified either fast-growing mycelia or yeast isolated from stipe, mycorrhizae and soil as not. The experiments results also indicated that soil-growing fungi Moretiella sp or others didn't occur inside matsutake basidiacarps tested.7. Eight species of ectomycorrhizal mushroom's collection, mycelia isolation and DNA identification. In the study, wild mushrooms Amanita caesarea (Scop:Fr)Pers:Schw, Lactarius volemus Fr, Lactarius pileratus (L:Fr) Gray, Russula fragilis Fr, Canthereallus minor Peck, Suillus granulatus (Fr) kuntze and Sclerodema areolatum Ehreab were collected in Longjing city, Jilin province, China, Lactarius deliciosus (L:Fr)Gray were collected in Yuan'an county, Hubei province, China.Their respective mycelia were isolated Jrom tissue of basidiocarps using 5 kinds of media. The isolates of Suillus granulatus(fi) kuntze .Sclerodema areolatum Ehreab from Jilin province, China, and Russula rubra (krombh ) Bres demanded for DNA identification from Fujian province, China, were analyzed by RAPD fingerprinting comparison with the respective basidiocarps. The results showed that the former two were indeed Suillus and Sclerodema mushrooms' isolates, but the last was not Russula mushroom's.To sum up, RAPD-fingerprinting -comparison technology is economic, fast, sensitive and reliable DNA identification science applying not only to saprophytic, but also to symbiotic and parasitic fungi, which contributes to developing isolation, cultivation and tameness studies of precious and rare wild mushrooms.

TI  - Mixed Farming: Scope and Constraints in West African Savanna
AU  - Slingerland, Maja
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Since colonial times the crop livestock integration concept has been a leading development model in francophone West Africa. So far, it has failed in certain aspects, such as cultivation of fodder crops, intensification of cereal production through animal traction, and sedentarisation of mobile livestock keepers. Three major flaws in the concept have been identified, that are partly responsible for the reported failure: neglect of the farm (household) context, neglect of the financing role of livestock, neglect of competition for land and labour. Whether crop livestock integration can remain the leading development model in a situation of high population growth, has been explored through the following research question:"Is crop livestock integration or mixed farming a suitable model for farming systems development, leading to guaranteed food security and socio-economic survival for all social entities of the rapidly increasing population in Sahelian countries, without endangering their resource basis? " The contextPhysical contextIn the study area, the village Ka'ibo Sud V5, Province Zoundweogo, Burkina Faso, resources and their use appeared to be heterogeneous. Scenario studies with SHARES, a model at the level of Ka'ibo Sud V5, and HOREB, a model at the level of an average farm in Zoundweogo province, indicated that self-sufficiency in grain can not be achieved under currently applied crop and animal production technology in average rainfall years. External inputs in the form of inorganic fertiliser and/or concentrate feed for livestock are needed to compensate unavoidable nutrient losses, and a cart is needed to allow intensive management of crop residues and manure.Agricultural knowledge systemIn Burkina Faso, policy makers, research and extension appear to follow the transfer of technology model, a top-down approach leading to development of technologies that are not necessarily addressing farmers' needs. Research is either curiosity-driven or guided by objectives of policy makers. Extension only reaches a limited number of farmers, hence the progressive farmers approach dominates their relations. Farmers generally adopt proposed technologies, either because they have the means to introduce the innovations or because the proposed innovation suits them best. Only farmers that adopted technologies were contacted subsequently, and in turn, those farmers actively asked research and extension for solutions to their problems. Only when they were recognised as a constituency of the policy makers, they could influence the research agenda. Resource-poor farmers and mobile livestock keepers are neither recognised as a constituency nor possessed the means to innovate, hence they hardly benefit from research and extension. Farming systems developmentA framework situating discrete farming systems in the development perspective of mixed farming, has been designed. The framework ranges from separate specialised low external input (LEIA) systems, through integrated and mixed farming systems without or with external inputs, to specialised high external inputs (HEIA) farming systems. Observed farming systems in Burkina Faso could be classified within the proposed framework. Policy makers, driven by the objective to settle and control mobile herdsmen and to constrain crop producers to permanent fields, aimed at mixed farming systems for everyone. The recent sustainability debate appears to support their promotion of mixed (LEIA) farming systems because they are assumed to reduce nutrient losses. Mobile Fulani herdsmen engage in crop production only, when forced by circumstances, such as drought or animal diseases, leading to severe losses in livestock, making continuation of their former way of life impossible. Mixed farming is a poverty-induced option for them and therefore not attractive. For Mossi crop producers, on the contrary, wealth is the drive towards mixed farming, cattle being needed to support the associated technologies, such as animal traction and use of manure. Resource-poor farmers going into mixed farming have to apply labour-intensive techniques (their only resource) and, because of their low purchasing power, they cannot afford external inputs and have no option but to (over) exploit the environment. High external input (HEIA) farming should avoid pollution of the environment. Ecologically, both HEIA and LEIA can have negative effects on natural resource quality. Socio-economically, high agricultural production per unit area, based on the use of external inputs will lead to larger scale production and lower prices. Resourcepoor farmers cannot follow this development and run the risk of being expelled from farming. Economically, HEIA farming is only sustainable when cash crops are cultivated or when high prices can be guaranteed. Around cities, capital intensive production systems can exist, because of the high purchasing power of the urban population and because of the short producer-consumer lines. In rural areas, farming systems that do not rely on high-quality infrastructure and use labour-intensive techniques, achieving moderate production levels are most suitable, guaranteeing local self-sufficiency in food. Production for export should be based on industrially organised systems using high levels of external inputs and capital. To aim at a variety of farming systems, each addressing specific societal needs, seems a more suitable strategy than to aim at the mixed farming system proposed in the model. Financing role of livestockIn the mixed farming model, the role of livestock was limited to the supply of manure and animal power for crop production, and to value crop residues. For farmers in Burkina Faso and elsewhere in West Africa, livestock plays an important role as capital asset, to cover (emergency) cash needs. In farming systems where crop production depends on erratic rainfall, as in West Africa, livestock can be used to transfer surpluses from years with abundant rainfall to years with deficiencies. Livestock production was negatively affected by this buffer function, because emergency (premature) sales are associated with losses due to  foregone offspring and foregone live weight. Emergency sales further restricted revenues, when livestock had to be sold in periods with low market prices. Sales of livestock for financing purposes also negatively affected performance of the farming system as a whole, in terms of foregone manure and animal traction, limiting crop production.For financing, farmers preferred livestock to other means, even though taking a loan with a savings and credit co-operative was cheaper. Accessibility, security, liquidity and profitability were all more favourable for livestock than for any of the alternatives examined. The fact that a pledge of 150 % of the credit is needed for a loan from a co-operative, was a major constraint for resource-poor farmers. Financing through livestock was therefore more attractive than taking a loan with a co-operative or any other source. Animal tractionAnimal traction has been presented as a key element of crop livestock integration. It appears to be associated with larger farm sizes, larger areas of cash crop and higher livestock numbers, hence with wealthier farmers. In Zoundweogo province and Ka'ibo village, animal traction could develop as there were sufficient animals to serve all households and to cultivate total current crop area. Additional efforts should be made to increase training of bullocks and transfer of bullocks from Fulani livestock keepers to Mossi crop producers is needed. Bullocks appeared too weak for the tasks asked from them, resulting in short working days of 2-3 hours. Output per animal might be increased through introduction of heavier animal breeds or additional animal feeding. Timeliness of seeding and weeding might also be improved by using additional bullocks. The scope for improvement is limited as any solution depends on purchasing power of the farmer and availability of inputs. Natural resource basisMossi and Fulani herds appeared to use the village territory in different ways, dictated by animal species, production objectives and season. Current high population growth leads to an expanded area under crops, for food production, and consequently reduced grazing area in the rainy season. Crop residue management, as proposed in the crop livestock integration model, leads to increased control over this feed resource by Mossi crop producers. As a result, room for the traditional feeding strategy, applied by Fulani and consisting of mobility and tracking changes in vegetation, becomes limited. The quantity (area) of animal feed becomes limiting, especially in the rainy season. In the post-harvest, dry season, both quantity and quality of animal feed becomes limiting because crop residues are no longer available and their animals thus have to rely on low quality grasses from the natural vegetation. Options for Fulani herds were further restricted by excluding them from the use of village wells in the dry season. Fulani have either to leave the village territory more often and for longer periods, or to accept lower animal production. When Mossi specialised crop producers become mixed farmers, the number of animals in their system increases. When Fulani become mixed farmers, their livestock will reside more permanently on the village territory. Larger livestock numbers and smaller grazing area increase risks of degradation, especially because specialist feeders such as goats and sheep will be forced to accept a more general diet, resulting in diet overlap between formerly complementary feeders. Population growth and subsequent urbanisation has been shown to lead to increased demands for firewood that has to be provided from village territories. Degradation of the natural resources in village territories and a decrease in feed resources for browsers can be the result. ConclusionThe crop livestock integration model, and especially the mixed farming model, has only limited applicability as goal for farming systems development. In Burkina Faso, the majority of the farming population consists of resource-poor farmers, incapable to adopt technologies associated with mixed farming, because they lack the purchasing power to acquire ploughs, draught bullocks, inorganic fertilisers, etc. Mixed farming as a comprehensive development model therefore fails, although several of its components are (at least partially) adopted by a variety of farmers. The concept of restricted nutrient losses through intensive management of manure and crop residues appeared, for instance, valid, but, because of unavoidable losses during (re-)cycling, external inputs are needed to guarantee sufficient food production for the rapidly growing population. Moreover, exchange of crop residues and manure between specialised farming systems, has the same potential for nutrient cycling as mixed farming, but may be preferred because of advantages associated with labour distribution. Constraints for farming system development, especially for crop farmers, can be alleviated by creation of an optimal farm environment, such as a sound financial infrastructure, an agricultural knowledge system addressing farmers needs, a professional infrastructure to provide inputs and to guarantee marketing of outputs, fair farm-gate prices for agricultural products, etc. Attractive prices for meat and milk, infrastructure for veterinary care, grazing rights protected by law and limiting crop production in designated grazing areas and corridors, etc. are needed to facilitate mobile animal production. Technology development should already take its impact on the environment into account. Research and extension should stimulate participation of resource-poor farmers and mobile livestock keepers in technology development and support development of a range of farming systems, in terms of inputs and outputs, because together they can address the variety of societal needs.

TI  - Study on riparian ecosystem degradation assessment of urban river in shanghai : a case study of suzhou creek
AU  - Wang, Dong Dong
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorRiver degradation becoming the primary problem faced by the river ecosystem of countries all over the word. With the accelerating process of urbanization, riparian zone, especially urban riparian ecosystem suffers serious degradation because of human interference. Degradation assessment is not noly the important means of protect and repair the riparian zone ecosystem, but also is the effective proof of river regulation and sustainable management. Based on this background, try to study on riparian ecosystem degradation assessment of urban river is useful abstractly and practically for urban riparian zone for planning and management regulation. Literatures and references are complete studied, research progress and degradation mechanism of riparian zone at home and abroad are described. Based on which, connotation of urban riparian zone is showed. Practices on assessing riparian zone in Australia, United States, British, Sweden, South Africa and China are concluded from river health assessment, status assessment and ecological restoration and reconstruction after-assessment three aspects, and evaluation factor database is established. Based on horizontal structure of riparian zone, the paper try to characterization of riparian ecosystem degradation degree from waterfront zone, revetment zone, buffer zone and nearshore zone four aspects. With consideration of the characteristics of urban riparian zone in Shanghai, a degradation assessment system of riparian ecosystem of urban river is established with 4 first-grade indexes (including waterfront zone, revetment zone, buffer zone and nearshore zone) and 23 second-grade indexes after determining the assessment indicators, assessment principle, assessment standards and assessment model. Suzhou Creek in Shanghai is selected as the study case for practice, whose natural characteristics are under signiﬁcant destruction and degradation due to rapid urbanization. 43 reaches were selected as the assessment units on the main stream of Suzhou Creek, constructs indicators database using the method of remote sensing image interpretation and spot investigation, measures the Riparian Comprehensive Situation Index (RCSI). Then it identifies the level of degradation interprets and the RCSI response to reaches location, land use types and two banks on the basis of ANOVA analysis and Spearman correlation analysis, and put forward remediation planning and restoration strategies. Meanwhile, the paper preliminary discussed the scope of riparian zone of Suzhou Creek, and the environmental effects of riparian land-use change of urban river are studied on the basis of Pearson correlation analysis. The results show that: (i) The riparian comprehensive situation of Suzhou Creek is in the poor grade with RCSI distributing from 3.79 to 25.03, and no reach is in the minimal degradation, and 69.8% reaches belongs to serious and extreme degradation grade; (ii) River channelization and revetment hardening of Suzhou Creek result in more than 85% reaches of the waterfront and revetment zone status belonging to serious and extreme degradation grade, the width of waterfront zone and type of revetment are the key factors to the grade. Though 72.1% reaches of the buffer zone status belongs to slight and moderate degradation grade, irrational vegetation structure and single species problems are still remained. Rapid urbanization makes more than 50% reaches of the nearshore zone status belonging to serious and extreme degradation grade, and impervious area ratio and facilities richness degree are the crucial factors to the grade; (iii) The results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) reveal that human activity intensity and urbanization are the key forces to cause RCSI and most of other indexes having significant differences in reach location, land use types and two banks, while waterfront zone width, revetment slope, erosion degree, α diversity index and longitudinal connectivity have no significant differences; (iv) It has most significant correlation among RCSI, first-grade indexes and second-grade indexes. (v) The scope of riparian zone based on function of control point source pollution and provides biological corridor range of 5.19-30.00m. The scope of riparian zone based on function of the shipping dock or industrial land range of 0.00-7.00m, The scope of riparian zone based on function of open and public housing range of 6.00-30.00m; (vi) 100m buffer landscape corridor is better reflects the environmental effects of riparian land-use change of urban

AB  - James Baldwin tells the story of being arrested in Paris for allegedly stealing a single hotel bedsheet. After spending several weeks and Christmas Day in a cold prison cell, Baldwin was brought to trial. As he was acquitted for the petty crime which he did not commit, he heard “great merriment in the courtroom.” Baldwin said, “I was chilled by their merriment even thought it was meant to warm me. It could only remind me of the laughter I had often heard at home, laughter which I had sometimes deliberately elicited. This laughter is the laughter of those who consider themselves to be at a safe remove from all the wretched, for whom the pain of living is not real…it was borne in one me that this laughter is universal and never can be stilled” (Baldwin, 161). These essays seek to hear and resolve what produces the fake laughter Baldwin describes. This laugher echoes in American society as well as through much of the American literary cannon. Jess Row, in his book, White Flights: Race, Fiction and the American Imagination asks, “What would it mean to accept that America’s great and possibly catastrophic failure is its failure to imagine what it means to live together?” Row, a key influence in this thesis, focuses on deconstructing and reckon with white identity in his essays and in his novel, Your Face in Mine. The novel follows the life of the main character, Martin, a white man, who undergoes racial reassignment surgery. The novel is satirical and critical of privilege and artistic blindness. Row doesn’t assume his race and his body do not matter in the art that he creates. In his 2019 collection of essays, White Flights, Row proposes a new way of writing called “reparative writing”. Row does so, “semiseriously, because it can’t exist until it exists in a community, as a process of dialogue and exchange; and it can’t exist initiated by me alone (or, necessarily, me at all)”. That point should be emphasized, the reparative community is incredibly small or as Row notes, essentially non-existent. Row assumes reparative writing would have tangible implications such as literary activism and resource redistribution. Row also argues that reparative writing means the white writers consider that racism is her “proximate cause of disorder and distress”. Row acknowledges the “reparative work the white subject can undertake in response to racism is…poorly understood and understudied” and that “white American writers are almost never asked to bring their own sadness or their own bodies into play when writing about race or racism; their dreams, their sources of shame, their most nightmarish or unacceptable or crippling fantasies, or their feelings of sadness, paralysis, isolation, or alienation”. Toni Morrison described the issue through a conversation on binaries. She wrote about colonial American’s insistence on defining personal freedom on the backdrop of slavery. To be a free and independent American required an alternate category of enslavement for the idea of freedom to become altogether real. Morrison showed that this dichotomy persists in the white writer’s mind and art in her work, Playing in the Dark: Whiteness in the Literary Imagination. In her review of American literature Morrison argues that there are endless tendencies for “Americans [to] choose to talk about themselves through and within a sometimes allegorical, sometimes metaphorical, but always choked representation of an Africanist presence”. Morrison argues that the consciousness of the white writer uses the enslaved other to free oneself and give the mind license to move freely in the white writer’s “playground of the imagination”. Morrison concludes that “images of blackness can be evil and protective, rebellious, and forgiving, fearful, and desirable- all the self-contradictory features of the self. Whiteness alone, is mute, meaningless, unfathomable, pointless, frozen, veiled, curtained, dreaded, senseless, implacable”. There seems to be two literatures in the United States. The racialized authored by people of color and the largely deracinated literature authored by white writers. It isn’t that race isn’t on the minds of white writers, but the topic is avoided. For starters, if a white writer digs into the issue with any depth or genuine curiosity she will soon be met with difficult feelings or to use Toni Morrison’s phrase, one’s own mute meaninglessness. It is a feeling of shame one would want to escape. Or it is the question of, “What if anything could a white American possible add to the conversation on race in America?”There is nothing to add per say other than sorrow, a reparative stance, and actual reparations. The conversation white people must have, in our lives and in our art, is a conversation with ourselves and one another about how to repair ourselves, reallocate resource, and learn to live together. W.E.B. DuBois asked, “What on earth is whiteness that one should so desire it?”. Taken to the bone, there is little to the identity other than a posture. DuBois described this way of being when he wrote, “I am given to understand that whiteness is the ownership of the earth forever and ever. Amen.”. In these essays I am trying to explore consider the cost and alternatives to white identity. In my essay, Lunar Phases, I write, “White writers have a history of escaping to nature as I have attempted to do in this essay. In the frontier we imagine ourselves to commune with nature or the stars or the moon. In this gaze we become raceless. But if we listen, even to nature, we hear the call to return to our natural rhythms. White women like myself, in ongoing relegation to housework, forced birth, and lack of protection when become mothers, will recognize the ways that we are out of step”. Michal Chabon called the dichotomous or categorical as an “apartheid of consciousness.” This split is within the white writer’s expression. It could be described as an artistic mental illness to continue to create art out of such an intense and pervasive dissociation. In Toni Morrison’s review of the white literary cannon, she sites Sapphira and the Slave Girl, as one attempt that failed not because of Cather’s limited gifts but on account her limited vision in the narrative subject matter, namely the writer herself. Morrison writes that Cather was trying to address a buried subject which is “the interdependent working of power, race and sexuality in a white woman’s battle for coherence”. Morrison noted the flaws in Cather’s attempts and concludes that Cather deserves credit for “undertaking the journey”. Coherence is a goal of these essays while I am aware that it is a process and not a destination that will be achieved here or in a lifetime. Reconciliation itself is a process that must be returned to again and again and not something that can be achieved. Coherence, even in the realm of the imagination, requires that the writer understands where she is from in terms of her gender, race, time, and place. In my essay Electric Feel I give witness ongoing white flight, now from one suburb to the next. It is spoken of in veiled language under the guise of a need for safety. I write of the neighbor worried that “anyone could come over that fence”. Jess Row writes that. “a house is not just a house: it’s an act of psychic positioning, a feedback loop, in which visual surroundings condition the owner’s inner landscape, and vis versa”. To gain coherence would be to bring awareness to this inner landscape of whiteness that desires to be deracinated or color blind and yet still seeks to be surrounded with reflections of oneself, of whiteness. Last week, a non-racist woman told me, following her vacation, “It’s hard to say why Montana was so relaxing for me, but everyone there was white. I think that was it, there was a calmness to it.” Jess Row called this brand of white flight an “aestheticization of social reality” and “a posture of avoidance or evasion: the desire not to have one’s visual field constantly invaded by inconveniently different faces and relationships that are fraught, unfixed, capable of producing equal measures of helplessness and guilt”. Perhaps in Montana the woman was unburdened of her subconscious guilt- the environment catered to her peace of mind. I am arguing in this thesis that a prerequisite to coherence as a white American requires one to become racialized. I argue that we can find one example of reparative fiction in Barbara Kingsolver’s, The Poisonwood Bible. The Price family is a religious family headed by the evangelical Baptist father, Nathan Price. The family sets off to the Congo to redeem the ‘lost peoples’ of Africa and convert them to Christianity. The narrative follows each daughter’s perilous journey through the Congo and her evolving relationship to the land, the people of the Congo, and their father. The daughters evolve, the mother disintegrates emotionally, while Nathan Price remains rigid in his belief that he can save the Africans even as his youngest daughter dies from a snake bite, his crops and farming methods fail, and the people of Congo proceed on with their way of life, their farming own practices and spiritual traditions. The cost of Nathan Price’s shortsightedness is everything. He loses his family, his youngest daughter dies, and he comes undone mentally and lives out the rest of his life meandering the Congo alone. In this way, the novel does what Morrison claims fiction written by white writers should do, “to advert the critical gaze from the racial object to the racial subject; from the described and imagined to the describers and the imaginers; from the serving to the served”. Towards the novel’s end, the elder daughter who remained in Africa and married a local man from the Congo concludes: “If I could reach backward somehow to give Father just one gift, it would be the simple human relief of knowing you’ve done wrong and living through it. Poor Father, who was just one of a million men who never did catch on. He stamped me with a belief in justice, then drenched me in culpability, and I wouldn’t wish such torment even on a mosquito. But that exacting, tyrannical God of his has left me for good…The sins of my fathers are not insignificant. But we keep moving on. As Mother used to say, not a thing stands still but sticks in the mud…I look at my four boys, who are the colors of silt, loam, dust and clay, an infinite palette for children of their own, and I understand that time erases whiteness altogether”. Part of reparative writing must come from a reckoning that whiteness itself belongs to a category of people who have given up attachments to their violent histories, and often to their lineage (Irish, Italian, Croatian) to assume an identity that is based upon conformist ideals and so often assumes false superiority. If this uniting principle were removed, whiteness itself would be erased, reparative writing might offer a new language for what could take its place. It is also true that if the divided consciousness that creates racist structures within the mind were abolished, most other seemingly unrelated neurosis might find their cure. One might learn to move through the world as Ta-Nehisi Coates implores, “to respect every human as being singular”. Coates writes in his letter to his son that, “There is no them without you, and without the right to break you they must necessarily fall from the mountain, lose their divinity, and tumble out of the Dream. And then they would have to determine how to build their suburbs on something other than human bones, how to angle their jails toward something other than a human stockyard, how to erect a democracy independent of cannibalism”. To live and write differently would mean living in a different world, it would mean falling out of that dream. This new world is constituted of different subjective realities that exist in different relationships to time. Human history and interaction might lose its linear structure and appear more as a kaleidoscope. Everyone would have to come home to their experiences, to the present moment, a moment in which we might reconcile our ideals of freedom to the actual conditions. There we might be reduced to what really matters, which is our own level of curiosity, empathy, and kindness in each of our interactions with one another and how that might be reflected in our art. Reparative writing is created out this place albeit an idealized plane that doesn’t exist. However, fiction at its best might be just that, hopeful, reparative, and truly creative of new realities. Of course, this doesn’t mean harsher truths are to be sidestepped. Reparative writing would have to include difficult feelings of shame, guilt, and regret. These feelings have their place in this work. Row notes that reparative writing means the white writer does so “without a break down, or meltdown, confession of sins, and seeking of absolution- that is to make my feelings a catastrophe that has to be dealt with”. This is a key limitation of my work thus far. While I am well acquainted with the feelings of shame and guilt, I have yet to provide an appropriate language for it and I believe this is a key opportunity for myself and white artists moving forward. I explore this lack in the essay, There You Are, in which I experience expression of shame and sorrow in Germany and fail to find any similar expressions in the United States. I write, “In Germany, a sense of shame was allowed, if not welcomed. The citizens there were ashamed of their history, ashamed of the genocide, and ashamed of the hatred that lived in the hearts of the ancestors. They spoke about the shame, and they made it into public display in Nuremburg and at the concentration camps. In the United States, the shame isn’t expressed. The confederate flag can blow widely and freely over citizens. Plantations, riddled with violent histories, can be toured freely while one is on vacation, one can even book a wedding that will provide the charms of southern history”.All these essays draw on experience. Jeffrey Swartz wrote, “In quantum theory experience is the essential reality, and matter is viewed as a representation of the primary reality, which is experience”. In that way, experience is speaking, and experience cannot lie. The conclusions of these essays were drawn because of experience. Here I share a few experiences, how those experiences led to these essays.In my years in Iowa City, I was drawn to a photo titled, Invocation, by Adam Fuss at the university museum. It depicts a baby’s silhouette that is suspended in water. Perhaps in this invocation, or summoning of a deity, the baby is being baptized. The background is warm and bright like the sun, the baby appears a shadow, floating in the water. The baby’s head and arm look as if they are trying to reach for something. I saw in that reach, my own reach, my own searching. The museum was canopied by expansive northern oak trees and after a visit, I would go outside the museum and sit on a bench and take Jimmy John’s tomato sandwich out of my bag. I’d watch the university rowing squad cutting the water’s surface on thin boats. I always wished I had become a rower. I loved the way they moved in unison, in full agreement on when and where to move. They went in a sleek line right down the middle, underneath the pedestrian bridges that were crisscrossed by students who lumbered like turtles with bulging backpacks. This project is about my experiences, how I went out searching, and what I found. At the river’s edge in Iowa City, I was at the start of my adult life. Everything I knew about the world and my place in it was based on my experiences with my brother, Joshua. And those experiences centered on the backdrop of my family’s community which was the insular evangelical church in Iowa. And by insular, I mean that it was all white. I write about worrying about my brother’s soul. He couldn’t pray or speak and therefore he couldn’t make a public confession of sin and claim Jesus as his savior. I was, as a child, deeply worried about his soul. By the insular logic of the church, Joshua was irredeemable. I remember once being in a service and a high schooler raised his hand and asked, “What happened to the native peoples that did not know who Jesus was?” The answer came quick, “They went to hell.” It was that day I began to question conservative Christian ideology, politics, and spiritual tradition and it was that day I realized they might be wrong, which meant maybe Joshua’s soul could be redeemed after all. Joshua came to be a major thematic element in this collection. In these essays, I start with one of my first memories of him from 1996. From there, I provide flash memories of most of the years leading up to 2020. These memories alternate and weave through the other essays which explore experiences outside of that relationship. If we’d been born earlier, in the 1950’s or prior, many of these memories wouldn’t have existed. My brother, around the onset of adolescence or earlier would have become a family secret because he would have been locked away in an insane asylum. The short memories I share from 1999 and 2000 illustrate why his commitment most likely would have been inevitable. There is an important history that led to the shift away from asylums, a movement known as deinstitutionalization. The idea was that those needing care would have their needs met in the context of the community. Hospitals and asylums were riddled with violence, pestilence, the suffering of human beings that were caged liked animals. Community care was seen as a solution to the abuses brought on by institutionalization. The full history of deinstitutionalization is far beyond the scope of this preface, however, here I provide a summary. A major note in the history being that the shift led to the rise of mass incarceration of the mentally ill, overcrowding in nursing homes, and homelessness (Parsons, 2018). Roy Grinkler, in Nobody’s Normal, wrote, “In the late 1770’s, when British prison reformer, John Howard visited the vast network of asylums that had emerged throughout Europe he was disturbed to find that hardened criminals were kept in the same place as the bankrupt and the insane. He understood that the goal of confinement was to create a new space for people who diverged dramatically from what had become the ideal person in emerging capitalism”. Grinkler argues that disabled and mentally ill people were categorized and shut away in asylums largely due to the rise of industrialization and capitalism which created an ethic of “individualism and personal responsibility”. The criminal, the bankrupt, and the mentally ill were “new and shameful category of being” which lead to the American trend in the 1800’s to divide people into two categories: idiots (congenital abnormalities) or imbeciles (developmental disorder of the mind that was lifelong) (Grinkler, 17). E. Torry, in American Psychosis, provides a compact account of the recent history and laments all too common incidents of abuse and neglect. He tells of Charles Furry who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and found with hundreds of maggots falling out of his socks, with more maggots wedged in-between his toes and under his skin, as he sat alone at home in a drool-soaked shirt (Torrey, ix). Community-based care is a failure in the United States. Care for disabled adults is pushed to the individual’s nuclear family often with catastrophic financial results for those families and the individuals in need of help.The history if further nuanced where it intersects with race and mass incarceration in the United States. Additionally, as Martin Summers shows in his work, Madness in the City of Magnificent Intentions, the American mental health system was founded on legacy of racist psychiatric treatment and research at a hospital located at the nation’s capital where there was a “reduction of black madness to a state of mind… and the tendency to think about insane African Americans as flattened caricatures” requiring separate and most often impoverished care when compared to the white patients at that institution. Joshua formed my way of being the world, the relationship made me aware of systems, matrices, and dichotomies. Joshua acts in many ways as what Buddhism calls bodhichitta, which is the “kinship with the suffering of others, this inability to continue to regard it from afar, it is the discovery of our soft spot…[a] tenderness for life, when we can no longer shield ourselves from the vulnerability of our condition, from the basic fragility of existence” (Chödrön, 88). Joshua removed me from any denial of injustice in the United States.In the United States, the category of being an individual is so rigid that the alternate category of being dependent or in need of help is equally extreme. I remember living in the tiny village of Bruckberg, Germany where there is one brewery. I was once sitting in that pub alone when two men entered. They had the physical characteristics indicating Down’s Syndrome. The men had a beer. They talked with one another for a while and then left. For about a year, I lived in a small apartment that was on a hill overlooking Bruckberg. At the center of the village was a yellow structure, the largest in town with a bell tower. It was a home for disabled people I would watch people of all abilities roaming the village and returning in the evenings to the home. I had never, in the United States, seen such an image of care and freedom. To “allow” a man with Downs who was institutionalized to wander freely and “allow” him to drink a beer was foreign. The German institution challenged the category of being dependent or independent. The residents of the home needed some structure, some help, but they were not solely dependent, they had freedom. Freedom to roam around, stop over and have a beer. America’s relationship her most vulnerable is extremely rigid. In the case of the disabled the pendulum swung from institutionalization and subjugation to another extreme, absolute neglect in the form forced self-determination.James Baldwin wrote, “It must be remembered the oppressed and the oppressor are bound together within the same society; they accept the same criteria, they share the same beliefs, they both alike depend on the same reality”. In speaking of someone as being disabled or able bodied, or in terms of one’s gender or one’s race, we are entering into the system of categorizations and a constructed reality. We run the risk of perpetuating the very systems we would like to escape. The writer must, as Baldwin explained, reject the category as the defining feature of the human being. In these essays I write about experiences sometimes in the context of my gender, my sexuality, my abilities, and my race. I do not understate the importance of gender. The intersection of gender and race is explored more deeply in Lunar Phases and Boss and more generally in the stories about who was the caretakers for Joshua, and the essay High Rise. Categories must be named, but I recognize that the categories themselves fortify a structure. Categories are the structure; the real people are operating within or outside of those boxes. My reach here is simple but honest, they are experiences. I hope that in my future work I can go farther and take more risks. In these essays there is a recognition of categories and structures and a few modest escapes. These essays lay a critical emotional and intellectual foundation for me as a writer, to proceed into other forms of writing such as fictional short stories and novels with a base from which to begin to relate myself to the world in all my identities, connections and even limitations. I believe that it is a white writer’s obligation to do as writers of color have been doing alone for far too long alone, and that is to bring white identity into our art and our conceptualization of what needs to progress in the United States and the world. We need look no further than the work of William Faulkner and Flannery O’Connor to see that effort was made to reckon with whiteness. But the limitation was in their faith. I believe O’Connor and Faulkner saw racism as America’s proximate cause of distress, however, I am not convinced that they wrote from a place of believing that progression out of and past that distress was possible. White writers should be asking, what will those that come after me find disgraceful? One way to avoid the pitfalls is to listen, listen to the writers and thinkers such as Brittany Cooper, James Baldwin, DuBois, Toni Morrison, and others as I have tried to do in these essays. And the other way is creating our art and our fictions not from despair but from an almost inconceivable faith that the future will survive, and it will be so much better than the present.And I hope that the conclusions of these essays are like the conclusions I express in my essay about white flight, Electric Feel. In that essay, I explore my reactions to the white women I meet that want to move away from Pflugerville to Georgetown, sometimes explicitly stating why and sometimes veiling their reasonings, leaving in their wake a lack of coherence and a crucial silence. In that essay, I’m not so sure that I can change anyone’s minds in conversation or even in the writing itself, but I identify in the children a reality none of should miss: “There is an electric feel in Pflugerville, Texas. The traffic buzzes in patterns of red and yellow lights, Tesla charging stations pop up on every corner zapping every sleek car engine into their electric lives of modern speed and acceleration devoid of petroleum. The children here are numerous, they crowd the grocery stores with incredible enthusiasms, and they line their shelves with unheard-of books about new children that come from everywhere flagged in their country’s lost glory. The children overtake those playgrounds baking in the sun, their skin a kaleidoscope coming in multitudinous shades of melanation. They climb the slides backwards to the tops, claiming their thrones as sweaty kings and queens with holes ripped in the knees of their pants. I can hear them speaking multiple languages and they seem to laugh at my confinement to a singular language, English. These children easily conquer English, and they also speak Spanish, Swahili, Yoruba, German, and Hindi. The words and sentences and paragraphs roll off their lips so easily. I can hear their words gathering strength as lightening does. They swing next to one another pumping their legs furiously as they all shout, “Higher! Higher! Demanding once and for all to play together”.

TI  - Flight characteristics of non-migrating and migrating populations of turkey vultures
AU  - Arrington, David Patrick
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Flight altitude characteristics of non-migrating turkey vultures (Cathartes aura) were examined in Indiana and Ohio for future incorporation into aircraft/bird avoidance models. Vultures spent 74.3% of the day perched and 25.7% in flight. Of time in flight, 97.4% was at or below 151m (500 ft) above ground level (AGL), corroborating previous studies suggesting these birds fly primarily at low altitudes for foraging efficiency and energy conservation, even when available dynamic lift would allow flight at much higher altitudes. There was no significant difference in altitude band selection among 3 sites separated by >200km, demonstrating that altitude modeling is possible. Correlating weather variables with altitude selection proved difficult; regression analysis yielded mixed results, forcing a simplistic altitude model concept. Turkey vultures do not move randomly across the landscape, but remain within annual home ranges that target specific habitat types. Average home range size for 3 separate populations from 1996–1998 ranged from 149km 2 at NPBRS (Ohio site) to 627km2 at CNSWC (south-central Indiana site); associated embedded 90% Kernel values for the same locations were 20km2 and 170km2. Turkey vultures spent 77.7% of the day perched in or flying over wooded habitat and spent much less time in other available habitats—agriculture (15.4%), landfills (6.1%), urban (0.6%) and wetlands (0.1%). Observations, averaged for each site, showed that the majority of movements within home ranges were within 15km of the primary roost—NPBRS (99%), PRFWA (97%), and CNSWC (92%). Data demonstrated that turkey vulture movements around primary roost sites could be modeled for inclusion into existing U.S. Air Force bird avoidance procedures. However, identification of primary roost sites within boundaries of low-level flight corridors is necessary to complete this task. Satellite data were collected on 2 turkey vultures (1 immature and 1 adult) captured at the National Plum Brook Research Station, Ohio. Two additional birds tagged at Pigeon River Fish and Wildlife Area failed to provide data. The immature bird provided 107 locations and 7 migration movements; 5 of the 7 movements (71%) were associated with a weather-front passage. The bird migrated 289km southwest, and settled in spring in an area 211 km south of the initial trapping location. The mature bird provided 93 locations and 15 migration movements; 12 of the 15 movements (80%) were associated with a weather-front passage. The bird migrated 1287km southeast and returned to the trapping area <3 months later. The flight altitude and habitat association data on these birds proved unreliable. In order to attain critical flight altitude and habitat preference data, future bird avoidance research of migrating turkey vultures should utilize global positioning systems.

TI  - A Modelação Dinâmico-Espacial na Gestão do Parque Natural da Madeira: Qual a Relação da Comunidade de Passeriformes Comuns com a Qualidade Ecológica dos Habitats Nativos?
AU  - Gonçalves, Adriana José Abreu
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - As ilhas oceânicas têm cativado o interesse de biólogos evolucionistas e ecólogos por serem entidades territoriais confinadas mas, em regra, com elevada biodiversidade, funcionando como modelos ideais para o estudo de processos evolutivos e de alteração ambiental. As ilhas são normalmente caracterizadas por um número significativo de espécies endémicas, que surgem por processos de especiação em contextos de isolamento (ecótipos ou neo-endemismos), bem como por habitats/ecossistemas únicos. Nesta perspectiva, a conservação e gestão destes valores ecológicos é crucial para garantir a sua viabilidade e sustentabilidade face às pressões antropogénicas a que estão sujeitos. Na Madeira, este desígnio conservacionista tem sido desenvolvido no seu Parque Natural. No presente trabalho pretende-se demonstrar a aplicabilidade de um protocolo de modelação dinâmico-espacial na previsão de tendências ecológicas relevantes para avaliar o estado de conservação de habitats nativos. A metodologia estocástico-dinâmica (StDM) foi a abordagem seleccionada em virtude de permitir estudar localmente o modo como indicadores ecológicos relevantes, expressos ao nível das comunidades, respondem às alterações do meio envolvente. O principal objetivo deste trabalho consistiu na selecção de indicadores que permitam avaliar qualidade ecológica dos habitats nativos em contraposição com os habitats moldados pela actividade humana, como as áreas periurbanas e agro-florestais. Para este efeito foram selecionados atributos das comunidades de passeriformes comuns (riqueza específica e abundância) como indicadores da presença de habitats humanizados, muito marcados pela presença de espécies exóticas, potenciais ameaças para a integridade dos habitats nativos. Em termos demonstrativos foram considerados dois cenários contrastantes: (1) o cenário de continuidade, tendo em conta o histórico das alterações em curso no território da Madeira, que têm gerado o aumento das espécies exóticas e da sua dispersão; (2) o cenário de gestão dos habitats nativos, com a implementação mais generalizada de medidas de conservação e de controlo de exóticas.Em termos comparativos, não obstante a degradação implícita no cenário de continuidade (especialmente induzida pela proliferação de espécies exóticas), os passeriformes revelaram-se bons indicadores da prevalência das características associadas a ecossistemas humanizados, com abundâncias relativas mais elevadas nesses contextos. Quando a gestão é simulada de forma a minimizar os efeitos associados às práticas humanas e/ou das suas consequências sobre os ecossistemas nativos (cenário de gestão), onde se privilegiou a manutenção dos habitats nativos e o controlo da expansão de espécies exóticas, as comunidades de passeriformes típicas dos sistemas humanizados reflectem essas tendências diminuindo a sua abundância relativa (embora sem reflexos na riqueza específica) nos ecossistemas/habitats alvo dessas medidas de conservação.

TI  - Mapping the Global Black South: Aesthetics, Labor, and Diaspora
AU  - McInnis, Jarvis Conell
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Recent scholarship on black transnationalism and diaspora in the early twentieth century has largely focused on migration to the urban centers of the US North and Western Europe. “Mapping the Global Black South: Aesthetics, Labor, and Diaspora” revises this discourse by exploring the movement of people, cultural practices, and ideas between the US South and the Caribbean as an alternative network of African diasporic affiliation. According to Caribbean theorist Édouard Glissant, “the Plantation system” created a “rhythm of economic production” and a “style of life” that links the US South to the Caribbean and parts of Latin America. Building on Glissant’s geographic frame, this dissertation establishes the plantation—a fundamentally modern form of labor organization—as the figural and literal organizing principle of “the global black south”: a matrix of diasporic articulation, subject formation, and knowledge and cultural production. Through close readings of works by Booker T. Washington, Claude McKay, Zora Neale Hurston, and Jean Price-Mars, this study examines how African American and Caribbean writers and intellectuals mobilized aesthetics—literature, music, photographs, and performance—to imagine alternative futures within and against the legacy of the plantation.   By drawing on theories of the plantation in Caribbean and New Southern Studies, “Mapping the Global Black South” makes critical interventions in the field of African American Studies, where the plantation is almost exclusively regarded as a metonym for slavery and anti-modernity. In Caribbean Studies, by contrast, scholars have proposed a more nuanced rendering of the plantation as the genesis of black modern life and culture, and in New Southern Studies, it has been reconceived as the link that tethers the US South to the global south (based on similar patterns of underdevelopment). Through an interdisciplinary and multimedia methodology,  then, this study interrogates the paradox of the plantation as at once local and global, fecund and barren, static and fungible—as a site of agricultural production that animates the flow of global capital, on the one hand, and a modern technology of power that exploits the land and the bodies forced to work it, on the other. In so doing, it establishes the plantation as a matrix of global black south cultures that revises traditional understandings of black modernity and creates new systems of connectivity and legibility for contemporary scholarship.  Moreover, in reconsidering the plantation as a crucible of black modernity, “Mapping the Global Black South” reconstructs the historical significance of the Tuskegee Institute—a former plantation turned industrial school—as a nodal point of black diasporic affiliation and a model for resolving one of the fundamental predicaments of New World blackness: the problem of free labor. Given that slavery was a system of coerced and exploitative labor, the greatest challenge of emancipation throughout the global black south was transforming a mass of formerly enslaved persons into autonomous workers. Thus, by the turn of the twentieth century, black artists and intellectuals from across the region began to embrace (and adapt) Booker T. Washington’s vision of an agrarian and industrial future (by way of Tuskegee) as a strategy for racial uplift and self-determination. Whereas Washington’s reformism is commonly reduced to a foil for W.E.B. Du Bois’ radicalism, this dissertation resituates Washington within a hemispheric framework to reconsider how his theories contribute to a more capacious epistemology of the “plantation” in African American Studies.   “Mapping the Global Black South” is thus organized around two interrelated concerns: the plantation as an alternative framework of black transnationalism and a site of cultural production that evinces the persistence of black life within structures of social death; and Tuskegee’s significance as a symbol of modernity and a nodal point of diasporic articulation at the turn of the twentieth century. In so doing, it illuminates how the plantation shaped the new futures that emerged in the US South and the Caribbean in the aftermath of slavery.

TI  - The Clinical and Environmental Epidemiology of Penicillium Marneffei Infection in Vietnam
AU  - Le, Thuy
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Infection due to Penicillium marneffei (renamed to Talaromyces marneffei in 2011) has emerged as an important public health problem over the past two decades due to the arrival of the HIV epidemic in Asia. Since 2004, P. marneffei has become the second most common pathogen isolated from routine blood culture, after Cryptococcus neoformans, at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, the largest referral centre for HIV care in southern Vietnam. The clinical epidemiology of P. marneffei infection has not been studied in Vietnam. The fundamental epidemiological questions regarding the pathogen reservoirs and risks of acquisition remain poorly understood. The diagnosis relies on isolation of the pathogen from clinical specimens and can take up to 14 days to identify, resulting in delayed initiation of therapy which is associated with worse treatment outcomes. This thesis aims to increase knowledge and understanding of the clinical and environmental epidemiology of P. marneffei infection and to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis of P. marneffei infection. The Précis provides a brief background and rationale for the thesis. Chapter 1 is an introductory chapter and provides an overview of the epidemiology, ecology, mycology, pathology, immunology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of P. marneffei infection. Chapter 2 summarizes the incidence and features of P. marneffei admissions at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City over a 13 year period. During this period, 795 patients with P. marneffei infection were identified and hospital charts were obtainable for 513 (65%) patients. The data showed clear seasonality with an increase in incidence of approximately 30% during the rainy season compared to the dry season. The clinical and microbiological features and treatment outcomes of the patients were characterised. Poor outcome, defined as death or worsening disease at hospital discharge, occurred in 28% of patients. History of injection drug use, shorter duration of illness, absence of fever or skin lesions, higher respiratory rates, and lower platelet counts independently predicted poor outcome. Chapter 3 describes an analysis of meteorological factors that determine penicilliosis incidence in Ho Chi Minh City. Humidity, rather than precipitation, was the most important factor that governs the seasonality of penicilliosis. Higher humidity was associated with increased odds of penicilliosis versus cryptococcosis admissions. The infection incubation period was estimated to be between one and three weeks. Chapter 4 describes an analysis of exposure and behavioural risk factors for penicilliosis based on a matched case control study of 205 culture-confirmed HIV-infected penicilliosis cases and 405 HIV-infected controls recruited from two major HIV referral centres in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Penicilliosis was independently associated with proximity or exposure to tropical plants and exposure to farmed animals. The geographical analysis showed that patients living in or traveling to the highland regions were at increased risk for penicilliosis in southern Vietnam. Chapter 5 describes the development of a Taqman real-time PCR assay based on a novel Mp1 gene target unique to P. marneffei for rapid detection of P. marneffei infection in patient plasma. The assay was tested in 70 plasma samples from HIV-infected patients (50 with culture-confirmed penicilliosis, 20 with other opportunistic infections) and showed a clinical specificity of 100% (20/20) and sensitivity of 70.4% (19/27) and 52.2% (12/23) prior to and within 24-48 hours of antifungal therapy administration, respectively. Chapter 6 is an overview discussion interpreting the implications of the major findings and the future direction of P. marneffei research. The work of this thesis increases knowledge of the clinical epidemiology of P. marneffei infection in Vietnam, providing essential data for the design of prospective studies to improve the diagnosis and treatment of P. marneffei infection in Asia. The data suggest that multiple environmental factors including humidity, tropical plants, farmed animals, and highland location, are important drivers of P. marneffei infection in southern Vietnam. The real-time PCR assay showed potential as a rapid ârule-in' test for P. marneffei in this pilot study and should be prospectively evaluated in a large cohort to determine if it can improve diagnostic speed and crucially, impact patient outcomes. Prevention, diagnosis and elimination all require further research to reduce the high mortality following clinical disease caused by P. marneffei in Asia.

TI  - Landscape, Communities, and "the Community at Palmers River": Settling a River System, 1665-1737, Rehoboth, Massachusetts
AU  - Abernathy, Leslie Clive, III
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - This dissertation is an historical archeological examination of a preindustrial agricultural society, originally an emigrant group with English cultural traditions. The focus is on that society as it initially occupied the Palmers River drainage basin in southeastern New England in what is now the township of Rehoboth, Massachusetts. The settling of this river system occurred between about 1665 and 1737, and parallelled the expansion of settlement to the hinterlands of townships in the entire region.This study was carried out using the technique of historical archeology to answer questions drawn from social and cultural anthropology about the relationships between settlement pattern, social organization, and ideological variation. Historical archeology combines the field study of the physical record and the examination of the documentary record. Access to the documentary record made it possible to test the assumption that archeological research alone can provide data sufficient for the correct identification of the connections between cultural material, here represented by the artifact of a cultural landscape, and cultural ideas, here the ideological subdivisions of a social system. The access to nonarcheological data also allows a demonstration of the contribution data from other sources can make in answering questions using settlement pattern analysis.Given the combination of data sources and the depth of the anthropological questions being investigated, a variety of research steps were needed. These began with archeological and architectural surveys that recorded 422 historical loci to identify the nodes of domestic and public settlement established during the target period of initial landscape organization, about 45 sites. The second step was to use the demographic technique of family reconstitution to identify the social units who established the sites and to trace connections made beteen families by marriages. The third step was to examine these families and their connections in the light of documents indicating religious affiliation to establish the presence of subdivisions in the social system based on ideological variation in transplanted English reformed Protestantism. Finally, conventional analysis of records of political and religious activity in the Palmers drainage provided an historical context for the social patterning of kinship networks and the physical patterning of settlement.It was found as a result of these research steps that the archeological settlement pattern did not fully reflect the complexities of the social landscape. The settlement pattern was dispersed, but the families spatially and socially organized themselves into two separate territories based on religious affiliation reinforced by marriage ties. One territorial community was Congregationalist. The other was Baptist. Both planted public expressions in the cultural landscape with separate meeting houses and cemeteries.The powerful combination of archeological data and documentary data permitted this investigation to move beyond simplistic quantitative modelling to approach the understandings of human behavior more usually associated with the ethnographic record. It was therefore possible to determine that planning decisions were made by families regarding where to settle not on the necessities of subsistence but on the mandates of religious belief, the variations of which are not reflected in the archeological record. The scattered family farmsteads therefore represent not a landscape of isolation, but one of integration of families into kin and ideological communities.

TI  - The encounter between two kinds of action logic-- the sociological analysis on the process of rural public crisis management from a village in northwest china
AU  - Guo, Zhan Feng
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorAs globalization continued to spread in the early 21st century, various kinds of global crisis appeared frequently. After 2003 "SARS", public crisis management did not only become the focus of scholars, but also, attracted the main management attention of the Chinese Central government for the first time. Considering this transition, China is undoubtedly faced with the challenges of adjusting the traditional interest, resetting the political and social structures.Other challenges include; increasing population flow and a series of changes, combined with information convergence and integration on a global scale. The latter has led to the collision and evolution of traditional and cultural values. All these dramatic changes have led to increased social instability; therefore China has entered a crisis-prone period. Taking into account of the crisis characteristics of urgency, danger, uncertainty, suffering and difficulty, and many others (as evidenced in the high-frequency Sichuan earthquake and other current reality of China's crisis situation), it is of paramount importance for China central government to properly implement crisis management timely and effectively. Rural public crisis management is not only an important part of crisis management for China Central Government, but also an indispensable component of rural development and management. At the micro level, this paper explores respective action logic of smallholders and local government in the public crisis management and the encountering process of these two kings of action logic, in order to pursue theoretic reasons of deviation for the two actions logic, and try to find the effective rural public paths for the current crisis management based on the reality of the situation. Ying Village of He town in W City, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region was selected as field Survey village. The major case for analysis was the bird flu crisis which occurred in 2006. We divided the crisis management process into three phases; crisis early warning, crisis management (risk identification, risk isolation) and crisis recovery. At each phase, we discussed the respective action logic of the local government and smallholders during the process of crisis management. The following are the main conclusions: With the reforms and opening up, the state is playing a very important role in promoting local economic development, which is making the smallholders gradually become rational from the tranditional planting to intensive breeding, and has led to the tendency of individual's interests of the family-based for smallholders and also has accelerated disintegration of the rural community. It has therefore become difficult for the farmers to gather together in "collective action" for the rural public crisis management. With the "role evolution" of local government gradually from the "agent-based power operator" to "profit-based power operators ", the "self interest" of the local government is becoming more prominent, which leads to "agent behavior alienation " for the local government, and then results in deviating between these two kinds of action logic of the local government and the smallholders in the process of rural public crisis management, eventually leads to irreversible damage for the local social-economic development. In short, there is conflict between the smallholders' action logic of the family-based interests and local official government's action logic of the individual-based interests, and it is difficult to reconcile the conflict in a short time. Once the two actions logic has met, there will be serious ill effect on the rural publi crisis management. Based on the above findings, we propose the following discussion: Based on local social and cultural networks, we should foster the civil "response unit" in rural public crisis management and try to make the smallholders become "actors" not "bystanders".We suggest the reconstruction of the "rural community" and enhancement of smallholders' participation capacity in rural public crisis management and try to avoid the family-based interests of smallholders. Meanwhile, we suggest that the local government's unreasonable "self interest" should be controlled and supervised, in order to avoid the local official government's interest of individual-based. We advocate increasing in public space of rural non-governmental organizations from the "Crisis Management" to the "Crisis Governance". We also suggest innovation in rural public crisis management paradigm, and exploring the analysis framework of localization on the study of rural public crisis management in

TI  - Riparian forest vegetation patterns and historic channel dynamics of the Big Sioux River, South Dakota
AU  - Ley, Matt J.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The Big Sioux River, a major tributary to the Missouri River, drains approximately 22,550 km2 in South Dakota, Iowa, and Minnesota.  Compared to many other Great Plains rivers, the Big Sioux is relatively natural and free-flowing, with a largely intact riparian corridor and little flow regulation.  Along its course, the river flows through a largely agriculturally dominated matrix that contains several major population centers.  The close proximity to these agricultural and urban land uses have contributed to a number of water quality problems during the last 50 years that have threatened the ecologically integrity of the Big Sioux.  In order to conserve and properly manage the Big Sioux corridor, it will be important to gain an improved scientific understanding of ecological patterns and their environmental correlatives along the river.  This thesis is an attempt to provide these data.   Using modern aerial imagery and ground-truthing techniques, I quantified the current extent of riparian forest communities along a 576 km stretch of the Big Sioux River.  In total, there were 7 dominant riparian forest community types along the river that contributed to 6.85% of the total Big Sioux basin land cover.  Riparian forest extent increased from north to south and was dominated by the Silver Maple-Elm-Cottonwood Forest community type (41% of total).  In addition, 35 riparian forest sites and 5 upland forest sites were sampled to examine the typical vegetative characteristics of forest within the basin.  In general, floristic quality and basal area decreased from south to north and % exotics increased.  These findings provided data on riparian forest habitats along the river and can be used to assess future forest restoration efforts.   Streamflow has increased dramatically over the last 30 years in the Big Sioux basin (122% increase in mean annual flow) resulting in a highly significant, 62% increase in channel planform area, a 4% decrease in channel length and sinuosity, and a 69% increase in channel width.  These channel adjustments were highly correlated with increasing mean annual flows and baseflow.  To examine why these increases have occurred, the relative effects of land use change and climatic variation were examined, with findings from these analyses lending support towards land use change, specifically agricultural intensification, being a more important driver of increased streamflow and channel adjustments than changes in the climatic regime.  These results are in line with findings from similar studies of agriculturally dominated basins throughout the Upper Midwest.   The final chapter examines potential pitfalls and uncertainties associated with using the Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) across state boundaries.  In total, results from 18 riparian and upland forest sites along the South Dakota/Iowa border were compared using Coefficients of Conservatism (C-values) from each state.  Findings indicated that for the 141 observed species, South Dakota mean C-values were higher (3.57) than Iowa (2.50) and that there were 98 C-value divergences between states with 20 being equal to ± 4.  FQA  values calculated using Iowa C-values were consistently lower than South Dakota and highlight the subjective nature of assigning  C-values at the individual state level. This thesis provides several recommendations that would improve the utility of the FQA and allow it to become more widely standardized as a valuable ecological assessment tool.   This thesis provides baseline data critical to targeting current and future management efforts along the Big Sioux and provides an improved scientific understanding of ecological patterns in habitats along this valuable watershed in eastern South Dakota and northwestern Iowa.

TI  - A Tale of Two Viruses: The Ability Of New World Mammals to Host Old World Viruses
AU  - Lewis, Juliette
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The majority of human pandemics throughout history have zoonotic origins. The etiological agent of the bubonic plague, which devastated the human population as it emerged and re-emerged, was a result of spillover from rodents to humans via an arthropod vector. In more recent years, novel emerging pathogens are often viruses. From the vector-borne flaviviruses such as West Nile virus, dengue virus, and Zika virus, to the notorious coronaviruses, ever-reassorting influenza viruses, and high consequence paramyxoviruses, animal reservoirs are a source of endless spillover potential. What is the common thread woven among these spillovers? They are the products of anthropogenic change; the domestication of animals, such as livestock, birds, and pets, the encroachment of humans into and destruction of natural habitats, and the construction of urban habitats create new interfaces between animals that may have not interacted otherwise and provide the opportunity for viruses to transmit and adapt to new hosts, including humans.Like ancient history, much of human pandemic history has been centered in the Old World. As a result, surveillance efforts have primarily focused on areas where important spillover events have historically occurred, such as China, southeast Asia, and Africa. Consistent surveillance in these regions will help us prepare for another spillover event from those same geographic origins. However, surveillance tunnel vision on the Old World leaves us vulnerable and unsuspecting in the western hemisphere, where those same anthropogenic factors are at play in creating interfaces for spillover events. Several viruses have already shown us that pathways from animals to humans are in place for viruses in the New World, and that Old World viruses are capable of establishing transmission cycles in new animal species. For example, the first documented case of West Nile virus in humans was in Uganda in 1937. Over the course of the 20th century, its range expanded to include all of the Old World. In 1999, West Nile virus made its debut in New York City, and quickly became endemic to most of North America, spreading through its reservoir host, birds. This is not a new story: Zika virus, dengue virus, rabies virus, and SARS-CoV-2 were all imported to the New World where they gained entry to wildlife and domestic animal populations.In this work, the primary goal was to assess the ability of New World mammals to host high-consequence Old World viruses. First, henipaviruses are examined, which are members of the viral family Paramyxoviridae and includes Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV), two species that cause high fatality in humans. Henipaviruses exist primarily in their reservoir hosts, which include bats, rodents, and shrews in the Old World, and very recently, opossums in the New World. To provide context and summarize what is known about the circulation of paramyxoviruses in New World bats, chapter 2 of this dissertation reports on surveillance efforts, gaps, and findings.The third chapter herein investigates the susceptibility of a New World bat species, the Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis), to henipaviruses using in vitro and in vivo methods. The immune response of Jamaican fruit bat cells to infection by these viruses was characterized, as well as how a model henipavirus, Cedar virus (CedV), adapts to Jamaican fruit bat cells. Our data indicate that Jamaican fruit bat cells are susceptible to NiV, HeV, and CedV. NiV and HeV were able to effectively shut down the antiviral response in the bat cells while CedV induced high antiviral gene expression. Serial passaging of CedV on Jamaican fruit bat cells resulted in several mutations to the viral genome and an improved ability to replicate and cause cytopathic effect in the cells. Lastly, intranasal challenge of three Jamaican fruit bats with CedV resulted in a transient infection with oral and rectal shedding, viremia in one bat, and seroconversion. These results indicate that a widespread species of New World bat is susceptible to experimental henipavirus infection, and that they could potentially be a reservoir should henipavirus spillback occur in the Americas.While our investigation into Jamaican fruit bats as potential hosts of henipaviruses was underway, news of the “novel coronavirus-19” broke. In response, we shifted the focus of our work to the new virus threatening public health: SARS-CoV-2. To contribute to the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and explore potential spillback hosts, we pivoted to determining the susceptibility of a subspecies of North american deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus nebrascensis) to the virus. Initial susceptibility testing revealed that SARS-CoV-2 causes a subclinical infection in deer mice, though pathology was evident in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Immune gene assessment via qPCR arrays indicate that deer mice mount a pro-inflammatory type I inflammatory response to control infection. In a subsequent experiment, the ability of deer mice to transmit SARS-CoV-2 conspecifically was determined up to two passages. This experiment established that deer mice are capable of sustained intraspecific transmission, an important characteristic of a potential reservoir.Given the wide geographic distribution and numerous species of deer mice, we conducted susceptibility testing of two additional deer mouse species (P. polionotus, P. californicus) and two additional subspecies of North American deer mouse (P. m. sonoriensis, P. m. bairdii). Virus isolation from oral swabs and lung samples and seroconversion indicate that all tested species and subspecies of deer mice are susceptible and suggest broad susceptibility of mice in the genus Peromyscus to SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, two California deer mice (P. californicus) developed clinical signs and one was euthanized for humane reasons. Given that SARS-CoV-2 has already been transmitted from humans to a number of animals, including American mink (Neogale vison) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), it is not unreasonable that deer mice, a geographically ubiquitous peridomestic animal, could be naturally exposed to the virus.The work presented herein demonstrates that there are viable wildlife hosts for important pathogenic human viruses in the New World. Surveillance, although sparse, has shown that viruses related to human pathogens circulate in rodents and bats in the Americas, and therefore it is critical to be prepared for a spillover event in this geographic region by increasing surveillance efforts and characterizing potential animal hosts from which viruses may emerge. As deforestation, urbanization, and climate change progress, new opportunities for virus-sharing between wildlife, domestic animals, and humans are created and will, undoubtedly, result in the next pandemic.

TI  - A Fusion of Nature and Technology?: Icelandic Identity, Activism, and the Art of Björk
AU  - Daly, Elissa
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - This dissertation investigates the effects of massive industrialization, technological sophistication, and environmental problems in Iceland on the music of Björk, Iceland's most renowned living musician. In the seventy-year period since Icelanders gained independence from Denmark, their perception of themselves has changed from a fishing and farming community to an urban community preoccupied with technological development. I investigate the way this shift in Icelandic identity has been expressed through the art of Iceland's pop stars with a focus on Björk. In the last twenty years, during Björk's rise to fame, Iceland has become a contender in the global economy in the areas of technology and sustainable energy. The collapse of Icelandic currency and the proposed construction of major hydroelectric power plants and aluminum manufacturing plants at the expense of the natural environment has forced Icelanders to make difficult choices. This dissertation investigates the ways Icelandic identity explains how Icelanders have responded to these choices and in particular how one Icelandic musician did. A preoccupation with nature, Icelandic nationalism, a pagan identity derived from old Norse Eddas and Sagas, self-sufficiency, rebellion, isolation or "alien" identity, and a modern-day preoccupation with technology are recurring themes in Björk's music that provide a gateway to understanding a shift in Icelandic identity that has occurred during the last century.An investigation into Icelandic culture, politics, economics, and popular music expression indicates the extent to which local environmental crises, the global climate crisis, and Icelandic popular music are linked. While retaining a vast pristine landscape, Iceland has still fallen prey to environmental destruction that plagues other locales of the world. Informed by the growing field of ecomusicology, this study views the popular music scene of Iceland as a kind of petri dish: a microcosm that demonstrates how economic and social pressures affect popular music. Just as Darwin found the basis for a theory of evolution in his study of the Galapagos Islands, we can learn about pressures that are put upon music and the ways that music responds to those pressures by studying this small island nation near the Arctic Circle.

TI  - The Archaeology of Small-Scale Slavery in Antebellum Missouri
AU  - Haas, James Elliott
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - In this thesis, I examine small-scale slavery and resistance by the enslaved to their condition using the conceptual framework of resistant accommodation, as applied to the circumstances on my family’s farm in Missouri. My family were slaveholders who came from Kentucky and settled in Hardin Township, Clinton County, Missouri, circa 1833. Family oral history included information on the location of the first house, but little else.The term resistant accommodation, developed based on small-scale farming operations in colonial New England, implies that the enslaved outwardly conformed to the demands of their enslavers while covertly circumventing those demands to further their own interests. In this conceptual framework, resistance is not an end in itself. It further suggests that individual acts of resistance coalesced into a community of resistance through the networking, shared experiences, and mutual trust that developed among the enslaved when they were able to exploit gaps in the surveillance of their enslavers. Gaps in surveillance arose in part from enslavers’ competing attempts to maintain surveillance while also using their work force efficiently and emphasizing separateness through the control of shared space. The nature of the landscape was also a factor.I hypothesize that conditions in colonial New England were broad enough to apply to slaveholder surveillance and resistance by the enslaved on small-scale farms across the antebellum Upper South and in Border States such a Missouri. I then present a case study using data from my family farm, settled by my great-great-great grandfather James Elliott, to test whether those data support an interpretation that conditions for the people my family enslaved were consistent with the expectations of resistance accommodation.The Euroamerican settlers of the Upper South were largely small-scale yeoman farmers with smaller acreages and few or no slaves, interspersed physically with a smaller number of large-scale planters with large acreages and many slaves. Conditions and opportunities for the enslaved differed between small-scale and large-scale operations in terms of labor management, housing, and degree of surveillance. To understand the opportunities available to the people my family enslaved, it was important to determine the scale of their farming and slaveholding operation, and the nature of the surrounding landscape, for which I used both archaeological and historical methods.The archaeological investigations included remote sensing and exploratory excavation at the site family oral history indicated was the location of the first house, followed by artifact analysis. The results suggest that a two-room hewn log house on a limestone foundation, typical of the antebellum period, existed on the site. The artifacts support an antebellum origin for the house, and the presence of male and female occupants, but provide no unique markers of African American occupancy. A comparison of the type, number, and quality of artifacts with those from a well-documented large-scale slaveholding operation suggest that the Elliott family had a small-scale operation.Historical records confirmed that James Elliott was a small-scale farmer and slaveholder who raised a typical suite of crops and livestock that was sufficient to support his family and labor force while providing surplus production for the commercial market. Culturally, James and his family and slaves lived in an agrarian society. Only about 29 percent of Hardin Township’s heads of household were slaveholders, but the society was highly stratified based on land and slave ownership, with greater wealth accruing to six large-scale slaveholders.  In a small-scale farming operation, the Elliotts’ enslaved (and those of other small-scale holders) could expect reduced surveillance while working, running approved errands, and attending church. These moments likely afforded the enslaved some time to further their own interests and socialize with their peers. The housing practices of small-scale holders were variable; James was among the 41 percent of them who did not provide separate slave quarters, making unauthorized nighttime excursions more difficult. I used a viewshed analysis to examine the characteristics of physical landscape; this analysis revealed that extensive areas around the Elliott farm were out of sight of the Elliott log house and the houses of neighboring slaveholders, and that the riparian corridors of small creeks connected these areas in ways that would allow slaves to gather clandestinely while avoiding detection. There is, therefore, compelling circumstantial evidence that opportunities were available to the enslaved to reduce or avoid surveillance. In addition, a report by the Hardin Township Slave Patrol from December 1859 shows that African Americans were in fact availing themselves of these opportunities, meeting in groups of two to six without authorization. These group actions show that a community of resistance existed among the township’s enslaved, a community built upon individual acts of resistance. It is likely that similar conditions prevailed throughout the Upper South.

TI  - Systematics and evolution of the Ronnbergia alliance (Bromeliaceae): History of disjunct diversification in three biodiversity hotspots of the neotropics
AU  - Aguirre Santoro, Julian Andres
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The systematics, biogeography and evolution of the “ Ronnbergia Alliance,” a nested lineage within the Core Bromelioideae, were investigated. In the first chapter, the phylogenetic relationships of the Ronnbergia Alliance were reconstructed using three chloroplast and three nuclear DNA sequence markers in combination with a wide species sampling across the Core Bromelioideae and a nearly complete species-level sampling of the five species complexes that likely comprise the Ronnbergia  Alliance. The analysis indicates that the Ronnbergia Alliance is a robust monophyletic group sister to the remaining Core Bromelioideae, and it is composed by species of the polyphyletic genera Aechmea,  Hohenbergia and Ronnbergia. The first of main lineage within the Ronnbergia Alliance, here called the Pacific Clade, contains species of that occur exclusively in the forests of southern Central America to northwestern South America. The second clade, called the Atlantic Clade, contains species mostly limited to the central corridor of the Atlantic Forest and the Greater Antilles. The combination of apically spreading tubular corollas and unappendaged ovules are diagnostic for the Ronnbergia  Alliance, whereas flower size, corolla tube length, and petal pigmentation are important characters to differentiate the Pacific and Atlantic Clades. A new taxonomic reorganization and synopsis for this clade was proposed in the second chapter. Here, all the species of the Pacific Clade were placed in Ronnbergia, whereas the species of the Atlantic Clade were relocated in the resurrected genus Wittmackia. In the third chapter, a complete taxonomic revision of the Caribbean clade of  Wittmackia was conducted. In the fourth chapter, the biogeographic history and evolutionary rate dynamics of the Ronnbergia Alliance were analyzed. These analyses showed that one vicariant event that separated Ronnbergia from Wittmackia in South America, and a later long-distance dispersal event allowed the separation of Wittmackia between the Atlantic Forest and Jamaica. Although the evolutionary rate dynamics remained constant during the diversification of Ronnbergia, these rates were heterogeneous during the radiation of Wittmackia. This is the first species-level approach that combines phylogenetic, ecological, geographic and morphological information to reveal fine-scale processes that shaped the evolution of highly diverse lineages of Bromeliaceae.

TI  - Utilisation of distributed ied-s for substation automation
AU  - Watson, Ian
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - In a power system, transformer substations are electrical plans dominative by their numbers. Initially, they were designed to meet the power demands in a particular area or to a particular consumer type. Power system evolution, privatisation, deregulation, environmental issues, lack of 'green sites' to build new plants, are forcing the utilization of the existing assets to its best. Additional functionality and economically tangible benefits are demanded from the existing devices with no deterioration to the quality or the functionality of their intended use.  There is a large existing base of installed Intelligent Electronic Devices, with potential to be used to either partly or fully automate plant or its process. The present work evaluates the suitability of such devices for automation purposes and as such it aims at user's desire for improved, "quality of supply" often instigated by electricity markets regulatory institution, benefits creation of the automation induced cost savings and investment reduction or deferral through the better and more effective use of the existing assets.  For the purpose of the research, representatives lED-s were employed in an experimental method research. Practicality of the research demanded a real time physical model, modelling typical distribution transformer substation. For typical automation functions, automation algorithms were identified, appropriate software package developed and experimental measurements taken.  Automation algorithms chosen met commonly required automation functions such as, substation wide switching device interlocking, automatic load transfer, load shedding, load restoration and return to normal service.  The necessity of the deep inside knowledge of the lED-s to harmonise the use of the IED and its functionality to the extent to which the plant can be automated pertinent to the role of the plant in the power system plays the pivotal role. Event driven automation algorithm, optimised polling strategy, minimal yet sufficient number of messages exchange containing single data, maintaining communication link throughput for the useful data by message packaging and data block transfer seems to be the right combination to achieve the desired goal.  Contrary to the above, neither high transfer rate communication link in combination with an IED having an oversubscribed and overloaded Central Processing Unit (CPU) will help, nor will the fast responding IED on a slow transfer rate communication link be effective.  Beyond the substation boundaries traditional techniques to automate were based on fault detection, faulted section isolation and restoration of the supply to the consumers unaffected by a fault. Reducing the occurrences where de-energizing the power line in its full length and thus affecting the customers which do not necessarily need be affected by a fault in a specific line section, was often taken outside of the automation discipline. Similar approach was adopted towards communication technology, lED-s and their use.  As instigated by the research and contrary to the above, an integrated approach produces much favourable results. Alternative techniques may be used to automate distribution networks. By doing so, targets set out to improve the quality of supply can easily be met. Those can also be applied to reduce negative effects of the traditional Neutral Point Treatment inherited from the early days of the technology. As indicated by research, communication technology must also be taken into account in any effective solution capable of dealing with the issues specific to urban, meshed or rural distribution networks.  Research strongly suggests that the use of installed lED-s to automate plant or its process is a feasible and economically viable solution. Providing the removal of the conventional barrier between the primary and secondary equipment, schemes capable to produce benefits beyond the automation sphere become the re

AB  - Networks are a useful quantitative representation for complex systems of interacting entities arising in fields such as biological, physical and social sciences. A network representation provides a degree of simplification while capturing key connectivity patterns. This thesis focuses on two main themes: the study of community structure, an important mesoscopic feature of many networks, and its application to study spatiotemporal spread of infectious diseases. Community detection seeks to partition a network into dense sets of nodes that are connected sparsely to other dense sets. The notion of denseness is often relative to some "null model" that describes baseline connectivity that can be construed to occur randomly. In the first part of the thesis, we discuss the incorporation of spatial information into null models for community detection. We develop a spatial null model based on the radiation model of mobility. We test different spatial null models using static and temporal (multilayer) spatial benchmarks with planted partitions that represent interactions between human populations. Our results indicate that it is important to incorporate spatial information into null models for community detection, but it is best to incorporate only relevant information into null models, as extraneous information can lower performance. In the second part of the thesis, we present the results of community detection with different null models on disease-correlation networks generated form real and synthetic time series of disease occurrence. We use data sets for endemic diseases (established in a region, with occasional epidemic outbreaks) and emerging diseases (newly-discovered or introduced into a region for the first time). We study the spatial and temporal organization of partitions. Finally, we apply community detection with different null models to synthetic time series generated from an agent-based model (ABM) simulating the spread of endemic and emerging diseases between spatially-embedded cities with a planted, transport-based community structure. We compare the findings on real and synthetic data sets, and we searched for model parameter regimes in which we are able to detect planted partitions or other interesting communities. For emerging diseases, we find spatial communities that are associated with the first times the infection reached a node in both ABM and disease data. For endemic diseases, we are unable to find planted or spatial communities in the ABM data, but we detect spatial communities for two of the three disease data sets. For these diseases, we also detect temporal communities corresponding to some of the important time points in disease history. We hope that these results show that community structure of disease correlation networks appears to be more complicated than simple spatial patterns and is a fascinating topic to study.

TI  - The Clinical and Environmental Epidemiology of Penicillium Mmarneffei Infection in Vietnam
AU  - Le, Thuy
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - Infection due to Penicillium marneffei (renamed to  Talaromyces marneffei in 2011) has emerged as an important public health problem over the past two decades due to the arrival of the HIV epidemic in Asia. Since 2004, P. marneffei has become the second most common pathogen isolated from routine blood culture, after Cryptococcus neoformans, at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, the largest referral centre for HIV care in southern Vietnam. The clinical epidemiology of P. marneffei infection has not been studied in Vietnam. The fundamental epidemiological questions regarding the pathogen reservoirs and risks of acquisition remain poorly understood. The diagnosis relies on isolation of the pathogen from clinical specimens and can take up to 14 days to identify, resulting in delayed initiation of therapy which is associated with worse treatment outcomes. This thesis aims to increase knowledge and understanding of the clinical and environmental epidemiology of  P. marneffei infection and to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis of P. marneffei infection.The Précis provides a brief background and rationale for the thesis. Chapter 1 is an introductory chapter and provides an overview of the epidemiology, ecology, mycology, pathology, immunology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of P. marneffei infection. Chapter 2 summarizes the incidence and features of P. marneffei  admissions at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City over a 13 year period. During this period, 795 patients with  P. marneffei infection were identified and hospital charts were obtainable for 513 (65%) patients. The data showed clear seasonality with an increase in incidence of approximately 30% during the rainy season compared to the dry season. The clinical and microbiological features and treatment outcomes of the patients were characterised. Poor outcome, defined as death or worsening disease at hospital discharge, occurred in 28% of patients. History of injection drug use, shorter duration of illness, absence of fever or skin lesions, higher respiratory rates, and lower platelet counts independently predicted poor outcome. Chapter 3 describes an analysis of meteorological factors that determine penicilliosis incidence in Ho Chi Minh City. Humidity, rather than precipitation, was the most important factor that governs the seasonality of penicilliosis. Higher humidity was associated with increased odds of penicilliosis versus cryptococcosis admissions. The infection incubation period was estimated to be between one and three weeks. Chapter 4 describes an analysis of exposure and behavioural risk factors for penicilliosis based on a matched case control study of 205 culture-confirmed HIV-infected penicilliosis cases and 405 HIV-infected controls recruited from two major HIV referral centres in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Penicilliosis was independently associated with proximity or exposure to tropical plants and exposure to farmed animals. The geographical analysis showed that patients living in or traveling to the highland regions were at increased risk for penicilliosis in southern Vietnam. Chapter 5 describes the development of a Taqman real-time PCR assay based on a novel Mp1 gene target unique to P. marneffei for rapid detection of P. marneffei infection in patient plasma. The assay was tested in 70 plasma samples from HIV-infected patients (50 with culture-confirmed penicilliosis, 20 with other opportunistic infections) and showed a clinical specificity of 100% (20/20) and sensitivity of 70.4% (19/27) and 52.2% (12/23) prior to and within 24-48 hours of antifungal therapy administration, respectively. Chapter 6 is an overview discussion interpreting the implications of the major findings and the future direction of P. marneffei research. The work of this thesis increases knowledge of the clinical epidemiology of P. marneffei infection in Vietnam, providing essential data for the design of prospective studies to improve the diagnosis and treatment of P. marneffei infection in Asia. The data suggest that multiple environmental factors including humidity, tropical plants, farmed animals, and highland location, are important drivers of P. marneffei  infection in southern Vietnam. The real-time PCR assay showed potential as a rapid 'rule-in' test for P. marneffei in this pilot study and should be prospectively evaluated in a large cohort to determine if it can improve diagnostic speed and crucially, impact patient outcomes. Prevention, diagnosis and elimination all require further research to reduce the high mortality following clinical disease caused by P. marneffei in Asia.

TI  - Behavior, ecology, and conservation of Scaphirhynchus  sturgeon
AU  - Hintz, William Dean
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Large rivers are perhaps the most modified ecosystems worldwide.  Natural flow regimes, ecosystem connectivity, and habitat have been modified for human interests, and poor water quality has resulted from urban settlement and agricultural practices.  Subsequently, such changes have had deleterious effects on riverine biota and many endemic species are of critical conservation concern.  Due to the inter-jurisdictional nature and economic importance of large rivers, conservation efforts must be realistic and recognize human interests.  To reach that point, however, we must understand behavioral and ecological patterns and processes at multiple scales, to ensure conservation strategies are successful.    Fishes have been particularly affected by modifications to large rivers.  Further, freshwater roe fisheries around the world have overfished several species to the brink of extinction; among the most notable are sturgeon populations.  Pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) and shovelnose sturgeon (S. platorynchus) are two species that occur in large rivers of the central United States.  Pallid sturgeon are primarily limited to the riverscapes of the Missouri and lower Mississippi Rivers, whereas shovelnose sturgeon are more widely distributed.  Pallid sturgeon are a federally endangered species in the United States and shovelnose sturgeon are federally threatened where they overlap in range with pallid sturgeon. Like other sturgeon species around the world, Scaphirhynchus sturgeon habitat has been modified and degraded by dams, extensive levee systems, and pollution.  To date, our understanding of habitat needs for Scaphirhynchus sturgeon—at multiple spatial scales—remains unknown.  Furthermore, basic behaviors, e.g. anti-predatory behavior or foraging behavior, have yet to be identified.    The goal of my dissertation was to fill knowledge gaps in Scaphirhynchus  sturgeon behavior, ecology, and conservation.  First, I identified a species-loss domino-effect, which may manifest from use of Similarity of Appearance Provisions in the U.S. Endangered Species Act.  The aim of the legislative action was to protect pallid sturgeon by closing the shovelnose sturgeon roe fishery where shovelnose overlap in range with pallid sturgeon (Chapter 1).  It was assumed that closing the shovelnose sturgeon roe fishery to prevent bycatch of pallid sturgeon would increase the number of reproductively viable females in the wild, thereby facilitating pallid sturgeon recovery.  However, I show that this response may have unintended consequences by diverting fishing effort to other economically viable species (e.g. paddlefish  Polyodon spathula) and increase poaching.  Further, I suggest that protecting the shovelnose sturgeon may increase the rate of hybridization and competitive interactions between pallid and shovelnose sturgeon.  I recommend such legislative action be followed by contingency plans for any unintended consequences and protections be ready for species which may experience diverted fishing effort.   Regarding sturgeon behavior, I used shovelnose sturgeon as a model species to test whether sturgeon exhibit predator avoidance behavior (Chapter 2), as predators, or interactions with predators, have strong regulatory effects on populations.  My experiment showed that shovelnose sturgeon do exhibit predator avoidance behavior when they encounter a catfish predator ( Ictalurus punctatus).  This was the first experiment to document such behavior in any sturgeon species and suggested that it was a learned, rather than an innate behavior.   The remaining chapters of my dissertation focus on the goals of elucidating the current status of Scaphirhynchus sturgeon and habitat selection at multiple spatial scales.  In Chapter 3, I estimated the population size of adult pallid sturgeon (N = 1,516) and shovelnose sturgeon (N = 82,336) in the free-flowing middle Mississippi River.  My estimates highlight the critical status of pallid sturgeon, and show that shovelnose sturgeon are faring comparatively well.  In the same study, I found both sturgeon species were most abundant at the downstream ends of alluvial islands.  I suggest restoration of alluvial islands, which were historically present in the Mississippi River, is a realistic goal to facilitate recovery of Scaphirhynchus  sturgeon.  Given pallid and shovelnose sturgeon were found in highest abundance around alluvial islands (Chapter 3), I wanted to understand the uniqueness of habitat surrounding alluvial islands (Chapter 4).  Hydroacoustic techniques were used to quantify the abiotic attributes, and variability in those attributes, around two alluvial island complexes.  At the same time, age-0 Scaphirhynchus  sturgeon were sampled to examine whether they used similar habitats as adults.  All sturgeon sampled were shovelnose sturgeon, but similar to Chapter 3, I found that the greatest abundance of age-0 sturgeon occurred at the downstream ends of the alluvial islands, particularly on the main channel side.  This area had intermediate variability in depth and velocity, and contained sand dunes.  I also found that vegetation was an important attribute of the islands, mostly when inundated by high spring flows.  I suggest that if island restoration is pursued, as in Chapter 3, abiotic attributes identified in Chapter 4 should be replicated.   Alluvial islands represent a coarse, albeit important, scale at which habitat is relevant to Scaphirhynchus sturgeon.  However, for several abiotic attributes and mesohabitats that affect habitat selection by sturgeon, it is difficult to elucidate their relevance at the individual scale due to high flows, turbidity, and depth of large riverscapes like those of the Mississippi River.  Therefore, carefully designed laboratory experiments are an alternative means of identifying pattern and process relevant to individuals.    Velocity is an important abiotic attribute that influences the distribution of individuals in lotic ecosystems (e.g., Chapter 4).  The goal of Chapter 5 was to evaluate how swimming behavior of Scaphirhynchus sturgeon was affected by velocity.  I designed an experiment to specifically test whether sturgeon swimming behavior evolved in a way that reduced the energetic cost of occupying river energy landscapes.  Further, a dynamic state variable model was developed to assess the optimal behavioral decision based on the expectation of food and energetic costs.  Both pallid and shovelnose sturgeon showed a tendency to occupy faster velocity, but their swimming behavior from the experiment was consistent with cost minimization.  The dynamic program revealed that the expectation of food and costs associated with the experimental energy landscape influenced the probability of a sturgeon moving upstream, downstream, or station holding.  It appears the suite of swimming behaviors exhibited by fluvial specialists like pallid and shovelnose sturgeon may have evolved to maximize net energy gain.  Lastly, I examined mesohabitat selection by age-0 Scaphirhynchus  sturgeon (Chapter 6).  Like velocity, substrates and other benthic structures can influence the distribution of individuals.  I tested selection of four common mesohabitat types nested within alluvial island complexes: 1) sand only substratum with no structure, 2) sand substratum with sand dune structure, 3) sand substratum with simulated vegetation, and 4) a gravel only substratum.  Sturgeon almost completely avoided gravel substrate and selected for the sand substratum, structure-less mesohabitat, followed by the mesohabitat with a sand dune.  Vegetated habitat retained less sturgeon than these two habitats but more than the gravel mesohabitat.  Scaled to the population level, the patterns revealed in Chapter 6 could have implications for the macro-distribution of both species.   In summary, I hope that the illustration of a species-loss domino-effect will be considered in the conservation of threatened and endangered species.  The issue of diverted effort, in particular, must be recognized when species are protected in a limited fashion to prevent or anticipate harvest cascading to other valuable and/or vulnerable species.  We must also consider acquiring basic knowledge of sturgeon behavior if we are to understand how best to conserve them.  Herein, the identification of predator avoidance behavior in shovelnose sturgeon suggests that predators in the wild may have regulatory effects on the distribution of young sturgeon.  I also identified how  Scaphirhynchus sturgeon—behaviorally—navigate large river velocity landscapes.  Such contributions regarding sturgeon behavior have largely gone undescribed—I hope the present work will provide a framework for future ethological study.  Lastly, my work has implications for the rehabilitation of large, sand-dominated rivers.  Specifically, my research suggests the restoration of alluvial islands in the free-flowing Mississippi River will contribute to the recovery of Scaphirhynchus sturgeon.  Restoration efforts should be mindful, though, of 1) the attributes that retain sturgeon, 2) habitat selection at multiple scales, and 3) selection differences among species at various scales.  These considerations will assist in facilitating the success of large-river conservation programs.

TI  - The occurrence and removal of salmonellas during waste water treatment
AU  - Yaziz, Mohammad Ismail
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - The numbers of salmonellas in raw sewage entering a treatment plant varied hourly and diurnally; their peak concentration preceded the peak influent waste water flow into the plant by about 2 hours. Salmonellas were detected in all raw influent samples collected from 2 sewage works and the mean population level at the daily peak period was about 3000 organisms/l. On average, 70-80% of the salmonellas were removed in 6-7h during primary sedimentation when upwards of 76-82% of solids were removed, Biological treatment and secondary sedimentation removed a further 70-100% of the pathogen. Compared with the activated sludge process, the trickling filters were less efficient in removing salmonellas and they were adversely affected by increased loading following rainfall. The number of salmonellas in the final effluents varied from 0-50/1 in the activated sludge plant (overall salmonella removal efficiency = 99.83%) and 1-2500 /1 in the trickling filter plant (overall salmonella removal efficiency = 98.70%); these results suggest that greater emphasis should be placed on the actual quality of the effluent rather than on percentage removal efficiencies. The performance of both processes were discussed in relation to the current E.E.C. guidelines concerning the level of salmonellas in surface waters intended for both drinking and swimming. A total of 43 different serotypes were isolated, and of these, only 21 were common to both towns. The common serotypes included, in order of decreasing frequency, S. typhimurium, S. bredeney, S. virchow, S. reading, S. st. paul and S. agona. The isolation of several species from the sewage coincided with the occurrence of clinical cases of salmonellas infection in the human population in the town concerned. Removal of salmonellas from waste water was studied in a laboratory model of the activated sludge process. It appeared to occur in two phases. During the first phase, the salmonellas were rapidly adsorbed to the activated sludge floes and was completely removed from the liquid in under 15 hours. There-after, a slower elimination was observed which was due to predation by ciliate protozoa. This was confirmed by inhibition of predation in the presence of manoxol which inactivated the ciliate protozoan populations. The rate of salmonellas destruction increased with increasing temperature up to 25°C. At 30°C, the ciliate protozoa were destroyed by heat and the salmonella removal rate fell dramatically, A batch anaerobic digestion process was efficient at eliminating salmonellas in raw sludge. A 7-log10 reduction was achieved in under 9 days but the pathogens survived for considerably longer periods when the proportion of raw sludge in the digester was reduced. The bactericidal agent was most effective at low pH (< 5.0) and appeared to comprise the volatile fatty acids. Simple storage of raw sludge in open vessels also led to reductions in their salmonella content but was markedly less efficient compared to the anaerobic digestion process. The reasons why intermittently fed anaerobic digesters do not attain maximum pathogen kills were discussed in the light of the experimental results obtained, and proposals were made to modify the mode of operation of digesters to improve the efficiency of the process with regard to the elimination of the salmonella group and other microbial pathogens.

TI  - Cotton Agriculture and the Function of Gravel Mulch in the Northern Rio Grande
AU  - Kessler, Nicholas V.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The site of Poshu’Owingeh was one of several ancestral Tewa villages to experience rapid growth in the 14th and 15th centuries A.D. in northern New Mexico. Recent research has proposed that this growth was one aspect of a trend characterized by nonlinear socioeconomic change produced by increasing population size and connectivity. Agriculture, commodity production, and exchange are fundamental to this model, but direct evidence for intensification is limited and no empirical data exists for the function and mechanics of the technologies which are supposed to have supported surplus production. This research addresses the problem by examining paleobotanical and soil evidence for the function of gravel mulch, a unique agricultural technology hypothesized to have supported cotton agriculture in portions of the Northern Rio Grande.Physical soil properties and base cation ratios are used to reconstruct the irrigation effect of gravel mulch, and soil nutrient levels are measured to assess change in soil quality associated with cultivation. Fossil pollen assemblages recovered from agricultural soil layers are used to determine the mix of crops grown in gravel mulch fields. A spatial database of archaeological sites is used to reconstruct Puebloan population dynamics in the Tewa Basin. This is compared to published estimates of population growth, the timing of socioeconomic developments in the region, and climate reconstructions.Fossil pollen concentrations indicate that cotton was the main crop grown at Poshu’Owingeh. The substantial increase in the ratio of cotton to maize and a decrease in the diversity of economic wild plant taxa at Poshu’Owingeh suggest cotton cultivation was more intensive here than other documented sites in the region. Soil analysis revealed no evidence for degradation associated with gravel mulch. Cation ratios and particle size distribution in the A horizon suggest that gravel mulch continues to enhance subsurface water flux. I estimate that the runoff required to produce the sodium leaching observed in mulched profiles is generated by relatively intense precipitation generated by monsoon storms. Peak rates for the spatial expansion of farming populations responsible for the construction of the gravel mulch-cotton fields follows rapid population growth in the great Tewa Basin, is coincident with the intensification of regional exchange networks, and strengthening of the North American Monsoon. Given the mechanics of agricultural technology documented in this study, and hypotheses for the importance of cotton in the regional economy; it is concluded that population dynamics, climate change, and human niche construction interacted played a significant role in social change and economic expansion in the late precontact Northern Rio Grande.

AB  - Landscape ecological research in the Netherlands has been fruitful because of the mutual exchange of ideas and results of fundamental and applied research. This research project has been focused on methodologies for application of fundamental landscape ecological research in planning for land use and water use with emphasis on nature conservation aspects. The object of research has been the river system, because the river system is both a fundamental landscape ecological unit and an administration unit. The theoretical concept of planning is based on the model of spatial organisation; this model has been worked out by differentiating the rather simple physical aspects into a 'spatial ecological structure'.This model is based on the idea that all species have an ecological web and that these webs together make the - natural - landscape. The main patterns and processes in the spatial ecological structure of river systems are climate and water discharge. Within this context organisms create their ecological webs and these webs together constitute the spatial ecological structure. This spatial ecological structure can be modified by man. Man-through his social organization has an important impact by ecological changes that modify the spatial ecological structure into a manmade physical organisation. It is a model of the interference between sustainability and dynamics. The spatial ecological structure has been used as the guiding principle for the landscape ecological analysis and the interference of landscape ecological processes with changes in society. Within this context the research questions have been formulated as:* the definition of the main processes in river systems that determine ecological development in time and space and its translation into guiding principles and constraints for nature conservation;* evaluation of planning and management of rivers and its related nature in the context of its objectives.To answer these questions several research projects have been carried out, that have all been published in the period 1990-1992. They concerned both questions and emphasised different aspects of the spatial ecological structure. The research projects are: Ecological classification of the climate of the Rhine catchment ( Int. J Biometeorology 1990, 34:194-203 ).In this research an ordination and classification has been carried out on the climate of the Rhine catchment based on data from meteorological stations. The objective of the classification is to provide an ecological interpretation of climate data. The climate of northern France, Belgium, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, The Federal Republic of Germany and northern Switzerland is divided into 5 classes, of which two, the atlantic and the subcontinental are subdivided further into subclasses. The climate classes can be interpreted ecologically and are correlated with floristic and vegetation data. The Rhine valley has a distinctive and characteristic climate. Interpolation of the classification has not been carried out, because of the uneven geographical spread of the sites in the dataset. The position of the Rhine valley as a separate subclass is striking. For the use of climatic data for modelling changes in climate in relation to hydrological effects, this will have minor implications, because the valley is just a section of the total drainage basin. For ecological interpretation of the Rhine catchment however, it will be of major importance, because also climatically the Rhine valley seems to function as a major ecological stream corridor in western Europe. Land use changes or climatic changes in this corridor might improve or hamper its functioning as such. Other rivers do not seem to be characterised by climatic differences in the same way and may not function as climate related stream corridors. They possibly do not have such pronounced effect on the surrounding landscape or insufficient climatic data are lacking to conclude on this.Vegetation, river management and land use in the Dutch Rhine floodplains (Regulated Rivers 1992 7(3):279-289. In this project the relation between vegetation and historical changes in ecological processes has been investigated. The floodplains of the Lower Rhine are situated in a densely populated area of The Netherlands. Although they are intensively used, the floodplains still fulfil important ecological functions. The lower Rhine is the downstream sedimentation zone of the River Rhine and its floodplains are characterised by river transported vascular flora originating from southern and eastern Europe. Using multivariate methods data from literature and field data on grasslands and former river beds have been analyzed to find trends in ecological changes. The consequence of continued sedimentation and diminished erosion is an increased drying out of the floodplains. Excavation and recultivation of former excavated land does not reverse the losses in flora and vegetation. Statistically there is a negative relationship between the characteristic dry fluvial flora and recultivated land. Also the natural transversal river gradient disappears together with its characteristic ecological diversity. Aquatic environments in the floodplains have been changed completely since the regulation works started in the 19th century. Most former river beds have disappeared by silting up. Data on short term vegetation succession confirm the long term analysis of map data.Dutch floodplain policy, regulation of landscape ecological processes ( Landschap 1992 9(l):17-29 ). In this project the relation between floodplain vegetation and the management of ecological processes has been investigated. Rivers are landscape ecological systems, characterised by dynamic processes. Floodplains are very important in the ecological functioning of the river system. The Rhine is a regulated river situated in a densely populated area. The Dutch Lower Rhine is the downstream sedimentation area of the river. Here the floodplains are strongly influenced by man during the last decades. In general there is a process of drying out going on in both the Upper Rhine and the Lower Rhine. River dynamics in the floodplains can be analyzed on basic processes as period and time of discharge, stream velocity, relative altitude and morphology. The importance of the floodplains has been recognised by all administrative levels and nature conservation and nature development has become a policy objective. To develop and execute a river floodplain policy translation of river dynamics into practical planning and management is needed. Little experience is available on the effectiveness of the means for policy execution. The available knowledge shows, that at this moment neither physical planning nor water management but only protection by Nature Conservation Law can be used to handle extreme cases.Conservation of brooks in small watersheds: a case for planning (Landscape and Urban Planning 1990 19:55-68). In this research project a simple regional water balance model has been made of the two regions in the Veluwe in order to qualify the consequences of adjacent land use and urban activities for the objectives of the National Park. Nature conservation is under stress in The Netherlands because of intensive land use and related water use. One of the main problems for the brook systems is planning of water use in order to maintain a locally high water-table. From a study of the water balance it is shown, that extraction in some parts of the research area causes water shortage for brook discharge. Water extraction is inevitable because of the dense population in the fringes of the national park. This leads to the conclusion that integration of research and co-ordination of physical planning and water use planning is needed to realise a sound nature conservation policy for this area.Landscape ecological and spatial impacts of climate change in two areas in the Netherlands (Earth surface processes and Landforms 1991 16:639-652). Possible impact of climatic change on the water balance has been analyzed for the river Dommel and the Veluwe, an area drained by many very small brooks. The water balance has been calculated for the winter and the summer period. With help of four scenarios, based on GCM's, climate data from the dry year 1976 and land use scenarios the impact of climatic change and a possible superposed effect of acid precipitation is analyzed. The results show that although the yearly changes in the water balance are small in some cases, in all cases the fluctuations in the water balance between winter and summer period increase. Changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration are multiplied in water storage and runoff. This will have an important impact on water use planning and management.River systems: a leading part in a changing climate (Milieu 1992 7(3):68-75). A review has been made of research carried out on the impact of climate change in rivers. Climate change will influence the environment in Europe not only by changes in CO 2 -content and temperature, but also by changes in hydrology. Rivers might appear to be very sensitive to climatic variability and climate change. Most important impact is expected to be a change in mean discharge, extreme events and seasonality of runoff, which can cause important changes in erosion and sedimentation in various parts of Europe, quality of both groundwater and surface water, functioning of the aquatic and semi-terrestrial ecosystems and the availability of water resources.Consequences of climate change combined with potential synergistic effects of acidification will be dealt with sooner or later through the water system in many parts of Europe. Wise use of water, based on thorough analysis of the hydrological system and international co-operation at the level of river catchments are of utmost importance for anticipation on possible changes. From this research it can be concluded, that the natural basis for planning can be considered as a spatial ecological structure made by natural ecological processes and related patterns. Such a framework can be used as a guiding principle for landscape ecological modelling and the analysis of the impact of land use changes.The concept of Ecological Main Structure as developed in The Netherlands is a policy concept. Its scientific basis can be found in the spatial ecological structure of catchments. However, for the pleistocene pail of the Netherlands it can be concluded from the analysis that the objectives of the Dutch Ecological Main Structure can only partly be reached. Natural development can best be achieved for whole catchments because of the strong interaction between all land use. A complicating factor is that all large Dutch rivers and many lowland streams originate from headwaters in other countries. This makes international co-ordination necessary. Dry grasslands in the floodplains of the major dutch rivers are significantly related with sites flooded less than two days a year and significantly not related with excavated and recultivated soils. They are severely under threat of extinction. Former river beds tend to silt up and especially the open oxbows and the tidal oxbows have disappeared. Both tendencies have important consequences for nature conservation strategy in the river area and especially for nature redevelopment projects.The use of physical planning regulations to maintain aquatic nature and wetlands has not yet been very successful, nor in planning nor in implementation and management. Intensive co-operation between the water boards and the municipalities is needed both in planning and in management of waters.The climate of the Rhine catchment can be differentiated into several types among which that of the Rhine valley. This can be of importance for research on the impact of climate change. However, it is not yet clear if other rivers have a comparable corridor.Consequences of climate change combined with potential synergistic effects of acidification will be dealt with sooner or later through the water system in many parts of Europe. Wise use of water, based on thorough analysis of the hydrological system and international co-operation at the level of river catchments are of utmost importance for anticipation on possible changes.

TI  - Neuroplasticity of the Corticospinal System: Applications of Neuromodulation-based Therapies
AU  - Amer, Alzahraa
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The motor cortex and corticospinal tract are necessary for producing skilled movements. I use intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), a high-frequency stimulation protocol known to promote neural plasticity, as a tool to characterize short- and long-term plasticity of the CS system.Although it is well known that activity-dependent motor cortex (MCX) plasticity produces long-term potentiation (LTP) of local cortical circuits, leading to enhanced motor evoked potentials (MEPs), the effects produced by the corticospinal (CS) projection on spinal cord neurons have not yet been thoroughly studied. In Chapter 2, I determined if the CS tract (CST) is capable of producing LTP in the spinal cord. I used multichannel recording of motor-evoked intraspinal excitatory local field potentials (LFPs) in adult rats after iTBS. I stimulated the wrist area of MCX and recorded at the 6th cervical spinal cord segment. A single 3-minute block of MCX iTBS potentiated the monosynaptic excitatory LFP recorded within the CST termination field in the dorsal horn and intermediate zone, for at least 15 minutes after stimulation. Ventrolaterally in the spinal cord gray matter, iTBS potentiated a late negative LFP that was localized to the wrist muscle motor pool. Response enhancement after a single block of iTBS in MCX thus produces LTP of the evoked monosynaptic and oligosynaptic CST responses. The time course of this LTP has the properties of early-LTP, the first phase of LTP which enables an increase in synaptic strength and is known to play an important role in memory function in the hippocampus, amygdala and other cortical brain structures in mammals. Pharmacological blockade of iTBS-induced LTP in MCX using MK801, an NMDA receptor antagonist, failed to prevent spinal LFP potentiation, showing that spinal plasticity can be induced in an activity-dependent manner without MCX LTP. Pyramidal tract iTBS, which preferentially activates the CST, also produced significant spinal LTP, indicating the capacity for plasticity at the CST-spinal neuron synapse. My findings show CST monosynaptic response plasticity in spinal interneurons and demonstrate that spinal premotor circuits are capable of modifying the way descending MCX signals are processed in an activity-dependent manner. These findings are important for understanding the key structures for motor learning and motor recovery after injury and suggest that spinal circuits, as the implementer of supraspinal muscle control signals, are capable of further modifying the actions of the MCX in an activity-dependent manner.I next determined if early-LTP can be converted, with repeated and chronic iTBS into the late phase of long-term potentiation (Late- or L-LTP), which allows enduring modification of the structure and function of neuronal connectivity (Chapter 3). I determined if there is day-to-day carryover of MEP augmentation produced by iTBS and elucidated the anatomical and molecular underpinnings of this robust corticospinal system plasticity.For these experiments, I recorded chronically from the extensor carpi radialis muscle in naïve rats and examined MCX-evoked motor responses (MEPs) as a measure of CS system plasticity. I promoted MEP plasticity by MCX iTBS for varying times daily and for one or more days. I found that one block (3 mins) of iTBS produced strong EMG potentiation lasting for up to 35 min; consistent with early-LTP which is independent of protein synthesis. Five contiguous blocks of iTBS during a single session (27 mins), prolonged EMG potentiation for 24-48 hours and resulted in upregulation of signaling of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulator of neuronal translational capacity. These changes are a signature of a stable and long-lasting LTP (late-LTP). In addition, iTBS-induced L-LTP was enhanced or blocked bidirectionally by modulating cortical activity chemogenetically using engineered G-protein coupled excitatory and inhibitory receptors (GPCR); Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), respectively. We next assayed CST structural changes that could support the enhanced motor responses. Chronic stimulation promotes a significant increase in CST axon length in the contralateral spinal cord intermediate zone. 3D reconstruction of CST synapses, defined by the co-expression of the pre- and post-synaptic markers VGlut1 and PSD-95 in labeled CST axons, revealed a significant increase in the total number and volume of PSD-95 clusters. Intrinsic presynaptic bouton characteristics did not change; however, the number of presynaptic sites increased in proportion to the increase in CST axon length.Taken together, my findings show early-LTP of the CST EPSP in the dorsal horn and intermediate zone of the spinal cord that leads to early-LTP of the CST oligosynaptic response in the motor pools and wrist muscle. A prolonged potentiation of MEP, or late-LTP, occurs after repeated blocks of iTBS. The transition from early- to late-LTP is accompanied by upregulation of known L-LTP cortical plasticity markers. Remarkably, delivery of iTBS daily for 10 days leads to the emergence of persistent MEP augmentation. We show that iTBS can be used both to lay the groundwork for a brief to an enduring form of MEP enhancement and CST structural changes underlying the stronger and more effective of synaptic transmission of the CST.  The maintained increase in MEP magnitude we observe with L-LTP and CST synaptic structural changes may be viewed as the neurophysiological surrogate for LTP-dependent processes more generally, such as motor learning within the CS motor systems.

TI  - Phylogeography of Southeast Asian flying foxes (Chiroptera: Pteropodidae: Pteropus)
AU  - Tsang, Susan M.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Flying foxes (Pteropus) are a genus of Old World fruit bats that are important seed dispersers and pollinators for plants native to the 200,000+ islands in Southeast Asia, yet they are some of the most poorly known bats in the world. They comprise some of the largest known bat species, and are morphologically relatively conserved on the genus level.  Pteropus is the most species-rich genus within Pteropodidae, though the origin for this diversity remains incompletely understood. In Chapter 1, I discuss the importance of Pteropus to the ecosystem and as reservoir hosts. In Chapter 2, a molecular phylogeny is presented with  Pteropus species organized into fewer species groups than recognized from previous research that better reflected the comprehensive dataset. An increase in relative divergence rate was detected within Pteropus  during the Pliocene that led to rapid radiations in three species groups. Additionally, discordant signals from nuclear and mitochondrial genes suggested incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization were present, likely as a result of the young clade age, low genetic variability, and rapid diversification of the genus. In Chapter 3, using the species tree generated in Chapter 2, I tested biogeographic mechanisms and scenarios that resulted in current distributions of Pteropus species using several ancestral area reconstruction methods. Dispersal and founder-event speciation were both important mechanisms through which species expanded into new areas. Wallacea was an integral part of the evolutionary history of Pteropus, and likely the region of origin, a new result uncovered largely a product of the increased taxonomic and geographic sampling. I then used a combination of phylogenetics and population genetics to determine the population connectivity of two commonly studied  Pteropus hosts that are of interest to the disease ecology community,  P. vampyrus (Chapter 4) and P. alecto (Chapter 5). Host metapopulation dynamics are important for predictions of pathogen diversity, aggressiveness, and transmission. Pteropus vampyrus and  P. alecto highlight differences in management strategies needed and pathogen model predictions. Chapter 6 presents a general discussion regarding these findings and future directions for research.

TI  - Determination of Sustainability of Aloe Harvesting Empowerment Project in the Emnambithi (Former Ladysmith) Municipality, Kwazulu Natal
AU  - Ross, Donnette
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Ladysmith is a town situated on the banks of the Klip River in the uThukela District of KwaZulu Natal, and falls into the Emnambithi-Ladysmith Local Municipality. The labour force of the Emnambithi-Ladysmith Local Municipality makes up 32.48 % of the population within the municipality, of which 16.49 % are employed, and 15.99 % are unemployed. A further 22.21 % of the total population in the municipality are not economically active, i.e. are students, homemakers, disabled, too ill to work, or are not seeking work.In an effort to address the poverty within KwaZulu Natal, the Department of Economic Development initiated a process which identified potential poverty-relieving initiatives and proposed to further investigate these development projects to establish which of the identified alternatives would be most feasible and beneficial to target communities. The areas where the poor communities are situated were identified based on the potential ability of the community to be able to support the required infrastructure investment and product development, which were in turn focussed on emerging economic growth points and development corridors (DEAT, 2001). One of the communities identified which could potentially benefit from one of the proposed development projects was that of the Emnambithi-Ladysmith Municipality, in KwaZulu Natal. Emnambithi-Ladysmith Local Municipality appointed a consultant to compile a Local Economic Regeneration Study for Ladysmith and the rural communities of the locality. The Study is aimed at analysing the local economy and thereby finding economic strategies that will make optimum use of local resources to create sustainable job opportunities and means of redressing economic challenges such as retrenchment and unemployment. A significant component of the Study is the identification of projects, which promote local ownership, local jobs and local reinvestment and illustrate the potential to revitalise the local economy of Emnambithi (Urban Econ, 2005). One of the alternative potentially sustainable poverty relief proposals put forward by the consultants, and other relevant parties, was that of harvesting the plant parts of the Aloes which appeared to be abundant within the Emnambithi-Ladysmith Municipality area. It was proposed that an Aloe pre-processing factory be established in a suitable location, which would provide employment opportunities for the local poor communities, who would either be directly employed by the pre-processing factory, or would be appropriately trained to harvest the required raw material from the natural Aloe populations. Similar operations have been initiatedin the Southern and Eastern Cape by formal sector businesses, which produce products made from Aloe ferox, which are then either sold locally or exported. The sustainability of the harvesting of these plants was determined based on the number of leaves which can be harvested per day by a tapper. It was possible to determine that the Aloe marlothii populations within the study area will not be able to support the harvesting of leaves, and as such, the harvesting thereof will not be sustainable.Several recommendations have been made which will further refine the results of this project. The main shortfall of this study was the limitation of the study area by political boundaries.

TI  - Evaluation of rural land-use plans in protected area bio-networks in northeastern tanzania
AU  - Kaswamila, Abiud Lucas
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - The application of rural land-use planning is seen by many in developing countries as a panacea for minimising land-use conflicts and for increasing the productivity of natural resources in African rangelands. However, this assumption has not been thoroughly tested in the context of wildlife corridors in African rangelands. The focus of the research work for this thesis was to evaluate both "conventional" and "participatory" approaches to land-use planning in an African rangeland setting, and to assess the impact of these land-use plans in mitigating conflict and enhancing conservation of important wildlife migratory routes. Nine villages were selected for study in Northeastern Tanzanian rangelands, within the Tarangire-Manyara, Greater Serengeti and MkomaziTsavo ecosystems. Several methods were used to provide an indication of the performance of the plans, against their stated objectives of minimising land-use conflict and conserving wildlife migratory routes. Eight hundred and fifty two households, 13 "expert witnesses" and 4 representatives of planning agencies were interviewed. Several field assessment visits and focus group discussions were also carried out. Review and analysis was conducted on archive data, land-use plans technical reports and general management plans for neighbouring Parks. The results of the research presented in this thesis revealed five major findings: (1) involvement of land-use stakeholders in land use preparation was low; (2) different types of conflicts and encroachments increased after the plans were implemented; (3) Park management failed to involve adjacent villages in the preparation and implementation of Park GMPs; (4) the amount of conflict around villages where plans were in place was comparable to that around villages with no plans, suggesting that the plans made no difference to conflict; (5) overall, both participatory and conventional plans failed to achieve their objectives of mitigating conflicts and enhancing conservation of wildlife corridors and dispersal areas. The major causes of weakness and failure of the plans to achieve their desired objectives were: (l) insufficient participation oflocal communities in the planning process; (2) lack of robust of robust, transparent and accountable implementation strategies for the plans; (3) inadequately qualified rural planners; (4) lack of a comprehensive vision - "holistic approach" - to the planning process. Taking these findings into account, the author has made recommendations for an improved Buffer Zone Land-use Planning framework (BUZLUP) that could contribute to progress in mitigating conflicts and enhancing both conservation and development in Northeastern Tanzania. It is concluded, however, that high quality plans in themselves cannot ensure the successful establishment and maintenance of effective wildlife corridors. In addition to improved planning strategies such as the proposed BUZLUP framework, other broader socio-economic issues need to be addressed, including strengthened conservation education, better protection for rural people's natural resources and support for their livelihoods, equitable benefit sharing from conservation and tourism activities, and more devolution of decision-making powers to the grass-roots level in communities neighbouring conservation areas.

TI  - Free Fatty Acids as a Major Component of the Chlorosulfolipid Membrane of Ochromonas Danica
AU  - Winicov, Irene
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The flagellar membrane of the phytoflagellate, Ochromonas danica (primarily dark-grown) had earlier been characterized by lack of phospholipids. The main polar lipids were chloro-substituted alkyl disulfates; the other principle components being free fatty acids (FFAs) and sterols. FFAs are not usually natural membrane components; they are known to uncouple proton gradients. Cell damage or solvent extraction can cause their artifactual production from esterified precursors. This work is an attempt to determine whether or not the free fatty acids are indeed components of the natural membrane of O. danica.If the FFAs were artifacts, they would most likely have been produced during solvent extraction (solvent-activation of lipolysis is known to occur in plant systems) or during the procedure for flagellar detachment (mechanical wounding can also be associated with lipolysis). Attempts to denature putative solvent-activated lipase(s) through exposure to boiling isopropanol or by crosslinking the flagella with glutaraldehyde prior to extraction failed to eliminate the free fatty acid fraction, nor to significantly alter its composition. Exposure of flagella to albumin resulted in the net transfer of FFAs to the supernatant phase, showing their presence is not caused by solvent activated lipolysis. Finally, levels of labelled free fatty acids failed to rise as a function of time after deflagellation in cells grown in the presence of  10-('14)C -oleic acid. Acid hydrolysis of the total labelled lipid at elevated temperature increased the percentage of counts occurring as unesterified fatty acids (from 2.6% to 64.8%). This, taken together with a corresponding loss of the more polar labelled material (66.8% to 8.2%) indicates that some esterified lipids were present, but probably not broken down during the isolation procedure.Free fatty acids have also been reported in O. danica's extracellular vesicles. Indeed, liposomes can be formed using sulfolipid, sterol and free fatty acids as membrane components. The surface charge density of the flagellar membrane at low and high pH is consistent with the presence of free fatty acids in an alkyl sulfate membrane. Thus, it seems that unesterified fatty acids are a component of the chlorosulfolipid membrane of Ochromonas danica.

TI  - Analysis of Poultry Trade Networks to Improve Risk-Based Surveillance: A Survey Study in Gujarat, India
AU  - Sequeira, Sara Alexandra Correia
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Poultry production and trading in India have been facing a spectacular growth as the demand for poultry products increases. Live bird shops (LBSs) and poultry trading practices are known risk factors in the spread of diseases within poultry production and distribution networks. Although such shops are ubiquitous in India, poultry trading practices and potential impact on disease risk are poorly understood. The objectives of this study were to characterise LBSs for Exotic Broiler (EB) and Desi species, based on trading practices likely to increase infectious risk, and to assess the connectivity between shops through the trade of live poultry.A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted in 86 LBSs, selected through a multi-stage sampling method. Eight cities were first purposively selected and, within each city, shops were identified using random spatial sampling. The standardised questionnaires focused on shop management characteristics, hygiene practices and details of their chicken suppliers. The suppliers were then contacted and asked about their trading practices and suppliers until catchment areas were identified. Finally, disease transmission pathways were investigated and poultry trading networks were constructed for EB chickens, to assess the connectivity between shops.Preliminary descriptive analysis suggests a high heterogeneity in the scale of operations, with daily sales ranging from 6 up to 800 and from 0 to 30 chickens, respectively for EB and Desi species. Most of the shops reported to have unsold chickens at the end of the day, with a proportion of unsold chickens reaching up to 26% and 45.2%, respectively for EB and Desi chickens. Several practices were identified as having a potential influence on disease introduction and transmission, into and within the shops. The transport of chickens from farms to shops typically involves one (85.3%) or two intermediaries (10.3%). While each city obtained chickens only from one to four districts (out of the 33 districts of Gujarat), four districts supplied more than one city.The described practices may promote pathogen amplification within Gujarat’s shops. Moreover, the network shaped by poultry movements, regarding EB chickens, connect distant poultry populations that include both tribal and non-tribal areas, increasing the risk of pathogen spread in the region. Nevertheless, most of the surveyed cities get their supplies from the closest district(s). Further investigation on risk pathways for disease transmission and identification of their geographical and socio-economic determinants are some of the next steps.

AU  - Belenguer, Ana
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - This Thesis describes three pieces of work, all of which were commissioned by the World Health Organization Special programme in Human Reproduction which are concerned with aspects of the chemistry of agents for the regulation of fertility.  The first two topics are related to agents causing infertility in the male, whilst the third is related to a method of contraceptive delivery in the female.Gossypol is a chiral natural product with phenolic and aldehyde functionality, occurring in the cotton plant.  The literature on the isolation, identification, chemistry and biological properties of gossypol is reviewed in this Thesis.  Following reports by Chinese scientists that racemic gossypol causes reversible infertility in male animals and human beings, it became clear from further studies in both China and in Western countries that toxic side effects were seen on prolonged dosing.  In an attempt to lower the toxicity of this interesting antispermatogenic agent, attention turned to studies of the individual enantiomers, which were first separated in Matlin's group by derivatisation with a chiral amine and chromatography of the resulting diastereomeric Schiff's bases on a non-chiral (normal or reverse) phase.  Following hydrolysis and fractional crystallization, 40 g of chemically and optically pure (-)-gossypol was prepared and micronized for a toxicology study.Extracts of Tripterygium wilfordii L. Hook have been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for many centuries for the treatment of inflammatory and dermatological disorders.  Recent studies in China have revealed that men undergoing prolonged treatment with tabletted extracts of T. wilfordii suffered a reversible loss of fertility and tests in male rats have shown that this is related to a dramatic reduction in sperm density and motility.  This Thesis gives a literature review of all the known constituents of T. wilfordii and the biological studies which have been reported.In the final part of the Thesis, a literature review is presented of the design, mode of action and clinical studies of vaginal rings.

TI  - The Stories and Legacies of the Black Residents of the Yorkshire Dales and Lancashire Coast in the Long Eighteenth Century
AU  - Bullock, Robert
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - The novel 'Dark Tide' forms the creative element for the thesis. It offers a fictional exploration of the origins, lives and legacies of the black residents of the Yorkshire Dales and Lancashire coast in the long eighteenth century through the character Jack Moss, former slave and machete man at the Bay View Plantation on Plantashion Island (Barbados). The narrative of 'Dark Tide' is roughly apportioned into four parts. The first examines the geographic origins of African slavery, the second, colonial exploitation and racial polarisation in pursuit of economic gain, the third, returning to England, represents the movement of social consciences and the isolation of colonial slave colonies in a world where abolition was gaining momentum. Finally, part four is intended to provide an examination of how black people could have arrived in the Yorkshire Dales and Lancashire coast in the long eighteenth century and integrated into rural working-class communities. The narrative begins on Jack's last night before trial for murder when he is visited by the unique Bajan demon, the Heartman. After brief introductions the pair travel back to the origins of slavery on the west coast of Africa where they experience the dehumanisation of sorting slaves (men, and women and children) in the 'dark room' and sail in the horrendous slave hold of the ship 'Hope' on the middle passage to the Caribbean. The racially polarised lives of those who lived on a British colonial sugar cane plantation is witnessed first-hand before Jack's owners take him with them as they sail back to England. En-route, Jack fights and kills plantation overlooker, Charles Inman, but because on board 'Hope' British laws are in force as opposed to the colonial slave code, he must stand trial at Red Rose City (Lancaster). In England, the socio economics, class and race of pre-industrial revolution Britain are examined as Jack escapes transportation to integrate via an interracial marriage into the working-class communities of the northern uplands. The unreliable narration of the Heartman and magical realism allow the narrative to explore the lives of those who were merely numbers in ships ledgers, assets on plantation records and names on moss covered tombstones in quiet corners of northern graveyards, in unique, insightful and challenging ways. The critical exegesis is an accompaniment for the fictional narrative, and it contextualises the historical research that underpins the fiction. It offers a discussion of the anticolonial counter narratives the creative element offers, examines where this narrative sits alongside other literature and suggest ways it makes a unique contribution to literature and history.

TI  - Efficient message dissemination framework for diverse wireless networks
AU  - Khalid, Osman
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Wireless networks exhibit diversity, ranging from mostly disconnected delay tolerant networks and partially connected mobile ad hoc networks, to mostly connected cellular networks. Besides having useful applications, including, vehicular communications, emergency response networks, battlefield networks, and wildlife monitoring, wireless networks face numerous challenges, such as unreliable connectivity, bandwidth restrictions, interference, frequent disruptions and delays, power outages, message loss, and malicious attacks. Moreover, when nodes are mobile, communication may be disrupted frequently for longer time periods. Designing protocols to tolerate such disruptions is challenging because of the extreme uncertainty in mobile wireless environments. Most of the existing approaches either require exact knowledge about future connectivity schedules, or perform message flooding in an attempt to improve message delivery rate. However, message flooding results in an increased overhead and loss of messages in resource constrained environments. Moreover, it is almost impossible to acquire precise future contact schedules in real-life scenarios.The goal of this dissertation is to architect robust protocols that overcome disruptions and enable applications in diverse wireless networks. We propose a suite of protocols for wireless environments where nodes transfer messages during opportunistic contacts. To conserve resources, the protocols control flooding by autonomously adapting to the changing network conditions, to find optimal temporal routes between source and destination nodes. Moreover, the dissertation presents novel approaches that utilize time-series forecasting on nodes' contact patterns. Such routing schemes learn from nodes' temporal contacts and mobility patterns, and forecasts the future contact opportunities among the nodes. By making precise predictions about future contacts, messages are forwarded to only those nodes that increase the message delivery likelihood. Simulation results proved that the proposed routing framework can be efficiently utilized in many real-life applications to disseminate delay tolerant data, such as electronic newspapers, weather forecasts, movie trailers, emergency information, and travel routes information in various parts of a city. The dissertation also proposes a novel application for mobile social networks that generates real-time recommendation of venues for a group of mobile users. The proposed framework utilizes Ant colony algorithm, social filtering, and hub and authority scores on the users' contextual information to produce optimal recommendations.

TI  - The new ruralism: A vision for exurban landscapes
AU  - Filuk, Justin L.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Residential development has become prevalent in the urban fringe of Canadian cities. This form of low-density growth impacts both the physical and cultural features that define rural landscapes. Preserving farmland, open space, wildlife habitat, natural resources and rural character have all become salient issues of regional significance. The sporadic nature of land subdivision and a ‘cookie-cutter’ approach to site design often fail to address these regional issues. The cumulative effects of these individual developments often result in a fragmented, contrasting and uninspired exurban landscape. This master's degree project recognizes the inevitable growth of exurban development and uses a design-based approach to develop a concept for a residential community. A set of key principles and design process derived from ecological design and rural design precedents provide a framework to guide design decisions within exurban settings. A project site located west of Calgary is used to illustrate the principles and demonstrate a design strategy that responds to the local conditions of the site and its regional context. Over 80% of the site is maintained as open space for agricultural uses, community uses and environmental protection. Houses are clustered to preserve wildlife habitat and movement corridors and to benefit from communal infrastructure. The concept design also establishes connections to its regional context, demonstrating its potential to serve as a building block for open space protection in the local area. The New Ruralism as a model for exurban growth represents a potential form of exurban development that is sustainable and logical in the rural landscape.

TI  - Land development in Massachusetts: Its effect on the environment within Essex and Middlesex counties from 1990 to 2007
AU  - Tardie, Peter Sean
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Since the 1970's urban centers in and surrounding Essex and Middlesex Counties in Massachusetts have expanded and proliferated into adjacent communities. This expansion has led to the conversion of land for housing, businesses, schools, recreation, and parks, placing significant strain on existing land cover, land use, and available natural resources. Mounting growth pressures and a reduction of undeveloped land have raised serious concerns as cropland and forest fragmentation, wetland destruction, protected open-space infringement, pollution, and systematic losses of rural conditions have become obvious. To monitor development, the post-classification change detection method was applied to Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite data and GIS was used to detect, quantity, and document the extent of development and its effect on the environment and to assess and quantify the demographic changes that occurred within the counties from 1990 to 2007. Classification of the 1990 image resulted in 217 clusters and 214 clusters for the 2007 image The overall accuracy achieved for the 1990 image classification was 87.3% with a KHAT value of 0.848, and the overall accuracy for the 2007 classification was 86.27% with a KHAT value of 0.840. From 1990 to 2007 land cover change occurred primarily along major transportation corridors. The post-classification change detection results indicate that Essex and Middlesex County combined gained 23,435.66 "new" acres of land development from 1990 to 2007 through a loss and change in acreage from the Bareland, Forest, Grassland, Water, and Wetland land cover class categories. Results indicate that there was an approximate 0.56% overall (net) increase of newly developed land areas within the 1990 and 2007 image classifications from 415.46 acres or 0.64 square miles. In addition, there was a substantial decrease (-40.0%) within the grassland category. Land development was responsible for a portion of the decrease of grasslands (-13.63%), which occurred mostly within Middlesex County. Results also indicate that "new" land development occurred within several Commonwealth of Massachusetts designated environmentally-sensitive areas: 722 acres in areas of critical environmental concern, 670 acres in priority habitats of rare species, 1,092 acres in living waters core habitats and critical supporting watersheds, 1,318 acres in protected and recreational open spaces, and within 0-1000 feet of 600 certified vernal pools. In addition, several rare or imperiled species inhabiting these areas may have been adversely affected by land development through habitat loss, change, or fragmentation, and/or passage corridor disruptions. A GIS comparison of the "new" land development acreages and census demographic statistics within Essex and Middlesex County cities and towns during this period indicate that communities with more families with children exhibited more land development, and communities with higher median household income exhibited less land development. Land change detection over the 17-year period indicated encroachment of development in areas of environmental concern, but level of development varied by socio-demographic factors.This study also illustrated that the combined use of remotely sensed data, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology, and demographic data are effective for use as a diagnostic tool and/or base to be built upon to explore associations, indicators, or drivers which may influence land cover change and its effects on existing environmental conditions in areas exhibiting change. In addition, this study provided awareness to ancillary research where scientific guidelines were derived for the protection of specific wildlife habitats and resident species. Lastly, this study presented several land cover modeling and web deployed data dissemination tools for the dissertation results as well as provided a conceptual framework for the successful adoption and implementation of these tools for organizations engaged in natural resource planning and management.

TI  - Novel Strategies for Glutamate Clearance in the Glia-Deprived Synaptic Hub of C. Elegans
AU  - Chan, Joyce
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - As the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain, Glutamate (Glu) is critical for normal neuronal physiology. Disruption in Glu clearance results in hyper-stimulation of glutamatergic circuits, potentially leading to excitotoxic neurodegeneration. The canonical model of brain connectivity describes glutamatergic synapses as well insulated and enveloped by glia. These glia express Glu Transporters (GluTs) which work to clear Glu following synaptic activity. However, critical areas of the brain such as the mammalian hippocampus display poor synaptic isolation, which may result in Glu spillover between adjacent synapses and subsequent loss of circuit specificity. How accurate signal transmission is achieved in these glia-deprived areas remains unclear. We approach this question using the C. elegans system, which faces the same dilemma as the mammalian hippocampus. Using a combination of behavioral assays and imaging of transgenic animals expressing Ca2+-sensitive reporter GCaMP or Glu-sensitive reporter iGluSnFR, we demonstrate a combined role of synaptic location and pharyngeal pulsatility in efficient Glu clearance of the nerve ring. We find that perfusion of Glu-rich interstitial fluid plays a vital role in GluT-mediated synaptic clearance, shown in our experiments where we induce paralysis of pharyngeal and head muscles to inhibit local movement. This study provides novel insights to mechanisms of effective Glu clearance in the absence of glia, a feature shared between nematodes and vital areas of the mammalian brain. Investigating novel mechanisms of Glu clearance can inform us in seeking candidate targets for therapeutic interventions in brain ischemia, and potential ways of manipulating brain pulsations and heart rate to promote clearance of solutes and aggregates (such as amyloid β) in patients to slow the onset of Alzheimer’s disease and other neuropathies.

TI  - Wellbeing on the Edge: The Dynamics of Musundian Edge-Dwelling on the Boundaries of Protected Natural Areas in Limpopo, South Africa
AU  - Abrams, Amber L.
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - This thesis examines the impacts of a protected natural area (Makuya park) on residents of Musunda village in Limpopo, South Africa. The creation of protected natural areas entails the formation of boundaries to limit access and resource use, often under the assumption that the isolation from human activity will allow 'natural' environments/habitats to re-emerge. When humans are not afforded a place in protected spaces, 'edge-dwellers' emerge. This thesis explores how the resulting changes in land use and access can impact the availability, distribution, and quality of strategically important resources, and thus influence a wide range of ecological, epidemiological, and economic processes that directly and indirectly impinge on an individual's wellbeing. Based on over two years of ethnographic fieldwork in the HaMakuya chieftaincy, this thesis aims to explore the tangible and intangible ways in which Makuya park impacts on Musundian edge-dwellers efforts to achieve wellbeing. Specific research questions include: How do edge-dwellers understand, discuss, and enact wellbeing? How and when are natural resources used toward achieving wellbeing? How and when does land access shape land use in terms of wellbeing and in what ways? Have shifts in practices occurred as a result of the formation of protected areas? I address these questions by engaging with current debates in social, medical and environmental anthropology. Using Cohen's (2013) 'ecologies of wellbeing' as a matrix through which to explore local conceptions of health/wellbeing (mutakalo), this thesis engages with a historical 'political ecology of health' (Harper 2002) and conservation to consider health and wellbeing within 'environmental perspectives' (McElroy and Townsend 2009). In focusing on the everyday practices of Musundians, this thesis foregrounds local notions of health (mutakalo) and local perceptions of natural resource limitations imposed by the park as a way to understand edge-dwellers' local ecologies of wellbeing. This thesis provides TshiVenda speakers' (an under-represented group) perspectives; it shows the negative impacts that the park has on resource access, diet, relationships and local healing practices according to edge-dwellers. Questioning how Musundians maintained ambivalence in these challenging circumstances, I discuss how I came to realize that the park is locally understood to offer the promise of 'good things.' Exploring the ways in which hope and the park intersect, I describe how the park has become incorporated into local ecologies of wellbeing. This thesis explores some wellbeing-related experiences of Musunda's edge-dwellers, while considering the park's influence on those dwelling on the boundary of a protected natural area thereby contributing to social anthropology scholarship at the intersection of environmental and medical anthropology. In doing this, this thesis draws on related disciplines in the social sciences, contributing to literatures in human geography, public health and ecology.

TI  - The Relative Timing of Human Migration and Land-Cover and Land-Use Change — An Evaluation of Northern Taiwan from 1990 to 2015
AU  - Shih, Hsiao-Chien
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Urban land expansion can be driven by and drive population growth, but determining cause-effect relationships of urban land expansion and population growth is challenging due to the temporal resolution of decadal censuses for most countries. The relative timing of urban land expansion and population change was explored based on a case study for north Taiwan from 1990 to 2015. Data on urban land expansion were derived from a dense time series of Landsat satellite imagery, and population change from annual population registers at the district level. A novel algorithm for identifying the starting time of urban expansion was developed and tested based on dense time series of Vegetation-Impervious-Soil (V-I-S) proportion maps derived from Landsat surface reflectance imagery. The time of urbanization estimated by logistic regression was determined from the Impervious cover time series. The identified location and estimated time for newly urbanized lands were generally accurate, with 80% of urban expansion estimated within ± 2.4 years.The random forest (RF) classification routine was applied to Landsat image inputs for detailed urban land-use classification. Input features were extracted from a 2015 Landsat image dataset, and the top 10 most contributing features for RF classifiers were the six spectral wavebands, gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) homogeneity of V-I-S, and Vegetation temporal variation. The Landsat image was tested with different input features, and the land-use maps derived from the top 10 features yielded the most accurate map. Areal extents of annual urban land uses (Residential, Employment, and Transportation corridor categories) were derived by applying a conditional statement based on the urbanization date of the urban expansion map and overlaying on the 2015 land-use map. The relative timing and general relationship between urban land-use and population dynamics was explored at the district level. Linear regression was run to understand the general relationship between population and land use. The relative timing between population growth and land-use change was estimated with lagged correlation. Residential land use and change was most related to population and change. Population growth occurred 2.5 years later than Residential land expansion based on the median time lag.

TI  - Community perturbations: Introduced species and habitat fragmentation
AU  - Bolger, Douglas Thomas
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The effect of perturbations on three ecological communities was studied using comparative and experimental methods. Fragmentation of chaparral habitat and its effect on chaparral specialist bird and rodent species was studied in coastal San Diego County, USA. The distribution of five bird species in isolated habitat fragments of known age (time since isolation) was compared to that in similar sized plots in continuous chaparral habitat. Fragments supported fewer species than plots, implying that population extinctions occur following isolation. Furthermore, bird species are lost in a predictable sequence which is highly correlated with density. Species which occur at lower density go extinct first. An analogous methodology was applied to chaparral specialist rodents. The results were similar. Plots in continuous habitat supported more species than fragments of similar size, and species which occur at low density occurred in fewer fragments than species of higher density.The effect of introducing a new species to a community was investigated in a system of urban-dwelling geckos on islands in the tropical Pacific. A biogeographic pattern was documented in which the introduction of Hemidactylus frenatus, a sexual species, to an island is correlated with the decline of two previously resident asexual species, Lepidodactylus lugubris and Hemidactylus garnotii. On a local scale the interaction between L. lugubris and H. frenatus was studied experimentally in Fiji. The introduction of H. frenatus to buildings from which its was previously absent resulted in a significant decline in the density, body weight, and fecundity of L. lugubris, relative to controls. These experiments confirm that the biogeographic pattern is the result of interspecific competition. Behavioral experiments revealed that male H. frenatus were behaviorally dominant to asexual H. garnotii and L. lugubris. H. frenatus was more likely to approach, bite, and spatially displace the asexual species than vice versa. This indicates that at least part of the competitive advantage enjoyed by H. frenatus is due to behavioral interference. The structure of chaparral bird and rodent communities in habitat fragments is most significantly affected by the autecological variable density, while interspecific interactions are the predominant structuring force in the gecko community.

TI  - "Near-by Nature": A Logical Framework for Building Integrated Agriculture
AU  - Plyler, William
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Building Integrated Agriculture (BIA) aims to reduce the environmental footprint of food production and to improve the human condition. BIA places food producing plants into the everyday working/living environment. This study explored the intersection of the diverse BIA requirements (human, plant, and building) as established by the relevant literature from various disciplines. Kaplan (1992), and Ulrich (1984; 1986; 1992) established the restorative physiological and psychological effects of plants in non-natural settings. Kaplan deemed these settings “Near-by Nature.” In building interiors, “Near-by Nature” is achieved through interiorscaping, a design practice that incorporates plant, building and occupant requirements.This study specifically investigated the implications of considering Building Integrated Agriculture as “Near-by Nature” while allowing for the diverse environmental requirements of the plants and building occupants. The environmental requirements considered were light, temperature and relative humidity. A synthesis of the requirements was applied to two theoretical redesigns of the Honors College dormitory at West Virginia University in Morgantown, WV.This study used a design research approach and fell into the category of design phenomenology. A logical argumentation approach (Groat & Wang, 2002) was used to establish a framework of “Near-by Nature” in the context of interiorscapes. Analog simulation modeling was used to test the “Near-by Nature” structure in the context of BIA (Groat & Wang, 2002).Analysis of interiorscape images was used to establish the structural framework of “Nearby-Nature”. Required crop yields were established using the U.S. Food Market Estimator developed by the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture. The existing baseline building and modified BIA version was modeled using Autodesk Revit 2011 software. Photorealistic images of the modified building with approximated crops provided the means to evaluate “Near-by Nature”.There were two interiorscape categories: those that facilitate movement and those that provide a place for gathering. The “Near-by Nature” framework had three technical terms: pace, distinct and contrast. The framework was combined with the Honors Hall dormitory and crop production requirements. The existing dormitory was found unsuitable to provide “Near-by Nature and plant production. Concept ‘A’ was developed to facilitate movement. The result was an increased occupancy and Gross Square Footage. The vegetables crops created rhythm and established landmarks along the corridors. Concept ‘B’ was developed to provide a space for gathering. The result was a decreased occupancy but an increased Gross square footage. The vegetable crops generated rhythm, created a sense of enclosure and controlled vistas. This study established a framework for designing “Near-by Nature”, developed parameters for further research and design investigations of BIA.

TI  - Reunited at Last: Genetic Recovery of Stream Fish Populations after Removal of Passage Barriers
AU  - Prasko, Lauren  M.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - One of the top threats to biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems is habitat fragmentation due to human activities. In streams, road crossings with poorly designed culverts can cause fragmentation and block fish passage, which limits genetic exchange between upstream and downstream individuals. The genetic effects of population isolation are well established, but the genetic response, or pattern of recovery, of fish populations following re-establishment of connectivity is poorly understood. This knowledge gap is addressed by measuring allelic diversity, genetic differentiation, and assignment probabilities in Mottled Sculpin (Cottus bairdii) sampled upstream and downstream of sites with varying time spans since culvert replacement. Sample collection occurred during the summer of 2018 from eight streams located throughout western Pennsylvania. This was the first time Mottled Sculpin microsatellites were used to assess the genetic effects of culvert barriers. Sites with restored passage barriers had little genetic differences among upstream and downstream populations. Results indicate immediate movement between upstream and downstream populations following barrier restoration.

T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - My analysis and evaluation of the conservation community policy model has shown it to be an effective and economically viable urban policy remedy for negative externalities inherent in urban sprawl development. Using surveys, interviews and election data in a case study analysis of Prairie Crossing, a private conservation community in Lake County, Illinois, I establish that the policy model, as defined in this case study, is a for-profit hydridization of the non-profit land trust model. Incorporating aspects of the New Urbanism movement, Prairie Crossing succeeded in the positive creation of place and community. Resident voting participation in local elections significantly exceeded county norms, and non-voting political participation significantly surpassed the national rates recorded in the ANES data. Community developers substantively created and restored valuable habitats, including the locally extirpated and regionally threatened tall-grass prairie ecosystem. Biotic corridors link the development's wetlands to the local watershed and provide for the exchange of genetic material between populations, mitigating the problem of island biogeography. Conservation homeowner association practices, including exotic invasive and pest species removal, wetland and prairie burning, place-based ecology, organic farming, renewable energy generation, the planting of native organisms, and the reintroduction of endangered fish, have mitigated regional environmental degradation, and have fostered altruistic eco-friendly behaviors within the housing community's residents. Residents self-reported increasing their conservation behavior one-half a point on a four-point conservation rubric. Residents failed to alter transportation-oriented behaviors firmly anchored in American culture, supporting prior research conclusions. Increased environmental awareness at the national and, particularly, the local level substantively contributed to the defeat of a long-time incumbent in the U.S. House of Representatives. Survey data suggests that self-selection of homebuyers did not undermine the policy model. Further resident association practices include education, both internally and externally, and financial and organizational support for outside organizations. The development was successful in competing in the free market with conventional sprawling development. The conservation community policy model offers policy makers an economically competitive alternative to conventional urban sprawl.

TI  - Mechanistic modeling of sylvatic arboviruses in Senegal
AU  - Althouse, Benjamin M.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Many arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) occur in two distinct transmission cycles: transmission among non-human hosts by mosquitoes (termed the  sylvatic cycle) and transmission among humans by mosquitoes in villages and cities (termed the human cycle). These viruses transmitted predominantly via a sylvatic cycle may nonetheless cause considerable morbidity and mortality to humans living or working in proximity to primate populations. Further, sylvatic cycles represent virus reservoirs that will support transmission even if transmission among human populations were eliminated. Using a uniquely rich ecological dataset from the Institute Pastur de Dakar, Senegal, this thesis quantifies patterns observed in dengue fever virus, yellow fever virus, chikungunya virus, and zika virus isolates over the past 50 years and attempts to explain these patterns through mechanistic models. We find non-human primate demographics may determine the periodicity of isolations observed in Senegal, and that mosquito biting on more than one species may act to synchronize isolations across hosts and vectors. To refine mechanistic models of dengue transmission, we perform a systematic review and pooled analysis to quantify the time from inoculation to viremia and duration of viremia for dengue fever virus in flavivirus naïve non-human primates and identify associations between these and several primate characteristics while adjusting for study heterogeneity. Finally, we explore periodicities of all four viruses and mosquito capture abundances of three key mosquito species and find ecological associations between virus isolation, mosquito abundance, and climactic variables. This thesis is a springboard to launch further explorations of the sylvatic cycle of arboviruses in Senegal and, indeed, across the globe.

TI  - Riverine wetland function and human-induced ecological disturbance: A watershed perspective
AU  - Edge, Julie Mann
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - This dissertation evaluated the relationship between human-induced ecological disturbance and riverine wetland function at a watershed level. Specifically, it addressed the hypothesis that as human-induced ecological disturbance increases riverine wetland functional capacity decreases. The use of a watershed perspective was assessed, as was the Hydrogeomorphic Approach (HGM). The HGM method evaluates wetland function to meet the technical and programmatic requirements of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. HGM is based on the factors that influence how a wetland functions--geomorphic setting, water source, and hydrodynamics. Brinson et al.'s (1995) HGM guidebook for riverine wetlands (HGM-Riverine) was used as the framework for investigating the wetland functional capacity in two small watersheds located in eastern Missouri. HGM-Riverine defines fifteen functions that are categorized as hydrologic, biogeochemical, and habitat functions. It also determines the index of function for a riverine wetland based on the fifteen functions. Nine of the fifteen functions and the index of function proved significant. These functions were long-term surface water storage, moderation of groundwater flow or discharge, nutrient cycling, removal of elements and compounds, characteristic plant communities, spatial structure of habitat, interspersion and connectivity, distribution and abundance of invertebrates, distribution and abundance of vertebrates. For the ecological disturbance tests, the two watersheds were compared based on their population dynamics and land use. Wild Horse Creek watershed and Caulk's Creek watershed are of similar size and terrain, but have contrasting ecological disturbance regimes. Wild Horse Creek is relatively rural and undisturbed while Caulk's Creek is experiencing rapid urbanization as part of the westward expansion of the St. Louis metropolitan area into the City of Wildwood. The tests showed a significant difference in the ecological disturbance factors between the two watersheds. In sum, the research results revealed that Wild Horse Creek's watershed had greater riverine wetland functional capacity and less manifestation of human-induced ecological disturbance than Caulk's Creek's watershed. A watershed perspective enhanced the evaluation of wetland function and ecological disturbance by showing the trends among related wetlands and landscape features. While HGM was not intended to be a watershed-based technique, the results from this dissertation support its use in that capacity.

AU  - Stadnyk, Eric Stephen
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Alternative open space design strategies need to be sought which work in concert with those qualities of a landscape which contribute to its inherent sense of place. Traditional planning strategies at Omand's Creek in Winnipeg have recently seen this area evolving from an industrial locale into a typical, big-box retail superstore site. Barely a shade of what it used to be, the waterway has become merely an industrial drainage ditch, with little benefit for wildlife or recreational opportunities. Traditional notions of park space development places islands of parks within the urban fabric, unconnected and unrelated to one another, few and far between. Greenway design is a recent movement that brings together nature, recreation and the potential to re-think the way cities and green spaces are put together. Re-integrating nature as a greenway at Omand's Creek explores the exciting potential of the revitalisation of the creek, the reuse of the railway corridor, enhancement of the existing park spaces at Bluestem and Westview, and future linkages to the regional context. As well, as a means of urban design, a greenway may resolve the area's changing and temporal land uses and natural and pedestrian activities. A framework is illustrated which will allow for change to continue to occur on the site as it continues to evolve.

TI  - Landscape Genetics of Anopheles Gambiae in Southern Ghana
AU  - Essandoh, John
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Insecticide application via indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticide-treated bednets (LLIN) has been a key component in combating malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, with pyrethroids being the traditionally recommended insecticides. However, the resistance of Anopheles gambiae s.s. and An. coluzzii to pyrethroids is high and widespread, especially in West Africa, underpinned in part by high frequencies of the L1014F target-site mutation in the voltage-gated sodium channel (Vgsc). Carbamate (CB) and organophosphate (OP) resistance is generally lower but appears to be spreading via increasing frequencies of acetylcholinesterase (Ace-1) target site mutations involving the G119S polymorphism. Whilst Vgsc-1014F often nears fixation, Ace-1-119S is far more heterogeneous with complex copy number variant (CNV) dynamics. This study seeks to identify the determinants of Ace-1-119S spatial and temporal distribution and use population genetics to quantify the fine-scale population structure of An. gambiae s.s and An. coluzzii to understand how genetic barriers and gene flow may determine the current and future geographical spread. The study across southern Ghana demonstrated that ecological zones and land-use activities are important determinants of Ace-1-119S and Vgsc-1014F distributions. The Vgsc-1014F is associated with rural, mining, and cash crop plantations, while Ace-1-119S is associated with urban agricultural activities. These human-influenced environmental factors are likely to influence selection for, and the spread of the insecticide resistance mutations. Interesting, whilst almost all past studies have shown that insecticidal mortality increased with mosquito age, this was not the case for pirimiphos-methyl. Indeed, mortality was well predicted by Ace-1 mutant type but not age, suggesting that age-dependent costs of resistance may be low, and more broadly that age-specific resistance is not a universal phenomenon and may depend on insecticide class and resistance mechanisms. The study also showed that informative molecular markers such as Ace-1 can be used for sensitive temporal surveillance to track the changes in resistance in populations missed by standard diagnostic dose assays. In the focal area of Accra from which the time series of samples were collected, Ace-1-119S frequencies within An. gambiae s.s. and An. coluzzii appeared destined for fixation but deviated from this path in recent years. This resulted from the co-existence of homogeneous and heterogeneous Ace-1 duplications, with balancing of mutant polymorphisms likely a result of different costs and benefits of each. There was also evidence of shifting Ace-1 duplication type dynamics that are operating in the opposite direction in each species – presumably bringing each towards a common equilibrium.Finally, Anopheles gambiae s.s. and An. coluzzii sampled from 34 sites spanning the four ecological zones, and land-use types were genotyped using around 10,000 markers generated by low-coverage genome sequencing. Results showed a striking lack of close relatives among mosquitoes, despite larval sampling, suggesting that the strategy of collecting from multiple sites within (on average) a 3.0-km radius successfully yielded unrelated mosquitoes. There was low genetic differentiation and no population structure within both An. coluzzii and An. gambiae s.s. across southern Ghana. However, An. coluzzii showed isolation by distance at a local sampling scale, suggesting there is distance-limited dispersal, and that patterns reflect contemporary gene flow. In An. gambiae s.s, no isolation by distance was detectable, even at a smaller geographical distance of separation suggesting the implication of historical signals for the observed no population structure. The results also showed that distance is not the primary cause of Ace-1 differentiation, but rather habitat differentiation which may correlate with distance. The findings of this study have given insight into phenotypic resistance of primary Anopheles malaria vectors to CB and particularly OP and how underlying target-site resistance mechanisms may be selected by environmental factors to modulate resistance and its spread. This information provides guidelines for vector control and resistance management.

TI  - Evolution, phylogeography and species boundaries of the ringneck snake genus Diadophis
AU  - Fontanella, Frank Matthew
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The monotypic snake genus Diadophis Baird and Girard, 1853 is one of the most widely distributed and morphologically variable snakes throughout North America. This snake (Diadophis punctatus) exploits a variety of habitats and ecological niches ranging from the mixed hardwood forests of southern Canada to the desert of the Southwestern US and Central Mexico (excluding the northern Great Plains states. Ringneck snakes have traditionally been divided into 13 subspecies based on a combination of morphology and geography. This study has provided the first range-wide molecular study and provides a framework for the origin, evolution and biodiversity in the genus Diadophis. Analysis of mtDNA sequence data inferred 16 mtDNA lineages that replace each other geographically across the United States and into central Mexico. In contrast to previous hypothesis, ancestral area reconstructions inferred an origin for D. punctatus in the southeastern United States during the Miocene, followed by a southeast to northeast then westward directionality of historical migration. Demographic analyses indicate that independent lineages currently occupying previously glaciated or unsuitable areas in eastern, central and western U.S. underwent post-glacial population expansion likely from southern refugia during the late Pleistocene/early Holocene. Conversely, southern lineages display patterns consistent with long-term population stability. For the purposes of species delineation, ecological niche modeling does not show isolation due to unsuitable habitat. Ten novel microsatellite loci developed for this study suggest that most species boundaries are maintained through a balance of selection and dispersal in hybrid zones. Based on the geographic distribution of the mtDNA lineages and the microsatellite frequency data, we hypothesize that there are eight species within the genus Diadophis throughout the Eastern United States. This body of work provides a rich framework for further study including, examining species boundaries in the western lineages, determining population structure within species, and detailed examination of hybrid zones.

TI  - The Shasta Dam boomtowns: A social and economic history, 1938-1950
AU  - Rocca, Alvieri Mario
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - This study attempts to investigate the social and economic history of the boomtown communities that sprang up around the building of Shasta Dam during the period between 1938-1950. The historical evolution of dam town settlements is traced back through the dam construction projects at Grand Coulee and Hoover Dam. Migration routes to Shasta Dam are traced and mapped.Three distinct types of communities appeared in the vicinity of Shasta Dam. Toyon, the Government Camp, housed federal dam inspectors and administrators, as well as their families. The town, modelled along the lines of other Depression-Era greenbelt communities, contained well maintained residences and services. Shasta Dam Village, the Contractors Camp, was built on the job site and provided homes for company managers and job foremen. This camp provided dorms for single men, detached residences for families, a large mess hall, a recreation room, and a store. Boomtown activity centered around three commercial cores that grew up near the intersection of transportation links to the dam site. The boomtowns included Summit City, Project City, and Central Valley.The Shasta Dam area community development expanded rapidly to comprise over 11,000 persons by 1940. Active businessmens' associations promoted the area and encouraged further growth. The communities built an area school and maintained a large and active PTA organization. Social interaction between the commercial boomtowns occurred regularly and consistently, however, evidence exists suggesting some degree of social isolation between the government town of Toyon and boomtowns. The onset of World War II brought a highly fluid situation to the area as many workers migrated south to better paying defense related jobs in the Bay Area and Los Angeles.Expanding job opportunities after World War II and an improved highway commuter network facilitated a postwar economic boom that encouraged permanent settlement in the area. Foremost among the area employers were lumber mills, plywood processing plants, and Pacific Gas & Electric. By 1950, with the dam complete and their community water problems solved, the boomtown communities were well on their way to becoming permanently established towns.

TI  - Ecophysiology of Populus fremontii: Effects of inundation, and interactions among nitrogen form, nutrient level, and water availability
AU  - Auchincloss, Lisa Cutting
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - As the climate changes and land continues to be developed for agricultural and urban use, ecosystems around the globe will experience shifts in hydrologic cycles, CO2 concentrations, water availability, and nutrient availability.  Semi-arid riparian forests in the North American West will be particularly affected by these changes since establishment of riparian vegetation depends on the river hydrograph, urban and agricultural runoff, water and air temperature, CO2 concentration, and soil nutrient availability.  Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii) is an early successional foundation species in these ecosystems that establishes along barren point bars and contributes many important ecosystem functions.  The three chapters of this dissertation investigate responses of P. fremontii  seedlings to 1) variation in inundation depth, duration, and temperature, 2) variation in atmospheric CO2 concentration and N form (NO3- and NH4+), and 3) variation in nutrient level, soil water availability, and N form.    Investigations of seedling tolerance of inundation showed that mortality increased linearly with days of complete shoot submergence (mortality % = 4.6 + (2.5 days)), resulting in greater than 60% mortality after four weeks of complete submergence.  Cooler water temperature (18/11°C day/night) during complete submergence positively affected seedling dry weight and survival resulting in 25% greater seedling survival than at warmer water temperatures (25/18°C day/night).  Results indicated that establishment of new  P. fremontii populations in the riparian corridor will be more successful when flows do not completely cover the shoots of seedlings for more than two weeks and if water temperatures during inundation are cool.    Investigations of seedling response to N form and CO2 level found that seedlings grown with NH4+ had 42% greater average dry weight than those grown with NO3-  regardless of CO2 level.  The lack of an interaction countered our hypotheses that inhibition of leaf NO3- reduction at elevated CO2 would lead to lower dry weights in NO3- fed plants at elevated CO2.  Instead we found that NO3 -  reduction occurred in roots and was not coupled to carbon metabolism in seedling leaves.  The observed differences in dry weight between NO 3- and NH4+ plants were likely due to the increased costs of NO3- reduction and maintenance of charge balance in P. fremontii seedling roots.  Regardless of form, there was no significant difference in average dry weights between plants grown at ambient and elevated CO2, and there was evidence of CO2 acclimation.  The final chapter quantified relative effects of water stress (stressed vs. well watered), nutrient level (low near field conditions, medium, and high non-limiting), and N form (NO3- vs. NH 4+) on growth.  Low nutrient level decreased average plant dry weight to a large extent.  Decreases caused by low nutrients were at least six-fold greater than any decrease in biomass resulting from water stress.  N form had little effect on plant dry weights.  Both water stress and N form interacted with nutrient level such that effects of either factor on growth and allocation were only observed at high and medium nutrient levels.  Thus, effects of water stress and N form are likely to affect plant growth and dry weight allocation only when high, non-limiting nutrients are present, whereas nutrient level consistently affects seedling growth and allocation and dampens effects of the other factors.    Together these chapters provide an assessment of the effects of inundation, nutrient level, CO2 level, N form, and intermittent, moderate water stress on the growth and survival of P. fremontii seedlings during their first season of growth.

T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorMangifera indica L (Anacardiaceae family) which belongs to Mangifera genus, is widely distributed in 70 countries all over the world. In China, Mangifera indica L is very abundant, and distributed in Taiwan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, North part of Fujian and South part of Yunnan. Its fruits, nucleus, bark and leaves can be used as drugs for various special pharmacologic activities. The extract of leaves of Mangifera indica L has many functions such as relief of cough, anti-inflammation, relief-pain, anti-bacteria, anti-virus, anti-neoplasm et al. Application in the clinic shows that the extract of leaves of Mangifera indica L has good effect on respiratory inflammation and cough in the flu. Its fruit which contained mangiferonic acid, iso-mangiferonic acid and polyphenols has anti-cancer function. The extract of bark of Mangifera indica L shows relieve a cough and anti- inflammation. In recent years, the anti-diabetic activities of the bark of Mangifera indica L and mangiferin have become more and more important. There are some reports about chemical constituents of the bark of Mangifera indica L in aboard. In 2003, Schieber et al reported the flavonols from the bark of Mangifera indica L by means of HPLC-ESIMS, and found seven quercetin O- glycosides, one kaemferol O- glycoside and four xanthone C-glycosides. The latter were identified as mangiferin and isomangiferin and their respective galloyl derivatives. Nunez Sells et al had made studies on chemical character of the bark of Mangifera indica L, and obtained seven phenol constituents in 2002. Among them, mangiferin is an outstanding constituent. Unfortunately, there is no report on chemical constituents of the bark of Mangifera indica L in China. The purpose in the research is to make a systemic study on chemical constituents of the bark of Mangifera indica L in Guangzhou city, Guangdong province, China. W hope to find new compounds which have anti-diabetic activities. The results will supply a theory basis for the further study on the bark of Mangifera indica L. Isolation and identification of the chemical constituents of the bark of Mangifera indica L It is reported that the experiments of isolation and identification of chemical constituents of the bark of Mangifera indica L. The experiments of isolation and identification had been done by using modern techniques. Twelve compounds were isolated from the EtOH extracts of the bark of Mangifera indica L, and ten of them were identified as mangiferone (1), mangiferin (2), pristimerin (3), daphnoretin (4), quercetin (5), rutin (6), myricetin (7), myricetrin (8), β-sitosterol (9) and β-daucosterol (10). Among them, mangiferone was a new compound. Pristimerin, daphnoretin, myricetin and myricetrin were obtained from this plant for the first time. The other two compounds were not identified because of less amount. For the limitation of time, the pharmacologic activity tests of twelve compounds obtained have not been done in this study. According to recent researches, five of the twelve compounds isolated from the bark of Mangifera indica L have the anti-diabetic activities. They are mangiferin (2), quercetin (5), rutin (6), myricetin (7) and myricetrin (8). It will be benefit to the research and development of natural hypoglycemic medicine. In general, twelve compounds were isolated from the bark of Mangifera indica L in Guangzhou area in this study. Mangiferone (1) is a new compound.

TI  - Evaluation of wetland plants for susceptibility to species of Phytophthora present in runoff water at ornamental plant nurseries
AU  - Ridge, Garrett A.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Competition between agricultural producers and urban communities for high quality water is increasing; therefore, growers need to adopt water conservation and reuse practices to ensure an adequate supply of irrigation water. One concern with recycled irrigation water is the potential to recirculate propagules of oomycete pathogens. Constructed wetlands are a biologically-based treatment option for nutrient and chemical remediation that potentially also could filter pathogen propagules. The goal of this study was to assess the susceptibility of plants routinely used in constructed wetlands to infection by species of  Phytophthora commonly found at ornamental plant nurseries. In laboratory and greenhouse experiments, an effective and relatively consistent inoculum delivery method for aqueous systems was developed using zoospores of five species of Phytophthora (P. cinnamomi, P. citrophthora, P. cryptogea, P. nicotianae, and P. palmivora ) that were released from agar plugs placed in aqueous solution over 29- and 13-day test periods. In a separate greenhouse experiment, four wetland plant species (Canna flaccida, Juncus effusus, Sagittaria latifolia,  and Typha latifolia) were evaluated for potential infection by the five species of Phytophthora. Zoospore presence and viability were monitored throughout each experiment by a baiting bioassay and filtration. Susceptibility of each plant species was determined by visual observation and isolation on medium selective for Phytophthora spp. Two of the four wetland plant species screened in this study were not susceptible to species of Phytophthora; however roots of  Canna flaccida and Juncus effusus were infected by P. cinnamomi and P. cryptogea respectively. Zoospore production by all species of Phytophthora, with the exception of P. cinnamomi, was suppressed by Canna flaccida. During all plant trials, a reduction in zoospore activity for the five species of Phytophthora in the plant treatments was documented when compared to control containers with no plants. On samples collected in the field over an 18-month period, 14 species of plants growing in established constructed wetlands at a production nursery in Georgia were sampled and roots were assayed for species of Phytophthora. Wetland plant species exhibited only limited association with naturally-occurring species of  Phytophthora; pathogens were found infesting roots of only 22 of the 350 plants sampled. Phytophthora spp. were not found infesting roots of Canna flaccida, Juncus effusus, and  Lemna valdiviana. Further testing of the susceptibility of  Canna flaccida, Hydrocotyle umbellata, Pontederia cordata, Sagittaria latifolia,  and Typha latifolia are needed because my results suggest that these species do not support growth and reproduction of the five species of Phytophthora used in this study. By establishing constructed wetlands with plant species known to be not susceptible, propagules of Phytophthora will be less likely to establish themselves in roots and reproduce within the constructed wetland system. This should allow the safe re-use of runoff for irrigation at the nursery and may limit or prevent escape of Phytophthora spp. in runoff from nurseries into the environment.

TI  - Responses of Flesh Fly (boettcherisca Peregrina) to Heavy Metals and Its Adaptation Mechanism
AU  - Wu, Xing Guo
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - There is a growing public concern over the potential pollution of heavy metals in China owing to rapid urban and industrial development in the last several decades. Heavy metals are nonbiodegradable and they can be accumulated by organisms and have adverse effects at different levels of organization, such as population, individual organisms, tissues and cells. These effects are demonstrated in life-history traits of an organisms, for example, development, growth, aging, longevity, survival and reproduction. In the ecosystems insects (such as flies, mosquitoes, beetles and ants) play an important role in the transport and reintegration of heavy metals, and the insects have developed special adaptation mechanism to resist the heavy metal under the metal-pollution stress. Thus, it is of the utmost importance to investigate heavy metal accumulation in such insects, effects on the insects and adaptation mechanism of the insects. In this paper, the accumulation, the responses, homeostasis and storage mechanism of flesh fly (Biettcherisca peregrina) to Cd2+ and Cu2+ are studied. The results are shown as follows:1 Effects of Cd2+ and Cu2+ on development and reproduction of parental generation (P) and filial generation (F1) of Biettcherisca peregrinaThe development and reproduction of P generation and F1 generation of B. peregrina were studied after newly oviposited larvae of P generation were exposed to various concentrations of Cd2+ or Cu2+ administered in the artificial diet until pupation. The duration of the larval stages and pupal stages in P generation increased in proportion to the concentrations of metal ion, but the adult lives of treated-group got shortened than control group. The weight of larvae, pupae and newly emerged adults in P generation of treated-group decreased with Cd2+ or Cu2+ concentration. In addition, the body length of larvae and pupae in P generation of treated-group decreased with Cd2+ or Cu2+ concentration too. Survival of larvae, pupae and adult in P generation of treated-group was decreased with metal concentration. Although the sex ratio of adult coming from the larvae exposed to Cd2+ or Cu2+ had no significance compared with the control, mating rate of male and female were significantly lower than controls. Fecundity of females of treated groups was also significantly reduced. However, all above parameters of F1 generation coming from parents exposed to Cd2+ or Cu2+ and controls were not significantly different. These results show that development and reproduction of P generation are seriously impaired at sublethal Cd2+ or Cu2+ concentrations, but the impairment of P generation induced by Cd2+ or Cu2+ don’t influence the development and reproduction of the offspring. Moreover, low concentrations of heavy metals affected little to the development of B. peregrina and have stimulatory function to some extent, implying that B. peregrina has good mechanism to regulate metals.2 Accumulation and excretion of Cd2+ and Cu2+ in Biettcherisca peregrina larvaeB. peregrina larvae fed on food supplemented with Cd2+ retained most of ingested Cd2+. Few ingested Cd2+ were excreted by excretory system. Cd2+ accumulation in larvae of B. peregrina was proportional to treatment time, but not to Cd2+ concentration in food. Especially, Cd2+ accumulation and excretion in larvae both decreased at more than 200 μg/g Cd2+ exposure than 200 μg/g exposure. This maybe ascribe to toxic effect of Cd2+ on larvae. During metamorphosis, the loss of Cd2+ took place almost entirely at pupation. Newly eclosion adults had lower Cd2+ concents than the larvae. This loss of Cd2+ was correlated to the excretion of Cd2+.B. peregrina larvae fed on food supplemented with Cu2+ retained about half amounts of ingested Cu2+. Few ingested Cu2+ were excreted by excretory system. Cu2+ accumulation and excretion in larvae of B. peregrina were proportional to treatment time and to Cu2+ concentration in food. During metamorphosis, Cu2+ was excreted by final instar larvae and newly eclosion adults and Cu2+ content in vivo decresed.3 The distribution of Cd2+ and Cu2+ among tissues of Biettcherisca peregrina larvaeThe larvae of B. peregrina were fed with Cd2+-containing or Cu2+-containing diet and the distributions of Cd2+ and Cu2+ among tissues were determined by separating each organ. The results determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer showed most of Cd2+ and Cu2+ accumulated in the alimentary canal, especially midgut, and the content of Cu2+ and Cd2+ in integument, fat body, haemolymph and malpighian tubules were very low. But the concentrations of heavy metal in malpighian tubules was adjacent to that in midgut, and was much higher than that in integument, fat body and haemolymph.4 Morphological and ultrastructural alternations in the midgut and malpighian tubules after the Cd2+ and Cu2+ exposureThe effects of Cd2+ (80 μg/g) and Cu2+ (100 μg/g) on the morphology and ultrastructure of midgut and malpighian tubules of B. peregrina larvae were studied by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Treatment times (48 h) and metal concentrations were in the sublethal range to the larvae as determined by toxicity test. Under the treatment time and metal concentrations, the two metal species had profound effects on the morphology and ultra- structure of midgut and malpighian tubules. The morphology of midgut and malpighian tubules in treatment showed similar changes at the light microscopical level: the midgut got darker, shorter and thicker than control midgut, and many strumaes occurred on the surface of the midgut; and the malpighian tubules got shorter and thinner. Ultrastructural alterations in midgut induced by Cu2+ and Cd2+ included mitochondrial condensation, swelling, and lysis. The rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) showed dilation and vesiculation. The microvilli (MV) were shortened and disordered. The lipid droplets decreased and stored glycogens were increased. Many mineral spherites appeared. Ultrastructural alterations observed in the malpighian tubules included rER vesiculation and mito- chondria swelling with loss of cristae. Shortened and disordered microvilli, increased numbers of large hydropic vacuoles and mineral spherites were also observed. It was special to malpighian tubules basal membrane became thinner.5 Effects of Cd2+ and Cu2+ on the number, spreading and viability of the larval hemocyteswe investigated the effects of Cd2+ and Cu2+ on hemocytes of B. peregrina in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, the total number of hemocytes and viability of hemocytes decreased after the larvae fed cadmium-containing and copper-containing diets in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In vitro , Haemocytes from 4th-day-old larvae were seeded in 96-well microplates and exposed to Cd2+ or Cu2+ at the concentrations of 0.1, 1, 10, 20 and 40 μg/g. The viability of hemocytes was affected by heavy metals in a dose- dependent manner, and the viability ratio is no difference after 0.5 h and 4 h incubation. Moreover, the spreading had no difference among metal-exposed hemocytes and control hemocytes. The above results indicated Cd2+ or Cu2+ can disturb hemocytes of B. peregrina.6 Changes of energy level in larval haemolymph on exposure of larvae to Cd2+ and Cu2+The biochemical constituents of larval haemolymph such as total sugar, proteins ans lipids were determined in B. peregrina larvae to Cd2+ or Cu2+ at different concentrations for 48 h, repectively. The results showed the biochemical constituents decresed on exposure to Cd2+ and Cu2+, and the energy level determined by the biochemical constituents decreased too. Moreover, high concentrations were found to more effective than low concentration. The effect of Cd2+ or Cu2+ at the concentration of 800 μg/g was also studied on the above biochemical consitituents at intervals of 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h. The results showed biochemical constituents and energy level in Cd2+- or Cu2+-exposed larvae were lower than that in control larvae. Therefore, measuring the caloric concentration in larval haemolymph of B. peregrina can be used to evalute the physiological effects of combating Cd2+ and Cu2+ toxicity.7 Lipid peroxidation induced by Cd2+ and Cu2+ in Biettcherisca peregrina larvaeCd2+ and Cu2+ could induce the increasing of lipid peroxidation in B. peregrina larvae in dose-dependent and time-dependent ways.8 Isolation, purification and characterization of metallothioeinThe metallothioneins (MT) in B. peregrina larvae were induced to be produced after feeding the dietary containing 800 μg cadmium per gram diet for 48 h. Two forms of MTs (MT-I and MT-II) were isolated and purified from the supernatant of the whole body homogenates from the larvae after exposure to cadmium chlorides, using gel chromatography on Sephadex G-50, ion-exchange chromatography on UNOTM Q1, and on Bio-Gel P-6 for desalination. Both molecular weights of MT-I and MT-II were 9 kDa. Both MT-I and MT-II contained 7 cadmium atoms and 20 sulfhydryl groups per molecule, and showed the spectral characteristic of cadmium-thionein, i.e. a broad shoulder at 254 nm. As to amino acid composition of MT-I and MT-II, their contents of cysteine residues were the highest, accounting for 36.6% and 31.8% of all amino acids, respectively. However, their contents of aromatic amino acid and histidine were very low, just sharing 1%~2% of all amino acids.9 Proteomic analysis of Responses to Cd2+ in the midgut of Biettcherisca peregrinaWe examined proteome changes of midgut cells in a B. peregrina larvae to acute cadmium stress using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The expression levels of many protein spots showed changes. Amounts of fourteen proteins increased and of ten proteins decreased. Of these fourteen increased protein, ten protein were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationtime of flight mass spectrometry, and 7 proteins have previously been reported to be relevant to cellular detoxification processes. The functions of 7 proteins include the removal of Cd (p -glycoprotein，pGp)，emergency function (Heat shock proteins, Hsp ), osmoregulation and transport metal ion (cadmium-inducible lysosomal protein CDR). 10. Comparison of metal accumulation, growth and development, reproduction and antioxidant enzymes in resistant strain and susceptible strainDevelopment of cadmium tolerance and copper tolerance in a natural B. peregrina population maintained in the laboratory for 20 generations. Increased metal tolerance in selected strains (RCd and RCu) was reflected by increased metal accumulation, enhanced juvenile survivorship, and increased fecundity of female adult compared with the relative susceptible strain (S). The RCd and RCu strains displaied higher metallothionein levels than S strain after inducement with same level of heavy metals. This correlated with increased metal accumulation. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione- S-transferase (GST) and esterase (EST) were measured after the larvae of different srains were exposed to heavy metal. Significant enhancement of GR activity were observed in RCd and RCu strains compared with S strain, while SOD, CAT, GST and EST levels were not significantly different.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of hormone-autonomous tumors of Arabidopsis thaliana
AU  - Persinger, Sharon Marie
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - In order to study the molecular genetics of factors controlling plant cell growth, a set of tumors on the small crucifer Arabidopsis thaliana was isolated and characterized. Seeds or seedlings were exposed to $\sp{60}$Co gamma radiation and, 30-60 days after germination, tumors developed either on the hypocotyl or in the region of the apical meristem of about 1% of the plants. When excised and placed in culture, some of these tumors were found to be capable of hormone-autonomous growth. The tumors exhibit a number of different phenotypes, varying in color, texture, and degree of differentiation. Some tumors appear to be completely undifferentiated, one consistently produces roots, and others show the sporadic appearance of shoots or leaflets. Growth rates of the tumors on hormone-free medium vary but are within the range of hormone-dependent callus and tumors induced by Agrobacterium. Investigations of gene expression in the tumors led to the identification of an mRNA that is abundant in all of the tumors and differentially expressed in plant organs and hormone-dependent callus grown on different auxins. The predicted translation product of the mRNA is a glycine-rich protein (GRP), and partial DNA sequence homology was found to previously characterized GRP genes. Like other GRP sequences, this mRNA was found to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner, and accumulates in response to wounding or flooding stress. In an attempt to isolate the genomic sequences encoding the GRP mRNA, genomic clones were isolated using the GRP cDNA sequence as a probe. Comparison of one of the cloned genomic sequences with the cDNA revealed that the two sequences are not homologous but share short regions of GC-rich homology which are probably responsible for hybridization at normal stringency. Although the GRP sequence is not likely to play a role tumorigenesis, the use of the tumors in its identification illustrates how differences between the tumors and normal tissue can be exploited to study the regulation of genes of interest.

TI  - "The Dream is in the Process:" Environmental Racism and Environmental Justice in Boston, 1900 to 2000
AU  - Brennan, Michael J.
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The following work explores the evolution of a resident-directed environmental activism that challenged negative public perception to redevelop their community. Beginning in the 1950s, city leaders justified the dislocation of non-white residents from Boston’s South End with the argument that they failed to maintain personal property and degraded community institutions. Most of these minority residents were forced to move to Roxbury. From 1963 to 1983, Roxbury lost 2,200 housing units. The vacant lots led to illegal dumping, and increased toxicity in the air, water, and soil from undesirable land use businesses such as asphalt plants. As a result, banks, supermarkets and pharmacies refused to locate in the area. By 1985, the Dudley area of Roxbury shared a median income with the poorest communities in the United States. The negative perception of residents, abrogation of civil and property rights, and denial of essential services led to isolation and vulnerability that instituted and enforced environmental racism. The roots of the Environmental Justice Movement (EJM) that gained public recognition in Boston during the 1990s extend back to the nineteenth century. Minorities employed a variety of environmental strategies and actions to control their community and shape policies that impacted their community. In response to urban renewal and coupled with civil rights efforts, residents developed an activist approach in the 1960s. In the 1970s, groups recruited participants, built organizational capacities, and improved the networking capabilities of residents. While they did not identify as environmentalists, their pragmatic pursuit of equality led to specific environmental improvements.In the 1980s, the Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative (DSNI) drew directly from the experiences and personnel of previous efforts to build a national exemplar of environmental justice. Building an “urban village” in Dudley Square facilitated a variety of environmentally focused initiatives that increased access to public transportation, expanded clean energy use, improved air quality, and reduced pollutants. Activist groups pioneered civic environmentalism, the philosophy that environmentalism and civic activism begins in the home, street, and neighborhood where one lives. Proponents of civic environmentalism contend that local environmental stewardship leads to sound environmental policy on larger and more complex scales.

TI  - Literature and National Formation: 'Indigenista' Fiction in the United States (1820-1860) and in Mexico (1920-1960)
AU  - Steele, Cynthia
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Jacksonian America (1820-1860) and postrevolutionary Mexico (1920-1960) were both marked by nation-building, literary nationalism, and the formulation of Indian policy. The indigenista fiction of these periods, in treating the conflicts between colonial and Native American societies, illustrates the reciprocal influence of politics, ideology, and literature. In particular, each nation adapted common paradigms to reflect the peculiarity of national circumstances, values, and goals.In each of the periods under discussion, the dominant society sought to promote the national project of modernization by making its people culturally homogeneous. In the antebellum United States this meant "civilizing" a "savage" people, i.e., making farmers of a people that were thought to be hunters. Because it was taken for granted that hunting and farming societies could not peacefully coexist and because the process of Indian acculturation was too slow for American settlers, it was finally decided that Native Americans must be removed beyond the reach of Civilized progress. In Mexico a century later, Mexicans struggling to reconstruct their nation after a revolution sought to "civilize" a "primitive" people. They assumed that, through Spanish language instruction and improved systems of transportation, the supposedly backward and isolated Indian campesinos would rapidly become assimilated into the project of nation-building.Jacksonian fiction explores the role of the frontiersman in the process of Westward expansion. As imaged definitively in the figure of Leatherstocking, the frontiersman represents a necessary intermediate stage between Savagism and Civilization. In his many guises as hunter/trapper/scout, roarer, renegade, and Indian-hater, he is defined by the violence which he perpetrates. As a civilized man, we are to understand, his duty is to commit acts of civilized violence, in order to combat savage violence--which is indiscriminate, sadistic, and cannibalistic--and so to make the frontier safe for Civilization. When, in his guise as Indian-hater, the frontiersman commits an act of savage violence, it is seen as a necessary, if regrettable, measure of retributive justice. James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking saga celebrates the consummation of Manifest Destiny, while expressing an increasing ambivalence toward the violence that is the legacy of Civilized progress. In The Yemassee, William Gilmore Simms presents an unambivalent defense of slavery and imperialism, while in Nick of the Woods, Robert Montgomery Bird openly advocates racial violence.The fiction of cardenista Mexico, as exemplified by Gregorio Lopez y Fuentes' El indio, focuses on the social reformer's redemption of the degraded noble savage. While a few aspects of Indian culture are presented as more natural and therefore superior to corresponding aspects of urban Mexican culture, most are seen as deriving from ignorance, isolation, and cultural degradation. One cardenista writer, Ermilo Abreu Gomez, transcended this primitive/civilized paradigm to some extent by adopting a more critical attitude toward his own society and by introducing into indigenista fiction certain elements intrinsic to Indian culture: the oral tradition and revitalization movements. During the late 1950's, Rosario Castellanos further explored these phenomena, in addition to portraying the psychological and social dynamics of oppression in both Indian and Mexican societies. Also, Eraclio Zepeda drew extensively on the oral tradition of Indian and mestizo Chiapas in order to approximate Indian campesino consciousness from the inside in his collection of short stories, Benzulul. Still, few Mexican writers have been able to reject the most powerful component of the myth of Savagism, as defined by the writers of Jacksonian America; a pervasive element of Mexican indigenista fiction is the image of savage violence.

AU  - Nikolakaki, P.
T2  - PQDT - UK & Ireland
AB  - The work described in this Thesis, develops a theoretical framework for the development of a spatial woodland creation strategy as a response to habitat fragmentation.The study produced a methodology that used the best available landscape ecological knowledge to generate a set of rules that enabled the creation of a landscape plan. The choice of a target species (the woodland bird, Redstart), which is sensitive to fragmentation effects, allowed precise parameters to be worked out as a framework for the woodland strategy.Two contrasting landscape types with different woodland cover were chosen as case studies for evaluating the success of the re-instating of a woodland framework. The use of a Geographic Information System (GIS) was an indispensable tool for the application of the method.The strategy first identified woods with the highest chances of being occupied: these were considered to be "source" woods, which provided colonizers for local populations in the remaining woods. With regard to the colonization potential of existing sites in relation to the sources, small woods with a low degree of isolation were identified for further expansion so as to satisfy the minimum area requirement for redstarts. Woodland corridors were created to promote dispersal to the isolated woods. In addition , the strategy also suggested planting on degraded areas of urban fringes and colliery sites, so that both visual and ecological benefits would be delivered.

TI  - Pool -breeding amphibian habitat use and conservation in southern Maine's urbanizing landscapes
AU  - Baldwin, Robert Fritz
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Pool-breeding amphibians utilize both wetland and terrestrial habitats, and thus are vulnerable to the combined threats of wetland and terrestrial habitat loss. Habitat loss and degradation are extreme in urbanizing areas, and in the rapidly-developing northeastern United States, pool-breeding amphibians including the wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) face loss of isolated wetland breeding sites and fragmentation of forested non-breeding habitat. More information on the biology of the species and systematic approaches to conservation are needed to address these threats. To add to the pool-breeding amphibian habitat literature and develop conservation methods, I studied association between breeding population size at 87 seasonal forest pools, and habitat conditions at the aquatic, local (150m) and landscape (500m) spatial scales, in rapidly developing southern Maine. I examined migratory movements and post-breeding habitat selection by 43 wood frogs April–November 2003, using radiotelemetry, and conducted conservation gap and threat analyses. Breeding populations of wood frogs and spotted salamanders were greater in long-hydroperiod seasonal pools (≥18 weeks), in relatively isolated upland settings (2–5 neighboring pools). Spotted salamander breeding populations were higher when also associated with late-successional forest conditions (Tsuga canadensis, Fagus grandifolia co-dominance). Radiotracked wood frogs migrated 102–340m (median 169m) from breeding pools through forested uplands to neighboring forested wetlands where they spent the summer months. Within wetland macrohabitats, wood frogs selected non-aquatic, moist, shaded microhabitats, primarily utilizing leaf and sphagnum structures as daytime refugia. Conservation GAP and threat analysis at the region (multi-township) scale revealed that nearly half of potential breeding sites receive no protection, and 1.5% of pool-breeding amphibian habitat in the region (453 ha) is immediately threatened by projected human population expansion. Furthermore, National Wetland Inventory maps omit 55% of potential breeding pools (1.77/km2), and thus many pools may be threatened by a lack of remote detection during delineation. To prioritize conservation of pool-breeding amphibian habitat, we recommend identifying (a) landscapes with high habitat value that are threatened by development and within those, (b) high-quality breeding (i.e. intermediate-long hydroperiod seasonal pools) and non-breeding (i.e. forested) habitat. A method to incorporate wetland habitat connectivity using a context-specific GIS is suggested.

TI  - Nonstationary Flood Risk Assessment in Coastal Regions under Climate Change
AU  - Ghanbari, Mahshid
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Coastal cities are exposed to multiple flood drivers including high tide, storm surge, extreme rainfall, and high river flows. The occurrence of these flood drivers, either in isolation or in combination, can cause significant risk to property and human life. Climate change is placing greater pressure on coastal communities by increasing frequency and intensity of flood events through sea level rise (SLR) and more extreme rainfall and storm events. Therefore, effective adaptation strategies are essential to reduce future flood risk in exposed communities. The planning and implementation of effective adaptation strategies require a comprehensive understanding of future flood hazards and risks under future climate conditions and adaptation options. The overarching goal of this dissertation is to improve the capacity to understand, estimate and mitigate future flood hazards and risks in coastal areas under uncertain climate change. To achieve this goal, first, a nonstationary mixture probability model was developed that enables simultaneous characterization of minor and major flood events under future sea level conditions. The probability model was used to estimate minor and major flooding frequency at 68 locations along the coasts of the Contiguous United States (CONUS). The results showed a significant increase in frequency of both minor and major flood events under future sea level conditions. However, the frequency amplification of minor and major flooding varied by coastal regions. While regions in the Pacific and southeast Atlantic coast are likely to be exposed to higher frequency amplification in major flooding, the Gulf and northeast Atlantic coastal regions should expect the highest minor flood frequency amplification. Second, the proposed mixture probability model was employed in a flood risk assessment framework to enable assessing future acute and chronic coastal flood risks under different SLR and adaptation levels. The HAZUS-MH flood loss estimation tool was used to estimate property damage. The application of the framework in Miami-Dade County revealed that as sea level rises, chronic risks from repetitive nonextreme flooding may exceed acute risks from extreme floods. Third, a nonstationary bivariate flood hazard assessment method was developed that enables estimation of future frequency of compound coastal-riverine flooding with consideration of impacts of climate change including SLR and variations in extreme river flows. The proposed method was employed at 26 paired tidal-riverine stations along the CONUS coast. Specifically, the joint return period of compound major coastal-riverine flooding, defined based on flood impact thresholds, was explored by mid-century. The results showed that under current climate conditions the northeast Atlantic and western part of the Gulf coasts are exposed to the highest compound major coastal-riverine flood probability. However, considering future SLR, emerging high compound major flooding probability was evident in the southeast Atlantic coast. The impact of changes in extreme river flows was found to be negligible in most of the locations. Finally, four stormwater intervention scenarios including gray (i.e., conventional centralized conveyance systems and water treatment plants) and green (i.e., decentralized infiltration measures) infrastructure systems, were assessed in New York City (NYC). The results revealed that in developed and urbanized cities like NYC, green systems should not be considered as a substitute for gray systems. Complementary benefits on flood and combined sewer outflow (CSO) reduction can be gained through integration of green and gray systems.

TI  - Phylogeny, systematics and biogeography of short-tailed opossums (Didelphidae: Monodelphis)
AU  - Pavan, Silvia Eliza D'Oliveira
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Short-tailed opossums (genus  Monodelphis) comprise the most species-rich genus of New World marsupials, with 25 currently recognized species. Monodelphis comprise small, terrestrial species collectively widespread in South America, which makes the group potentially informative about biogeographic processes that have shaped the continental fauna. The genus exhibits striking variation in several phenotypic characters, notably pelage coloration, behavior, and reproductive strategies. This diversity is unique among Neotropical marsupials, and makes the group particularly interesting to investigate the evolution and the adaptive significance of phenotypic trait variation. Despite this potential, missing knowledge on phylogeny and basic taxonomy precludes broader studies on evolution and biogeography on this group. To remedy this situation this thesis is centered on undertaking a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis and taxonomic revision of Monodelphis.In chapter one (published in collaboration with Dr. Sharon A. Jansa and Dr. Robert S. Voss) we present the first phylogenetic analyses of  Monodelphis based on dense taxonomic sampling—23 of the 25 currently recognized species—and multiple genes—one mitochondrial gene (CYTB), two autosomal exons (IRBP, BRCA1), one autosomal intron (SLC38), and one X-linked intron (OGT). Parsimony, maximum-likelihood and Bayesian analyses of this dataset (110 terminals, 4983 aligned sites) strongly support the monophyly of Monodelphis and recover six major clades within the genus. Additionally, the analyses suggest that several nominal taxa are synonyms of other species in the genus (M. “sorex”  of M. dimidiata, M. “theresa” of  M. scalops, M. “rubida” and M. “umbristriata”  of M. americana, and M. “maraxina”  of M. glirina). By contrast, four unnamed genetic lineages recovered by the analyses may represent new species. Reconstructions of ancestral states of two discrete characters—dorsal pelage color pattern and habitat—suggest that the most recent common ancestor of  Monodelphis was uniformly colored (with unpatterned dorsal pelage) and inhabited moist forest. Whereas most dorsal pelage patterns (e.g., reddish sides and reddish head-and-rump) appear to have evolved homoplastically in  Monodelphis, dorsal stripes may have had a unique historical origin in this genus. In chapter two (also published in collaboration with Dr. Sharon A. Jansa and Dr. Robert S. Voss) we infer historical-biogeographic patterns and processes in South America based on estimated divergence times and ancestral distributions for this diverse clade of marsupials. The dating analysis suggests that the diversification of Monodelphis was not restricted to a narrow time interval, such that speciation cannot be attributed to a single causal historical factor. In particular, speciation within the Atlantic Forest biome appears to have occurred in the Neogene, whereas most Amazonian speciation events are Pleistocenic. Amazonia and the Atlantic Forest hosted most of the diversification events in Monodelphis and were estimated as the historical sources of lineages that subsequently colonized other areas (e.g., Tepuis, Andes, Cerrado) during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. Model selection suggests an important role for founder-event speciation, a process seldom accounted for in previous biogeographic analyses of continental clades. These results, together with others recently reported from analyses of South American datasets suggest that dispersal-mediated cladogenesis has been an important process in the evolution of Neotropical vertebrate faunas. Possible mechanisms for founder-event speciation in low-vagility terrestrial vertebrates such as Monodelphis include historically transient connections between currently disjunct biomes and rapid reproductive isolation of populations colonizing adjacent but ecologically disparate biomes. In the following chapter (to be published in collaboration with Dr. Robert S. Voss), an integrative approach—phylogenetic information together with phenotypic data from external and craniodental morphology—is used to provide a revised subgeneric classification of Monodelphis,  intended to serve as the basis for future revisionary research at the species level. Over 2000 specimens of Monodelphis were analyzed for morphology, including representative material of all species currently recognized as valid, together with all undescribed forms discussed in the previous chapters. Discrete characters found to be useful for diagnosing monophyletic groups of species previously established by molecular research are defined and illustrated. Five subgenera are formally recognized, for which morphological diagnosis, comparisons, and patterns of geographical distribution and sympatry are provided. In chapter four, a paper (already published) describing a new species of Monodelphis from Atlantic Forest in Brazil is presented.

TI  - How Street Features and Lighting Affect Neighborhood Walkability
AU  - Zhang, Xin
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Research has attempted to measure, evaluate, and improve the walkability of streets in neighborhoods. Such studies have found walkability and walking behavior associated with density, diversity, travel distance, design (connectivity and infrastructure), and destination accessibility (referred to as the 5Ds) at macro level and environmental aesthetics at micro (or street) level. Because most studies have been cross-sectional or correlational studies, it is worth doing controlled experiments to test effects of street features on walkability. This dissertation combines walking preference (intention to walk) and aesthetic preferences as a measure of perceived walkability in built environments. It aimed to 1) model the potential effects of selected street characteristics on perceived walkability; 2) find the effects of building styles that convey environmental meanings on perceived walkability; and 3) find effects of lighting modes and enclosure (or openness) on walkability after dark. In the long-term, the approach and findings can point to practical and low-cost measures to stimulate walking in various neighborhood.The dissertation included four studies (one correlational study and three experiments). The first two set up the later studies. A correlational study sought to identify salient groupings of visual properties of streets for walkability. Using t-tests and multivariate analyses, it identified five clusters of attributes that pedestrians perceived as similar to one another for walking choices, as well as the critical ones among those that one could easily manipulate. The remaining studies used 3D models in SketchUp and Vray to create virtual desk-top simulations of streets. The second study sought to identify meanings associated with five street types by building style or type (Tudor and Farm styles, Tudor and Colonial styles, Mediterranean and Saltbox styles, Multi-stories with Traditional styles, and Multi-stories with Modern styles). It had 147 respondents (107 women and 40 men) and used non-parametric analyses to test the perceived desirability, friendliness and social status of the streets. Respondents gave the most favorable scores to the streets with Tudor and Farm or Tudor and Colonial, and they gave the lowest scores to streets with multi-story houses.The two main studies used controlled experiments to test the effect of the physical attributes of streets on perceived walkability. The first experiment used the results from the second study to test the effects of building styles on perceived walkability during the day. It also tested three other attributes identified as salient in the first study: greenery, number of street elements and street enclosure (or openness) selected from the first study. This experiment had 236 participants (156 women, 78 men and 2 unknown). The mixed effect model of the four variables and perceived walkability in daylight found that greenery, traffic controls (signs and crosswalks), street furniture, the preferred building styles, and enclosure each had a positive effect on perceived walkability. The second experiment tested effects of lighting modes (overhead or peripheral, uniform or non-uniform) and enclosure on perceived walkability after dark. It had 186 participants (117 women, 68 men and 1 unknown). The mixed effect model and three ANOVAs found that uniform lighting and overhead lighting had positive effects alone and in combination on perceived walkability. Two logistic regressions analyzed the socio-demographical differences that women and older adults are more sensitive to street characteristics for walking during the daytime and after dark than did men and the younger.For planners, the finding of five cluster suggests that improving one feature in a cluster might achieve the similar effects to improving any of the others. The results from the experiments offer some practical steps communities can take to improve walkability. The addition of trees, better enclosure, traffic safety cues, and overhead and uniform lighting may well make streets more attractiveness for walking. Future research can test how well the verbal measures apply to on-site walkability and how well the findings apply to other kinds of manipulations, other kinds of streets, locations, and populations.

AU  - Wang, Juan
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorAlgae, also called spore-producing plants or thallus plants, are living an autotrophic life with chlorophyll. They have no real root, stem and leaf differentiation, with single-cell zygote or spores to propagate. Algae can survive in a very wide range environment, from the tropics to the poles, cold mountains to hot springs, whether in rivers, lakes and oceans, or in water and shortly damp places, algae are almost everywhere. Although Algae have potential resistance-related genetic resources, there are few studies on the diversity and resistance of algae of alkali spot soil in northeast China. In present study, we selected alkali spot soil in Anda City, Heilongjiang Province as the algae research plots. In addition, we selected garden nursery soil in Northeast Forestry University as the control. With streak plating method, we isolated 30 algae species eventually, 29 of which had been purified. After resistance screening of 29 algae species by NaCl stress, Na2CO3 stress and NaHCO3 stress, we found their growth conditions were different from each other at different stress or different stress concentration gradient. Algae species of alkali spot soil showed stronger resistance than those of nursery soil. Moreover, some algae were strongly inhibited by lower concentration of sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate, but some were promoted. In order to further investigate the resistance characters of algae species of alkali spot soil, six typical algae species of alkali spot soil were selected for growth assay, with an algal of nursery soil as the control. After treated with different concentrations of NaCl, Na2CO3, NaHCO3, Sorbitol, H2O2 and pH stress, the seven algae species showed different resistance characters, among which JB19 is the strongest, followed by JB6. Although CK6 is similar with JB6 and JB19 in morphology, it showed great different resistance from them and weaker than the algae species of alkali spot soil in all kinds of abiotic stresses, except sorbitol and H2O2 stress, in which it was stronger than JB1, JB4 and JB10. Seven algae species are all adapt to grow in neutral or alkaline conditions. However, too acid or too alkaline conditions would inhibit their growth, or could even lead their death. The results of this study suggested that algae species of alkali spot soil are high resistant to a variety of stresses. The isolation and screening of special resistance-related algae species as the foundation of resistance-related genes have an important theoretical and practical significance on soil salinity remediation, ecological restoration and the promotion of resistance-related genetic engineering of

TI  - American Folk Attitudes Toward the Environment: A Preliminary Exploration
AU  - Wollner, Chester Shad
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - This study examines the relationship between man and his environment as exemplified in attitudes of the folk. It finds that in their environmental expressions the prevailing concern of the folk was survival, and that this was characteristic of the folklore of all groups. White farmers, Indians and slaves alike revealed in their songs, ballads, traditions, customs, beliefs and stories an acute awareness of the harshness and punishing ways of nature. The natural environment was a hostile, mean, cruel force in their lives, first and foremost.Second to survival was the almost equally strong theme of adjustment. Folklore stories, tall tales, yarns, boasts, witticisms, myths, legends, etc. reflect acceptance of the need to adjust to harsh environmental realities, or suffer disproportionately. All groups saw themselves as occupying a relatively fixed position in the biotic pyramid of land, air soil, to which they must adjust. This is an attitude which parallels modern ecological thinking in many ways. It is common to both mythical and authentic types of folk hero models.However, this is most true of pre-Columbian Indian myths, legends rituals and stories of creation and of planting and harvesting which symbolized the natural cycles of human existence. The Indian creation myths and traditions were ecological examples of the daily rituals of the life of the tribal people. Today the regionally diverse tribes often try to preserve their unique pre-industrial cultures in geographical isolation. Whether or not this is possible, their folklore contains much of potential value to modern American environmental and ecological thought and education.A third focus was upon the importance of the land, also prominent among all three groups. The land was a symbol of hope, peace, and endurance and represented the basic element upon which all Indian stories, legends, myths and traditions were erected. For slaves and free rural blacks it was also a place of refuge, and an ally against urban and industrial force which tempted with glittering but false promises. For white farmers it was the basis of a philosophy of rural life, as well as a promise of future prosperity and progress, through hard work, growth and development.The study concludes that folklore is a largely unused resource for American environmental education, full of color and interest for children, especially (but by no means exclusively) at the elementary level. Major values available for the teacher which are abundant in readily accessible published folklore collections, include love of the beauties of nature in these United States, patriotic pride in the courage with which ethnically varied Americans came to terms with frontier dangers, and the need for even a highly industrialized society to conserve its resources and preserve its rich endowment of scenery and wildlife for the continued pleasure of future citizens.

TI  - Robust algorithms for estimating vehicle movement from motion sensors within smartphones
AU  - Ustun, Ilyas
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - Building sustainable traffic control solutions for urban streets (e.g., eco-friendly signal control) and highways requires effective and reliable sensing capabilities for monitoring traffic flow conditions so that both the temporal and spatial extents of congestion are observed. This would enable optimal control strategies to be implemented for maximizing efficiency and for minimizing the environmental impacts of traffic. Various types of traffic detection systems, such as inductive loops, radar, and cameras have been used for these purposes. However, these systems are limited, both in scope and in time. Using GPS as an alternative method is not always viable because of problems such as urban canyons, battery depletion, and precision errors. In this research, a novel approach has been taken, in which smartphone low energy sensors (such as the accelerometer) are exploited. The ubiquitous use of smartphones in everyday life, coupled with the fact that they can collect, store, compute, and transmit data, makes them a feasible and inexpensive alternative to the mainstream methods. Machine learning techniques have been used to develop models that are able to classify vehicle movement and to detect the stop and start points during a trip. Classifiers such as logistic regression, discriminant analysis, classification trees, support vector machines, neural networks, and Hidden Markov models have been tested. Hidden Markov models substantially outperformed all the other methods. The feature quality plays a key role in the success of a model. It was found that, the features which exploited the variance of the data were the most effective. In order to assist in quantifying the performance of the machine learning models, a performance metric called Change Point Detection Performance Metric (CPDPM) was developed. CPDPM proved to be very useful in model evaluation in which the goal was to find the change points in time series data with high accuracy and precision. The integration of accelerometer data, even in the motion direction, yielded an estimated speed with a steady slope, because of factors such as phone sensor bias, vibration, gravity, and other white noise. A calibration method was developed that makes use of the predicted stop and start points and the slope of integrated accelerometer data, which achieves great accuracy in estimating speed. The developed models can serve as the basis for many applications. One such field is fuel consumption and CO2 emission estimation, in which speed is the main input. Transportation mode detection can be improved by integrating speed information. By integrating Vehicle (Phone) to Infrastructure systems (V2I), the model outputs, such as the stop and start instances, average speed along a corridor, and queue length at an intersection, can provide useful information for traffic engineers, planners, and decision makers.

TI  - Tracking Antibiotic Resistance From Hospital Effluents to the Surrounding Environment
AU  - Varela, Ana Rita Boura
T2  - PQDT - Global
AB  - Over the last decades the environment has received particular attention regarding its role on the dissemination of antibiotic resistance of clinical relevance. Hospital and municipal wastewater, where antibiotic residues and resistant bacteria are discharged, are among the most obvious reservoirs. However, their role on the resistance dissemination is still poorly understood. The primary goal of this study was to assess the role of hospital effluent in the dissemination of antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes in the environment. The focuses of the study were a hospital effluent and the wastewater of the receiving urban wastewater treatment plant. Multivariate analyses based on the variation of the composition of the bacterial communities and prevalence of antibiotic resistant culturable populations in function of variations on the concentration of antibiotic and metal residues were performed in order to search for possible correlations among these variables. The significant positive correlations observed were a possible indication that the presence of the analyzed chemical contaminants could be associated with rearrangements of the bacterial communities or selection of resistant populations in wastewater, mainly in hospital effluent. The potential of hospital and municipal wastewater as environmental reservoirs of antibiotic resistance was, thus, further investigated, using quinolone resistant Escherichia coli as model. A group of quinolone resistant E. coli strains representative of sampling events from municipal and hospital wastewater and urban streams, spanning a period of nine years, was selected. The genetic diversity of these strains was assessed based on multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and this information was compared with data on the isolates regarding the presence of genetic determinants associated with quinolone and with other resistance-associated traits. In this way, it was possible to infer about the occurrence of vertical and/or horizontal resistance dissemination. The MLST-based studies showed that strains from different types of water and isolation dates clustered together, suggesting not only the ubiquitous character of some lineages but also their persistence in aquatic environments. The indication of vertical resistance dissemination that these data suggested was confirmed by the fact that quinolone resistance was mostly chromosome-based. However, acquired genetic determinants of resistance to quinolones, to beta-lactams and plasmid replicons, found in the different E. coli lineages and origins, suggested that these bacteria play an important role on the horizontal transfer of resistance in aquatic environments. Indeed, some of these determinants were observed to be located in conjugative mobile genetic elements. At this stage, the question was if the same lineages and genes found in E. coli from aquatic environments could be found in other habitats. The same approach, applied to an extended set of isolates from different origins, showed that the same lineages could be found also in hospital patients and urban gulls, although not in birds of the prey from a natural reserve, suggesting that at least some E. coli bacterial lineages can be disseminated among the human-impacted environments. While E. coli is an human and animal commensal species, the study of an environmental bacterial group not associated with humans was also of interest and Aeromonas spp. were the choice, and, as a common point, quinolone resistant strains were selected. Surprisingly, in spite of the loose association with humans, Aeromonas spp. from hospital effluent showed higher antibiotic resistance prevalence among them than those from urban wastewater. The role of members of this species as vectors of resistance dissemination was evidenced in different ways. First, Aeromonas spp. from hospital effluent were found to harbor a beta-lactamase gene not previously described in Aeromonas spp. or outside the clinical settings. Second, they harbored acquired quinolone resistance genes that showed either ubiquitous distribution or a non-clinical origin, both interesting tools for source tracking surveys. Third, some of their antibiotic resistance genes could be transferred to an E. coli receptor via conjugation. Aeromonas spp. were confirmed as relevant carries of resistance and the hospital can be an important source for members of this genus. Conjugation and the effect of sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics are two key issues in the understanding of the dissemination of antibiotic resistance, herein investigated based on a multidrug resistant E.coli isolate from hospital effluent. While a sub-inhibitory concentration of ceftazidime was observed to significantly increase the conjugation rate, tetracycline had the opposite effect. The conjugative plasmidome, which on average was transferred in more than 90% of the assays, included genes putatively associated with persistence, resistance to antibiotics and to metals, suggesting the importance co-selection phenomena. The hospital effluent was therefore confirmed as a significant source of antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance determinants to the environment.

TI  - Insular biogeography of breeding passerines in southern Ontario woodlots: A rigorous test for faunal collapse
AU  - Schmiegelow, Fiona Katrina Anne
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - I used a broad-scale contemporary distribution data base, the Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas,to estimate the pristine species-area curve for forest passerines within the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forest region, for comparison to the current species-area curve for forest passerines (songbirds) in 24 woodlots (0.30 to 73.6 ha) in Wellesley Township, Ontario, in 1989. I also measured habitat structure, configuration and isolation of the woodlots to test whether these variables accounted for variation in species richness independent of area. The slope estimate for the relationship in woodlots (0.48) was significantly higher than that estimated for the pristine relationships (0.12); the intercept for the woodlots (0.57) was significantly lower than that for the pristine relationship (1.16). These results indicate that some collapse of forest passerines has taken place in woodlots in Wellesley Township. No other woodlot characteristics accounted for additional variation in species richness in the woodlots independent of area alone.The approach I present reduces the risk of committing either Type I or Type II errors and provides a more rigorous means of identifying those areas that have undergone faunal collapse and predicting those at risk.

TI  - Juvenile coho salmon habitat utilization and distribution in a suburban watershed: The Salmon River (Langley, British Columbia)
AU  - Giannico, Guillermo Roberto
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - I investigated juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) distribution and habitat utilization in an agricultural/urban watershed, the Salmon River, Langley, B.C. The results of my empirical work confirmed the importance of instream woody debris and undercut banks in coho distribution. I examined experimentally how juvenile coho select among patches that differ in foraging profitability and in cover availability. Ideal free distribution (IFD) models were used as the practical basis for hypotheses about habitat choice by coho salmon. My experiments were conducted in artificial stream channels and involved two different types of cover, instream and overhead, and two spatial scales. The two scales (patches within individual pools and pools within stream reaches) were used to detect the effect of different levels of sampling and information processing by the fish. Juvenile coho responded positively to food abundance both within and between pools, but they did not do it as predicted by the IFD model. Cover presence further deviated coho distribution from an IFD. Within pools, coho foraged in open patches away from cover, but preferred pools with cover when choosing between separate units. None of the alternative dispersion models that I considered, derived from the IFD, fully explained the observed dispersion patterns. Coho's ability to maximize food intake rate was not only affected by the physical complexity of their habitat, but also by intraspecific competition and interference. Subsequently, I investigated experimentally coho's response to food and different densities of woody debris in natural stream reaches. If food was abundant, coho favoured pools with sparse cover, which offers accessible refuge and leaves unobstructed foraging patches where prey and perhaps also predators are easy to detect. Pools with either high densities or total lack of woody debris attracted to proportionately less fish. Earlier in the summer, fry were indifferent towards cover, but as they became older their association with instream woody debris increased. Experiments I conducted during winter indicated that velocity and temperature affected juvenile coho downstream movement. The proportion of fish that tried to leave the experimental channel increased with water discharge and decreased with water temperature.Based on the results of my empirical and experimental work, and on information derived from comparative case studies, I evaluated the potential impact of agriculture and urbanization on coho salmon habitat. Activities associated with these types of land developments tend to: (a) reduce stream channel complexity; (b) eliminate off-channel fish habitat; (c) increase both the magnitude and the frequency of peak flows; (d) augment water sediment transport; (e) alter riparian vegetation; and, (f) degrade water quality.A multilayered management plan, aimed at increasing coho salmon production, was developed. The plan's management strategies were devised reflecting on the different spatial scales that watershed components have and on the connectivity processes that exist among them.

TI  - Conservative Baptists in Mid-Passage: The Study of a Movement; Its Growth & Self-Understanding, Its Present Crisis of Uncertainty
AU  - HEDLUND, ROGER EUGENE
T2  - ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
AB  - The Conservative Baptist Association of America, its related institutions and agencies, constitute an ecclesiastical entity of 200,000 to 300,000 members. The present study is a sociological and historical perspective. The intent is to discover reasons for non-growth and to suggest possible solutions. The Conservative Baptist Movement is the product of the fundamentalist-modernist controversy as well as the more remote movements of revival and American frontier religion. Certain characteristics result. As a believer the Conservative Baptist is a biblicist. The Conservative Baptist minister is thought of primarily as preacher. The layman exercises the role of servant, frequently outside his denomination. A Conservative Baptist congregation embodies the general qualities of American evangelicalism a chief concern of which is evangelism.The prime Conservative Baptist objectives are evangelism and church growth. Present evangelistic efforts, however, are not producing significant growth. Few new churches have been planted in recent years.Performance is tested in the city. Conservative Baptists with other evangelicals have frequently fled the city. Their orientation to mission, however, demands expression in feelings of compassion for the world near at hand as well as for that farther away. Diagnosis shows that Conservative Baptists have fallen behind other denominations in their rate of growth. While others (Baptists and non-Baptists, evangelicals and non-evangelicals) increase, Conservative Baptists are stagnant. In Southern California, for instance, there has been no real growth over the past decade. There has been a dangerous trend toward isolation, nominality and consolidation. Finally it is proposed that Conservative Baptists cure their malaise by utilizing their God-given resources in a deliberate project of renewal through evangelistic outreach.
