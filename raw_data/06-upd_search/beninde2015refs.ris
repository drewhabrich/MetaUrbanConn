TI  - Habitat associations and breeding bird community composition within the city of Bristol, UK
PY  - 2010
AB  - Capsule Different urban breeding bird communities are associated with different habitat types, but, although community species diversity varies significantly, total bird density does not. Aims To investigate the association between breeding bird communities and habitats within Bristol, UK and how these communities vary in terms of species diversity and total bird abundance. Methods Breeding density data for 70 species in the metropolitan area of Bristol, UK were subjected to de‐trended correspondence analysis to identify the number of different communities present and their indicator species. These data were then used to identify patterns of habitat association with each community and differences in species richness and total bird density. Results Three communities were identified: a rural community associated with woodland, managed grassland and inland water; a suburban community associated with buildings and residential gardens; and an intermediate community that shared some of these habitat characteris...

TI  - Microbats in a 'leafy' urban landscape are they persisting, and what factors influence their presence?
PY  - 2010
AB  - Urbanization is an extreme form of habitat modification, but retention of native vegetation in bushland reserves may improve the ecological sustainability of cities. We focused on bats (Microchiroptera) and investigated the use of the urban matrix and surrounding bushland in a region of Sydney, Australia, where remnant bushland persists and gardens often support large trees. Ultrasonic surveys were conducted at 40 sites over one summer season in the backyard matrix, bushland remnants and surrounding National Parks to determine which species were present, and the influence of landscape elements and habitat characteristics on activity, species richness and presence of individual species. In total, 15 of the 17 microbat species known from the Sydney region were recorded in the study area. Yet only three of these species, Chalinolobus gouldii, Mormopterus species 2 and Miniopterus schreibersii were present in more than 40% of sites. Bat activity was significantly higher in remnant bushland on shale soils and in backyards, compared with sandstone gully and ridge remnants, or reference sites in nearby National Parks. Furthermore, species assemblages in urban areas were different from assemblages in reference sites. Of all the habitat characteristics examined, the amount of bushland within 0.5–3 km surrounding a site and tree density were the most common predictors of individual species presence, particularly rare species. Area of bushland, hollow abundance and average tree diameter were positively correlated with species richness, while tree diameter was the strongest predictor of total microbat activity. The proximity of large areas of bushland and the many trees remaining in residential areas of the northern ‘leafy’ suburbs of Sydney allowed the persistence of a range of bat species. The higher bat activity on fertile shale soils indicated that bushland remnants embedded within cities can have high conservation value for bats. Surveys in more urbanized areas of Sydney are needed to test predictions of the models derived in this study.

TI  - Changing Bee and Hoverfly Pollinator Assemblages along an Urban-Rural Gradient
PY  - 2011
AB  - Background The potential for reduced pollination ecosystem service due to global declines of bees and other pollinators is cause for considerable concern. Habitat degradation, destruction and fragmentation due to agricultural intensification have historically been the main causes of this pollinator decline. However, despite increasing and accelerating levels of global urbanization, very little research has investigated the effects of urbanization on pollinator assemblages. We assessed changes in the diversity, abundance and species composition of bee and hoverfly pollinator assemblages in urban, suburban, and rural sites across a UK city. Methodology/Principal Findings Bees and hoverflies were trapped and netted at 24 sites of similar habitat character (churchyards and cemeteries) that varied in position along a gradient of urbanization. Local habitat quality (altitude, shelter from wind, diversity and abundance of flowers), and the broader-scale degree of urbanization (e.g. percentage of built landscape and gardens within 100 m, 250 m, 500 m, 1 km, and 2.5 km of the site) were assessed for each study site. The diversity and abundance of pollinators were both significantly negatively associated with higher levels of urbanization. Assemblage composition changed along the urbanization gradient with some species positively associated with urban and suburban land-use, but more species negatively so. Pollinator assemblages were positively affected by good site habitat quality, in particular the availability of flowering plants. Conclusions/Significance Our results show that urban areas can support diverse pollinator assemblages, but that this capacity is strongly affected by local habitat quality. Nonetheless, in both urban and suburban areas of the city the assemblages had fewer individuals and lower diversity than similar rural habitats. The unique development histories of different urban areas, and the difficulty of assessing mobile pollinator assemblages in just part of their range, mean that complementary studies in different cities and urban habitats are required to discover if these findings are more widely applicable.

TI  - Factors Shaping a Breeding Bird Community Along an Urbanization Gradient: 26-year Study in Medium Size City (Lublin, SE Poland)
PY  - 2011
AB  - We investigated the spatiotem- poral dynamics of a breeding bird community in the urbanized landscape of Lublin city (150 km2, 0.5 million inhabitants, SE Poland). We conducted 211 separate territory mapping surveys during 26 years (1982–2007) in 24 green areas (0.2–30.1 ha in size), distributed along an urbanization gradient. We recorded a total of 16,151 territories of 65 species. According to the estimated species richness, we detected all the species present in the studied plots. the three species community indices (species richness, Shannon-Wiener index and abundance – number of breeding pairs in census plot) increased with increasing tree stand age and area of the site, while it decreased as the proportion of biologically inactive areas increased. the three indices showed significant negative trends as the study period progressed. the mean decreasing rate was 0.2 species and 2.3 territories per year. Distance to the city centre and understorey cover negatively affected bird abundance, while they positively affected species richness and the shannon index. tree stand age seems to be the most important of the three indices among the analyzed explanatory variables. Our results show that the diversity of breeding avifauna in an ur- banized landscape can be significantly shaped by the proper management of vegetation and size of green areas in the city. the long term decline of the three diversity indices seems to be the most important outcome of our study and requires further research and monitoring

TI  - Forest Fragment and Breeding Habitat Characteristics Explain Frog Diversity and Abundance in Singapore
PY  - 2010
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation can have severe negative and irreversible effects on biodiversity. We investigated the effects of forest fragmentation on frog diversity in Singapore because of its high rates of deforestation and the demonstration that frogs are some of the most sensitive species to habitat degradation. We surveyed frog species in 12 forest fragments varying from 11 to 935 ha. We compared differences in species richness, abundance, and Shannon’s index in relation to forest fragment size, connectivity (distance between fragments), and breeding habitat heterogeneity. A total of 20 species from 12 genera and five families were encountered in 12 fragments. Larger fragments and those closer to larger fragments had higher species richness. Abundance, however, was not correlated with forest area or connectivity, but we found fewer individual frogs in the larger fragments. We also found that breeding habitat heterogeneity best explained frog species diversity and abundance in forest fragments. Fragments with a high diversity of breeding habitats had more species. We found no evidence to suggest that abundance and diversity are strongly correlated, particularly in disturbed areas, but that breeding habitat heterogeneity is an under-appreciated factor that should be considered when prioritizing areas for anuran conservation. Enriching breeding habitat heterogeneity, creating corridors between fragments, and reforesting degraded areas are some of the most beneficial strategies for preserving urban frog biodiversity.

TI  - Effects of urban sprawl on snags and the abundance and productivity of cavity-nesting birds
PY  - 2005
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>We investigated the occurrence of, and relationships among, snags and cavity-nesting birds in the rapidly urbanizing region around Seattle, Washington in 2001 and 2002. We measured the density of snags in 49 sites (1-km2 “suburban landscapes” that included built and forested portions), and determined the diameter, height, decay status, and species of individual snags. We spot-mapped territories and observed nests of cavity-nesting birds at a stratified, random subsample of 13 sites. Snags, especially red alder (Alnus rubra), were abundant in sites' forested portions, but rare in the built portions. Snag density was positively correlated with density of live trees. Snags in built versus forested portions were similar in all attributes except decay, which was more advanced in forested areas. In the oldest suburbs (60–80 years old), snags in forested portions were larger, more decayed, and more likely to have broken tops than those in younger suburbs (2–20 years old). Cavity-nesting bird species richness and equity of individuals per species was highest in suburban landscapes where remaining forest was not fragmented, but adjacent to highly intermixed urban and urban-forest land covers. Suburban landscapes with highly interspersed land covers had higher densities of Black-capped Chickadees (Poecile atricapillus), Red-breasted Nuthatches (Sitta canadensis), Northern Flickers (Colaptes auratus) and Downy Woodpeckers (Picoides pubescens); suburban landscapes with higher percentages of forest had higher densities of Brown Creepers (Certhia americana), Chestnut-backed Chickadees (Poecile rufescens), Pileated (Dryocopus pileatus) and Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides villosus). Red-breasted Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus ruber) densities were positively correlated only with the density of snags. All study sites had low bird densities compared to wildlands, presumably due to the relative lack of live trees and snags. Cavity-nesting birds bred successfully in all landscapes; seven of the nine species produced fledglings in &gt;50% of their nesting attempts. Snags important for nesting were larger in diameter, taller, and more decayed than expected based on availability. Snags with active nests also had evidence of previous use, fungal conks, broken tops, and substantial bark.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>Efectos de la Expansión Urbana sobre la Abundancia y la Productividad de Aves que Nidifican en Cavidades</jats:p>
               <jats:p>Resumen. Durante el 2001 y 2002, investigamos la presencia de, y la relación entre, troncos muertos y aves que nidifican en cavidades en los alrededores de Seattle (Washington), una región que está urbanizándose rápidamente. Medimos la densidad de troncos en 49 sitios (1-km2 de “paisajes suburbanos” que incluyeron ambientes edificados y bosques) y determinamos el diámetro, altura, estado de descomposición y especie de troncos individuales. Mapeamos los territorios mediante registros puntuales y observamos los nidos de aves que nidifican en cavidades en una sub-muestra estratificada y al azar de 13 sitios. Los troncos, especialmente de Alnus rubra, fueron abundantes en las áreas con bosque, pero raros en las áreas edificadas. La densidad de troncos se correlacionó positivamente con la densidad de árboles vivos. Los troncos de las áreas edificadas y de las áreas con bosque fueron similares en todos sus atributos excepto en su descomposición, que fue más avanzada en los sitios boscosos. En los suburbios más viejos (60–80 años), los troncos en las áreas con bosque fueron más grandes, estuvieron más descompuestos y presentaron mayor probabilidad de tener sus extremos rotos que aquellos presentes en los suburbios más nuevos (2–20 años). La riqueza de especies que nidifican en cavidades y la equitatividad de individuos por especie fueron mayores en los paisajes suburbanos donde el bosque remanente no estaba fragmentado, sino adyacente a coberturas con una gran mezcla de sitios urbanos y sitios en la transición bosque-ciudad. Los paisajes suburbanos con coberturas ampliamente entremezcladas presentaron mayores densidades de Poecile atricapillus, Sitta canadensis, Colaptes auratus y Picoides pubescens; los paisajes suburbanos con porcentajes más altos de bosque presentaron mayores densidades de Certhia americana, Poecile rufescens, Dryocopus pileatus y Picoides villosus. Las densidades de Sphyrapicus ruber sólo se correlacionaron positivamente con la densidad de troncos. Todos los sitios de estudio tuvieron bajas densidades de aves comparados con áreas silvestres, debido presumiblemente a la carencia relativa de árboles vivos y troncos. Las aves que nidifican en cavidades criaron con éxito en todos los paisajes; siete de las nueve especies produjeron volantones en &gt;50% de sus intentos de nidificación. Los troncos importantes para nidificar fueron más grandes en diá metro y altura y estuvieron más descompuestos que lo esperado con relación a su disponibilidad. Los troncos con nidos activos también presentaron evidencias de uso previo, deformaciones producidas por hongos, copas rotas y bastante corteza.</jats:p>

TI  - Determinants of bird species richness in public green spaces
PY  - 2007
AB  - Capsule Bird species richness showed consistent positive correlations with site area and rough grass. Aim To determine those features of parks and other public green spaces that are of most importance in promoting bird species richness and to use this information to make recommendations for management of these areas. Methods Birds were counted in parks and other public green spaces within Greater London. Three survey visits were made in each of the periods summer 2002 and 2003 and winter 2002/03 and 2003/04. Habitat data were also collected. Results Site area was the most consistently significant variable related (positively) to total species richness. There were also positive effects of waterbodies and rough grass (including nettles and weed-rich areas). Species richness increased with a greater proportion of adjacent gardens in sites <1 ha in size. There were negative associations with the presence of buildings. When considered by species group (woodland species, farmland species and habitat generalists...

TI  - The influence of urban park characteristics on ant (Hymenoptera, Formicidae) communities
PY  - 2008
AB  - As rapid urbanization continues, existing natural areas within urban zones will play a critical role in safeguarding remaining biodiversity. Ants are an integral part of almost every terrestrial ecosystem, including urban environments, and understanding which environmental characteristics influence their persistence is critical. In this study, 24 protected natural areas within urban parks including mosaic, scrub, herbaceous and forest habitats were surveyed for ants with 563 pitfall traps. The data provide insights into the distribution and abundance of ant fauna in San Francisco natural areas, as well as which characteristics of parks have the most influence on ant community composition. A total of 2,068 ant individuals representing 15 species were collected. A regression analysis revealed that urban forests reduced ant richness and abundance and that there was little or no impact of the Argentine ant on native ants. Natural area size and shape were not important in explaining variations in overall ant species richness and abundance, with many smaller natural areas harboring ant populations that are just as diverse and robust as larger areas.

TI  - Contrasting patterns in species richness of birds, butterflies and plants along riparian corridors in an urban landscape
PY  - 2012
AB  - Aim Urbanization is a major driver of global land-use change, substantially modifying patterns of biodiversity. Managing these impacts has become a conservation priority. The creation and maintenance of greenways, such as river corridors, is frequently promoted as a strategy for mitigating habitat fragmentation in urban areas by bringing semi-natural habitat cover into city centres. However, there is little evidence to support this assertion. Here, we examine whether riparian zones maintain semi-natural habitat cover in urban areas and how species richness varies along such zones.

TI  - Habitat Fragmentation and Vertebrate Species Richness in an Urban-Environment
PY  - 1987
AB  - (1) Species of terrestrial mammals, reptiles and amphibians were surveyed in patches of semi-natural and disturbed vegetation within the City of Oxford. The patches were delimited by roads, walls or other artificial barriers, and ranged from 0 16 ha to 20 ha. (2) A total of twenty species of mammals was recorded, two to seventeen species occurring per patch. Mammalian species richness (the number of species) within patches decreased with increasing percentage of barren ground per patch, with proximity to buildings, and with patchiness in the total vegetation cover, but increased with increasing density of vegetation in the layer 21-50 cm above ground. (3) Five species of amphibians and four species of reptiles were recorded, zero to seven species occurring per patch. The richness of these taxa within patches increased with patch area, but declined away from sources of permanent water. (4) More species of mammals, amphibians and reptiles were retained in two small habitat patches than in one large patch equal to their combined area. (5) For mammals, excluding large species such as deer, species richness in the urban environment can be preserved by maintaining a system of small (>0 65 ha) patches of undisturbed woodland throughout the city area. The richness of reptiles and amphibians can probably be preserved by maintaining patches of )0 55 ha that provide permanent water.

TI  - Importance of reserve size and landscape context to urban bird conservation
PY  - 2004
AB  - We tested whether reserve size, landscape surrounding the reserve, and their interaction affect forest songbirds in the metropolitan area of Seattle, Washington (U.S.A.), by studying 29 reserves of varying size (small, medium, large) and surrounding urbanization intensity (urban, suburban, exurban). Larger reserves contained richer and less even bird communities than smaller reserves. These size effects disappeared when we removed the positive correlation of shrub diversity with reserve size, suggesting that greater habitat diversity in large reserves supported additional species, some of which were rare. Standardizing the number of individuals detected among all reserve size classes reversed the effect of size on richness in exurban landscapes and reduced the magnitude of the effect in suburban or urban landscapes. The latter change suggested that richness increased with reserve size in most landscapes because larger areas also supported larger samples from the regional bird species pool. Most bird species associated with native forest habitat (native forest species) and with human activity (synanthropic species) were present in reserves larger than 42 ha and surrounded by >40% urban land cover, respectively. Thus, we recommend these thresholds as means for conserving the composition of native bird communities in this mostly forested region. Native forest species were least abundant and synanthropic species most abundant in urban landscapes, where exotic ground and shrub vegetation was most common. Therefore, control of exotic vegetation may benefit native songbird populations. Bird nests in shrubs were most dense in medium (suburban) and large reserves (urban) and tended to be most successful in medium (suburban) and large reserves (exurban), potentially supplying another mechanism by which reserve size increased retention of native forest species.

TI  - Exotic invasive species in urban wetlands environmental correlates and implications for wetland management
PY  - 2008
AB  - Summary 1. Wetlands in urban regions are subjected to a wide variety of anthropogenic disturbances, many of which may promote invasions of exotic plant species. In order to devise management strategies, the influence of different aspects of the urban and natural environments on invasion and community structure must be understood. 2. The roles of soil variables, anthropogenic effects adjacent to and within the wetlands, and vegetation structure on exotic species occurrence within 21 forested wetlands in north-eastern New Jersey, USA, were compared. The hypotheses were tested that different vegetation strata and different invasive species respond similarly to environmental factors, and that invasion increases with increasing direct human impact, hydrologic disturbance, adjacent residential land use and decreasing wetland area. Canonical correspondence analyses, correlation and logistic regression analyses were used to examine invasion by individual species and overall site invasion, as measured by the absolute and relative number of exotic species in the site flora. 3. Within each stratum, different sets of environmental factors separated exotic and native species. Nutrients, soil clay content and pH, adjacent land use and canopy composition were the most frequently identified factors affecting species, but individual species showed highly individualistic responses to the sets of environmental variables, often responding in opposite ways to the same factor. 4. Overall invasion increased with decreasing area but only when sites > 100 ha were included. Unexpectedly, invasion decreased with increasing proportions of industrial/commercial adjacent land use. 5. The hypotheses were only partially supported; invasion does not increase in a simple way with increasing human presence and disturbance. 6. Synthesis and applications . The results suggest that a suite of environmental conditions can be identified that are associated with invasion into urban wetlands, which can be widely used for assessment and management. However, a comprehensive ecosystem approach is needed that places the remediation of physical alterations from urbanization within a landscape context. Specifically, sediment, inputs and hydrologic changes need to be related to adjoining urban land use and to the overlapping requirements of individual native and exotic species.

TI  - Avifaunal use of wooded streets in an urban landscape
PY  - 2000
AB  - Birds in urban landscapes primarily occupy parks ( forest fragments), wooded streets (linear strips connecting fragments), or the urban matrix. I studied the effects of street location in the landscape, vegeta- tion structure, and human disturbance (pedestrian and automobile load) within wooded streets on bird spe- cies richness, temporal persistence, and density of feeding and nesting guilds, and on the probability of street occupation by individual species in Madrid during two consecutive breeding seasons. The number of species recorded increased from the least suitable (control streets without vegetation) to the most suitable habitats (urban parks), with wooded streets being intermediate landscape elements. Fourteen species, belonging to four of the eight guilds identified in this system, were recorded in wooded streets in both years. Streets that connected urban parks, along with vegetation structure, positively influenced the number of species within wooded streets, species persistence, guild density, and probability of occupation of streets by individual spe- cies. Human disturbance exerted a negative influence on the same variables. Wooded streets potentially could function as corridors, allowing certain species—particularly those feeding on the ground and breeding in trees or tree holes—to fare well by supporting alternative habitat for feeding and nesting. Local improve- ments in corridor quality, through increased vegetation complexity and reduced human disturbance, could exert a positive influence on the regional connectivity of the system. Because of differential use of corridors by species with different habitat requirements, however, corridor implementation should also take into ac- count the target species of management.

TI  - Bird community composition patterns in urban parks of Madrid The role of age, size and isolation
PY  - 2000
AB  - This study intends to assess the influence of fragment age, size and isolation (from the regional species pool) on bird community composition patterns in urban parks in Madrid, and the role of local and regional factors on community structure. Park age was a good indicator of habitat complexity. Park age and area accounted for 62% of the variability in species richness, but two measures of isolation from the regional species pool were not included as significant factors. Species composition in urban parks showed a high degree of nestedness, which was associated with park age and area, but not with two measures of isolation from the regional species pool. The degree of nestedness increased with park age; the distribution of species varying from nested in old and mature parks to random in young parks. The incidence (% of species occurrence in parks) in young parks was correlated with regional densities, whereas in mature and old parks the incidence was correlated with local densities. In this urban landscape, species composition appears to be regulated by local factors (particularly in mature and old parks), such that species accumulate in an orderly (not random) fashion in relation to park age and area. Regional influences seem to be more pronounced only in young parks, which are mainly colonized by species from the regional species pool.

TI  - Bird diversity in a subtropical South-American City effects of noise levels, arborisation and human population density
PY  - 2011
AB  - Cities are highly modified environments in which the only areas that resemble natural landscapes are urban parks with low human population density. Attempts are frequently made to maintain high bird diversity in cities for aesthetic or educational reasons. However, it remains unclear whether local site characteristics are important in determining bird assemblage composition or whether simplification of the assemblage is an inevitable consequence of the changes associated with human population density. From May 1998 to December 1999, we undertook bird counts at 521 points in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. Our main goal was to understand the pattern of distribution of the bird species richness and density within the city and determine which variables most affect species assemblages. We recorded 132 species belonging to 43 families that are common in Rio Grande do Sul and obtained quantitative data on 121 species in survey sites. The two most abundant species (House Sparrow, Passer domesticus and Rock dove, Columba livia) were exotics. Analysis based on a reduced subset of 134 points surveyed in spring/early summer suggested that there was a North–south gradient in assemblage structure. Variation in assemblage structure was also affected by the number of trees, urban noise and human population density. However, human population density had a much smaller effect on richness and assemblage structure than variables subject to management, such as tree density and noise levels. These results suggest that complex communities may be maintained in densely populated urban areas of sub-tropical South-America given adequate urban planning.

TI  - Effect of landscape context on anuran communities in breeding ponds in the National Capital Region, Canada
PY  - 2007
AB  - Land cover change, predominantly habitat conversion to agricultural use and urbanization, has recently been recognized as the primary cause of biodiversity loss in terrestrial ecosystems. We evaluated the relative effects of urban and agricultural landscapes on anuran species richness and the abundance of six anuran species found at breeding ponds in and around the cities of Ottawa, Ontario and Gatineau, Quebec. We performed six call surveys at 29 permanent focal ponds surrounded by one of three landscape contexts: primarily urban, primarily agricultural, and primarily forested. We also measured three local pond variables to control for the effects of local habitat quality in our analyses. We found that anuran species richness was significantly lower in breeding ponds in urban landscapes compared to forested and agricultural landscapes, which exhibited no significant difference in species richness. The abundances of individual anuran species were also consistently lower in urban landscapes for all species except one, which exhibited no response to landscape type. Three species had their highest abundances in ponds in forested landscapes, whereas two species had their highest abundances in ponds in agricultural landscapes. We conclude that ponds embedded in urban landscapes support lower biodiversity than ponds in agricultural settings. We suggest that landscapes composed of a mosaic of forest and open habitats surrounding wetlands would hold the highest biodiversity of these species.

TI  - Multi-scaled habitat considerations for conserving urban biodiversity native reptiles and small mammals in Brisbane, Australia
PY  - 2010
AB  - The rapid expansion of the world’s urban population is a major driver of contemporary landscape change and ecosystem modification. Urbanisation destroys, degrades and fragments native ecosystems, replacing them with a heterogeneous matrix of urban development, parks, roads, and isolated remnant fragments of varying size and quality. This presents a major challenge for biodiversity conservation within urban areas. To make spatially explicit decisions about urban biodiversity conservation actions, urban planners and managers need to be able to separate the relative influence of landscape composition and configuration from patch and local (site)-scale variables for a range of fauna species. We address this problem using a hierarchical landscape approach for native, terrestrial reptiles and small mammals living in a fragmented semi-urban landscape of Brisbane, Australia. Generalised linear modelling and hierarchical partitioning analysis were applied to quantify the relative influence of landscape composition and configuration, patch size and shape, and local habitat composition and structure on the species’ richness of mammal and reptile assemblages. Landscape structure (composition and configuration) and local-scale habitat structure variables were found to be most important for influencing reptile and mammal assemblages, although the relative importance of specific variables differed between reptile and mammal assemblages. These findings highlight the importance of considering landscape composition and configuration in addition to local habitat elements when planning and/or managing for the conservation of native, terrestrial fauna diversity in urban landscapes.

TI  - Urban plant species patterns are highly driven by density and function of built-up areas
PY  - 2007
AB  - This paper aims to assess the relative importance of the type of built-up area in structuring plant species composition and richness in urbanised environments. The study was carried out in the city of Brussels where all vascular plant species were recorded in 189 grid cells of 1 km2 each. The effect of urban land use type on species composition was investigated using first Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Densely built-up area was the most powerful predictor for species composition, followed by industrial built-up areas, half open or open built-up areas with plantations, and open built-up areas with much natural vegetation in the surroundings. Indicator species were found for each type of built-up area and a response curve to the amount of built land was produced using Generalised Additive Modelling. Various types of built-up areas had different effects on environmental conditions as inferred by Ellenberg’s indicator values, as well as on the species richness, species rarity, number of exotic species and proportion of extinction-prone species. It is concluded that future ecological studies should not treat urban areas as homogeneous areas by combining all anthropogenic factors into one aggregated variable. Instead, the urban matrix should be categorised in subsystems as it is multidimensional and highly variable across space.

TI  - Promoting dragonfly diversity in cities: major determinants and implications for urban pond design
PY  - 2013
AB  - Urbanisation is increasing and it is essential to integrate biodiversity into the spatial planning of urban areas. This requires deeper understanding of biodiversity patterns in cities. We investigated which habitat variables are major determinants of dragonfly diversity and species assemblage structure in the municipal area of Dortmund (Germany). We sampled dragonfly larvae in 33 ponds situated in city parks, commercial, residential and agricultural areas. We recorded 30 autochthonous dragonfly species with species richness ranging from zero to 17. Additionally, we surveyed a set of environmental variables including habitat size, water level, pond structures and vegetation as well as surrounding landscape and potential disturbances like waterfowl and fish. Multivariate methods were used to identify the major determinants of dragonfly diversity, abundance and assemblage structure. Analysis indicated that diversity of aquatic and terrestrial vegetation affected dragonfly diversity positively. City park ponds had low diversity, but Ischnura elegans was obviously promoted by the specific park pond conditions, including high waterfowl density. We found five assemblages mostly determined by generalistic species which were related to different pond types. Moderately disturbed ruderal and pioneer ponds in residential and agricultural areas also contained increased numbers of rare species. Our results indicate that urban ponds may have a great value for maintaining biodiversity, but various disturbances have negative impact. To promote urban biodiversity we suggest a natural design of well-vegetated ponds as well as a high diversity of different pond types and particularly a more-natural redesign of city park ponds.

TI  - Effects of urban habitat fragmentation on common small mammals species versus communities
PY  - 2011
AB  - There is an increasing interest in understanding how species respond to the modifications of habitat attributes in urban areas. Patterns in the occurrence and abundance of small mammal communities in 15 isolated patches of remnant natural and semi-natural habitat of Porto Metropolitan Area (Portugal) were assessed against environmental characteristics (from both the patch and the surrounding matrix) of each patch using multiple regressions and canonical correspondence analysis. Four species of common small mammals were found: wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), greater white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula), Algerian mouse (Mus spretus) and house mouse (Mus musculus). Our results showed that both relative abundance and species richness were negatively affected by urbanization. The species richness also displayed a negative association with the increase of forest around the patch but relative abundance showed the opposite trend. At the species level, the relative abundance of A. sylvaticus and C. russula showed a negative association with urbanization. Our results reveal that these two species also benefit from a mosaic of habitats and pervious areas in the surrounding matrix. The relative abundance of M. spretus and M. musculus showed a negative effect of forest area around the patch. Understanding how the increase of urbanization affects small mammals will be particularly useful for the managers of urban landscapes, as these animals occupy a pivotal position in the ecosystems.

TI  - Local and landscape determinants of amphibian communities in urban ponds
PY  - 2011
AB  - Urbanization is currently responsible for widespread declines of amphibian populations globally through the loss, isolation, and degradation of habitat. However, it is not clear how urbanization affects amphibian communities at both local (pond) and landscape scales. We assessed the breeding distribution of frogs in ponds along an urban-rural gradient in Greater Melbourne, Australia, and examined community relationships with habitat quality and landscape context. We sampled frog larvae at 65 ponds on four separate occasions and collected data on local pond and landscape variables. Using Bayesian Poisson regression modeling we found that species richness decreased at ponds surrounded by high densities of human residents and at ponds with high water conductivity, whereas species richness increased substantially at ponds surrounded by a high proportion of green open space. Ordination of individual species presence-absence data by canonical correspondence analysis largely confirmed these findings. Ordination also highlighted the negative influences of pond shading and density of predatory fish, and the positive influence of aquatic vegetation, on community composition. Individual species' responses to urbanization varied. Urbanization had strong negative effects on species that were associated with well-vegetated, sunny, fish-free ponds. Our study highlights the importance of strategic management actions in urban landscapes to improve terrestrial habitat and connectivity around ponds and other wetlands, and local management actions to improve water quality, remove predatory fish, and plant aquatic vegetation at breeding sites.

TI  - Riparian bird community structure in Portland, Oregon Habitat, urbanization, and spatial scale patterns
PY  - 2003
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>In 1999, we surveyed breeding bird and plant communities along 54 streams in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan region to link bird community metrics with structural and spatial characteristics of urban riparian areas. Canonical correspondence analysis produced two explanatory axes relating to vegetation and road density. Total and non-native bird abundance was higher in narrow forests. Native bird abundance was greater in narrow forests surrounded by undeveloped lands; native species richness and diversity were greater in less-developed areas. Native resident and short-distance-migrant abundance was higher in narrow forests, and diversity was positively associated with developed lands. Neotropical migrant abundance, richness, and diversity were greater in open-canopied areas with fewer roads. We examined spatial relationships by regressing bird variables on satellite-derived forest canopy cover, area of undeveloped lands, and street density in a series of 50-m buffers within a 500-m radius around study sites. Non-native bird abundance decreased with increasing canopy cover within 450 m, but most other relationships were strongest at smaller scales (50–100 m). Our results suggest that increasing urban canopy cover is the most valuable land management action for conserving native breeding birds. A hierarchical scheme for Neotropical migrant conservation might include increasing forest canopy within 450 m of streams to control non-native species and cowbirds; reducing street density within a 100-m radius of streams; and conserving or planting onsite native trees and shrubs.</jats:p>

               <jats:p>Resumen. Censamos las comunidades de aves reproductivas y plantas a lo largo de 54 arroyos en el área metropolitana de Portland, Oregon en 1999 para conectar medidas de comunidades de aves con características estructurales y espaciales de zonas riparias urbanas. Análisis de correspondencia canónica produjeron dos ejes explicativos relacionados con la vegetación y la densidad de carreteras. La abundancia total de aves y la de aves no nativas fueron mayores en bosques estrechos. La abundancia de aves nativas fue mayor en bosques estrechos rodeados por terrenos rurales y la riqueza y diversidad de especies fueron mayores en áreas menos desarrolladas. La abundancia de residentes nativas y migratorias de corta distancia fue mayor en bosques estrechos y su diversidad estuvo asociada positivamente con terrenos desarrollados. La abundancia, riqueza y diversidad de las migratorias neotropicales fueron mayores en áreas de dosel abierto y con pocas carreteras. Examinamos las relaciones espaciales mediante regresiones entre variables de aves y la cobertura del dosel derivada de imágenes satelitales, el área de terrenos sin desarrollar y la densidad de calles en una serie de áreas de 50 m de ancho en un radio de 500 m alrededor de los sitios de estudio. La abundancia de aves no nativas disminuyó con aumentos en la cobertura del dosel hasta 450 m, pero la mayoría de las demás relaciones fueron más fuertes a escalas menores (50–100 m). Nuestros resultados sugieren que el incremento de la cobertura del dosel en áreas urbanas es la estrategia de manejo más valiosa para conservar las aves nativas que se reproducen en el área. Un esquema jerárquico para la conservación de las migratorias neotropicales podría incluir aumentar la cobertura de bosque a menos de 450 m de los arroyos para controlar a las especies no nativas y a los Molothrus, reducir la densidad de calles dentro de un radio de 100 m alrededor de los arroyos y conservar o plantar árboles y arbustos nativos.</jats:p>

TI  - Bird communities in suburban patches near Paris Determinants of local richness in a highly fragmented landscape
PY  - 2006
AB  - ABSTRACT Local species richness in highly fragmented landscapes is expected to be affected by characteristics of both the considered patch and its surrounding matrix, especially in areas dominated by human activities. However, the proximity of other suitable habitat patches may also be determinant for the conservation of biodiversity by enhancing dispersal and thus, “rescue effects” and re-colonization. We investigated breeding bird communities on 63 patches suitable for wildlife in the suburbs of Paris, France, in 2003. After exploring the spatial structure of the data, we tested hypotheses relating local species richness to patch characteristics (size and vegetation), urbanization intensity around patches, and patch isolation relative to the nearest natural remnant. Spatial dependence in the data was considered in the regression analyses because patch distribution may affect local species richness through ecological processes and non-independence between patches situated nearby can pose statistical prob...

TI  - Pocket parks in a compact city: how do birds respond to increasing residential density?
PY  - 2013
AB  - The desire to improve urban sustainability is motivating many city planners to adopt growth strategies that increase residential density, leading to substantial changes to urban landscapes. What effect this change will have on biodiversity remains unclear, but it is expected that the role of public greenspace in providing wildlife habitat will become critical. We explored the role of urban “pocket parks” as habitat for birds, and how this role changed with increasing residential density in the surrounding neighbourhood. We found that parks in neighbourhoods with high levels of public greenspace (corresponding to less residential land) supported more bird species and individuals overall, and more woodland-dependent species, insectivores and hollow-nesters. Total greenspace area was more important (included in the best ranked models for all bird responses) than the configuration (number, average size and connectivity) of greenspace patches. The majority of species were common suburban birds, indicating that species we assume are tolerant to urban areas will be negatively affected by increasing residential density. Parks form part of an interconnected network of urban open space. For parks to continue to support a diverse native bird community, the network must be viewed, managed, and maintained in its entirety. We suggest three key management actions to improve the bird diversity values of urban greenspaces in compact cities: (1) Increase urban greenspace cover in residential neighbourhoods. (2) Increase vegetation structure in greenspace. (3) Encourage homeowners to plant trees and shrubs.

TI  - Biogeographical comparison of winter bird assemblages in urban environments in Finland
PY  - 1996
AB  - We studied biogeographical variation of urban bird assemblages in Finland. Winter birds were censused by single-visit study plot method from thirty-one centres of villages or towns along 950 km latitudinal extent. A total twenty-eight bird species was observed and the average density was 61.2 ind./10 ha. The number of dominant species in study areas varied between two and seven and their proportion of the whole assemblage was over 70%. Species richness, but not the density of birds, decreased northwards in pooled data. Higher species richness in south than in north was mainly due to the higher amount of delayed migratory birds (e.g. waterbirds, finches) and southerly distributed bird species. However, in heavily urbanized areas species richness did not decrease northwards. This observation disagreed with the hypothesis that species richness decreased northwards. Bird density, but not species richness, increased with urbanization. In particular, feral pigeon, hooded crow and house sparrow had highest densities in most urbanized areas. As only few bird species are adapted to live in urban areas, species composition and dominant bird species were almost the same in the south and in the north. These urban birds may effectively use energy rich food in feeding tables and overcome the problems of severe climate in the north. This may be the reason why bird species richness does not decrease northwards in urban areas.

TI  - Influence of Suburban Habitat on a Wintering Bird Community in Coastal Northern California
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract. To evaluate factors influencing a suburban bird community in coastal northern California, we examined the abundance, richness, and diversity of wintering birds at 75 locations within the city of Arcata. For each location we used aerial imagery to determine the proportions of vegetation and impervious surfaces within 75 m and the distances to various landscape features. Human activity was measured and used as a covariate in model selection. Total bird abundance, species richness, and diversity declined with the proportion of road surface at a site, while the abundance of non-native species increased with the cover of roads and structures. The proportions of shrub and tree cover at a site predicted total abundance and richness positively. The effect of trees on species diversity was increasingly positive in more urban areas. Several species, such as Steller's Jay (Cyanocitta stelleri), Ruby-crowned Kinglet (Regulus calendula), Wrentit (Chamaea fasciata), Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), Yell...

TI  - Urban summer heat load: meteorological data as a proxy for metropolitan biodiversity
PY  - 2012
AB  - Regional climate models forecast that the incidence of extreme heat waves will increase in Central Europe, and the associated intensification of urban heat islands causes concerns about human health and biodiversity. We investigated species diversity of terrestrial gastropods across an urban gradient in a metropolitan area. We considered 34 sites of different degrees of urbanization and of different thermal stress classes (TSC) that were derived from a classification of urban heat load based on the physiological equivalent temperature (PET). A total of 31 species were recorded with 0–21 species per site (mean: 4.4 ± 5.2 species per site). Alpha diversity was best explained by TSC, bush cover and perennial vegetation cover, and it decreased with increasing thermal stress. Overall, thermal stress predicted snail and slug species richness better than urban cover (ANOVA(analysis of variance); TSC: F = 10.0, p < 0.001; urbanization: F = 3.9, p = 0.018), and the proportional loss in species richness was higher for native species than for introduced species. The results indicate that climatic stress contributes to the impoverishment of biodiversity in urban areas. We propose that TSC and/or PET are useful indicators for environmental stress levels in biodiversity studies in natural and anthropogenically transformed landscapes.

TI  - Variation in bird diversity in relation to habitat size in the urban landscape of Seoul, South Korea
PY  - 2007
AB  - This study was carried out to find what factors could affect bird diversity in green areas in an urban landscape. We selected 83 sites of different size and type of urban landscapes in Seoul, South Korea and surveyed bird diversity. Urban green patches were grouped into three subclasses: 10 ha. The cumulative bird diversity was greater in the subclass 1–10 ha than in 10 ha. We suggest that bird diversity was closely related to habitat size, especially in the category 1–10 ha, and recommend this area be used to establish new bird habitats in urban landscapes. The number of bird species was significantly correlated with the number of insect species in studied patches, but was not correlated with the size of green areas or the distance to roads. Therefore, we suggest that the number of insect species is the most important factor affecting bird diversity within our urban study area.

TI  - Effects of habitat edges and trampling on the distribution of ground beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) in urban forests
PY  - 2012
AB  - Urban forest patches are generally small with highly contrasting edges bordering non-forest habitat, landscape features that increase with urbanisation. These forest patches are also subject to high human foot traffic resulting in trampling and other user disturbances that affect their quality as habitat for invertebrates. We studied the effects of these factors on carabid beetles in urban forests in the cities of Helsinki (Finland) and Edmonton (Canada). In both cities, the structure of carabid assemblages was affected by trampling intensity and distance to the forest edge. Moderate intensity of trail use was associated with increased beetle captures, especially in Edmonton. The effects on individual species were apparent in Edmonton but harder to demonstrate in Helsinki where forest specialist species may have been largely extirpated already. We suggest that these differences result because there has been a long history of fragmentation of urban forest patches in Helsinki, species loss from such patches is gradual, and understorey vegetation structure constrains human foot traffic in forest patches more in Edmonton than it does in Helsinki.

TI  - Urban landscape matrix affects avian diversity in remnant vegetation fragments: Evidence from the Phoenix metropolitan region, USA
PY  - 2012
AB  - Biodiversity conservation in urban areas has become increasingly important as cities have expanded to cover larger proportions of landscapes across the world. The careful planning of habitat reserves within urbanized areas has the potential to make significant contributions to regional biodiversity. We surveyed the passerine community in 15 habitat reserves within the Phoenix metropolitan region and explored the relationships between community composition and urban land uses surrounding the reserves. Diversity of different guilds was affected in substantially different ways by reserve characteristics and surrounding urban land use. Guilds responded to land use at all three scales included in the study – 200 m, 1000 m and 2500 m. The responses of four guilds, synanthropic, non-synanthropic, insectivore and feeding generalist, were well predicted by the factors considered here. Reserve characteristics (area, shape, isolation), particularly area, had effects on all four of these guilds with non-synanthropic and insectivore species responding positively to area, while synanthropic and feeding generalist species responded negatively. Land use type surrounding the reserves had significant effects on all of these guilds, except for feeding generalists. High density, high diurnal activity land uses decreased diversity, while medium density, low diurnal activity uses increased the diversity of some guilds, particularly insectivores, probably by providing supplemental habitat. This study provides new evidence from an arid urban landscape that not only reserve characteristics, but also surrounding urban land use should be considered during conservation planning, especially if non-synanthropic or insectivore species are among the targeted species.

TI  - Matrix configuration and patch isolation influences override the species-area relationship for urban butterfly communities
PY  - 2012
AB  - The aim of this paper is to examine the role of urban public parks in maintaining connectivity and butterfly assemblages. Using a regression framework, we first test the relative importance of park size and isolation in predicting abundance and species richness of butterfly assemblages across a set of 24 public parks within a large metropolitan area, Marseille (South-East France). Then, we focus on landscape features that affect diversity patterns of the recorded butterfly communities. In this second part, the urban landscape surrounding each park is described (within a 1 × 1 km window) according to two major components: vegetated areas (habitat patches) and impervious or built areas (matrix patches). Specifically, we aim to test whether the incorporation of this built component (matrix) in the landscape analysis provides new insights into the understanding of ecological connectivity in the urban environment. We found a significant effect of both matrix configuration (shape complexity of the built patches) and distance from regional species pool (park isolation) on diversity of butterflies that overrides park size in their contribution to variation in species richness. This result suggests that many previous studies of interactions between biodiversity and urban landscape have overlooked the influence of the built elements.

TI  - Patterns in bat functional guilds across multiple urban centres in south-eastern Australia
PY  - 2013
AB  - Understanding the impacts of landscape change on species behaviour is a major challenge in landscape ecology. A focus on the functional traits of species may improve this understanding if species with similar traits (functional guilds) are impacted by landscape change in similar ways, but this idea has not been widely tested on bat communities in urban landscapes. We examined changes in bat species richness and the activity level of species in different functional guilds within 72 residential neighbourhoods across 18 towns and cities spanning over 250,000 square km in south-eastern Australia. Species richness increased close to native vegetation, declined with increasing urbanization, and had a hump-shaped relationship with neighbourhood vegetation cover. Also, the activity level of all bat species combined peaked at mid-range values of neighbourhood vegetation cover. The activity of species in the open-adapted guild was not strongly related to any urban characteristic, but our results concur with previous findings that the activity of most open-adapted species does not appear to be negatively impacted by urbanization. Conversely, clutter-adapted species appear more sensitive to urbanization and their activity level was negatively related to urban intensity and increased closer to native vegetation, consistent with previous studies. The functional-trait approach may improve the capacity to make generalisations across different landscape contexts for clutter-adapted and open-adapted guilds, but is currently hampered for other bat species owing to variation in the behaviour of different species assigned to the same functional guild, and a lack of ecological knowledge regarding the impacts of different types of landscape change on particular species.

TI  - Assessing the impact of local habitat variables and landscape context on riparian birds in agricultural, urbanized, and native landscapes
PY  - 2008
AB  - Large tracts of natural habitat are being replaced by agriculture and urban sprawl in Mediterranean regions worldwide. We have limited knowledge about the effects of human activities on native species in these landscapes and which, if any, management practices might enhance the conservation of native biodiversity within them. Through a citizen volunteer bird-monitoring project, we compared bird abundance and species richness in northern Californian riparian zones surrounded by vineyards, urban areas, and natural areas. We assessed both local and landscape-level variables that may enhance native bird diversity in each land use type. We also demonstrate a new statistical approach, generalized estimating equations, to analyze highly variable data, such as that collected by volunteers. Avian abundance was highly correlated with both landscape context and local habitat variables, while avian richness was correlated with local habitat variables, specifically shrub richness, and percent of tree cover. In particular, shrub species richness has a strong positive correlation with riparian-preferring bird species. This suggests that active local management of riparian zones in human-dominated landscapes can increase our ability to retain native bird species in these areas.

TI  - Urban bird diversity and landscape complexity Species-environment associations along a multiscale habitat gradient
PY  - 2003
AB  - For birds in urban environments, the configuration of local habitat within the landscape may be as critical as the composition of the local habitat itself. We examined the relative importance of environmental attributes (e.g., tree cover, composition, and number of tree species) measured at different spatial scales in relation to urban bird species richness and abundance. We expected that some bird species and nesting guilds would have a closer association with landscape-level features (within 1000 m), such as proximity to large forested areas, than with local-scale habitat measures (within 50 m). To investigate this, avian community data were collected at 285 point-count stations in 1997 and 1998 along four roadside transects located in Vancouver and Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. Transects (5–25 km in length) bisected three large parks (>324 ha) and proceeded along residential streets in urban and suburban areas. In total, 48 bird species were observed, including 25 common species. Species richness declined in relation to a gradient of increasing urbanization, as measured by local- and landscape-level habitat features. We further examined the significance and importance of local- vs. landscape-level habitat attributes using logistic regression and found that both scales explained the presence/absence distributions of residential birds. Local-scale habitat features such as large coniferous trees, berry-producing shrubs, and freshwater streams were of particular importance in estimating the likelihood of finding bird species. Landscape measures, particularly forest cover (within 500 m) and park area (measured at different scales as a function of distance from point-count stations) significantly improved likelihood estimations based solely on local-scale habitat features. Our results suggest that both local- and landscape-scale resources were important in determining the distribution of birds in urban areas. Parks, reserves, and the surrounding residential areas should be integrated into urban planning and development designs to maintain resident avifauna and overall species diversity in urban environments.

TI  - Effects of seasonality on the species-area relationship a case study with birds in urban parks
PY  - 2007
AB  - Aim  To examine how parameters of the species–area curve and factors determining bird species richness are affected by seasonality.



Location  One hundred and thirty urban parks of the city of Valencia (Spain) ranging between 0.03 and 18.6 ha.



Methods  Bird censuses were conducted monthly during 1998 and 2004. For each park, 27 variables were recorded as measures of size, structure and isolation. Linear regression was used to test for patterns in species richness relative to independent variables. The results of each season were compared.



Results  Curves corresponding to the breeding period (spring–summer) had significantly higher intercepts, but slopes did not change across seasons. Turnover rates of resident species were dependent on patch size and isolation considering spring, but not autumn, from different years. Additionally, turnover rates in spring were lower in parks in close proximity to others than in isolated ones. In all seasons, the number of bird species showed a strong relationship with park area, which explained c. 60% of the variation in species numbers. Habitat variables and park isolation explained a small amount of the variation in species numbers. The data did not give support to the random placement hypothesis.



Main conclusions  The overall conclusions of this study give little support to the possible influence of seasonality on species–area relationship or on the three main hypotheses explaining it. This lack of influence of seasonality could be explained by the seasonal stability of the bird populations of the parks within the study area as a consequence of different factors, mainly the characteristics of the species pool, similarity in the features of the parks irrespective of their size, and stability of resources and conditions across seasons. The question of whether this lack of influence of seasonality on the species–area relationship occurs in those ecological systems that have a larger seasonal variation than the urban parks of the study area remains unresolved. Closer examination of the seasonal patterns reported in this study is likely to be useful in increasing our understanding of the species–area relationship.

TI  - Factors influencing the bird community of urban wooded streets along an annual cycle
PY  - 2007
AB  - Although the bird communities of some urban habitats have received considerable re-search attention, the bird fauna of wooded streets have been little studied despite the fact that wooded streets constitute a distinct feature of the urban landscape. In order to exam-ine the effects of vegetation structure and floristic attributes on bird species richness and bird abundance, 216 wooded streets in the city of Valencia (Spain) were surveyed during three consecutive seasons in the year 2000. During the survey 1,378 individuals of 14 bird species were recorded. With the exception of the House Sparrow (Passer domesticus) and the Collared Dove (Streptopelia decaocto), most of these species had very low abun-dances. Depending on the season, the species recorded in wooded streets represented be-tween 19–25% of the species recorded in the nearby urban habitats. Across seasons, tree species richness, tree abundance and tree height were the main factors influencing bird species richness and bird abundance. 34 tree species out of 41 were used by birds. Some large tree species like the Box Elder (Acer negundo), the Siberian Elm (Ulmus pumilla) and the White Poplar (Populus alba) were preferred. A substantial change in the design and management of wooded streets in order to improve their suitability for bird fauna is suggested.

TI  - Determinants of native avian richness in suburban remnant vegetation Implications for conservation planning
PY  - 2008
AB  - While urban areas are increasingly recognized as having potential value for biodiversity conservation, the relationship between biodiversity and the structure and configuration of the urban landscape is poorly understood. In this study we surveyed birds in 39 remnant patches of native vegetation of various sizes (range 1–107 ha) embedded in the suburban matrix in Melbourne, Australia. The total richness of species within remnants was strongly associated with the size of remnants. Remnant-reliant species displayed a much stronger response to remnant area than matrix-tolerant species indicating the importance of large remnants in maintaining representative bird assemblages. Large remnants are important for other ecological groups of species including migratory species, ground foraging birds and canopy foraging birds. Other landscape (e.g. amount of riparian vegetation) and structural components (e.g. shrub cover) of remnants have a lesser role in determining the richness of individual remnants. This research provides conservation managers and planners with a hierarchical process to reserve design and management in order to conserve the highest richness of native species within urban areas. First of all, conservation efforts should preferentially focus on the retention of larger remnants of native vegetation. Second, where possible, riparian vegetation should be included within reserves or, where it is already present, should be carefully managed to ensure its integrity. Third, efforts should be focused at maintaining appropriate habitat and vegetation structure and complexity.

TI  - Urban amphibian assemblages as metacommunities
PY  - 2006
AB  - 1. Urban ecosystems are expanding throughout the world, and urban ecology is attracting increasing research interest. Some authors have questioned the value of existing ecological theories for understanding the processes and consequences of urbanization. 2. In order to assess the applicability of metacommunity theory to urban systems, I evaluated three assumptions that underlie the theory – the effect of patch area, the effect of patch isolation, and species–environment relations – using data on assemblages of pond-breeding amphibians in the Greater Melbourne area of Australia. I also assessed the relative impact of habitat fragmentation, habitat isolation, and changes to habitat quality on these assemblages. 3. Poisson regression modelling provided support for an important increase in species richness with patch area (pond size) and a decrease in species richness with increasing patch isolation, as measured by surrounding road cover. Holding all other variables constant, species richness was predicted to be 2·8–5·5 times higher at the largest pond than at the smallest, while the most isolated pond was predicted to have 12–19% of the species richness of the least isolated pond. Thus, the data were consistent with the first two assumptions of metacommunity theory evaluated. 4. The quality of habitat at a pond was also important, with a predicted 44–56% decrease in the number of species detected at ponds with a surrounding vertical wall compared with those with a gently sloping bank. This demonstrates that environmental differences between habitat patches were also influencing amphibian assemblages, providing support for the species-sorting and/or mass-effect perspectives of metacommunity theory. 5. Without management intervention, urbanization may lead to a reduction in the number of amphibian species persisting in urban ponds, particularly where increasing isolation of ponds by roads and associated infrastructure reduces the probability of re-colonization following local extinction.

TI  - Amphibian breeding distribution in an urbanized landscape
PY  - 2005
AB  - : Amphibians commonly use wetlands for breeding habitat, and given the concern about their ongoing global declines, the effects of urbanization on the breeding distribution of amphibians need to be quantified. Thus, we conducted a survey of the larval amphibian community in central Pennsylvania (U.S.A.) wetlands along an urbanization gradient. Wetlands in urban areas had less surrounding forest and wetlands and greater road density than rural wetlands. Urbanization was also associated with increases in hydroperiod (i.e., wetland permanency) and the presence of fish predators. Moreover, urban wetlands had lower larval amphibian species richness than rural wetlands. This decrease in richness was attributable to a decrease in occurrence of wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and ambystomatid salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum and A. jeffersonianum) in urban sites. Wood frogs and ambystomatid salamanders were positively associated with the amount of forest surrounding sites and negatively associated with hydroperiod. As a result, we hypothesize that these species are sensitive to the effects of urban development. The remaining species in this study appear fairly resilient to the effects of urbanization. These data demonstrate the importance of quantifying both local and landscape attributes when describing the factors that limit the breeding distribution of amphibians. We recommend that to preserve amphibian biodiversity in urbanized landscapes, it is best to focus on regional diversity, which protects a variety of sites that encompass various hydroperiods, have adequate buffer habitat, and are connected by dispersal routes.




Resumen: Los anfibios comunmente utilizan humedales como habitat de reproduccion, y dada la preocupacion por sus declinaciones globales, existe la necesidad de cuantificar los efectos de la urbanizacion sobre la distribucion de la reproduccion de anfibios. Por lo tanto, examinamos la comunidad larvaria de anfibios en humedales de Pennsylvania central (E, U. A.) a lo largo de un gradiente de urbanizacion. Los humedales en areas urbanas tenian menos bosque y humedales en los alrededores y mayor densidad de caminos que los humedales rurales. La urbanizacion tambien se asocio con incrementos en el hidroperiodo (i. e permanencia del humedal) y con la presencia de peces depredadores. Mas aun, los humedales urbanos tenian menor riqueza de especies de larvas de anfibios que los humedales rurales. Este decremento en riqueza se debio al decremento en la ocurrencia de ranas (Rana sylvatica) y de salamandras ambistomidas (Ambystoma maculatum y A. jeffersonianum) en sitios urbanos. Las ranas y salamandras ambistomidas se asociaron positivamente con la cantidad de bosque alrededor de los sitios y negativamente con el hidroperiodo. Como resultado, planteamos la hipotesis de que estas especies son sensibles a los efectos del desarrollo urbano. Las especies restantes en este estudio parecen medianamente resistentes a los efectos de la urbanizacion. Estos datos demuestran la importancia de cuantificar tanto los atributos locales como los del paisaje cuando se describen los factores que limitan la distribucion de la reproduccion de anfibios. Para preservar la biodiversidad de anfibios en paisajes urbanizados, recomendamos enfocar la diversidad regional, que protege a una variedad de sitios que abarcan varios hidroperiodos, tienen habitat amortiguador adecuado y estan conectados por rutas de dispersion.

TI  - Investigating environmental variation and landscape characteristics of an urban-rural gradient using woodland carabid assemblages
PY  - 2006
AB  - Aim  To investigate environmental variation and associated assemblage changes of carabid beetles along an urban–rural gradient.



Location  ‘Quercus–Acer’ (oak–sycamore) woodlands in the city of Birmingham, UK.



Methods  We collected carabid data using pitfall traps on 12 sites in the city. The traps were run from April–September in 2000, and we collected environmental data on 24 individual variables associated with the individual sites and their landscape context. Changes in carabid assemblages were analysed using repeat measures anova and the environment–species relationships with a Redundancy Analyses (RDA) and Generalized Linear Modelling (GLM).



Results  We found that: (1) species richness and diversity were lower in the urban and suburban zone and higher in the rural zone; (2) Berger Parker dominance index was higher in the urban and suburban zones; (3) the number of woodland and woodland associated species was significantly higher at the rural end of the gradient; (4) the number of short-winged (brachypterous) species was highest in the rural zone and decreased towards the urban woodlands, whereas the long-winged species were more abundant in suburban woodlands; (5) the median weight length (WML) of the assemblage declined along the gradient from the rural to the urban zone, as did the number of large species; and (6) five of the 24 environmental variables showed a significant relationship with variation in the carabid assemblage. At site level the carabid assemblages were related to the level of site disturbance and soil penetrability, whereas site size and amount of woodland and urban land within 5 km of the site were important at a larger landscape scale.



Main conclusions  The results suggest that urbanization has a deleterious impact on carabid assemblages, causing a reduction in species richness from the rural fringe to the centre of the city. Changes in assemblage structure were related to woodland fragmentation, which led to variations in woodland size, woodland location and site disturbance due to trampling. Large, flightless and specialist woodland species are more susceptible to changes associated with urbanization, presumably due to their longer life spans, lower reproductive rates, more specialized niches and more limited dispersal potential.

TI  - Spider, bee, and bird communities in cities are shaped by environmental control and high stochasticity
PY  - 2010
AB  - Spatially organized distribution patterns of species and communities are shaped by both autogenic processes (neutral mechanism theory) and exogenous processes (niche theory). In the latter, environmental variables that are themselves spatially organized induce spatial structure in the response variables. The relative importance of these processes has not yet been investigated in urban habitats. We compared the variance explained by purely spatial, spatially structured environmental, and purely environmental components for the community composition of spiders (Araneae), bees (Apidae), and birds (Aves) at 96 locations in three Swiss cities. Environmental variables (topography, climate, land cover, urban green management) were measured on four different radii around sampling points (,10 m, 50 m, 250 m, 1000 m), while Moran's eigenvector maps (MEMs) acted as spatial variables. All three taxonomic groups showed weak spatial structure. Spider communities reacted to very fine- scaled environmental changes of lawn and meadow management and climate. Bird community composition was determined by woody plants as well as solar radiation at all radii, the scale of the influence varying among species. Bee communities were weakly explained by isolated variables only. Our results suggest that the anthropogenic structuring of urban areas has disrupted the spatial organization of environmental variables and inhibited the development of biotic spatial processes. The near absence of spatial structure may therefore be a feature typical of urban species assemblages, resulting in urban community composition mainly influenced by local environmental variables. Urban environments represent a close-knit mosaic of habitats that are regularly disturbed. Species communities in urban areas are far from equilibrium. Our analysis also suggests that urban communities need to be considered as being in constant change to adapt to disturbances and changes imposed by human activities.

TI  - Spatial correlates of amphibian use of constructed wetlands in an urban landscape
PY  - 2009
AB  - Many amphibian species rely on both aquatic and terrestrial habitats to complete their life cycles. Therefore, processes operating both within the aquatic breeding habitat, and in the surrounding uplands may influence species distributions and community composition. Moreover, changes in land use adjacent to breeding site may degrade aquatic habitats. To assess land use effects on pond-breeding amphibian assemblages, we investigated relationships between land use, breeding habitat conditions, and breeding amphibian use of constructed wetlands in urban environments of the Baltimore metropolitan area, USA. Forest and impervious surface associations with species richness and occurrence occurred at spatial scales ranging from 50 to 1,000 m, with strongest relationships at 500 m. Forest and impervious surface cover within 1,000 m of ponds were also related to water and sediment quality, which in turn were capable of explaining a proportion of the observed variation in species richness and occurrence. Taken together, our results suggest that forest and other land covers within relatively proximal distances to ponds (i.e., within 50–1,000 m) may be influencing species richness directly via the provisioning of upland habitat, and indirectly via influences on within pond habitat quality.

TI  - Characteristics of urban natural areas influencing winter bird use in southern Ontario, Canada
PY  - 2007
AB  - Characteristics of urban natural areas and surrounding landscapes were identified that best explain winter bird use for 28 urban natural areas in southern Ontario, Canada. The research confirms for winter birds the importance of area (size) and natural vegetation, rather than managed, horticultural parkland, within urban natural areas as well as percent urban land use and natural habitat in surrounding landscapes. Alien bird density and percent ground feeding species increased with percent surrounding urban land use. Higher percent forest cover was associated with higher percentages of forest, bark feeding, small ( 20 ha start to support some area-sensitive species. Areas similar to rural forests had >25% insectivores, >25% forest interior species, >25% small species, and <5% alien species. Indicator species separated urban natural areas from rural habitats and ordination placed urban natural areas along a gradient between urban development and undisturbed, rural forests. More attention is needed on issues of winter bird conservation in urban landscapes.

TI  - Urban brownfields as temporary habitats driving forces for the diversity of phytophagous insects
PY  - 2006
AB  - In urban brownfields (derelict sites), we studied the influence of local factors (successional age, vegetation structure, soil) and landscape context (spatial arrangement of brownfields of different successional stages) on the diversity of phytophagous insects, grasshoppers and leafhoppers (Orthoptera and Hemiptera: Auchenorrhyncha). The study was conducted on a total of 246 plots in the cities of Bremen and Berlin, Germany. We used a habitat modelling approach, enabling us to predict the community from single species models (30 species in Bremen, 28 in Berlin). The results revealed that communities were predominantly determined by vegetation structure, followed by landscape context, soil parameters and site age. For most species, local factors were the most important. Only few species were strongly influenced by landscape context, even though some showed clear negative reactions to low proportions of brownfields in the surroundings. Along a successional gradient of vegetation structure, from scarce and low to dense and high vegetation, the insect community was not static. Even though species numbers remained comparatively constant, species composition changed considerably. Many species showed clear preferences for certain successional stages. Thus, maintaining the regional species pool of a city requires a mosaic of all successional stages.

TI  - Decline in the diversity of willow trunk-dwelling weevils (Coleoptera Curculionoidea) as a result of urban expansion in Beijing, China
PY  - 2011
AB  - Beijing, the capital and second largest city of China, expanded in a typical concentric pattern. The urbanized area consists of five concentric zones, which are based on the city’s ring road system. Willow trees (Salix spp.) are commonly planted and abundant in the city. In this study, we determined the effects of urbanization on willow trunk-dwelling weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea) in a 3-year survey. Our results indicated that species richness and abundance decreased from outskirts to the urban center. It was estimated that within a 30-km limit, species richness and abundance might be reduced by 0.9 species and 59.3% of individuals per 5 km toward urban center. Landscape variables (e.g., the proportion of impervious surface and distance to urban center) explained 59.4% of species richness and 43.9% of species abundance. Local variables (e.g., plant resources and site size) explained only 4.9% of species richness and 4.7% of species abundance. Our results show that there is a negative relationship between urban expansion and weevil diversity. There are several ways in which such detrimental effects on biodiversity could be mitigated: (1) Optimization of urban landscape structures, as well as vegetation planting; (2) increasing connectivity between urban remnants and natural landscapes in the outskirts of the city; and (3) limiting the proportion of impervious surface in inner urban zones.

TI  - Impact of urban structure on avian diversity along the Truckee River, USA
PY  - 2012
AB  - Urban riparian habitats are potentially important resources for native birds in arid ecosystems. Most studies have assessed the value of urban riparian habitat in terms of vegetation and natural resources; however, the surrounding land use and infrastructure may determine the viability of urban habitat. We studied the impact of urban structure, the combination of land use, infrastructure and vegetation variables that work together to shape the urban environment, on avian riparian habitat in the Truckee Meadows, Nevada, USA. Land use and infrastructure explained avian species richness and abundance better than local vegetation alone, but community resemblance was more strongly correlated to vegetation. Avian species guilds responded differentially to surrounding land use, suggesting there may be a functional difference between land use types. The best models for bird diversity used urban structure (both land use and vegetation) to describe potential habitat. Urban structure describes urban habitat in ways that vegetation variables alone cannot. Studies that ignore land use and infrastructure and other socioeconomic variables are likely missing key functional differences within urban ecosystems, and may miss the potential for compatible development that encourages both biodiversity and urban growth.

TI  - Can a large metropolis sustain complex herpetofauna communities? An analysis of the suitability of green space fragments in Rome
PY  - 2009
AB  - Urban areas are primary causes of species’ range fragmentation and reduction. However, relatively few studies have attempted to describe the habitat variables influencing the diversity and conservation of amphibians and reptiles, particularly in Mediterranean Europe and in large metropolitan areas. We explored this broad conservation ecology problem by studying the richness and diversity patterns in relation to a suite of six independent habitat variables in Rome, one of the most ancient cities of the world. We considered all the green remnant areas (n = 62) of Rome, ranging 1 to 41000 ha in size, which are interspersed within a sea of urbanized matrix. A total of 10 amphibian and 15 reptile species were studied. Their presence/absence patterns were assessed and the effects of the various habitat variables on each species were predicted by a logistic regression model. A total of 1261 presence records (404 amphibians and 857 reptiles) were analysed. Fragment size and wood size within each fragment did correlate significantly with the species richness of both amphibians and reptiles, and there was a clear threshold effect after 50 ha of wooded surface. The presence of water bodies positively affected the species distribution. One amphibian and three reptiles inhabited exclusively fragments 450 ha. The distance from the centre did not affect fragment species richness. The presence of most species of both amphibians and reptiles was positively influenced by the irregular versus circular shape of the wooded area. The legal protection of a given area did not influence the observed patterns but the total number of sheltered species. Overall, our study suggests that, in order to maintain the current diversity and population viability, it is necessary, in addition to water bodies’ maintenance, to (1) preserve the wooded landscapes over 50 ha; (2) promote irregularly shaped increases in the wood surface; (3) maintain ecotonal boundaries.

TI  - Warm-temperate, immense, and sprawling: plant diversity drivers in urban Beijing, China
PY  - 2012
AB  - Urbanization is one of the most environmentally damaging of human activities, producing large alterations in ecosystem structure, function, species composition and interactions. In this study, we performed a systematic investigation of the plant species richness and density in the city of Beijing, China. We also assessed which socio-economic factors have most influence on plant diversity. Within the city, we found 551 plant species of 313 genera and 103 families, of which 118 were trees, 99 shrubs, and 296 herbs. Nearly half (48.3 %) of the total plant species were aliens. Species richness and density were positively correlated both for tree/shrub and herb taxa, which indicate that although some species predominate in our study area, there is an important array of species in relation to their densities. As expected, most of the socio-economic variables studied showed to be related to at least one of the four plant diversity variables (i.e., herb richness, herb density, tree/shrub richness, and tree/shrub density). Land-use showed a significant relationship in all four cases, which generally had lower values in cultural and education areas (areas that in Beijing are generally characterized by large extensions of urbanized land). The year of establishment was also largely related to plant diversity, with higher values for recently developed areas. This was an expected result given the dynamics of the urban development of Beijing during the last 60 years, which consisted of intense urban sprawling, followed by more environmentally-friendly urbanization practices during the 2000s related to the greening of the city for the olympic games. This dynamics also explained the negative relationship found between the distance to the city center and both tree/shrub species richness and density.

TI  - How would size, age, human disturbance, and vegetation structure affect bird communities of urban parks in different seasons?
PY  - 2012
AB  - Parks are diversity hotspots in cities, and are generalized isolated “islands” in urban landscapes. However, there is a paucity of information on the avian community structure of urban parks in big cities in Southeast Asia, including Hong Kong which has more than 7 million people. This study therefore aimed to assess the influences of park attributes, human disturbance, and vegetation structure on species richness, diversity, total density, and species groups of breeding and wintering bird communities in Hong Kong. Bird communities of 30 parks were censused four times each season in 2010–2011 using point counting. Species richness and diversity were affected by park size in both seasons, and larger parks supported more species and higher diversity. In addition, species richness of wintering season was negatively affected by visitor rate. Total bird density increased with visitor rate, but only in the breeding season. Noise did not have significant impacts on species richness, diversity, and total density. Regarding the responses of species groups, number of resident species increased with park size in both seasons. Migrants, insectivores, and insectivore–frugivores were positively affected by park size, but negatively by visitor rate in the wintering season. However, omnivores in the breeding season increased with both park size and visitor rate. Granivores was the only feeding guild which was positively affected by noise and negatively by foliage height diversity in the wintering season. In conclusion, park size and visitor rate affected bird community structure, and different species groups had different responses to habitat factors in the two seasons.
