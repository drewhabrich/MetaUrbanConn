AB  - Background: It has been recognized that urban green spaces play a crucial role in providing many landscape services. The research aimed at identifying the main knowledge gaps in this framework and to support urban planning, taking into account the spatial configuration of green areas through a pilot study area, and mapping urban landscape services. Methods: In this research, (1) a systematic review, analyzed through a network analysis; (2) an urban pilot study to map the Urban Green Index and, jointly, the spatial composition and configuration of urban green areas, through the integration of three landscape metrics; and (3) the mapping of Urban Landscape Services Index have been carried out. Results: The 37% of the reviewed articles focused on regulating services, while the network analysis identified four clusters. The total Urban Green Index was 26%, and some districts showed a percentage that surpassed it. The total overall Green Connectivity Index was 21%. Some districts were the best providers of landscape services. Conclusions: This research was in line with the EU Joint Science for Policy Report suggesting giving emphasis to the spatial pattern map of green spaces in European cities to provide spatial data available for decision-makers in relation to GI deployment.

AB  - Landscape fragmentation due to urban sprawl and industrialization has caused habitat loss and threatened global biodiversity. However, the magnitude, spatial pattern, and mechanisms of how landscape fragmentation leads to habitat loss remain unclear. The Yellow River Basin (YRB) and the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YZREB) are important ecological security barriers that play a decisive role in landscape connectivity and biodiversity conservation in China. From a comparative perspective, this study analyzes the temporal-spatial changes of land cover in the YRB and the YZREB from 2005 to 2018 and simulates the land use pattern in 2031 using a patchlevel simulation (PLUS) model. Then the degree and tendency of landscape fragmentation during 2005-2031 are measured based on the entire region and a 10 km grid, respectively. The habitat quality (HQ) is measured using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model. The temporal-spatial evolution characteristics of HQ are analyzed across multiple dimensions, including the entire region, urban agglomerations and watersheds (upstream, midstream, and downstream). Finally, spatial econometric models are applied to examine the spatial dependence of HQ and quantify the spatial impact of landscape fragmentation on HQ in the YRB and YZREB based on 10 km grids. Results show that: (1) there would be a significant trend of landscape fragmentation and habitat degradation in both the YRB and YZREB during 2005-2031. (2) HQ in the YRB and YZREB has the spatial distribution characteristics of being low in coastal areas and urban agglomerations but high in inland areas and mountainous forest areas. (3) The spatial distribution and spatial relationship of landscape fragmentation and HQ in YRB and YZREB differ significantly in multi-spatiotemporal dimensions. The findings could provide support for landscape planning and biodiversity conservation strategies in China and other developing countries.

AB  - In recent decades, the biodiversity of freshwater environments has decreased sharply due to anthropogenic disturbances that damaged ecosystem structures and functions. Habitat restoration has emerged as an important method to mitigate the degradation of river ecosystems. Although in many cases a post-project monitoring has been promoted to access the restoration progress, it is still unclear how aquatic community changes following river habitat restoration in China. Macroinvertebrate communities intermediately positioned within ecosystem food webs play a key role in ecosystem processes within river ecosystem, driving energy flow and nutrient cycling. Here, benthic macroinvertebrates are used as bio-indicators to assess the ecosystem health of degraded urban rivers, restored urban rivers, and undisturbed rivers. This study aims to determine (i) how habitat restoration influences macroinvertebrates diversity and how this compared to degraded and reference conditions; (ii) how did macroinvertebrate community compositions differ in restored, degraded, and reference sites; and (iii) the environmental factors shaping macroinvertebrate communities. Habitat restoration significantly increased the diversity and richness of macroinvertebrate community and intolerant species and shifted the community composition towards reference status. Habitat characteristics and water chemistry, including substrate diversity, water velocity, and both nutrients (TN) and organic pollutants (TOC), appeared to shape the turnover of these communities. Habitat characteristics contributed to most of the variation of the entire macroinvertebrate community. Our research indicates that habitat restoration is an efficient approach to restore the aquatic community and hence improve river ecosystem health for freshwater conservation and sustainable management in Zhejiang province. This study strengthens our understanding of the changes of macroinvertebrate community after habitat restoration and important controlling variables that attribute to these changes, which provides an important guidance for future freshwater management.

AB  - Urban open spaces are considered as spatial residuals of the expansion of built areas. The environmental impact of the resulting land-cover pattern and associated ecosystem services are frequently evaluated at a crude spatial resolution only. However, wild animals use remaining interconnected fine-grain open spaces as an infrastructure for movement. In this paper, we traced the evolution of an open-space system in Haifa, Israel, and examined the impact of urban morphology on size and distribution of open spaces at different spatial resolutions. At a 30m resolution, our analysis indicated fragmentation and increasing partial elimination of open spaces. Over time the connectivity declined at a diminishing rate, yet the network did not disintegrate into separate components. The evolution analysis implied that in crude resolution, the open space network is threatened. At a 5m resolution, our analysis showed that Haifa remains porous to animal movement. Using combined multiple least-cost paths through the urban landscape of heterogeneous permeability, we illustrated extensive connectivity among open spaces. Backyards and other urban in-between spaces complemented the seminatural open-space network connectivity, enabling wildlife movement between habitat patches and thus survival in an urbanized environment.

AB  - Aim To determine the factors influencing the distribution of birds in remnants in a fragmented agricultural landscape. Location Forty-seven eucalypt remnants and six sites in continuous forest in the sub-humid Midlands region of Tasmania, Australia.
   Methods Sites were censused over a two-year period, and environmental data were collected for remnants. The avifauna of the sites was classified and ordinated. The abundances of bird species, and bird species composition, richness, abundance and diversity were related to environmental variables, using simple correlation and modelling.
   Results There were two distinct groups of sample sites, which sharply differed in species composition, richness, diversity and bird abundance, separated on the presence/absence of noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala Latham) colonies, remnant size, vegetation structural attributes and variables that reflected disturbance history. The approximate remnant size threshold for the change from one group to another was 20-30 ha. Remnant species richness and diversity were most strongly explained by remnant area and noisy miner abundance, with contributions from structural and isolation attributes in the second case. Segment richness was explained by precipitation, logging history and noisy miner abundance. Bird abundance was positively related to precipitation and negatively related to tree dieback. The 28 individual bird species models were highly individualistic, with vegetation structural variables, noisy miner abundance, climatic variables, variables related to isolation, area, variables related to floristics, disturbance variables, the nature of the matrix and remnant shape all being components in declining order of incidence. Age of the remnant did not relate to any of the dependent variables.
   Main conclusions Degraded and small remnants may have become more distinct in their avifaunal characteristics than might otherwise be the case, as a result of the establishment of colonies of an aggressive native bird, the noisy miner. The area, isolation and shape of remnants directly relate to the abundance of relatively few species, compared to vegetation attributes, climate and the abundance of the noisy miner. The nature of the matrix is important in the response of some species to fragmentation.

AB  - We found that phyllosphere bacterial communities in European cities are associated to urban intensity and that this effect is mediated by several combined stress factors.
   The phyllosphere harbours a diverse and specific bacterial community, which influences plant health and ecosystem functioning. In this study, we investigated the impact of urban green areas connectivity and size on the composition and diversity of phyllosphere bacterial communities. Hereto, we evaluated the diversity and composition of phyllosphere bacterial communities of 233 Platanus x acerifolia and Acer pseudoplatanus trees in 77 urban green areas throughout 6 European cities. The community composition and diversity significantly differed between cities but only to a limited extent between tree species. We could show that urban intensity correlated significantly with the community composition of phyllosphere bacteria. In particular, a significant correlation was found between the relative abundances for 29 out of the 50 most abundant families and the urban intensity: the abundances of classic phyllosphere families, such as Acetobacteraceae, Planctomycetes, and Beijerinkiaceae, decreased with urban intensity (i.e. more abundant in areas with more green, lower air pollution, and lower temperature), while those related to human activities, such as Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillaceae, increased with urban intensity. The results of this study suggest that phyllosphere bacterial communities in European cities are associated with urban intensity and that effect is mediated by several combined stress factors.

AB  - Urban riparian corridors have the capacity to maintain high levels of bird abundance and biodiversity. How riparian corridors in cities are used by waterbirds has received relatively little focus in urban bird studies. The principal objective of our study was to determine how habitat and landscape elements affect waterbird biodiversity in an arid city. We surveyed 36 transects stratified across a gradient of urbanization and water availability along the Salt River, a riparian corridor that is monitored as part of the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long Term Ecological Research study system located in Phoenix, Arizona, USA. Habitat and landscape variables were reduced via Principal Component Analysis to be used in a constrained ordination that identified waterbird community composition patterns, and then used to model the responses of guild abundance and diversity. Habitat and landscape components from the constrained ordination explained 39% of the variation in the waterbird community. Land use components were related to the suite of species at each site, but had a weaker relationship to guild abundance or diversity. Habitat-level components (water physiognomy, shoreline composition, and terrestrial vegetation cover) were more important in predicting both guild abundance and diversity. We found that water physiognomy was the strongest driver shaping waterbird community parameters. The implications of our study are relevant to urban planning in arid cities, offering the opportunity to design and improve wildlife habitat while providing other important public amenities.

AB  - A comparative analysis of the structure of small mammal populations in urban cemeteries was performed, and basic factors affecting its formation were revealed. The basis of the study was provided by long-term observations on 42 Moscow cemeteries. 2734 animals of 12 species (17 944 trap x nights) were analyzed in the study. Taking into account the heterogeneity of the habitats examined, they were classidied according to a set of ranked parameters. The application of ordination and correlation techniques for comparing the species composition, abundance, and proportion of species with different levels of synanthropy allows one to reveal that the specific pattern of distribution of small mammals is determined by a complex of interconnected factors. The most influental factors were the level of isolation, the distance from the center of the city and the age of the habitat.

AB  - Urbanization affects streams by modifying hydrology, increasing pollution and disrupting in-stream and riparian conditions, leading to negative responses by biotic communities. Given the global trend of increasing urbanization, improved understanding of its direct and indirect effects at multiple scales is needed to assist management. The theory of stream ecology suggests that the riverscape and the surrounding landscape are inextricably linked, and watershed-scale processes will also affect in-stream conditions and communities. This is particularly true for species with semi-aquatic life cycles, such as amphibians, which transfer energy between streams and surrounding terrestrial areas. We related measures of urbanization at different scales to frog communities in streams along an urbanization gradient in Melbourne, Australia. We used boosted regression trees to determine the importance of predictors and the shape of species responses. We then used structural equation models to investigate possible indirect effects of watershed imperviousness on in-stream parameters. The proportion of riparian vegetation and road density surrounding the site at the reach scale (500-m radius) had positive and negative effects, respectively, on species richness and on the occurrence of the two most common species in the area (Crinia signifera and Limnodynastes dumerilii). Road density and local aquatic vegetation interacted in influencing species richness, suggesting that isolation of a site can prevent colonization, in spite of apparently good local habitat. Attenuated imperviousness at the catchment scale had a negative effect on local aquatic vegetation, indicating possible indirect effects on frog species not revealed by single-level models. Processes at the landscape scale, particularly related to individual ranging distances, can affect frog species directly and indirectly. Catchment imperviousness might not affect adult frogs directly, but by modifying hydrology it can disrupt local vegetation and prove indirectly detrimental. Integrating multiple-scale management actions may help to meet conservation targets for streams in the face of urbanization.

AB  - Since urbanisation and fragmentation result in a decrease in larger forests, the importance of isolated trees as habitat in urban landscapes is increasing. This study investigated the contribution of trees in urban landscapes to the abundance and variety of arthropod taxa. Ants and other arthropods were surveyed on the bark of 341 trees in three types of arrangement: isolated trees, trees in linear corridors and trees in patches. Ant species and other arthropods were identified and the numbers on each tree were counted. In order to determine the effects of host tree properties (size and plant species) and the surrounding environment (arrangement of trees, surrounding land cover), an analysis of covariance was conducted. Tree species was the most important influence, followed by tree size, on ants and other arthropods in the urban landscape, with little effect from the arrangement of trees. Thus, in order to increase arthropod diversity in urban landscapes, it is important to select tree species that attract a large number of arthropod taxa. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urbanisation is associated with the loss and fragmentation of natural land, the disruption of ecosystem functioning and services, and the loss of biodiversity. Cape Town is situated in a global biodiversity hotspot, with high rates of endemism, but both agricultural and housing demands are increasing pressure on remaining patches of natural land and consequently the biodiversity they support. The aims of this study were to use a standardised camera trap survey to determine which native medium and large mammal species still survive in 12 City of Cape Town (CCT) municipal reserves (range 32-8400 ha), and to understand how reserve size, area-perimeter ratio, connectivity, habitat heterogeneity and presence of permanent freshwater aquatic habitat might influence medium and large mammal (>0.5 kg) community composition. Cameras were placed at 151 locations across all reserves using a stratified placement protocol that resulted in 13,360 independent trigger events by targeted taxa. Nineteen native species (11 carnivores, 7 herbivores, 1 omnivore) were recorded, which is 49% of the 39 species believed to have been present historically. Species richness varied from 1 to 12 species (mean +/- SD = 7 +/- 3.6) across reserves, and linear models showed that higher species richness and the presence of large carnivores was best explained by improved connectivity to large amounts of natural habitat. It is recommended that maintaining biodiversity in urban reserves will be best achieved by preserving and establishing corridors of suitable habitat that allow for the movement of animals to and from other patches.

T2  - GREAT LAKES ENTOMOLOGIST

AB  - The spatial distribution of periodical cicada (Magicicada septendecim L. and M. cassini Fisher) emergence in 2007 did not match either historical locations of woodlands or the cicadas' own geography in the 19th and early 20th centuries in Du Page County, Illinois. Cicadas were present in forest areas that had remained above 61 ha throughout historic times, and they were absent from areas which at some point had been reduced below 52 ha by tree removal, mainly for agriculture. Isolation of forest areas also may have contributed to local extinctions. The insects have spread into new, urban woodlands created by residential plantings. Their distribution is associated with the early growth of towns along commuter railways in the eastern part of the county (toward Chicago). A peculiar gap in the main emergence area (encompassing two adjacent cities) may be the result of the cicadas shifting their emergence four years early. An active dispersal on 9-11 June, coinciding with the peak in cicada singing in forested areas, apparently placed scattered small groups of cicadas outside the main emergence area.

AB  - Extensive landscape modification by humans has led to the fragmentation of riparian forests across North America. We compared the vegetation of extant riparian forest along an urban-rural disturbance gradient. In 1999, twenty-five sites along Assiniboine River in Manitoba, Canada were categorized according to land use: urban, suburban, high intensity rural, low intensity rural, and relatively high quality reference forest. Differences in herbaceous, shrub, and tree species composition and diversity were related to the proportion of surrounding land use, forest patch size, connectivity, and area:perimeter ratio. Urban riparian forests were more disturbed and isolated. They were smaller and characterized by drier, more alkaline soils. Moreover, they had significantly lower native and overall understorey species diversity, and had a higher proportion of exotics including Solanum dulcamara and Hesperis matronalis. Suburban forests were less disturbed, faced greater development pressure, and had sandier soils. Although suburban understorey diversity was similar to that of rural forests, suburban sites had a higher proportion of exotic species, especially escaped horticultural and invasive species including Caragana arborescens and Rhamnus cathartica. Reference sites were relatively large and exhibited greater connectivity, but there was little difference in species composition and diversity among high intensity rural, low intensity rural, and reference sites. These site types were less disturbed than either urban or suburban forests, and reference sites were characterized by hydrophilic species including Scirpus fluviatilis and Carex aquatilis. Our results suggest that landscape measures of disturbance, and related changes in environment, may be confidently used to assess impacts of land use on vegetation along urban-rural gradients.

AB  - Urban growth accompanied by sharp environmental changes has degraded ecosystem services (ESs). Green infrastructure (GI) is premised on the various social and ecological benefits of high-quality ESs that humans acquire from natural ecosystems; hence, the conservation of GI can be considered an effective way to safeguard ecological security and contain rapid urban sprawl and outward expansion. Taking Hangzhou, a typical ecologically sensitive but rapidly urbanizing area, as the case study, a GI network was established according to the quantification and mapping of diverse ES values. The equivalent ES value in China based on Xie?s table was adjusted by calculating the priority index and the spatial difference index, and then the adjusted value was applied to obtain the spatial distribution of the comprehensive ES value in Hangzhou. On this basis, the high-level spatial agglomeration area with the highest comprehensive ES value was extracted as a hub using Getis-Ord Gi* hotspot analysis, while the accumulated channel with the lowest cost of comprehensive ES value was generated as a corridor through the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model. Both the established GI network and its buffer were delineated as the GI conservation area, which further supported the revision of the construction area in the Hangzhou Urban Master Plan (2020e2040), which was formulated by urban development policy to coordinate the conflicts between rapid urbanization and ecological protection. This study provides a characteristic example of how to establish GI networks based on ES evaluations and provides a strong reference for land-use and environmental planning in other developing countries and regions that are exposed to severe ecological deterioration. It also proves that GI network identification is not only applicable to ecological security safeguards but can also be regarded as a useful tool for containing rapid urban sprawl and outward expansion to shape and promote a sustainable urban growth pattern. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ecosystem services are strongly influenced by the landscape configuration of natural and human systems. So they are heterogeneous across landscapes. However lack of the knowledge of spatial variations of ecosystem services constrains the effective management and conservation of ecosystems. We presented a spatially explicit and quantitative assessment of the geographic variations in ecosystem services for the Fuzhou City in 2009 using exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and semivariance analysis. Results confirmed a significant and positive spatial autocorrelation, and revealed several hot-spots and cold-spots for the spatial distribution of ecosystem service intensity (ESI) in the study area Also the trend surface analysis indicated that the level of ESI tended to be reduced gradually from north to south and from west to east, with a trough in the urban central area, which was quite in accordance with land-use structure. A more precise cluster map was then developed using the range of lag distance, deriving from semivariance analysis, as neighborhood size instead of default value in the software of ESRI ArcGIS 10.0, and geographical clusters where population growth and land-use pressure varied significantly and positively with ESI across the city were also created by geographically weighted regression (GWR). This study has good policy implications applicable to prioritize areas for conservation or construction, and design ecological corridor to improve ecosystem service delivery to benefiting areas.

AB  - Within oasis-desert ecotone regions, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is an important parameter for evaluating the growth of vegetation. An accurate quantitative study between NDVI and environmental and anthropogenic factors is critical for understand the driving factors of vegetation growth in oasis-desert ecotone. In 2016, four periods Landsat 8 OLI_TIRS images, relevant climatological parameters data (air temperature, air relative humidity, wind velocity and accumulated temperature), land cover type data and soil data were selected as proxies. In order to quantify the explanatory power for NDVI spatial and temporal distribution in the southern edge of Dunhuang City and northern side of the Mingsha Mountain, the geographical detector model was used to explain the potential influences of factors versus the spatial distribution of NDVI, and each explanatory variable's relative importance can be calculated. The factor detector results disclose that the spatial distribution of NDVI is primarily dominated by land cover type. The risk detector results show that, high NDVI region is located within woodland. The mean value of NDVI displays an increase and then decrease trend with air temperature increase. With the increase of wind velocity and decrease of air relative humidity, the NDVI value shows a decrease trend. The interactive q values between the two factors are higher than any q value of separated factors. Results also indicate that the strongest interactive effects of NDVI are different in distinct seasons. Consequently, anthropogenic activity is more important than environmental factors on NDVI in oasis-desert ecotone. We also demonstrate that air relative humidity rather than air temperature have played a greater role in NDVI spatial distribution.

AB  - Cities annex wilderness and alter the interactions between the plant and animal assemblages embedded in the remaining nature fragments. Here, we explore consequences of habitat fragmentation for dispersal of cactus by fruit-eating mammals in the Sonoran Desert landscape. We use the barrel cactus, Ferocactus wislizeni, as a model system to diagnose (1) how fruit utilization by a mammal assemblage changes with fragment area and isolation, (2) what characteristics make individual plants particularly susceptible to frugivore failure, and (3) how inter-fragment differences in plant-frugivore interactions influence the seedlings' susceptibility to other stressors (granivores and drought). We described the type and phenology of plant-animal interactions in 20 fragments along a 0.05-500 ha size continuum within a large city (Tucson, Arizona, USA), and combined allometric scaling models of mammalian home ranges and descriptions of plant size distributions to predict the fraction of the fruit crops accessible to resident mammalian frugivores in each fragment. Fruit removal rates generally increased along a continuum of fragment sizes, and older, taller plants were particularly susceptible to frugivore failure and more likely to have fruits attacked by granivorous rodents. As a result, thresholds where the nature and/or phenology of a plant's interactions with animals changes can be accurately predicted by integrating descriptions of fragment size, fragment isolation, and plant population structure. Last, we found support for the hypothesis that fragmentation-induced changes in the phenology of fruit removal compromise the seedlings' ability to exploit precipitation delivered in winter and spring. Specifically, as a result of slower fruit removal, the seed crops in small fragments forfeit access to an increasing proportion of the rains between October and March, which determine whether cactus seedlings can survive the following dry season (April, May, June). We expect these inter-site differences in the type and phenology of interactions to compromise the integrity of plant populations in smaller fragments, to become increasingly influential in ecological settings in the Sonoran Desert where access to precipitation is essential, and to become increasingly prevalent as the plants in newly fragmented plant populations age (grow) to sizes that are more susceptible to frugivore failure in the defaunated landscapes.

AB  - Background: The role of linear transportation infrastructures (roads, railways, oil and gas pipelines, power lines, rivers and canals) in fragmenting natural habitats is fully acknowledged. Up to now, the potential of linear transportation infrastructures verges (road and railway embankments, strips of grass under power lines or above buried pipelines, or waterway banks) as habitat or corridor for biodiversity, remains controversial. In a context of decreasing natural habitats, the opportunities of anthropogenic areas for contributing to wildlife conservation have to be considered. The present paper is the first synthesis of evidence about the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as corridor and/or habitat for insects in temperate landscapes.
   Methods: A systematic literature survey was made using two online publication databases, a search engine and by sending a call for literature to subject experts. Identified articles were successively screened for relevance on titles, abstracts and full texts using criteria detailed in an a priori protocol. We then used six specific questions to categorize and to critically appraise the retained studies. These questions encompassed the potential of verges as habitats and corridors for insects, and the effects of management and landscape context on these potentialities. A user-friendly database was created to sort the studies with low and medium susceptibility to bias. We used these studies to synthesize results of each specific question in a narrative synthesis. Finally, studies that met the meta-analysis requirements were used for a quantitative synthesis.
   Results: Our searches identified 64,206 articles. After critical appraisal, 91 articles that reported 104 studies were included in our review. Almost all of them had "control-impact" design, only two studies used "before-after-controlimpact" design, and one study used "before-after" design. In some cases, artificialization of transportation infrastructures lowered insect biodiversity while vegetation restoration had a moderate positive effect; the trend remained unclear for mowing/grazing practices. Urbanization and agriculture in the surroundings tended to lower the biodiversity hosted by verges, while natural and forested areas tended to promote it. No study dealt with the influence of management or surrounding landscape on insect dispersal along the verge. The small number of studies that compared the dispersal along verges and in habitats away from transportation infrastructures, together with the inconsistencies of their results, prevented us from drawing conclusions. Meta-analyses were performed on 709 cases from 34 primary studies that compared biodiversity in verges vs. other habitats. Overall insect species richness did not differ between LTI verges and compared habitats. Globally, insect abundance seemed higher on LTI verges than in compared habitats, a result driven by the higher abundance of pollinators and primary consumers on non-highway road verges than in habitats away from roads.
   Conclusions: A major knowledge gap regarding the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as corridors for insects has been identified. Thus, we encourage more research on this topic. Infrastructure practitioners could benefit from our results about linear transportation infrastructure verges as habitat for certain taxa and about the impact of their management practices on insect abundance and species richness.

AB  - Understanding the factors contributing to maintaining biodiversity is crucial to mitigate the impact of anthropogenic disturbances. Representing large proportions of green area in highly modified landscapes, residential gardens are often seen as local habitats that can contribute to larger networks of suitable environments at the landscape scale.
   We investigated the impact of the landscape context on butterfly communities observed in residential gardens, taking into account garden characteristics, land-use types and presence of linear features in the surrounding landscape. We examined how species traits affected butterflies' response to landscape context and habitat quality.
   We performed a cross-scale study, based on citizen science data documenting butterfly species composition and abundance in 920 gardens across France. We examined the effect of garden quality, the area of different land-use types and the length of linear elements measured at three scales within the surrounding landscape. Species were grouped according to their habitat preference and mobility.
   Urbanization negatively affected total species richness and the abundance of butterfly in each group. This was related to declining habitat quality and reduced area of suitable habitat in the surrounding landscape. The magnitude of this effect, however, was negatively correlated with mobility, a trait related to habitat preference. The spatial scale at which landscape context best explained variation in butterfly abundance changed with species' habitat preference.
   This study highlights the importance of preserving high quality habitats in altered landscapes and considering species' mobility and habitat preference when assessing the impact of landscapes on butterfly communities.

AB  - Engineered soils provide numerous ecosystem services in urban landscapes, such as water regulation and plant growth. They are constructed to optimize soil physicochemical properties but their biological properties are given little consideration. In particular, earthworm communities may be highly impacted by soil engineering processes and soil isolation caused by asphalted surfaces separating soils, and in particular roadside soils, from pseudo-natural soils. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate (i) the effects of soil engineering processes applied to construct roadside soils, and (ii) the effects of soil isolation from pseudo-natural soils by asphalted surfaces on earthworm communities. The study was conducted in an urban landscape in the suburbs of Paris, France. We sampled earthworms in roadside soils from two distinct soil engineering processes: basic engineering (BER) associated with shallow stripping depth and advanced engineering (AER) associated with deep stripping depth and organic amendment. Within each soil engineering process, two levels of soil isolation were defined depending on the asphalted surface separating roadside soils from pseudo-natural soils: light isolation (LI) in case of a narrow cycle path, and high isolation (HI) in case of a wide road. Soil engineering did not affect the total earthworm abundance whereas the total species richness was negatively impacted in comparison to nearby pseudo-natural soils. High soil isolation differently impacted earthworm communities depending on the engineering process. Regarding AER, earthworm abundance and species richness were significantly lower in HI than in LI while no differences were observed between BER-LI and BER-HI. Overall, engineering processes define the soil's ability to host earthworms, and soil isolation defines soil ability to be colonized from nearby environments. Considering the contribution of earthworms to the provision of ecosystem services, both soil engineering and soil isolation should be taken into account in urban projects to optimize their development in urban landscapes.

AB  - The microbial communities inhabiting urban soils determine the functioning of these soils, in regards to their ability to cycle nutrients and support plant communities. In an increasingly urbanized world these properties are of the utmost importance, and the microbial communities responsible are worthy of exploration. We used 53 grassland sites spread across Berlin to describe and explain the impacts of urbanity and other environmental parameters upon the diversity and community composition of four microbial groups. These groups were (i) the Fungi, with a separate dataset for (ii) the Glomeromycota, (iii) the Bacteria, and (iv) the protist phylum Cercozoa. We found that urbanity had distinct impacts on fungal richness, which tended to increase. Geographic distance between sites and soil chemistry, in addition to urbanity, drove microbial community composition, with site connectivity being important for Glomeromycotan communities, potentially due to plant host communities. Our findings suggest that many microbial species are well adapted to urban soils, as supported by an increase in diversity being a far more common result of urbanity than the reverse. However, we also found distinctly separate distributions of operational taxonomic unit (OTU)s from the same species, shedding doubt of the reliability of indicator species, and the use of taxonomy to draw conclusion on functionality. Our observational study employed an extensive set of sites across an urbanity gradient, in the region of the German capital, to produce a rich microbial dataset; as such it can serve as a blueprint for other such investigations.

AB  - Especially in urban landscapes under intense urbanization pressure, artificial surfaces affect many components of the urban ecosystem and disrupt the flow of natural cycles. Due to the decrease in the continuity of the green system, population movement is interrupted, biodiversity decreases, the precipitation water infiltration capacity of soils and the transpiration rates decline as a result of sparse and interrupted vegetation cover, and the increase of impermeable surfaces trigger runoff rates and density. The artificial topography created by artificial surfaces, wind-shadow corridors, and urban heat island formations can be counted among further main adverse effects of the unplanned increase in artificial surfaces. Considering all these negative effects, relationships between the artificial surfaces and the green system were evaluated in our research. For this purpose, the criteria of surface cover type, surface flow direction, and slope were overlapped according to the weight ratios determined with the help of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). A map of priority areas, which enabled us to interpret the disruptions caused by artificial surfaces in the urban ecosystem, was produced. This map has been evaluated with a holistic perception to guide sustainable stormwater management and landscape planning and restoration and management processes related to the urban ecosystem. Artificial surfaces, which dominate the landscape with 62% surface cover in the research area, were assessed in terms of building blocks, transportation networks, and hardscapes, while suggestions were made for sustainable urban landscape planning.

AB  - Questions
   (1) How do seres differ with respect to vegetation changes? (2) What are the directions of succession? (3) How do species numbers change? (4) How do target species, i.e. those typical of natural and semi-natural vegetation, participate in succession? (5) Are spontaneously developed successional stages acceptable from the point of view of ecosystem restoration?
   Location
   Extracted peatlands, bulldozed sites in forests destroyed by air pollution, an emerged bottom of a water reservoir, corridors of former Iron Curtain, artificial fishpond islands and barriers, sedimentary basins, spoil heaps from mining, stone quarries, forest clearings, road verges, sand and gravel-sand pits, ruderal urban sites, river gravel bars and abandoned arable fields, located in various parts of the Czech Republic in Central Europe.
   Methods
   Phytosociological releves were recorded in 10-25m(2) plots located in the centre of representative successional stages defined by their age, ranging from 1 to 100yrs. In total, we obtained 2392 vegetation samples containing 951 species. We performed DCA ordination to compare 19 seres. Desirable target species were considered as those representing (semi)-natural vegetation and all Red List species.
   Results
   The seres studied are more similar in their species composition in the initial and early stages, in which synathropic species prevail, than in the later stages when the vegetation differentiates. This divergence is driven mainly by local moisture conditions. In most cases, succession led to woodland, which usually established after ca. 20yrs. In very dry or wet places (with limited presence of woody species) open vegetation developed, often highly valuable from the restoration and conservation point of view. The total number of species and the number of target species increased in the majority of seres with successional age.
   Conclusions
   The vegetation in the sites studied formed a continuum along a moisture gradient and by successional age. The individual seres largely overlapped in their species composition; the sere identity was not significant. Spontaneous succession usually proceeded towards woodland, except at very dry or wet sites, and generally appeared to be an ecologically suitable way of ecosystem restoration of disturbed sites because target species became dominant over time.

AB  - Green roofs and walls have recently emerged as conservation tools, and they offer promising additional opportunities to enhance biodiversity in cities. However, their ecological conditions remain poorly considered when planning wildlife corridors. To discuss the role of vegetated buildings in landscape connectivity, we reviewed the ecological and technical specificities of green walls and green roofs in light of the key factors concerning urban wildlife (patch size, quality, abundance, and isolation). Green roofs and walls show limited patch sizes, distinct habitat quality at the building scale, and limited redundancy of patch quality within the landscape. We also highlight that the abundance of roof and wall patches is often low. Future research is needed to establish if walls can be vertical corridors for wildlife, thereby reducing the isolation of green roofs. We argue that creating 3D ecological connectivity within the city requires substantial modifications of the design and maintenance of existing green building systems. We suggest that research is needed to integrate the biotic and abiotic characteristics of green buildings to make them more closely resemble those of open green spaces.

AB  - Over the past decades, Western European hedgerows have been declining as a result of land use change. Disused infrastructure corridors such as railways and tramways can host a range of existing and returning semi-natural habitats, including extensive hedgerow networks. However, long term corridor abandonment can result in network deterioration to gappy hedgerows, lines of trees and eventually individual scrub features. The loss of hedgerows results in the loss of many ecosystem services, habitat for species and landscape connectivity. This highlights an increasing need to find innovative solutions to recognise and appropriately maintain these hedgerow networks. European Greenways typically 'upcycle' disused infrastructure transport corridors for multiuse, non-motorised recreational public infrastructure. The potential for European greenways to maintain and restore hedgerows is of interest as a novel planning mechanism for enhancing green infrastructure in general. The aim of this study is to inform Greenway design and management through the evaluation of hedgerow significance (historical, ecological and landscape), condition and composition within a rural European Greenway landscape context. 81 hedgerows were sampled along a 70 km proposed Greenway route traversing a range of extensive and intensive landscapes. Hedgerows were surveyed using a rapid field score sheet which enabled significance and condition scoring. A hedgerow typology was subsequently developed based on species composition assemblages. Hedgerows were found to be highly ecologically significant and species rich throughout the route. On-going land use intensification was evident as significant sections of the former railway corridor were subsumed into intensive agriculture and afforestation. Management recommendations need to be adapted to the particular hedgerow group and surrounding landscape context, and take into account the varied requirements of different taxonomic groups. The study findings show Greenways have the potential to act as multifunctional green infrastructure (accomplishing both ecological and recreational objectives) through informed design to reinforce their nature conservation role and recognising hedgerows as integral landscape feature of Greenway corridor, at local level and as part of a wider European network.

AB  - Urbanization is a major cause of amphibian decline. Stream-dwelling plethodontid salamanders are particularly susceptible to urbanization due to declining water quality and hydrological changes, but few studies have examined these taxa in cities. The northern dusky salamander (Desmognathus fuscus) was once common in the New York City metropolitan area, but has substantially declined throughout the region in recent decades. We used five tetranucleotide microsatellite loci to examine population differentiation, genetic variation, and bottlenecks among five remnant urban populations of dusky salamanders in NYC. These genetic measures provide information on isolation, prevalence of inbreeding, long-term prospects for population persistence, and potential for evolutionary responses to future environmental change. All populations were genetically differentiated from each other, and the most isolated populations in Manhattan have maintained very little genetic variation (i.e. < 20% heterozygosity). A majority of the populations also exhibited evidence of genetic bottlenecks. These findings contrast with published estimates of high genetic variation within and lack of structure between populations of other desmognathine salamanders sampled over similar or larger spatial scales. Declines in genetic variation likely resulted from population extirpations and the degradation of stream and terrestrial paths for dispersal in NYC. Loss of genetic variability in populations isolated by human development may be an underappreciated cause and/or consequence of the decline of this species in urbanized areas of the northeast USA.

AB  - Powerline clearings are common in urban and semi-urban landscapes worldwide. The clearings could potentially promote flowering species associated with open-canopy habitats, and provide alternative habitat for species dependent on semi-natural grasslands, but the empirical evidence for this hypothesis is weak. We carried out a large-scale field study of understorey plant communities at 51 sites in powerline clearings and adjacent boreal forest. At each site, we placed four 4 m x 5 m plots with five 1-m(2) subplots in the clearing centre and a parallel set of plots 100 m into the adjacent forest. Habitat characteristics were sampled at plot and site level and from digital maps. The clearings had a higher richness of species associated with semi-natural grasslands, and a higher richness of shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant forb species. Total plant richness and diversity were higher in the clearings than in the forests. The magnitude of difference in species composition between clearings and forest, and plant community properties in the clearings, depended on the environmental context (age of the clearing, productivity, shading by tree regrowth, landscape fragmentation, climate). Our results indicate that over time, powerline clearings develop into novel habitats. Low-productive sites were dominated by Ericaceaous dwarfs shrubs. Richness of forbs and semi-natural grassland species in the clearings increased with productivity. Richness of shade-intolerant forbs and semi-natural grassland species increased with fragmentation of the surrounding landscape. We conclude that frequent clearing of productive sites can enhance plant biodiversity including richness of insect-pollinated species and mitigate the loss of species associated with semi-natural grasslands.

AB  - Evaluating fine-scale population structure of multiple species in the same landscape increases our ability to identify common patterns as well as discern ecological differences among species' landscape genetic relationships. In the Palouse bioregion of northern Idaho, USA, 99% of the native prairie has been converted to nonirrigated agriculture and exotic grasslands. Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) and long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) in this area breed almost entirely in artificial ponds on private land. We used genetic distances (F-ST and D-c) derived from eight microsatellite loci in 783 samples to evaluate the relationships among sympatric breeding populations (N = 20 and 26) of these species in a 213-km2 landscape. Both species showed a pattern of isolation by distance that was not improved when distance was measured along drainages instead of topographically corrected straight lines (P < 0.01). After testing for autocorrelation among genetic distances, we used an information theoretic approach to model landscape resistance based on slope, soil type, solar insolation, and land cover, and multi-model inference to rank the resistance of landscape surfaces to dispersal (represented by genetic distance). For both species, urban and rural developed land cover provided the highest landscape resistances. Resistance values for long-toed salamanders followed a moisture gradient where forest provided the least resistance, while agriculture and shrub/clearcut provided the least resistance for Columbia spotted frogs. Comparative landscape genetics can be a powerful tool for detecting similarities and differences between codistributed species, and resulting models can be used to predict species-specific responses to landscape change.

AB  - 1. Urbanisation is one of the main land-use changes behind global insect collapse. Despite that previous studies have described the negative effects of urbanisation on insect communities, so far there is no synthesis that considers multiple urban drivers, their combined effects, and the role of species traits altogether.
   2. Here we developed an integrative framework of the underlying mechanisms behind terrestrial insect species loss in cities by exploring five leading drivers: impervious surfaces, habitat fragmentation, urban heat island, pollution, and exotic plants. For each driver, we identified the main direct and indirect (mediated through species interactions or changes in resources) effects on insect populations and communities, emphasising the role of species traits as moderators of such effects.
   3. Body size, mobility, and oviposition/nesting requirements were the traits that frequently defined insect vulnerability to urban drivers. Urban heat island and pollution deserve further research from a community-level approach. Direct effects of drivers dominated the literature, while most indirect paths were mediated by changes in resources rather than species interactions.
   4. In conclusion, our review showed the challenges of recognising particular effects and mechanisms for each urban driver and their combined effects. By doing so, we intended to encourage researchers to address some of the gaps we noticed in order to fully understand how urbanisation is affecting insect communities. Finally, we outlined the main recent urban planning strategies and future challenges in order to successfully conserve urban insect biodiversity.

AB  - Aim Cities worldwide are characterized by unique human stressors that filter species based on their traits, potentially leading to biodiversity loss. The knowledge of which species are filtered and at which scale is important to gain a more mechanistic understanding of urban community assembly and to develop strategies to manage human impact on urban ecosystems. We investigate the ecological mechanisms shaping urban community assembly, taking into account changes across scales, taxa and urban green space types. Location City of Zurich, Switzerland. Taxon Carabid beetles and wild bees. Methods We use a large species occurrence and trait dataset with a high spatial resolution to assess the filtering effect of a medium-sized city on a regional pool of potential colonists. We then assess the filtering from the urban pool to five widely distributed types of urban green spaces. Results We found that our model city selects for functionally similar but taxonomically diverse bee and carabid beetle species from the regional species pool. Within the city, community assembly processes vary among green space types and taxa resulting in important changes in community taxonomic and functional composition. Main conclusions Our findings suggest that urban community assembly is a multi-scale process dominated by the strong environmental filtering from a regional to an urban species pool. This leads to the selection of species pre-adapted to urban conditions. Spatial habitat heterogeneity within and among UGS types can maintain an important taxonomic diversity within cities. However, increasing urban functional diversity would require stronger management efforts that consider regional ecological processes.

AB  - Forest fragmentation caused by human activities has many implications for natural landscapes, such as habitat reduction and the loss of biodiversity. This study investigated the temporal fragmentation process of forest remnants in a strongly agro-industrialised region in southern Brazil over 25 years. The studied watershed area hosts two important typologies of the Atlantic Forest biome as well as Quaternary remnants of the Brazilian Savanna biome, which are considered hotspots of biodiversity and reflect the intense process of forest fragmentation caused by Brazilian urban and agro-industrial development. Thus, studies encompassing multitemporal scales are paramount to understanding changes in forest patterns and are fundamental for trend predictions of landscape dynamics. To perform the calculation of the mean normalised difference vegetation index, Landsat satellite images from 1991 to 2016 were processed using SPRING (R) software. Subsequently, FRAGSTATS (R) software was used to calculate landscape metrics. A reduction in the number of forest fragments since 1991 was observed, with a maximum amount of 5 243 fragments in 1993 that declined to 4 015 fragments in 2016. Although the number of fragments in the watershed decreased, the mean area increased by 72.9% and the mean of the shape index increased from 1.3 in 1991 to 1.5 in 2016. In addition, there was a 64.7% increase in the edge density and a reduction of 35.6 m in the isolation between the nearest neighbours. The degree of isolation of the fragments underwent a process of expansion and reduction when compared to 1991, presenting results that support the hypothesis that the Atlantic Forest is in a process of stabilisation and forest restoration.

AB  - Owing to the ability of depicting the spatial distribution of land surface temperatures (LST) and land cover, remote sensing images have been used to analyze the relationship between urban heat island (UHI) and land use/cover changes (LUCC) in recent years. As one prominent feature of LUCC in urbanization process, urban roads are extended and expanded to form complex urban thermal corridors. This study estimates the relationship by investigating urban thermal environmental impacts caused by LUCC in the buffer areas of the urban roads. Multi-temporal remote sensing images, including Landsat TM/ETM+ data from September 19, 1987, September 6, 1994 September 14, 2000 and August 12, 2005 in Xuzhou city, are employed to explore land use types and derive land surface temperatures at different period. An integrating classification method based on decision tree classifier and object-oriented method is used for improving land cover classification accuracy. By analyzing the relationship between brightness temperature and vegetation indices, e.g., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), the relationship between UHI and LUCC is estimated quantitatively. Change results and regression analysis show that total transformation rate of LUCC behaves linearly decreased with increasing distance to roads while the transformation rate from other types to building/road has a negative exponent relation with the distance to roads. Analysis to urban green space and thermal landscape indicates that brightness temperature is negatively correlated with the. NDVI but positively related with NDBI. It is concluded that urban vegetation system plays a unique role in monitoring the urban thermal environment.

AB  - It is hypothesized that biodiversity is maintained by interactions at local and regional spatial scales. Many sustainability plans and management practices reflect the need to conserve biodiversity, yet once these plans are implemented, the ecological consequences are not well understood. By learning how management practices affect local environmental factors and dispersal in a region, ecologists and natural resource managers can better understand the implications of management choices. We investigated the interaction of local and regional scale processes in the built environment, where human-impacts are known to influence both. Our goal was to determine how the interaction between spatial variation in habitat heterogeneity in algal management of urban ponds and dispersal shape biodiversity at local and regional spatial scales. A twelve-week mesocosm study was conducted where pond management and dispersal were manipulated to determine how spatial variation in habitat and dispersal from various source pools influence zooplankton metacommunities in urban stormwater ponds. We hypothesized that dispersal from managed or unmanaged source pools will lead to community divergence and local management practices will act as an environmental filter, both reducing beta diversity between managed ponds and driving compositional divergence. Our results suggest that zooplankton dispersal from managed or unmanaged source pools was important to explaining divergence in community composition. Furthermore, local management of algae marginally reduced compositional turnover of zooplankton among ponds but did not lead to significant divergence in community composition. Management practices may act as strong environmental filters by reducing beta diversity between ponds. As hypothesized, source pool constraints led to compositional divergence and local management practices resulted in reduced compositional turnover between ponds. The results of this study suggest that sustainability and management plans may have complex effects on biodiversity both within and across spatial scales. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urbanization is a major factor driving habitat fragmentation and connectivity loss in wildlife. However, the impacts of urbanization on connectivity can vary among species and even populations due to differences in local landscape characteristics, and our ability to detect these relationships may depend on the spatial scale at which they are measured. Bobcats (Lynx rufus) are relatively sensitive to urbanization and the status of bobcat populations is an important indicator of connectivity in urban coastal southern California. We genotyped 271 bobcats at 13,520 SNP loci to conduct a replicated landscape resistance analysis in five genetically distinct populations. We tested urban and natural factors potentially influencing individual connectivity in each population separately, as well as study-wide. Overall, landscape genomic effects were most frequently detected at the study-wide spatial scale, with urban land cover (measured as impervious surface) having negative effects and topographic roughness having positive effects on gene flow. The negative effect of urban land cover on connectivity was also evident when populations were analyzed separately despite varying substantially in spatial area and the proportion of urban development, confirming a pervasive impact of urbanization largely independent of spatial scale. The effect of urban development was strongest in one population where stream habitat had been lost to development, suggesting that riparian corridors may help mitigate reduced connectivity in urbanizing areas. Our results demonstrate the importance of replicating landscape genetic analyses across populations and considering how landscape genetic effects may vary with spatial scale and local landscape structure.

AB  - Constructing an urban ecological corridor system is a major component and critical factor of forming an effective network within an urban ecosystem. Shenzhen, as a highly urbanized area in China, is facing the dual pressures of urban development and ecological conservation. The ecological corridors in Shenzhen are being constantly eroded by urban expansion, resulting in an urgent need to carry out sensitivity evaluations and ecological land management studies. By identifying the spatial range of planned ecological corridors in Shenzhen, we develop a GIS-based ecological sensitivity evaluation model from the perspectives of soil environment, habitat conditions, geological hazards, and human disturbance. Management strategies are proposed with regard to macroscopic protection guidance and microscopic land-use control. The results show that there is little difference in the sensitivity grade of ecological corridors in Shenzhen. With regard to spatial distribution, the sensitivity level is high in the north and low in the south, with moderately sensitive corridors being the dominant type. Meanwhile, we design the land-use control program by taking into account the present management and new land demand and provide the path for implementing the withdrawal, reservation, occupation, and avoidance polices. The results of the sensitivity evaluation objectively reflect the eco-environmental condition of ecological corridors in Shenzhen. The classified and graded protection guidance and space regulatory framework proposed in this study are of significance for guiding the ecological conservation, land use, and sustainable development in urban contexts with similar issues.

AB  - Movement is an ecological process that affects individual fitness and population dynamics of species. Understanding movement patterns is crucial for the effective conservation of amphibian populations isolated by urban development. Here, we conducted a capture-recapture study over 6 years in a population of the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) inhabiting a 7.3-ha patch of forest and disturbed land-use types in an urbanised catchment north-west of Budapest, Hungary. We investigated relationships between movement distances and environmental, spatial and demographic parameters in order to understand how this species is able to persist in a relatively small and isolated habitat patch. We found that most movement was aggregated around a permanent stream and that movement distances were generally <= 200 m, with maximum distances of 925 and 707 m for males and females, respectively. Movement patterns within the population were best modelled using a negative exponential function characterised by infrequent long-distance movement. Males had substantially larger home range sizes than females and were predicted to have larger movement distances. Mean movement distances were predicted to be larger in disturbed areas in the upper stream catchment which included residential areas, compared with smaller movements in more natural forest near the stream. There was a positive relationship between mean movement distance and body condition. Our results suggest that this local population persists in a relatively small habitat patch because it provides a stable breeding site and suitable foraging and shelter microhabitats. Conservation of the local population requires protection of the structure, connectivity and quality of forest and stream habitats, and preventing urban development in the surrounding catchment.

AB  - The fungal richness, diversity and community composition in the Quercus macrocarpa phyllosphere were compared across a growing season in trees located in six stands within and outside a small urban center using 454-sequencing and DNA tagging. The approaches did not differentiate between endophytic and epiphytic fungal communities.
   Fungi accumulated in the phyllosphere rapidly and communities were temporally dynamic, with more than a third of the analyzed operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and half of the BLAST-inferred genera showing distinct seasonal patterns. The seasonal patterns could be explained by fungal life cycles or environmental tolerances.
   The communities were hyperdiverse and differed between the urban and nonurban stands, albeit not consistently across the growing season. Foliar macronutrients (nitrogen (N), potassium (K) and sulfur (S)), micronutrients (boron (B), manganese (Mn) and selenium (Se)) and trace elements (cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn)) were enriched in the urban trees, probably as a result of anthropogenic activities. Because of correlations with the experimental layout, these chemical elements should not be considered as community drivers without further empirical studies.
   We suggest that a combination of mechanisms leads to differences between urban and nonurban communities. Among those are stand isolation and size, nutrient and pollutant accumulation plus stand management, including fertilization and litter removal.

AB  - Understanding the environmental factors driving species-genetic diversity correlations (SGDCs) is critical for designing appropriate conservation and management strategies to protect biodiversity. Yet, few studies have explored the impact of changing land use patterns on SGDCs specifically in aquatic communities. This study examined patterns of genetic diversity in roach (Rutilus rutilus L.) together with fish species composition across 19 locations in a large river catchment, spanning a gradient in land use. Our findings show significant correlations between some, but not all, species and genetic diversity end points. For example, genetic and species differentiation showed a weak but significant linear relationship across the Thames catchment, but additional diversity measures such as allelic richness and fish population abundance did not. Further examination of patterns in species and genetic diversity indicated that land use intensification has a modest effect on fish diversity compared to the combined influence of geographical isolation and land use intensification. These results indicate that environmental changes in riparian habitats have the potential to amplify shifts in the composition of stream fish communities in poorly connected river stretches. Conservation and management strategies for fish populations should, therefore, focus on enhancing connectivity between river stretches and limit conversion of nearby land to arable or urban use to maintain current levels of biodiversity.

AB  - Wildlife conservation in urban habitats is increasingly important due to current urbanization trends. We review the different approaches to studying birds in urban landscapes, and point out the importance of the habitat island ecological theory as a research framework for the management and conservation of urban birds. Based on two comprehensive research projects conducted at urban parks in Spain (Madrid) and Finland (Oulu and Rovaniemi), several different issues related to bird conservation in cities are discussed, main findings of these projects are presented, and future research needs are suggested. Urban parks are important biodiversity hotspots in cities. Fragmentation conditions have the same deleterious effects to urban birds as in other fragmented landscapes. Park size accounts for species accumulation in urban parks; this pattern being highly nested. Urban parks of 10-35 ha would contain most of the species recorded in cities, but other indicators related to the probabilities of persistence of the target species should be obtained. Wooded streets can increase urban landscape connectivity by providing alternative habitat for feeding and nesting during the breeding season. Because increasing the size of parks is difficult in cities, enhancement of habitat diversity and resource availability for birds within parks (e.g. nest boxes, winter feeding tables, etc.) appears to be a straightforward way of increasing urban bird diversity. However, human disturbance (pedestrians) should be controlled since it can negatively influence many urban birds. We present a conceptual model for urban bird conservation, which includes three aspects (management, environmental education and research) and new alternatives to promote the involvement of different sectors of the society.

AB  - China has rapidly expanded economically and spatially in recent years; the booming construction industry necessary to support this growth has significantly impacted the country's ecological future. This study was conducted to determine the ecological stress of construction lands in terms of quantity and spatial locations under the landscape ecology concepts of "Quantity-Oriented Ecological Stress" (QOES) and "Location-Oriented Ecological Stress" (LOES). We first provide a brief introduction of the study area (Southern Jiangsu, Eastern China) followed by a discussion of the methodology and data processing techniques applied. We next examine the spatial heterogeneity of ecological suitability (ES) from the perspective of ecological process analysis and divide Southern Jiangsu into five ecological zones with different ES levels. We then classify construction lands based on their spatial distribution in different ecological zones. We calculated county-level LOES and compared it against QOES; we also discuss our research contributions and policy implications in regard to the spatial allocation of construction lands. The locations of construction lands are of significance to ecological safety, and location effects correspond to the spatial heterogeneity of regional ecosystems. A location-oriented evaluation more objectively reflects the ecological stress of construction lands expansion than a quantity-oriented evaluation. Optimizing land development practices serves not only to control the quantity of construction lands but also the construction lands concession and ecological restoration in areas with high ES.

AB  - The Lake Simcoe Watershed (LSW) is an important natural resource, supporting varied agricultural, recreational, and tourism activities for millions of people. Historically, major alterations to land uses have occurred throughout the watershed, resulting in increases of nutrients and contaminants, and alteration of hydrological and thermal regimes. The combination of these stressors has the potential to elicit greater impacts on ecosystem health than any one stressor in isolation, yet no studies have examined their effects on stream health and aquatic biota in the LSW. In this study, we quantified the impacts of multiple stressors on indices of biotic integrity, as well as assessments of benthic invertebrate and fish community composition from 2004 to 2012. Using a suite of multivariate analyses, we examined stressors across three categories of environmental variables: water quality, temperature, and hydrology. Water quality explained the largest amount of variation in stream health and biological community composition, followed by water temperature and hydrological variables, respectively. Total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, and iron concentrations, as well as the 7-day low flow and the mean summer temperature, were identified as predictors of both fish and benthic invertebrate variance. Multiple stressor interactions were detected for fish communities, although these interactions were of lower relative importance than for individual stressors. In contrast, no significant stressor interactions were found to influence benthic invertebrate communities. Overall, our results reinforce the importance of ecosystem monitoring, and the need to consider the influence of multiple aspects of ecosystem function, when examining the health of aquatic systems.

AB  - Bird communities on the 20 fragmented woodlots in a suburban area were surveyed in the Tokorozawa City, Central Japan, to analyze the factors that influenced the distribution of birds. Our results showed that woodlot area is an important predictor of the number of individuals and the species richness of birds in each woodlot. Based on the species composition of birds in wintering season, the fragmented woodlots were classified into four types by TWINSPAN: those are core woodlots, woodlots surrounding core ones, isolated and small woodlots, and isolated and middle-sized woodlots. By canonical discriminant analysis, it was indicated that the connectivity between woodlots and the vegetation structure are also important factors influencing bird communities. The necessity of controlling these factors for avian conservation was pointed out.

AB  - Ponds are lentic waterbodies with a high conservation value for biodiversity that have long been overlooked by management policies. Recent initiatives aimed to promote the conservation of these ecosystems by restoring or creating new ponds throughout Europe. Therefore, studying responses of aquatic invertebrates to local pond characteristics and connectivity between them is determinant to understand community dynamics and colonization processes of these scattered ecosystems. We studied larval communities of odonates in 20 created or restored ponds to assess their colonization during the first 2 or 3 years. Community dynamics in relation to pond vegetation, landscape context and connectivity with other ponds were also investigated. No difference in species richness was found between restored and created ponds. Most species colonized the ponds during the first year, but a different pattern in colonization was observed between Anisoptera and Zygoptera. Community composition was related to the landscape context of ponds and the time since pond creation or restoration. Abundances were positively related to pond connectivity, especially in the suborder Zygoptera. No relationship was found between vegetation and Anisopteran larvae, while Zygoptera seem more sensible to the vegetation structure due to their endophytic oviposition. This work confirms the high colonization capacity of odonates and shows that creation of new ponds could be as efficient as pond restoration to enhance the conservation of freshwater species. It also highlights that landscape characteristics and connectivity between ponds are determinant to support higher abundances and a posteriori increase population viability at the landscape scale.

AB  - Preserving and expanding green infrastructure (GI) is key to biodiversity conservation in cities, but a significant share of urban land is commonly underutilized in GI plans: gardens. This is despite the fact that gardens can support diverse wildlife communities by providing habitat and by functioning as corridors. In this article, we apply circuit theory-based modeling in order to quantify the contribution of two types of gardens to connectivity in the city of Braunschweig, Germany: private gardens and allotment gardens. We ran four permeability scenarios: 1.) all green spaces including private and allotment gardens are permeable; 2.) private gardens are non permeable; 3.) allotment gardens are non-permeable; 4.) only public green spaces but no gardens are permeable. We based our modeling on the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), a common, relatively well-understood and well-liked urban species. Observations by citizen scientists were used for a plausibility analysis and interpreting the results. Our results confirm the importance of gardens for providing habitat and connectivity. The overall landscape permeability to the movement of hedgehogs would decrease by 75% and the area of core habitats would decline by 63% without private and allotment gardens. While private gardens contribute most to landscape connectivity, some allotment gardens occupy key areas for the overall connectivity in the city. In conclusion, circuit theory-based modeling is a promising tool for urban GI planning and the output of those models can inform decision makers and gardeners.

AB  - Urbanisation is a growing global phenomenon having multiple ecological consequences. However, the effects of urbanisation on biodiversity remain ambiguous, and some evidence exists that cities provide valuable secondary habitats for many species, possibly mitigating regional biodiversity loss. Therefore, the value of urban sites for biodiversity depends on local habitat conditions and the configuration of the surrounding landscape. We aimed to disentangle the effects of local habitatparameters (management, plant diversity) and urban matrix variables (urbanisation, isolation) on carabid beetle and spider diversity and traits in informal urban green spaces in Berlin, Germany. Habitat management and isolation were the most important influences on carabid beetle and spider species and trait compositions. Spider communities of irregular managed sites contained 2.5 times more species of conservation concern than extensive (regular) managed sites. Moreover, irregular managed sites contained larger species (both for carabid beetles and spiders) and affected the hunting mode of spiders. Isolated sites tended to have lower spider species richness and number of spider species of conservation concern. Moreover, isolated sites were characterised by small, mobile and herbivorous carabid beetles. In contrast, urbanisation and local plant diversity had no effect on carabid beetles and spiders. We conclude that urban grasslands within residential areas - even if not targeted for conservation plans - can provide important habitats for conserving biodiversity, including species of conservation concern. Reducing the intensity of habitat management and increasing the connectivity of urban grassland sites can promote diverse arthropod communities and should therefore be considered in urban planning.

AB  - Rapid urbanization is emerging as one of the leading threats to the biodiversity globally. But is especially a cause of concern for tropical countries which are urbanizing much faster and with relatively less urban planning than temperate ones. Urban green spaces are established to reduce the negative impacts of urbanization by conserving a large suite of species. Yet our knowledge on the significance of urban green spaces for supporting urban fauna and enhancing species richness is lacking for tropical countries such as India. We examined how landscape and local scale features of urban green spaces influence bird species richness, density, fine-foraging guild richness and composition during breeding and non-breeding season in Dehradun, India. We quantified landscape level variables in the 250 m buffer around 18 urban green spaces. We sampled vegetation and bird community during breeding and non-breeding season through 52 intensive sampling point spread across 18 urban green spaces. Size of the urban green space at landscape level and tree species richness at the local scale emerged as important predictors influencing bird species richness, density and richness of imperilled insectivorous guild across seasons. Urban green spaces within education institutions and offices experiencing less vegetation management supported higher bird species richness and density whereas city parks were species poor. Community composition was affected more strongly by built-up cover and barren area in the landscape matrix and also by tree species richness at the local scale within urban green spaces. City planners should focus on allocating green spaces within urban settings and expand the formal green spaces. Existing green spaces could be improved by augmenting compositional and structural heterogeneity of vegetation as well as conservation of large old native trees.

AB  - Small forest patches embedded in agricultural (and peri-urban) landscapes in Western Europe play a key role for biodiversity conservation with a recognized capacity of delivering a wide suite of ecosystem services. Measures aimed to preserve these patches should be both socially desirable and ecologically effective. This study presents a joint ecologic and economic assessment conducted on small forest patches in Flanders (Belgium) and Picardie (N France). In each study region, two contrasted types of agricultural landscapes were selected. Open field (OF) and Bocage (B) landscapes are distinguished by the intensity of their usage and higher connectivity in the B landscapes. The social demand for enhancing biodiversity and forest structure diversity as well as for increasing the forest area at the expenses of agricultural land is estimated through an economic valuation survey. These results are compared with the outcomes of an ecological survey where the influence of structural features of the forest patches on the associated herbaceous diversity is assessed. The ecological and economic surveys show contrasting results; increasing tree species richness is ecologically more important for herbaceous diversity in the patch, but both tree species richness and herbaceous diversity obtain insignificant willingness to pay estimates. Furthermore, although respondents prefer the proposed changes to take place in the region where they live, we find out that social preferences and ecological effectiveness do differ between landscapes that represent different intensities of land use. Dwellers where the landscape is perceived as more "degraded" attach more value to diversity enhancement, suggesting a prioritization of initiatives in these area. In contrast, the ecological analyses show that prioritizing the protection and enhancement of the relatively better-off areas is more ecologically effective. Our study calls for a balance between ecological effectiveness and welfare benefits, suggesting that cost effectiveness studies should consider these approaches jointly. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Species may benefit from green infrastructure, i.e. the network of natural and anthropogenic habitat remnants in human-dominated landscapes, if it helps isolated populations in remaining habitat patches to be functionally connected. The importance of green infrastructure is therefore increasingly emphasized in conservation policy to counter biodiversity loss. However, there is limited evidence, particularly in plants, that green infrastructure promotes functional connectivity, i.e. supports the colonization of habitat patches across a landscape. We applied landscape genetics to test whether the green infrastructure supports structural and functional connectivity in the grassland perennial Galium verum, in 35 landscapes in Belgium, Germany and Sweden. We used multivariate genetic clustering techniques, nestedness analyses and conditional inference trees to examine landscape-scale patterns in genetic diversity and structure of plant populations in the green infrastructure surrounding semi-natural grasslands. Inferred functional connectivity explained genetic variation better than structural connectivity, yielding positive effects on genetic variation. The road verge network, a major structural component of the green infrastructure and its functional connectivity, most effectively explained genetic diversity and composition in G. verum. Galium verum ramets occupying the surrounding landscape proved to be genetic subsets of focal grassland populations, shaping a nested landscape population genetic structure with focal grasslands, particularly ancient ones, harbouring unique genetic diversity. This nested pattern weakened as road network density increased, suggesting road verge networks enable high landscape occupancy by increased habitat availability and facilitates gene flow into the surrounding landscape. Our study proposes that green infrastructure can promote functional connectivity, providing that a plant species can survive outside of core habitat patches. As this often excludes habitat specialist species, conservation practice and policy should primarily focus on ancient, managed semi-natural grasslands. These grasslands both harbour unique genetic diversity and act as primary gene and propagule sources for the surrounding landscape, highlighting their conservation value.

AB  - A wide body of research in recent years has studied either green infrastructures as providers of multiple ecosystem services, especially at the urban level, or ecological corridors and the issue of connectivity between landscape patches in the face of growing fragmentation. However, not many studies have analyzed how the two concepts can be combined to ground evidence-based policy and planning recommendations. In this study, a methodological approach for such a combination is proposed: after mapping a regional green infrastructure building upon the assessment of multiple ecosystem services and a network of ecological corridors through the resistance to movement of species, the two spatial layouts are combined so as to analyze correlations between the potential provision of ecosystem services and the resistance to movement. The methodology is applied in the case of the island of Sardinia, whose self-containment makes it possible to discard potential effects from surrounding areas, hence facilitating the implementation of the model. The outcomes of the regression model point out three ecosystem services as the most important factors that should be targeted by appropriate spatial policies if connectivity is to be increased: regulation of micro and local climate, forestry productivity, and cultural identity and heritage values.

AB  - We assessed the benefit of 11 gravel pits for the settlement of waterbird communities in an urbanized area lacking natural wetlands. Gravel pits captured 57% of the regional species pool of aquatic birds. We identified 39 species, among which five were regionally rare. We used the Self-Organizing Map algorithm to calculate the probabilities of presence of species, and to bring out habitat conditions that predict assemblage patterns. The age of the pits did not correlate with assemblage composition and species richness. There was a positive influence of macrophyte cover on waterbird species richness. Larger pits did not support more species, but species richness increased with connectivity. As alternative wetland habitats, gravel pits are attractive to waterbirds, when they act as stepping stones that ensure connectivity between larger natural and/or artificial wetlands separated in space.

AB  - To understand the potential financial cost of acquiring lands within a proposed reserve network for the Sierra Nevada, CA, USA, we used an assessors GIS database to estimate the acquisition cost in one county within the network to be US$ 2.5 billion. When only larger parcels were selected for the reserve network, the cost of the network decreased exponentially as the size-threshold for parcel selection increased, while the total area of the network decreased only linearly. Although acquiring only larger parcels may make sense financially, it does not result in adequate habitat representation because the spatial distribution of parcels is such that the lower elevation oak woodland and mid-elevation conifer forests tend to be on smaller parcels, which fall below the larger size thresholds and the resulting potential reserve areas are fragmented. Then, for the area surrounding the two major highways that cross the Sierra Nevada, we identified seventeen road barrier areas and six urban conflict areas that pose major, but possibly mitigable barriers to wildlife movement at different time scales. We propose that (1) wildlife conflicts with highway traffic could be feasibly mitigated by installing wildlife overcrossings at the identified locations and (2) constraints on development rather than land acquisition are necessary to protect biodiversity. Finally, we suggest that a combination of highway crossings and restrictions on land-use may be the cheapest way to protect biodiversity in the Sierra Nevada. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although biological invasion often alters ecosystem properties and community composition at different scales, considerable uncertainty still exists regarding the underlying mechanisms that regulate the spread of alien species into new habitats. An alien invasion is generally achieved through multiple processes from multiple sources; this type of invasion often prevents us from understanding of the dispersal mechanisms. Here, we aim to disentangle the processes of alien invasion by focusing on a single migration source. We surveyed the distribution of alien and native plant species in Shiretoko National Park, located in northern Japan. We measured the coverage of each species and the environmental and spatial factors in 362 quadrats established along roadsides. We found 101 native species and 35 alien species (gamma-diversity) throughout the quadrats. The local species richness (alpha-diversity) was higher for the alien species (6.1 species) than for the native species (3.2 species). There was a significant negative correlation in alpha-diversity between native and alien species. Moreover, the alpha-diversity and distance from the nearest town (migration source) showed a negative relationship for alien assemblages while the native assemblages showed the opposite trend. These results suggest that the alien species are expanding their distribution outward from the town, resulting in a decrease in the alpha-diversity of native species in localities close to the migration source. Overall, our results emphasize that roadsides could unintentionally act as corridors for alien species, even in protected areas. Careful consideration is thus needed for utilizing these human-created habitats even though they were designed for conservation and management purposes.

AB  - The present study analyzed the drosophilid assemblages in different levels of urbanization in the city of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Collections were carried out in 2008 in three different environments: a highly urbanized area-"Jardim BotA cent nico," a forested area with intermediary urbanization-"Parque Gabriel Knijnik," and in a relatively well-preserved forested area, although threatened by the urban growth-"Morro Santana." In Jardim BotA cent nico, 36 species belonging to four genera were found, with high abundance of exotic species as Drosophila simulans Sturtevant and Zaprionus indianus (Gupta). In Parque Gabriel Knijnik, 33 species that belonged to four genera were found, with higher abundances of native species belonging to the Drosophila tripunctata species group and Drosophila willistoni species subgroup, and lower abundance of exotic species. As for Morro Santana, 32 species and three genera were found, with higher abundances of native groups, low representativeness of exotic species, and absence of Zaprionus indianus. The analysis of the Jaccard index showed higher similarity in the species composition between samples collected in summer and autumn, and between samples collected in winter and spring. On the other hand, the Morisita index differentiated Jardim BotA cent nico from the other two studied sites. Our results show that Morro Santana is an important area of native biodiversity, reinforcing, therefore, the inclusion of this area in the project for the creation of an ecological corridor as proposed by the Ministry of the Environment of Brazil.

AB  - Often used as a mitigation tool to landscape fragmentation, urban riparian corridors also suffered from the effects of the urban expansion. This study explored the relationships between plant riparian communities and two major environmental variables (land cover, soil characteristics) and analyzed the floristic change along an urbanization gradient. Fifteen sites were surveyed on both riverbanks of two riparian corridors characterized by contrasting water regimes in Strasbourg, North Eastern France. Data of spontaneous species abundance was collected from 180 quadrats using (i) all plant species, (ii) herbaceous stratum and (iii) ligneous stratum (bush and tree). The diversity and compositional patterns of riparian plant species were analyzed within each corridor according to three levels of urbanization (urban, suburban, peri-urban). Relationships between riparian communities, land cover and soil chemical properties (pH, nitrogen and carbon content, moisture) were established by between-class co-inertia analyses. Land cover emerged as the main factor explaining changes in riparian communities along the rural-urban gradient while soil chemical properties discriminate water stress and fluvial dynamics of the two corridors. Similar compositional patterns were found within the most urbanized sites with the establishment of ubiquitous species. The herbaceous stratum is best linked to the level of urbanization, whereas the tree stratum is primarily correlated with corridor attributes (hydrological regime, soil properties). Although riparian species and communities are mainly determined by land cover, urban riparian corridors maintain native biodiversity up to the urban center.

AB  - In recent years, archaeologists have studied how ancient humans have shaped, and been shaped by, their surrounding environments in an effort to provide valuable insight into the patterns of human-environment interaction during prehistoric and historical periods. Along the Heihe River in Hexi Corridor of northwest China, archaeologists have found many ancient cities that are good places to explore changes in human settlement patterns in relation to environment change in historical periods. In this paper, we present our investigation of seven ancient cities to clarify the chronology of these cities and their strategy for wood use in the area through the application of radiocarbon dating and charcoal identification. Our results suggest that the ages of many cities are younger than previous estimates, and humans mainly used Tamarix and mixed Tamarix and broad leaf trees in the lower and middle reaches of the Heihe River basin between similar to AD 240-1380 respectively, and roughly matches the modern spatial distribution of natural woody vegetation in the area. In comparison to the results of archaeological, paleoclimatic and historical studies in Hexi Corridor, we propose that ancient human strategies for wood use and their impact on environment of the Heihe Basin are primarily relevant to human lifestyles rather than climate change.

AB  - While several studies have demonstrated that roads can act as barriers to small mammal movement, the relationship between road density and small mammal abundance has not yet been investigated. In southeastern Ontario, Peromyscus leucopus (white-footed mice) suffer high over-winter mortality rates, resulting in small springtime populations and frequent local extinctions. Peromyscus leucopus movement is known to be inhibited by roads, which should result in lower rates of immigration into and recolonization of habitats in landscapes with high road density. We tested two predictions: (1) Forest sites situated in landscapes with high road densities have a higher chance of P. leucopus being absent during the early spring than forest sites situated in landscapes with low road densities and (2) P. leucopus populations during the summer are smaller in forest sites situated in landscapes with high road densities than in landscapes with low road densities. We sampled P. leucopus in focal patches within nineteen landscapes (7 rural, low-road-density landscapes; 7 rural, high-road-density landscapes; 5 urban landscapes). There was no significant relationship between road density and the presence/absence of P. leucopus during the early spring. We found a significant positive effect of road density on P. leucopus relative abundance during the summer, even when we excluded the urban landscapes and based the analysis on only the 14 rural landscapes. Our results suggest that any negative effect of roads on P. leucopus populations, created by their inhibition to moving across roads, is far outweighed by some positive effect of roads on P. leucopus abundance. We suggest that the two most likely explanations are that roads are positively correlated with an important as-yet-undetermined component of habitat quality, or that roads positively affect P. leucopus by negatively affecting their predators.

AB  - There is a growing demand for holistic landscape planning to enhance sustainable use of ecosystem services (ESS) and maintenance of the biodiversity that supports them. In this context, the EU is developing policy to regulate the maintenance of ESS and enhance connectivity among protected areas (PAs). This is known as the network of Green Infrastructure (GI).
   However, there is not a working framework defined to plan the spatial design of such network of GI. Here, we use the software Marxan with Zones, to prioritize the spatial distribution of different management zones that accommodate the needs of a network of GI. These zones included a conservation zone, mainly devoted to protecting biodiversity, a GI zone, that aimed at connecting PAs and maintaining regulating and cultural ESS; and a management zone devoted to exploiting provisioning ESS. We performed four planning scenarios that distribute the targets for ESS and biodiversity in different ways across management zones. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis by increasing ESS targets to explore trade-offs that may occur when managing together biodiversity and ESS. We use Catalonia (northeastern Spain) as a case study.
   We found that the representation of ESS could be achieved for intermediate targets in all scenarios. There was, however, a threshold on these targets over which trade-offs appeared between maintaining regulating and cultural ESS and biodiversity versus getting access to provisioning ESS. These "thresholds values" were displaced towards higher ESS targets when we moved from more strict to more flexible planning scenarios (i.e., scenarios that allowed mixing representation of objectives for biodiversity and ESS within the same zone).
   This methodological approach could help design a framework to integrate biodiversity and ESS management in holistic plans and decision making and, at the same time, meeting European mandates concerning the design of GI networks, or similar needs elsewhere.

AB  - P>1. Urbanization represents a major threat to biodiversity world-wide because it causes permanent degradation and fragmentation of biologically rich natural communities. This is particularly acute in coastal plains and river valleys, where cities are typically located. Although movement is essential to the persistence of populations in fragmented landscapes, little is known about how development and transportation corridors affect the movements of wildlife in the urban context.
   2. We conducted a series of translocation experiments within the urban landscape of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to assess the permeability of selected landscape elements for two species of forest songbirds with contrasting adaptabilities to urban development and migratory behaviours: the black-capped chickadee Poecile atricapillus, an urban-adaptable year-round resident, and the yellow warbler Dendroica petechia, an urban-sensitive Neotropical migrant.
   3. Birds were caught in riparian habitats and translocated either within the riparian corridor of origin or across the urban matrix. Riparian treatments included continuous forest, one or several transportation bridges and a major river. In the urban matrix, birds were translocated across a single major road, well- or poorly-treed developed areas, or multiple gaps.
   4. Using Cox regression we found that the presence of gaps in forest cover explained more variation in return time than the amount of forest cover for both species. Multiple gaps, in particular, resulted in significantly longer return times compared with continuous forest. Chickadees exhibited longer return times when translocated across linear gaps associated with bridges or roads. In contrast, yellow warbler movements appeared to be more constrained by urban development.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that improving the permeability of urban landscapes for songbirds can be achieved by preserving connectivity along riparian corridors and other major swaths of natural vegetation while minimizing gaps in vegetation throughout the urban matrix. Our study also demonstrated a cumulative effect of multiple barriers, species-specific response thresholds to canopy cover and gap width, and an important effect of distance-to-territory on movement behaviour. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of 'most forested route' as a new, animal-based approach for quantifying the permeability of heterogeneous landscapes.

AB  - To clarify the effects of forest fragmentation and a change in tree species composition following urbanization on endophytic fungal communities, we isolated fungal endophytes from the foliage of nine tree species in suburban (Kashiwa City, Chiba) and rural (Mt. Wagakuni, Ibaraki; Mt. Takao, Tokyo) forests and compared the fungal communities between sites and host tree species. Host specificity was evaluated using the index of host specificity (Si), and the number of isolated species, total isolation frequency, and the diversity index were calculated. From just one to several host-specific species were recognized in all host tree species at all sites. The total isolation frequency of all fungal species on Quercus myrsinaefolia, Quercus serrata, and Chamaecyparis obtusa and the total isolation frequency of host-specific species on Q. myrsinaefolia, Q. serrata, and Eurya japonica were significantly lower in Kashiwa than in the rural forests. The similarity indices (nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) and C-MH) of endophytic communities among different tree species were higher in Kashiwa, as many tree species shared the same fungal species in the suburban forest. Endophytic fungi with a broad host range were grouped into four clusters suggesting their preference for conifer/broadleaves and evergreen/deciduous trees. Forest fragmentation and isolation by urbanization have been shown to cause the decline of host-specific fungal species and a decrease in 3 diversity of endophytic communities, i.e., endophytic communities associated with tree leaves in suburban forests were found to be depauperate.

AB  - As the human activity footprint grows, land-use decisions play an increasing role in determining the future of plant and animal species. Studies have shown that urban and agricultural development cannot only harm species populations directly through habitat destruction, but also by destroying the corridors that connect habitat patches and populations within a metapopulation. Without these pathways, populations can encounter inbreeding depression and degeneration, which can increase death rates and lower rates of reproduction. This article describes the development and application of the FRAGGLE model, a spatial system dynamics model designed to calculate connectivity indices among populations. FRAGGLE can help planners and managers identify the relative contribution of populations associated with habitat patches to future populations in those patches, taking into account the importance of interstitial land to migration success. The model is applied to the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus), a threatened species whose southeastern U.S. distribution has diminished significantly within its native range due to agricultural and urban development over the last several decades. This model is parameterized with life history and movement traits of the gopher tortoise in order to simulate population demographics and spatial distribution within an area in west-central Georgia that supports a significant tortoise population. The implications of this simulation modeling effort are demonstrated using simple landscape representations and a hypothetical on land-use management scenario. Our findings show that development resulting in even limited habitat losses (10%) may lead to significant increases in fragmentation as measured by a loss in the rate of dispersions (31%) among area subpopulations.

AB  - Riparian habitats are important sites for avian conservation in western North America. These sites are also places of increasing human exploitation due to water availability and vegetation composition. Degradation and habitat patchiness of these systems may cause declines in avian species that are obligate breeders or use these habitats as corridors during migration. Our objective was to examine species composition and diversity of birds inhabiting a patchy Mesquite landscape in central Mexico. The study was conducted in the Salado River watershed in the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Biosphere Reserve. We conducted bird censuses using circular plot surveys in four zones of similar size differing mainly in proximity to town. We compared bird presence and density with plant coverage and density measured at the same points. We recorded 80 bird species, 53.6% of which were winter migrants. The four zones studied were not statistically different in bird species composition but differed in bird densities. Points counted inside the zones differed in bird densities and were positively correlated with plant density. The study site can be considered important for bird conservation due to its bird species richness, migratory species found exclusively in riparian habitat, and the presence of resident endemic species that breed in the area. Vegetation clearance that involves partial reduction of plants can represent a threat to bird conservation in the area. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ensuring connectivity in the countryside and cities is a key element of nature protection, allowing genetic fluxes between populations in fragmented ecosystems. We tested the hypothesis that artificial green corridors are effective for birds in the city of Cochabamba (Bolivia). We compared the following aspects of natural corridors, with generally preserved vegetation, to those of artificial corridors, constituting parks and gardens in a matrix of streets densely planted with trees: species abundance and richness, functional diversity, and the traits of bird communities. We used canonical redundancy analysis to relate species abundance to the corridor type, noise, tree vegetation structure, richness, and functional diversity. We also tested the explanatory factors for relationships with bird species richness, functional diversity, and traits. We found that most species were shared between the corridor types; the corridor type, nevertheless, had significant effects, with bird species in the green corridors being more common and heavier and having a lower beak depth/mass. By contrast, noise-reflecting urbanization deeply affected all of the studied traits, indicating large shifts in species composition. In conclusion, green corridors seem reliable enough to maintain birds at a level almost comparable to that in linear corridors, but noise is a limiting factor for efficiency for both types.

AB  - Vegetated roofs are human-manufactured ecosystems and potentially promising conservation tools for various taxa and habitats. Focussing on arthropods, we conducted a 3 year study on newly constructed vegetated roofs with shallow substrates (up to 10 cm) and vegetation established with pre-grown mats, plug plants and seeds to describe pioneer arthropod communities on roofs and to compare them with ground level communities. We vacuum sampled arthropods from the roofs and nearby ground level sites with low, open vegetation, i.e., potential source habitats. We showed that the roofs and ground sites resembled each other for ordinal species richness but differed in community composition: with time the roofs started to resemble each other rather than their closest ground level habitats. Species richness increased with time on roofs and at ground level, but the roofs had consistently less species than the ground sites and only a few species were unique to the roofs. Also, the proportion of predators increased on roofs, while not at ground level. We conclude that vegetated roofs established with similar substrates and vegetation, filter arthropods in a way that produces novel communities that are different from those at ground level but similar to one another. The role of these insular communities in species networks and ecosystem function remains to be investigated.

AB  - By increasing landscape patchiness and habitat loss, urbanization threatens biodiversity. Its adverse effects may be mitigated by urban parks, in which conditions that promote structural and functional biodiversity contribute to preserve ecosystem processes. Therefore, deep knowledge of urban park biodiversity and of patterns driving species assemblages is required, especially for soil communities which are understudied. This study, conducted in public parks in Montpellier (Southern France), is the first one examining the impact of landscape patterns on Collembola communities. Moreover, soil abiotic properties were analyzed to examine how local factors drive species assemblages in different landscape types. The results of the study highlighted that Collembola community structure is affected by landscape patterns. Specifically, Collembola communities with species-abundance structures typical of late successional stages were found within woody landscapes, whereas those with early successional stage structures were observed in wide turf patches surrounded by other vegetation covers. When turf patches become small and isolated, homogenization was observed in Collembola community composition. From the perspective of urban park planning, managers should consider limiting landscape fragmentation (i.e. interspersion and configuration of impervious surfaces) and preserving landscape diversity (especially through woody vegetation patches). These may promote the development of diverse and structured Collembola communities, indicators of the overall soil quality.

AB  - Background: Linear transportation infrastructures (roads, railways, oil and gas pipelines, powerlines and waterways) generate well documented fragmenting effects on species habitats. However, the potential of verges of linear transportation infrastructures (road and railway embankments, strips of grass under power lines or above buried pipelines, or waterway banks) as habitat or corridor for biodiversity, remains controversial. In a context of constant loss of natural habitats, the opportunities of anthropogenic areas for compensating the loss of biodiversity they generated have to be considered. This paper is the first synthesis of evidence addressing this topic for vertebrates (mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles) in temperate ecosystems.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic literature survey using two online publication databases, three search engines, specialist websites, and by sending a call for literature to subject experts. We successively screened the articles for relevance on titles, abstracts and full texts using criteria detailed in an a priori protocol. We then used six specific questions to categorize the retained studies and to critically appraise them. These questions encompassed the potential of verges as habitats and corridors for vertebrates, and the effects of landscape and management on these potentialities. We critically appraised all studies to assess their risk of bias and created a database of the studies with low and medium risk of bias. We synthesized results for each specific question in narrative syntheses. Finally, studies that met meta-analysis requirements were used for quantitative syntheses.
   Results: Our initial searches identified 83,565 documents. After critical appraisal, we retained 119 documents that reported 128 studies. Most studies were conducted in Europe (49%) and in the United States of America (22%), and were about mammals (61%) and birds (20%). Results from the narrative synthesis and meta-analyses converged and revealed that the potential of linear transportation infrastructures verges to constitute a habitat for vertebrate species varies according to the infrastructure and the biological group considered. Especially, highway verges may be a refuge for small mammals but seems detrimental to birds. The potential also varied depending on the landscape considered, with urbanisation being related to lower biodiversity hosted by verges. We found a wide variety of verge management practices with few studies on each practice, which prevented us from drawing general conclusions. Likewise, we found too few studies assessing the corridor potential of verges to be able to fully conclude although this potential seems to exist. We did not find any study assessing the effect of landscape context or management on the role of corridor of verges.
   Conclusions: We identified a major knowledge gap regarding the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as corridors for vertebrates, and when they exist studies rarely directly measured movements on verges. We thus encourage more research on this topic and the development of protocols that enable direct measures of vertebrate movements. The effect of management practices on the role of habitat of verges also deserves further investigations, and research efforts should be coordinated to focus on one specific practice (e.g. vegetation management).

AB  - Understanding varying levels of biodiversity within cities is pivotal to protect it in the face of global urbanisation. In the early stages of urban ecology studies on intra-urban biodiversity focused on the urban-rural gradient, representing a broad generalisation of features of the urban landscape. Increasingly, studies classify the urban landscape in more detail, quantifying separately the effects of individual urban features on biodiversity levels. However, while separate factors influencing biodiversity variation among cities worldwide have recently been analysed, a global analysis on the factors influencing biodiversity levels within cities is still lacking. We here present the first meta-analysis on intra-urban biodiversity variation across a large variety of taxonomic groups of 75 cities worldwide. Our results show that patch area and corridors have the strongest positive effects on biodiversity, complemented by vegetation structure. Local, biotic and management habitat variables were significantly more important than landscape, abiotic or design variables. Large sites greater than 50ha are necessary to prevent a rapid loss of area-sensitive species. This indicates that, despite positive impacts of biodiversity-friendly management, increasing the area of habitat patches and creating a network of corridors is the most important strategy to maintain high levels of urban biodiversity.

AB  - Aiming at assessing the ecological stress of land urbanization comprehensively, three perspectives are considered and combined, i.e. the amount effect with the proportion of construction lands as the indicator, the intensity effect per the density of environmental pollutant emissions, and the location effect based on their spatial distribution in the heterogeneous landscape. The quantitative results of Southern Jiangsu case in Eastern China show the single-perspective ecological stress are spatially different; the proportion effect is higher in city propers which are more densely populated and industrialized. However, the intensity effect is more significant for units along the Yangtze river where heavy industries are gathered, while the location effect is higher in "ecologically suitable" regions. As the integration of proportion, intensity, and location effects, the comprehensive stress differs across Southern Jiangsu and are also different with the single-perspective results. Dominant stressors of each unit are spatially distinct, which benefits policy-makers in targeting their objectives as per primary influencing factors. It is concluded that the comprehensive assessment could efficiently reveal the spatial differentiation of the ecological effects of land urbanization and also the differentiated role of different factors for each unit.

AB  - Selecting urban ecological patches is of great significance for constructing urban green infrastructure network, protecting urban biodiversity and ecological environment. With the support of GIS technology, a criterion for selecting sources of patches was developed according to existing planning Then ecological source patches of terrestrial organism, aquatic and amphibious organism were selected in Wuhan city. To increase the connectivity of the ecological patches and achieve greater ecological protection benefits, the green infrastructure networks in Wuhan city were constructed with the minimum path analysis method. Finally, the characteristics of ecological source patches were analyzed with landscape metrics, and ecological protection importance degree of ecological source patches were evaluated comprehensively. The results showed that there were 23 important ecological source patches in Wuhan city, among which Sushan Temple Forest Patch, Lu Lake and Shangshe Lake Wetland Patch were the most important in all kinds of patches for ecological protection. This study can provide a scientific basis for the preservation of urban ecological space, the delineation of natural conservation areas and the protection of biological diversity.

TI  - Isolation of Salmonella serotypes from fresh and frozen chicken
T2  - INDIAN VETERINARY JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - Salmo,nellosis, a common food borne infection in human is primarily caused by ingestion of Salmonella contaminated meat and poultry products. Poultry has been as a main reservoir of non-typhoidal human Salmonella infections and more than 2000 serovars have been recognized (Popoff and Leminar, 1992). Keeping in view of its zoonotic importance, isolation of Salmonella serotypes from poultry products was undertaken.
   Materials and Methods One hundred and twenty-five samples, from fresh and 50 samples from frozen chicken (-2 to -4 degrees C for 10 days) were collected from poultry shops, commercial farm and the retail outlets managed by State Animal Husbandry Department, Srinagar. Each 50g sample from the breast area covering both external and internal surface was collected aseptically in a sterile container and processed within 2 hours for enumeration and isolation of food-borne micro-organisms. Frozen chicken samples were collected after thawing the carcasses at room temperature for 2-3 hours. Srinagar city was divided into five arbitrary zones viz., North (Batpora, Hazratbal), South (Rambagh, Rawalpora). East (Brain, Nishat), West (Qamarwari, Parimpora) and Central zone (Habba Kadal, Zainakadal). For estimating total viable bacterial counts, each 10g of sample was triturated separately in a sterile pestle and mortar using peptone water as a diluent. Ten fold serial dilutions were made for inoculation into the nutrient agar plates in triplicate. Number of organisms per g was calculated by multiplying the average number of colonies in the desired dilution by dilution factor. For isolation of Salmonella spp. 25g of triturated sample in peptone water (1:1) was inoculated in 100 ml selenite F broth in duplicate. One of the inoculated tubes was incubated at 37 degrees C for 18-24 hours and other at 44 degrees C for 18 ours. The loop full of culture was streaked on Mac Conkey agar plates and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24-48 hours. Smears from different non-lactose fermenting colonies were stained by Gram's method for microscopic examination. Such culture from Mac Conkey agar plate was moved on to Brilliant green agar Bismath sulphite agar and de-oxycholate agar plates for further confirmation. The plates were incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours and the suspected colonies were transferred to nutrient agar slants for further studies. Serotyping of Salmonella was done at National Salmonella and E. Coli Central Research Institute, Kasauli, H. P. In vitro drug. sensitivity was done by standard procedure (Baurer et al., 1966).
   Results and Discussion Seventy six (60.8%) of 125 samples of fresh chicken were contaminated with food- borne micro-organisms with mean viable counts of 3.7499 +/- 0.312 cfu/g. Frozen chicken samples were comparatively less contaminated with 13 out of 50 samples (26.00) supporting the growth of food-borne micro-organ isms. The mean viable count in the frozen chicken was 1.1973 +/- 0.502 cfu/g. The higher percentage of contamination in fresh chicken could be due to the procedures adopted, at the time of slaughter as most of the birds are slaughtered at retail shops on roadside subjecting the carcases to environment related hazards. This was evident as higher percentage of contamination was observed in areas with higher population density and heavy vehicular traffic. Zone-wise percentage and the level of contamination of fresh and frozen chicken are presented in table.
   A considerable reduction in level of contamination was observed in frozen chicken. Freezing appears to have caused death of the micro-organisms as most of these belong to mesophillic group. Reduction in the bacterial load of meat and meat products under extended frozen conditions has been reported (Sherikar, 1994).
   Variable bacterial counts in fresh chickens have been reported previously. Mead et al., (1993) reported a count of 4.4 to 5.3 cfu/g. Counts ranging from 4.4 to 4.7 cfu/g on the carcasses of commercially slaughtered birds were reported by Weise and Trommer (1980). A higher level of contamination (7.93 cfu/g) has also been reported (Pattnaik et al, 1997). While total viable count may be indicative by hygienic standards adopted during slaughter and of subsequent storage till consumption, presence of certain food-borne microorganisms particularly those associated with diseased conditions in man is important from public health view point.
   Both frozen and fresh chicken were contaminated with Salmonella spp. The percentage of contamination of fresh and frozen chicken was 2.4 and 4.00, respectively, the difference being non-significant (Z=0.5739). Recovery of Salmonella serotypes from non-refrigerated and frozen broiler carcasses has been reported (Leon et al, 1996; Alshawabkeh and Yamani, 1996).
   Five isolates of Salmonella spp. were typed into 2 serotypes of which 80 and 20 per cent constituted Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella reading, respectively. Salmonella enteritidis is of zoonotic importance and has been isolated from chicken (Tadesse and Cizek, 1994; Boonmar, et al, 1998).
   In vitro senstivity of Salmonella serotypes showed 100 per cent sensitivity to nalidixic acid, chloramphenicol, amoxycillin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and resistance to erythromycin. Seventy per cent Salmonella enteritidis were sensitive to amplicillin, cephalosporin and pefloxacin whereas, Salmonella reading were, resistant to cephalosporin, co-trimoxazole and tetracycline. Resistance of Salmonella serotypes to tetracycline and co-trimoxazole has been reported (Poppe, et al., 1995). Increase in resistance of Salmonella spp. to antibiotics may be attributed to their indiscriminate use as growth promoters and coccidiostats.

AB  - Vegetated green infrastructure (GI) is used as a sustainable complement to traditional stormwater infrastructure in many cities and is reported to provide additional benefits such as heat island mediation, crime reduction, increased property values, improved air quality, improved human well-being, improved aesthetics, biodiversity conservation, and carbon sequestration. However, we hypothesize that the simultaneous provisioning of multiple benefits - multifunctionality - is not guaranteed yet may be achieved by planning two critical components of GI: the spatial placement of GI within a city and the traits of the plant species used to vegetate GI. We propose the Green Infrastructure Space and Traits (GIST) model, a new planning tool for evaluating and maximizing GI multifunctionality based on optimizing both site selection and plant traits in GI design to promote urban planning with higher sustainability and benefits to humans. GIST involves identifying priority areas for GI placement and using plant species with traits that maximize benefits and multifunctionality in priority areas. As a case study, we apply GIST to Philadelphia, USA, and identify new locations for GI and plant traits that would increase multifunctionally across the city. For the nine benefits we examined, GIST indicates high potential for multifunctionality for the Philadelphia GI system. An assessment of the GI planning in Philadelphia to date indicates that the actualization of this multifunctionality has not been fully realized and could be improved with strategic GI placement and plant species selection. Further, we identified a cluster of correlated benefits which may be a common pathway for multifunctionality across cities. Overall, our work supports the hypothesis that multifunctional GI is possible when proper planning tools that integrate spatial placement and plant traits are used.

AB  - We compared the avifauna recorded in a recent survey in an urban park (Parque Municipal Henrique Luis Roessler, Parcao) and surroundings, Novo Hamburgo, RS, with past data, to evaluate the possible alterations in species composition over time. Of the 265 species compiled as original elements of that region, 114 were found at Parcao. Among forest species, 37% were considered locally extinct. The most affected guild was the large frugivores, with nine extinct species and one survivor (Trogon surrucura). Birds highly sensitive to disturbance as well as endemic species were the most extinguished. The possible causes for this loss are fragmentation, hunting and environmental changes. The diversity today is threatened, thus conservation measures are necessary in that region. The most important actions are: maintenance of ecological corridors, protection of natural remnant areas and the establishment of protected areas.

AB  - Due to limited water supplies, use of drought-tolerant species to conserve water in irrigated urban landscapes is increasingly important in the Intermountain West. The Colorado Plateau endemic shrub, Shepherdia rotundifolia Parry is a potential candidate for use in sustainable urban low-water landscapes (LWLs) for its aesthetic and drought-tolerant qualities. However, the species is difficult to establish in urban landscapes of different fertility and water availability than found in regional native habitats. A better understanding of environmental and genetic constraints, as well as morphological adaptation in native habitats, may facilitate greater use of S. rotundifolia in LWLs. The goal of this study was to investigate variability in environmental conditions, morphology, and genetics among 6 populations of S. rotttndifolia along an elevation gradient (range 1200-2500 m) in the species' native range. Aboveground environmental conditions were characterized from 30-year proximal weather station data, intra-annual weather collected on-site, and site relative light intensity (RU) from hemispherical canopy images. Belowground, we analyzed site-specific soils for texture, pH, salinity organic matter (OM), and macronutrients. We characterized plant morphology and genetics from leaf area and specific leaf area (SLA), scanning electron microscopic imaging of trichome structure and leaf thickness, and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genetic variation among populations. Precipitation, air temperature, RLI, and soil properties varied widely among populations. Differences among leaf area, SLA, and leaf trichome structure suggest population-level adaptations consistent with environmental differences, particularly between high- and low-elevation populations. Similarly, distinct AFLP banding patterns among high- and low-elevation populations suggest differences due to isolation by distance. SLA was correlated with RU, OM, and potassium (K). Relatively high native levels and positive correlation with SLA suggest that K may be a limiting factor in urban landscape soils. Selection of plants adapted to environmental conditions similar to those present in urban landscapes may enhance successful use of S. rotundifolia. Genetic variation also suggests potential for cultivar selection.

AB  - The effects of urbanization on bats are poorly understood, but published data suggests it might be detrimental to them. Even though urban parks provide refuge to native biota, the nature of the urban landscape exacerbates the insularization process. In order to evaluate if wooded streets in an urban landscape provide connectivity for bats, we compared bat community structure in three different types of habitats: urban parks, wooded streets and non-wooded streets. Sampling occurred monthly from August 2006 to July 2007 in the city of Vitria, southeastern Brazil. Richness, relative abundance and diversity were higher in urban parks and lower in non-wooded streets. Jaccard's similarity index showed that the wooded streets are more similar to non-wooded streets than to urban parks. Urbanization may benefit generalist species by providing new resources, but for specialist species critical resources may be lost and persistence endangered. There is evidence that wooded streets may provide some degree of connectivity for birds in urban landscapes, but our results suggest that this is not the case, with wooded streets being used by few individuals of a few species. Vegetation cover is important to maintain bat diversity in urban centers. Activities like landscape planning and gardening should include biodiversity data in their outputs in order to better design a landscape that improves the likelihood of persistence of bats.

AB  - The loss of biodiversity due to rapid urbanization can be mitigated by urban riparian corridors. As an important component of urban biodiversity, spontaneous herbaceous plants play an essential role in the ecological functions of urban river corridors. Currently, the influence of the landscape structure within corridors on plant diversity has been poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the species and functional diversity, especially the functional traits of origin, pollination, and dispersal, of spontaneous herbaceous plants in the Wenyu River-North Canal riparian corridor in Beijing. The results showed that urban riparian corridors have a positive effect on the spread of alien and invasive plants as well as increasing the native plant diversity. No significant differences in diversity indicators but significant differences in the composition of functional traits between habitat types. Plants with long pollination and dispersal distances tended to be more closely related to the landscape structure indices at larger scales. Invasive plants were more common in patches with significant connectivity, while native plants were positively correlated with water and road connectivity. Anemophilous and anemochores were more common in habitats with sinuous edges. Ant-dispersed plants were closely related to the water bodies. Autochores were positively correlated with the connectivity of habitat patches. Plants dispersed by birds and mammals were weakly correlated with landscape structure. Our study underlines that emphasis should be placed on the support for plant pollination and dispersal, together with the prevention and control of invasive plants in the construction and management of future urban ecological corridors.

AB  - About 190,000 ha of higher-elevation marl prairies flank either side of Shark River Slough in the southern Everglades. Water levels typically drop below the ground surface each year in this landscape. Consequently, peat soil accretion is inhibited, and substrates consist either of calcitic marl produced by algal periphyton mats or exposed limestone bedrock. The southern marl prairies support complex mosaics of wet prairie, sawgrass sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense), tree islands, and tropical hammock communities and a high diversity of plant species. However, relatively short hydroperiods and annual dry downs provide stressful conditions for aquatic fauna, affecting survival in the dry season when surface water is absent. Here, we present a conceptual ecological model developed for this landscape through scientific concensus, use of empirical data, and modeling. The two major societal drivers affecting the southern marl prairies are water management practices and agricultural and urban development. These drivers lead to five groups of ecosystem stressors: loss of spatial extent and connectivity, shortened hydroperiod and increased drought severity, extended hydroperiod and drying pattern reversals, introduction and spread of non-native trees, and introduction and spread of non-native fishes. Major ecological attributes include periphyton mats, plant species diversity and community mosaic, Cape Sable seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis), marsh fishes and associated aquatic fauna prey base, American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), and wading bird early dry season foraging. Water management and development are hypothesized to have a negative effect on the ecological attributes of the southern marl prairies in the following ways. Periphyton mats have decreased in cover in areas where hydroperiod has been significantly reduced and changed in community composition due to inverse responses to increased nutrient availability. Plant species diversity and community mosaics have changed due to shifting gradients to more terrestrial or more aquatic communities, displacement of native communities by non-natives, expansion of woody plants, high-intensity dry season fires, tree-island burnout, and reduced microtopography resulting from alligator population decline. Cape Sable seaside sparrow populations are threatened by nest destruction resulting from extended hydroperiods, drying pattern reversals, and high intensity dry season fires, as well as by the expansion of woody plants into graminoid wetland habitats. Populations of marsh fishes and associated aquatic fauna that constitute the aquatic prey base for higher vertebrates have decreased in density and changed in species composition and size structure due to loss of wetland spatial extent, shortened hydroperiod, increased drought severity, loss of aquatic drought refugia in solution holes and alligator holes, and spread of exotic fishes. American alligator populations have declined in the Rocky Glades, and alligator holes have filled with sediment, as a result of shortened hydroperiod and increased drought severity. Habitat options for wading birds to forage during the early dry season and during unusually wet years have been reduced due to loss of spatial extent and shortened hydroperiod.

AB  - Shenzhen, a new city existed for less than three decades, experienced dramatic biological invasions of alien plants resulting from the construction of urban green spaces. In an investigation of plant species from 390 plots in 186 sites across five main types of green space (public parks, forests, vegetation corridors, residential and industrial area), a total of 474 plant species, including 221 alien species (46.6%), were recorded. Our study witnessed the spread and establishment of alien species across all urban green spaces and revealed significantly greater proportions of alien species in artificial green spaces than in natural ones. Furthermore, we found the positive relationship between native and alien species richness existed across all the green spaces and was particularly prevalent in the artificial ones. Additionally, successful establishment of alien species instigated by anthropogenic disturbances and most frequent species assemblages caused biotic homogenization in the artificial habitats. In contrast, biotic differentiation in the near-natural habitats was still preserved due to a greater level of protection for native species, which showed some resistance against the establishment of alien species. Therefore, urbanization was proven distinct effects on the flora of artificial and near-natural habitats, coexisting in the new city. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban plans for pedestrian-friendly environments by reducing exposure to air pollutants and enhancing movement are crucial for public health and accessibility of social infrastructure. Here, we develop a novel network analysis-based approach, which identifies pivotal local walkways that lower exposure risk to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) while improving the urban landscape connectivity. We employ an exponential distance-decay model and partial correlation analysis to estimate traffic-induced PM2.5 and to test the relationship between the proxies and actual PM2.5 concentrations, respectively. We use a proxy for pedestrians' PM2.5 exposure as a movement cost when conducting network analyses to compute pedestrian network centrality, reflecting both low PM2.5 exposure risk and landscape connectivity. As a result, we found a significant contribution of traffic to the estimated PM2.5 exposure and PM2.5 concentrations. We also found that walkways make a large contribution to regional connectivity regardless of the estimated PM2.5 exposure risk owing to the composition and configuration of urban landscape elements. Regarding the spatial features and planning context, this study suggests four types of pedestrian networks to provide urban authorities with useful practical information in city-wide urban plans for enhancing walkability: PM2.5 reduction required; PM2.5 reduction recommended; optimal areas; and alternatives of optimal areas.

AB  - Population expansion and land transformation reduce biodiversity, potentially reducing environmental functionality. These effects are evident globally, and specifically in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa, where land cover is being transformed for urbanisation. However, much of the urbanised areas incorporate differing levels of urban greening, which is improving local species and functional diversity. In recent years, a new form of urban greening in the form of eco-estate development has increased, which improves biodiversity and functional diversity. However, it has not yet been determined whether these eco-estates are connected to one another and the surrounding natural landscapes, allowing for natural species' colonisation, immigration and dispersal. In this study, we assessed whether eco-estates along the coast of KZN were ecologically connected to a) one another, and b) the surrounding natural landscape. Using a hybrid Least-cost Pathway/Ecological Circuit Theory approach, we modelled habitat suitability and dispersal requirements of a forest-specialised bird species in an effort to provide future development and management plans for eco-estates. Connectivity throughout coastal KZN was evident, with increased connectivity in areas of natural and urban indigenous forest and coastal thicket/dense bush and river systems (riparian zones), within which existing eco-estates were subsequently developed. Eco-estates were well connected to one another and surrounding natural landscapes, emphasising their importance as patches containing endangered indigenous forest and unprotected coastal thicket/dense bush and of increased species and functional diversity, improving local ecosystem functioning. We recommend that eco-estate development primarily focus on areas which have previously been transformed, to increase natural land cover. The intention to preserve, rehabilitate, and conserve natural land cover is fundamentally important if development is to take place within and surrounding areas of high connectivity to assist in increasing and conserving suitable habitats, improving functionality and connectivity in KZN, and assisting in offsetting the deleterious effects of future climate change.

AB  - Context Prioritising is likely to differ depending on the species considered for connectivity assessments, leading to a lack of consensual decisions for territorial planning. Objectives The objective was to assess the relevance of identifying priority areas for connectivity for groups of species based on common dispersal abilities. We aimed to assess the impact of target groups choices on predicted priority areas. Method The study was located at the Thau Lagoon territory to demonstrate the methodological approach. Ecological niche modelling was used to quantify species resistance and to identify suitable habitat patches. We coupled the least-cost path methodology with circuit theory to assess species connectivity. We classified connectivity from high to low levels and averaged the results by dispersal groups. Results We found important differences in identified priority areas between groups with dissimilar dispersal abilities, with little overlap between highly connected areas. We identified a gap between the level of protection of low dispersal species and highly connected areas. We found mismatches between existing corridors and connectivity in low dispersal species, and a greater impact in areas of expected urban sprawl projects on favourably connected areas for species with high dispersal capabilities. Conclusion We have demonstrated that a diversity of dispersal capacity ranges must be accounted for in order to identify ecological corridors in programmes that aim to restore habitat connectivity at territorial levels. Our findings are oriented to support the decisions of planning initiatives, at both local and regional scale.

AB  - The expansion of roads, and the subsequent changes to the surrounding landscape not only lead to landscape fragmentation but also have been shown to be a key driver of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. Local declines of species abundance as well as changes in animal behaviour have drawn attention to wider ecosystem effects including altered species composition and a degradation of ecosystem functioning. However, methods for measuring and quantifying the distribution and environmental impacts of roads are not yet fully developed. We present a new technique for assessing the potential impacts of roads on biodiversity using a spatial road disturbance index (SPROADI). The index is calculated from three sub-indices: traffic intensity as a measure of traffic volume per time and space; vicinity impact, which is the assessment of edge effect of roads on adjacent habitats (the road-effect zone); and fragmentation grade, which provides an indication of the degree to which the landscape is intersected by roads. SPROADI was then tested using data from the Federal State of Brandenburg in north-eastern Germany. A sensitivity analysis was carried out on the results to assess the robustness of the index. The findings revealed expected patterns of high road disturbance in urban and peri-urban landscapes surrounding Berlin. Less obvious were the high levels of road density and impacts in forest plantations across the southern region of Brandenburg, and low levels of road disturbance in agricultural crop lands of the north-western region. Results were variable for areas under some form of protection. The only national park displayed substantially lower SPROADI values in contrast to the surrounding non-protected areas whilst other protected area categories, which were landscape conservation areas and nature parks, revealed SPROADI values that were equally high as those for non-protected areas. The results of this study demonstrate the strengths and potential applications of SPROADI as a quantitative means for identifying low-traffic areas in the context of conservation and sustainable transport planning.

AB  - Although invasive plants are recognized as a major ecological problem, little is known of the relative importance of plant community characteristics versus landscape context in determining invasibility of communities. We determined the relative importance of community and landscape features of 30 woodlots in influencing the invasion of Lonicera maackii. We sampled woodlots using the point-quarter method and calculated canopy openness and basal areas and densities of shrub, sapling and tree species, as well as woody species richness. We used aerial photos and ArcView GIS to calculate landscape parameters from the same woodlots using a buffer distance of 1500 m. We used logistic and linear regression analyses to determine the community and landscape factors that best explain L. maackii presence and density. We also tested whether woodlot invasion by L. maackii begins at woodlot edges.
   Presence of L. maackii was significantly explained only by distance from the nearest town (logistic regression, p=0.017); woodlots nearer town were more likely to be invaded. Among invaded woodlots, density of L. maackii was positively related to the amount of edge in the landscape (partial R-2=0.592) and negatively related to total tree basal area (partial R-2=0.134), number of native woody species (partial R-2=0.054), and sapling shade tolerance index (partial R-2=0.054). Lonicera maackii in woodlot interiors were not younger than those on the perimeters, leading us to reject the edge-first colonization model of invasion.
   Our findings reveal that landscape structure is of primary importance and community features of secondary importance in the invasion of L. maackii. This shrub is invading from multiple foci (towns) rather than an advancing front. Connectivity in the landscape (i.e. the number of corridors) did not promote invasion. However, edge habitat was important for invasion, probably due to increased propagule pressure. The community features associated with L. maackii invasion may be indicators of past disturbance.

AB  - The Earth's freshwater ecosystems are currently under threat, particularly in developing countries. In Mexico, intensive land use and inadequate monitoring policies have resulted in the severe degradation of the country's freshwater ecosystems. This study assesses how the macroinvertebrate communities in the Pesqueria River, located in Northeastern Mexico, are affected by riparian land use, in order to determine their potential use as bioindicators to evaluate the macroinvertebrate integrity of the Pesqueria River. First, we characterized the land use cover in the riparian channel. Second, we sampled 16 sites for benthic macroinvertebrates along the main channel during the wet and dry seasons. Third, we evaluated the influence of the riparian channel land use on the macroinvertebrate community using 42 different biological metrics. The land use characterization depicted a riparian channel mainly influenced by agricultural and urban land use. Eighty-one invertebrate taxa were identified during the study. Permutational analysis of the variance analysis confirmed significant differences across the different land use classes and the macroinvertebrate community composition while no differences were found between seasons. The indicator species analysis revealed 31 representative taxa for natural land use, 1 for urban, and 4 for agricultural land use. Our modelling analysis showed that 28 of the 42 biological metrics tested responded significantly to land use disturbances, confirming the impact of land use changes on the Pesqueria River's macroinvertebrate communities and suggesting that these metrics may have a use as bioindicators. Finally, this study may provide significant biological information for further studies in similar conditions.

AB  - Urbanization profoundly impacts animal populations by causing isolation, increased susceptibility to disease, and exposure to toxicants. Genetic effects include reduced effective population size, increased population substructure, and decreased adaptive potential. We investigated the influence that urbanization and a disease epizootic had on the population genetics of bobcats (Lynx rufus) distributed across a highly fragmented urban landscape. We genotyped more than 300 bobcats, sampled from 1996 to 2012, for variation at nine neutral and seven immune gene-linked microsatellite loci. We found that two freeways are significant barriers to gene flow. Further, a 3-year disease epizootic, associated with secondary anticoagulant rodenticide exposure, caused a population bottleneck that led to significant genetic differentiation between pre- and post-disease populations that was greater than that between populations separated by major freeways for >60years. However, balancing selection acted on immune-linked loci during the epizootic, maintaining variation at functional regions. Conservation assessments need to assay loci that are potentially under selection to better preserve the adaptive potential of populations at the urban-wildland interface. Further, interconnected regions that contain appropriate habitat for wildlife will be critical to the long-term viability of animal populations in urban landscapes.

AB  - Exurban development, defined as residential development outside of cities and towns, occupies nearly five times more land in the United States than urban and suburban development combined. Understanding the effects of exurban development on biodiversity thus has important and wide-ranging implications for the planning, construction and stewardship of sustainable communities and surrounding rural lands. To assess the impact of exurban development on mammalian habitat use, wildlife cameras were placed along a unique gradient of landscape permeability through varying densities and configurations of housing development in a rapidly growing rural region of Colorado. Multiple-season species occupancy and relative activity levels were measured in summer and winter seasons. The impacts of exurban housing on mammals were species specific and varied along the development gradient. Bobcats (Lynx rufus), elk (Cervus canadensis), and coyotes (Canis latrans), showed decreased activity and occupancy levels in more developed areas, whereas red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) occurred more frequently in these areas. Other species did not show significant responses to exurban development. In addition, black bears (Ursus americanus) used embedded greenbelts more frequently in high-density exurban subdivisions. Using our development gradient provides ecologically relevant insight into how mammals respond to residential development, and our results demonstrate that some species respond positively to residential development, but that others decline or disappear as the development gradient intensifies. Incorporating well-designed and naturally vegetated open spaces into development projects and minimizing human disturbance could mitigate impacts to mid-large sized mammals in regions undergoing exurban expansion.

AB  - Circulation network design, widely mentioned as road network design, is one of the main topics in urban planning, urban transportation planning, traffic engineering and urban design. In the literature on road network design, problems and principles are examined through quantitative and qualitative researches (Magnanti and Wong, 1984; Hillier, 1987; Ran and Boyce, 1996; Hillier, 1999; Southworth and Ben-Joseph, 2003; Drezner and Wesolowsky, 2003, Marshall, 2005). The former one implies analysis and simulation of demographic and economic variables in order to apply appropriate circulation schemes, while the latter one deals with various factors of design and aims to create urban spaces regarding 'space quality'. This paper examines the role of urban patterns in the formation of road networks; thereby depicting relative performance and handicaps of road networks under stated travel distribution among specified units.
   Road network design requires knowledge of circulation concepts and methodology of assessment. This study provides a topological analysis method and assessment criteria in order to understand performances of various types of road networks. In order to constitute road networks, circulation systems are adapted on three basic types of urban pattern: the grid, the hexagon and the radio-centric. Finally, two certain travel demand matrices are assigned to the specified road networks in order to assess relative advantages of various patterns and circulation networks. At the first stage, travel distribution among units (zones) is assumed to be uniform while second stage is performed with a matrix representing a centre-oriented travel distribution pattern. Here, circulation systems connote to the conceptual representation of movement of vehicles on specific routes, while circulation network (road network) is the concrete form of any specificied circulation system.
   There are numerous studies on advanced traffic management systems, which mainly focus on the issue of uninterrupted traffic flow (Ran and Boyce, 1996; Levinson, 2003). In the last decade, intelligent transportation systems and traveler route guidance stystems are extensively adapted to urban transportation systems. On the other hand, there are limited studies measuring the the performances of such systems, which are highly dependent to the characteristics of road network (Emmerink et al., 2003; Levinson, 2003). Marshall (2005) argues that street pattern is significantly influenced by the "geometry of movement" and "the topology of route connectivity". Geometry of movement is the representation of individuals' travel patterns while connectivity refers to the structural (topological) characteristics of road network; such as hierarchy and composition of links (road sections) and nodes (junctions).
   This study deals with the role of urban patterns on the formation of road networks and relative performances of circulation systems. Conceptual forms of circulation systems, described by Wright et al.(1989) are adapted to basic types of urban patterns (the grid, the hexagonal and the radiocentric) in order to obtain road networks. Those networks are compared in terms of network efficiency, measured by average travel distance, traffic volume/capacity ratio, standard deviation among travel volumes, and average travel time. Proposed measures are applied to 33 test networks, which are derived from three base patterns: the grid, the hexagon, and the radio-centric. Traffic assignment procedure is carried out in order to observe performances of road networks.
   Results showed that when uniform travel distribution is considered, connected networks, such as convex polygons and concentric corridors, perform better than less connected circulation networks. Those networks perform with uniform volume capacity ratios; therefore, hierarchial capacity design is not necessary for such systems. Convex systems have high efficiency when adapted to grid patterns rather than hexagonal and radio-centric. Average traffic volumes and standard deviation on convex networks are much less than semi-connected or tree networks. Hence, connected road networks perform with less average travel distance and average travel time. Results showed that grid patterns are more advantageous when convex circulation systems are adapted, while hexagonal patterns perform better when tree or star shaped systems are adapted.
   Compared to two-way systems, one-way circulation systems prove to be inefficient in terms of travel distance and time, however, conflicts at intersections are much less. When centre-oriented trips are assigned to road networks, star-shaped and tree-shaped networks perform better, however, total travel time and total travel distance is more than others. Those networks perform with moderate volume capacity ratios.

AB  - Connectivity, the degree to which the landscape structure allows movement between resource and habitat patches, is vital for facilitating a wide range of ecological processes across transformed and anthropogenic landscapes. Connectivity is critical for dispersal of individuals from natal sites, colonisation of patches across a landscape by populations, the structuring of populations, and their persistence across metacommunities. Here, we present a replicable methodology for conservation and land-management practitioners to promote maximal functional connectivity for multiple taxa across a mixed land-use mosaic containing natural habitat patches. We used the maximal functional diversity present in three key taxa (trees, birds, and mammals) responsible for the persistence of forests and the provisioning of ecosystem function and services, in a mosaic landscape of natural, agricultural, and urban land-use practices to map probabilistic connectivity corridors. We used a hybrid of Circuit Theory, least-cost resistance pathways and pinch-points based on the traits and ecological parameters of a surrogate taxon to map functional connectivity across an anthropogenically-fragmented and critically endangered forest biome, the Indian Ocean Coastal Belt Forest of South Africa. By using functional diversity measures, rather than taxonomic species richness, we ensured that maximal ecosystem services were safeguarded, concurrently achieving high-priority conservation goals of protecting specialist, endangered, and range-restricted species and traits that may otherwise be lost through high turnover of generalists at the expense of specialist species. Mapping circuit/least-cost corridors and critical pinch-points in remnant natural, yet unprotected forested patches, highlighted priority habitat to be conserved for promoting maximal functional connectivity, cognisant of the restricted budgets available for conservation planning and landscape-level protection. Our approach simultaneously protects ecosystem services, threatened specialist species and traits, and range-restricted and endangered habitats, linking current Protected Areas while prioritising landscape features of connectivity importance to be conserved for land-management practitioners with limited budgets.

AB  - This study provides the first inventory of small non-volant mammals in the Parque Estadual das Fontes do Ipiranga (PEFI), a protected area in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The data was collected from 2015 to 2017 in 16 research campaigns with a duration of five days each. Four areas with different phytophysiognomies were sampled throughout the dry and rainy seasons. We sampled small mammals using live-capture and pitfall traps. Eleven species were captured, composed of six rodents and five marsupials. The sampling effort involved 5,600 traps/night, there were 527 capture events, and we captured 302 distinct individuals: 174 marsupials and 128 rodents. Recaptures accounted for 42.7% of the total captures. No significant differences were observed in the richness and abundance of small non-volant mammals between the different phytophysiognomies. We also found no significant differences in the richness and abundance of small non-volant mammals between the dry and rainy seasons. The relative abundance (Ar) and constancy index (C) of the species showed that the three most abundant and common species in the PEFI are: Didelphis aurita, Akodon montensis and Oligoryzomys nigripes, which represented 93.7% of the captures. Tomahawk traps accounted for 69% of the total captures, and pitfall traps were responsible for detecting the greatest richness, capturing 81.8% of the species. Comparing the efficiency of the different sampling methods in capturing small mammals in the PEFI, we observed significant differences between both pitfall versus Tomahawk and pitfall versus Sherman in the understory. The results obtained in this study are consistent with the past and current situations of the forest fragment which are in recovery after significant altered by anthropic activity. In light of this scenario of degradation and isolation, a defaunation process affecting the mastofauna is very likely in the PEFI, which favors the establishment and dominance of generalist species. This study could be the basis for further monitoring programs of small non-volant mammals. The data obtained here will also increase knowledge about the diversity of small mammals in urban fragments of the Atlantic Forest and demonstrate the importance of the PEFI for the maintenance of ecologically important species within the largest metropolitan region in Brazil. These species play important biological roles for the maintenance of ecological interactions and for the provision of rare ecosystem services for the anthropic landscape, which is of great value to the city of Sao Paulo.

AB  - Habitat corridors that facilitate functional connectivity are a fundamental component of wildlife conservation in fragmented landscapes. However, the landscape matrix separating suitable habitat is not uniformly impermeable to movement and management to increase matrix permeability could be an alternative means to maintain connectivity. Gliding mammals are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because their movements are constrained by glide distance thresholds. Populations of gliders in cities are at risk of being isolated by increasing habitat loss and urban development, yet little is known about how the urban matrix affects glider movement. Here we investigate how the level of urbanization and tree cover in the matrix influence matrix permeability to sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps) within suburban forest reserves. Twenty-two sugar gliders were radio-tracked over winter and summer at four reserves. Boundary crossing behaviour was measured as the number of times each glider crossed into the matrix, and matrix permeability was determined as the maximum distance travelled by gliders into the matrix. The majority of gliders (81%) were located in the matrix at least once, and rates of boundary crossing were consistent across urbanization and tree cover levels. Matrix permeability was negatively affected by matrix urbanization, but not by matrix tree cover, and no interaction effects were found. Although distances travelled by gliders into the matrix did not exceed 180m, they were comparable with typical movement distances by gliders in reserves. Our results demonstrate that the urban matrix can provide suitable habitat for gliding mammals to move and forage, but that increased urbanization may inhibit glider use of the matrix irrespective of tree cover. This finding has implications for conservation planning and suggests that structurally connected areas may not be used if movement behaviour is inhibited. Conversely, management of matrix permeability could be used to maintain connectivity without needing to construct physical corridors.

AB  - We explore bird communities in different types of small urban greenspaces (<2 ha) in order to understand which birds occupy these structures, and the habitat and landscape features that affect them. In particular we analyzed how greenspace characteristics (size and vegetation structure), those of the adjacent landscape (area covered by urban structures and vegetation), and human disturbance variables (traffic of pedestrians, vehicles and noise levels) affected bird species richness, abundance and community composition (during summer and winter) in the city of Pachuca, Mexico. We selected 19 small greenspaces (ranging from 0.1 to 2 ha), including public parks, gardens and road strip corridors. We registered 39 species of birds of which 15 were migratory. In general bird species richness was higher in parks and gardens, and lower in road strip corridors, where more noise and traffic was registered. Greenspace area was the most important variable that positively influenced bird species richness, for both the summer and the winter communities. Summer bird species richness was lower in places that had a greater percentage of area covered by buildings in the adjacent landscape. Generalist and opportunistic species were favored by urbanization. Insectivorous species in winter were more abundant in larger greenspaces that had taller trees and more tree and shrub species, and in sites with more vegetative cover in the adjacent landscape. We suggest some management and urban planning actions that would benefit birds within many Latin American cities, where small greenspaces are often the only available refuges for birds.

AB  - The evolution of land surface temperatures (LSTs) within the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) is examined with respect to patterns of urbanization from 2000 to 2019. Change detection as well as examinations of five periods within the 20 years yield insights into the spatial patterning of surface urban heat (SUH) within the BMR. Results suggest that the LSTs in portions of the BMR have increased more than 5 degrees C during the 20-year period. The spatial distribution of SUH exhibits a pattern where high LSTs occur outward and primarily westward from the urban core along highways serving as development corridors and related regions of rapid urbanization. Nighttime LSTs have not increased as markedly as daytime; however, several noted "hotspots" have intensified over time and are located in districts along the southern seaboard. The greatest LST increase through the 20-year period is located in the northwest of the Bangkok urban core in Bang Kruai and Mueang Nonthaburi. A close investigation of this area indicates that the LST hotspots are co-located with rapid urban expansion into the area that has been facilitated by the destruction of orchards and other agriculture lands from a flood that occurred in 2011. The significant changes in land cover from orchards and agriculture to urban and built-up have led to the large increases in LSTs within the region.

AB  - Australia's cities and regions are the envy of the world for their natural beauty and lifestyle amenities and attractions. Not only has this sustained the tree-change and sea-change movement, with broadband connectivity and the COVID-19 pandemic so-called 'e-changers' and 'flee-changers' are part of the populus seeking to combine career aspirations with lifestyle destinations. This paper discusses the growing popularity of remote, particularly home-based work, and planning and design responses that accommodate this type of work in residential neighbourhoods. The issues are exemplified through a case study of the City of Gold Coast drawing on mixed methods including survey instruments and a design charrette facilitated by the authors. The design charrette is reported via three integrative narratives of a remote worker, the neighbourhood and the city. Findings outline preferences of remote workers towards built environment and urban design features enabling collaboration and knowledge exchange and assist in a better understanding of the socio-economic factors behind the spatial distribution of home-based work. The study's findings offer a range of implications for appropriate urban planning and design responses.

AB  - Outbreaks of plague in wildlife are sporadic and spatially dispersed, and they depend on coincidence of susceptible hosts, flea vectors, the plague bacterium (Yersinia pestis), and environmental factors that support pathogen transmission. We fit spatial models of plague outbreaks to a long-term data set (1981-2005) of towns of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) on the shortgrass steppe of northeastern Colorado. We investigated the effects of spatial distribution (town area and connectivity to other prairie dog towns), climate (spring and summer precipitation and temperature), and soil moisture-holding capacity. In logistic regression models, plague epizootics were predicted by connectivity to other towns experiencing plague during periods with relatively low temperatures, in soils with high moisture-holding capacity. After accounting for connectivity between prairie dog towns and current-year climatic conditions, little additional spatial or temporal autocorrelation was detected. Spatial logit association models provided evidence for localized epizootic hotspots and that greater summer rainfall predicted plague events. Plague outbreaks were not predicted by precipitation in the previous year. As such, no evidence was found to support an indirect cascade model of plague outbreaks for black-tailed prairie dogs on the shortgrass steppe in Colorado. Instead, the models suggest that plague occurrence depends upon direct climatic effects on flea vectors and the plague pathogen.

AB  - Birds in urban landscapes primarily occupy parks (forest fragments), wooded streets (linear strips connecting fragments), or the urban matrix. I studied the effects of street location in the landscape, vegetation structure, and human disturbance (pedestrian and automobile load) within wooded streets on bird species richness, temporal persistence, and density of feeding and nesting guilds, and on the probability of street occupation by individual species in Madrid during two consecutive breeding seasons. The number of species recorded increased from the least suitable (control streets without vegetation) to the most suitable habitats (urban parks), with wooded streets being intermediate landscape elements. Fourteen species, belonging to four of the eight guilds identified in this system, were recorded in wooded streets in both years. Streets that connected urban parks, along with vegetation structure, positively influenced the number of species within wooded streets, species persistence, guild density, and probability of occupation of streets by individual species. Human disturbance exerted a negative influence on the same variables. Wooded streets potentially could function as corridors, allowing certain species-particularly those feeding on the ground and breeding in trees or tree holes-to fare well by supporting alternative habitat for feeding and nesting. Local improvements in corridor quality, through increased vegetation complexity and reduced human disturbance, could exert a positive influence on the regional connectivity of the system. Because of differential use of corridors by species with different habitat requirements, however, corridor implementation should also take into account the target species of management.

AB  - Within urbanized areas, the importance of greenspaces for wildlife has been widely investigated for some animal groups, but reptiles have generally been neglected. To assess the importance of the amount, spatial distribution, and configuration of greenspaces (comprised of terrestrial and aquatic areas), we examined semi-aquatic turtle species richness in urbanized areas. In this study, we sampled turtles from 2010 to 2011 at 20 ponds, including farm (rural) ponds, ponds in urbanized environments, and golf course ponds. We used a hierarchical Bayesian species-richness model to estimate species richness and species-specific occupancy responses to three pond types (rural, golf, or urban) and four landscape measurements of greenspace (i.e., Euclidean nearest neighbor, interspersion juxtaposition, percent of landscape, and connectance), generated in FRAGSTATS. We found that probability of occupancy of four species, Kinosternon subrubrum, Trachemys scripta, Chelydra serpentina, and Pseudemys concinna increased substantially with an increase in connectance of greenspace within 500 m of each pond. When the model examining the configuration of greenspaces was analyzed, estimated species richness was greater at golf ponds as compared to either rural or urban ponds, and richness increased with increasing connectivity of greenspaces. Our results indicate that in golf course ponds can potentially support a greater diversity of semi-aquatic turtle species than rural or urban ponds and thus may be considered superior habitat in suburban environments. In addition, we suggest that maintaining connectivity of greenspaces in suburban areas is important for semi-aquatic turtles and should be considered in urban planning. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many ongoing processes in today's landscapes impact our environment considerably. Thus, it is enormously important to gather information on qualitative characteristics of our landscapes in order to effectively counteract the negative developments. Structural functionality as proxy for the assessment of habitat quality and species patterns has already proven potential to successfully describe ecological values. Completed by the measurement of green infrastructure information for a defined profile of a functional trait, a rapid and rough assessment of the qualitative state of habitats seems feasible. We therefore present in this study (i) an assessment of structural functionality based on the statistical analysis of landscape metrics, (ii) the measurement of green infrastructure and travelling costs for the ecoprofile of a Disturbance Sensitive Species Group (DSG) and (iii) an investigation if functionality and green infrastructure change between different types of landscapes and protection status. In the Lake Neusiedl region we selected 41 landscape samples based on a stratified random process. Based on orthophoto interpretation, we calculated landscape metrics with FRAGSTATS and reduced them to a core set of 13 indices by combining statistical results with literature review. Their relation to main ecological processes determined if the individual metric related positively or negatively with the land cover category and structural functionality was given by the average value of the landscape metrics. Green infrastructure elements were allocated with GUIDOS, whereas the travelling costs to move between them was also considered. Landscape elements of valuable matrix and connecting corridors ranked highest in structural functionality based on the calculated landscape indices but showed large differences between different land use regimes. Correlation and regression analysis confirmed the dependence of green infrastructure elements (corr. r(2) = 0.877) as well as travelling costs (corr. r(2) = 0.669) to functionality values. Protection status of the landscape samples proved to be a determining factor because functionality values as well as green infrastructure differed significantly (both with a p-value < 0.05) with the exception of dissecting corridors, stepping stones and travelling costs. We conclude that one simple guideline for a holistic assessment of structural functionality is hardly reachable but we did set up a comprehensive rule set. Based on a transparent sampling procedure, a qualitative assessment of habitats and landscapes can easily be conducted. The complementary use of an ecoprofile enables the valuation of green infrastructure elements and the identification of major driving forces along with scenario development for sustainable landscape planning.

AB  - Tsuga canadensis (Eastern Hemlock) forests provide unique riparian zones that can influence adjacent streams, but increasing mortality from the invasive Adelges tsugae (Hemlock Woolly Adelgid) is eliminating this distinctive landscape component in some regions. The objective of this study was to determine if a stream section within a hemlock ravine harbored a unique benthic community as compared to other sections of the stream that could be threatened in the event of a Hemlock Woolly Adelgid outbreak. We sampled benthic algae and macroinvertebrates in an unnamed tributary of Sugar Creek within Beach City Wildlife Area, OH, in April and September 2015. The stream flows through 3 riparian habitats: beech-maple upland forest, hemlock ravine, and lowland forest dominated by Acer saccharinum (Silver Maple), A. negundo (Box Elder), and Platanus occidentalis (American Sycamore). Our results show that Chironomidae, Navicula, Caloneis, and Nitzschia were the dominant taxa across all 3 stream sections, but that benthic macroinvertebrate richness and density were significantly lower in the hemlock ravine when compared to the lowland habitat. Periphyton community metrics were not significantly affected by riparian habitat. Overall, seasonality was more influential than riparian habitat on benthic community composition; specific taxa were indicative of either the spring or summer season. Connectivity between stream sites and/or the abundance of sandstone bedrock substrate at many sample locations might account for the similarity in benthic communities across these 3 habitats.

AB  - The establishment of a sustainable vegetation layer on shotcrete walls subjected to road environment represents enormous challenges. High inclination of almost 90 degrees, the exposed position of the walls near streets as well as lack of soil and water supply pose major limiting conditions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of an innovative greening technology for vertical structures in terms of vegetation development on varying plant substrates and geotextiles. The field experiment included testing three plant substrates on basis of nearby rocky excavation material ('Innsbrucker Quarzphyllit', 'Bundnerschiefer' and 'Zentralgneis') combined with compost. Additionally, five geotextiles (geogrid (3x4 mm), geogrid (9x10 mm), coir net, coir mat, geo mat) were applied for assessment. All test combinations were evaluated regarding vegetation cover, species composition, and biomass production from 2015 to 2016. Analyses of chemical properties were conducted for all plant substrates. Results showed highest vegetation cover ratio on 'Bundnerschiefer' and 'Innsbrucker Quarzphyllit', which can be explained by the favorable mineral composition (nutrient storage capacity) and chemical properties of compost (lower values of electrical conductivity and C/N ratio). In conclusion, the use of ` Green Walls' filled with 'Bundnerschiefer' or 'Innsbrucker Quarzphyllit' plant substrate in combination with netlike geotextiles like geogrid or coir net proved best. They are promising in terms of establishing an optimal vegetation cover on vertical structures and are well suited for integrating shotcrete walls into the landscape. The use of local excavation material for greening purposes thus can be confirmed. Though, the use of high-quality compost is crucial.

AB  - Recent investigations of Blanding's turtles Emydoidea blandingii in urban landscapes in the Greater Chicago metropolitan area (GCMA) indicate that populations are small and isolated. This led to the prediction that two local populations of Blanding's turtles in the GCMA would have less within-population genetic variation than larger populations in Michigan, Nova Scotia, and Wisconsin. We further predicted that Blanding's turtles in Nova Scotia would be genetically differentiated from those in the species' main range. We tested these predictions using variation in randomly amplified polymorphic DNA. Levels of genetic variability as measured by percent polymorphism and mean percent band sharing were similar among populations in the GCMA, Nova Scotia, and Wisconsin, though genetic variation in Michigan was significantly higher. No unique bands were detected in GCMA, however, 16 were found in Michigan, five in Nova Scotia, and one in Wisconsin. As predicted, Blanding's turtles in Nova Scotia, which have been geographically isolated from the species' main range for 4000-8000 pears, were genetically differentiated from all other populations in the study. Although it was not clear that recent isolation and population declines resulted in a loss of genetic variation, our results indicated that Blanding's turtles in the GCMA may be genetically depauperate. The use of management interventions to prevent the loss of genetic diversity in the GCMA is discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Karakoram Highway (KKH), a part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), is a major highway connecting northern Pakistan to China. The inventorying and analysis of landslides along KKH are challenging because of poor accessibility, vast study area, limited availability of ground-based datasets, and the complexity of landslide processes in the region. In order to preserve life, property, and infrastructure, and to enable the uninterrupted and efficient operation of the KKH, it is essential to strengthen measures for the prevention and control of geological disasters. In the present study, SBAS-InSAR (Small Baseline Subsets-Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) was used to process 150 scenes of Sentinel 1-A images in the year 2017 along the Karakoram Highway. A total of 762 landslides, including 57 complex landslides, 126 rock falls, 167 debris slides, and 412 unstable slopes, ranging in size between 0.0017 and 10.63 km(2) were identified. Moreover, this study also gains an inventory of 40 active glacier movements in this region. Landslide categorization, displacements characteristics, spatial distribution, and their relationship with various contributing factors have been successfully investigated along the entire KKH using image interpretation and frequency-area statistics. The criteria adopted for landslides categorization is presented in the study. The results showed that the 2-D ground deformation derived in Hunza valley echoes well with the general regional landslides characteristics. The spatial distribution analysis revealed that there are clumped distributions of landslides in the Gaizi, Tashkurgan, and Khunjerab in China, as well as in Hunza valley, and north of Chilas city in Pakistan. Statistical results indicated that these landslides mainly occur on south-facing slopes with a slope angle of 20 degrees-45 degrees and elevation relief of 550-2,100 m. Landslide development is also related to low vegetation cover and weathering effects in mountain gullies. Overall, our study provides scientific data support and theoretical references for prevention, control, and mitigation of geological disasters in the Karakoram region.

AB  - The environmental factors affecting the spatial dynamics of bird communities in urban parks are well understood, but much less attention has been paid to the seasonal dynamics of bird communities. Since migrant and resident human commensal birds might have contrasting responses to environmental factors of urban parks, we expected different seasonal dynamics among parks. On the other hand, because bird species can have different habitat relationships throughout the year, we also expected different responses of bird richness to environmental variables between breeding and non-breeding seasons. Bird surveys were conducted in 14 small urban parks (1-4 Ha) of Mar del Plata city (Argentina) for one full annual cycle. Bird richness changed between seasons, but bird abundance remained constant. Bird community composition did not vary between seasons, but urban parks near the urban center, with the highest pedestrian traffic and isolation to other green areas had the least seasonal change of composition. During the breeding season, bird richness was negatively affected by the percentage cover of high buildings surrounding the immediate limits of parks, whereas during the non-breeding season bird richness was not related with any environmental variable. Bird composition variation among parks was affected by the distance to the urban center during both seasons. Results showed that urbanization promotes a seasonal homogenization of bird communities in urban parks, probably by affecting the presence of migrant species and promoting the temporal stability of human commensal species.

AB  - We investigated the relationships between vegetation area, edge length, and mammals in the urban woods of Daejeon Metropolitan City, South Korea. The vegetation patches included in this study varied from 2.1 to 501.0 ha in size. Surveys were conducted monthly between February and October 2015, with a survey route measuring 1km in length and 10 m width established in each forest patch. Field signs of 14 species of mammals were recorded in the 33 chosen forest patches over the course of the study period, and the number of species in each patch varied from 2 to 11. Mammal species richness was positively correlated with vegetation area, and field sign frequency was positively correlated with vegetation area and negatively correlated with edge length. The field sign frequencies of large moles Mogera robusta, Siberian chipmunks Tamias sibiricus, leopard cats Prionailurus bengalensis, Korean hares Lepus coreanus, water deer Hydropotes inermis, and wild boars Sus scrofa were positively correlated with vegetation area. Moreover, that of large moles, leopard cats, Korean hares, and water deer were negatively correlated with edge length. Remnant vegetation area and edge length are the primary determinants of mammal species richness and field sign frequency in urban woods, highlighting the importance of vegetation patch size for mammal conservation in fragmented urban landscapes.

AB  - Global wildlife populations are in decline, in part, due to urbanization. However, in urban landscapes, green infrastructure such as green roofs are being created to provide habitat for wildlife. Green roof isolation, planting heterogeneity, and size can all influence wildlife biodiversity, as may the age of a green roof. When new habitat is created, wildlife use of these new habitats is expected to increase over time. To test this expectation for birds, we monitored bird activity prior to and after installation of small green roof plots on six buildings located within New York City parks. Contrary to expectations, bird activity and bird species richness did not increase after green roof plot installation, nor did they increase over a period of 4 years following installation. These unexpected results may reflect the relatively small size of the plots or the fact that the plots were on buildings located within urban parks. Bird activity and bird species richness varied widely between roofs, and the composition of rooftop bird species may have been more influenced by the characteristics of the surrounding landscapes than the presence of the green roof plots. These findings suggest that small urban green roofs within a larger and, potentially, higher quality habitat may not provide additional habitat for foraging birds. Urban green roofs have numerous ecological and environmental benefits, but the size and characteristics of landscapes surrounding a green roof need to be considered when installing green roofs as wildlife habitat.

AB  - Urbanization particularly promotes habitat fragmentation, which in turn strongly affects biodiversity patterns. A major driver of species loss in isolated habitat patches is dispersal limitation. The relative importance of dispersal ability of species, spatial habitat configuration and local environmental conditions for predicting species composition is still unclear though. Addressing urban abandoned railway areas as study areas, we analyzed the relative importance of environmental versus landscape predictors (e.g. proportions of sealed, built-up and ruderal areas) using variation partitioning methods. To add the perspective of individual species dispersal ability, we characterized the effect of species traits on explained variation in species occurrence with a regression tree. The difference in explained variation in the occurrence of individual species (Delta Cfit) between a CCA with environmental predictors and environmental and landscape predictors together was analyzed.
   The results revealed that environmental predictors explained a slightly larger amount of variation than landscape predictors. Adding landscape predictors to the analysis with environmental predictors resulted in a sizeable increase in explained variation. The most important predictors in the CCA were photosynthetically active radiation, C/N-ratio in the soil and the proportion of ruderal habitats in the surroundings of the plots. The regression tree model showed higher Delta Cfit values for species with a long-term persistent soil seed bank. The lowest Delta Cfit values were found for species with a transient seed bank and long seeds.
   Linking dispersal-related traits to the predictability of species occurrence is a promising approach to reveal the interdependencies between environmental conditions, landscape configuration and species-specific dispersal abilities. Our results suggest that in fragmented urban habitats, a persistent seed bank is advantageous because it allows for stable populations once habitat patches have been colonized.

AB  - This study reports the concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers and hexabromobiphenyl in bottom sediment of two rivers within the city of Cape Town. Following the isolation of the target compounds by mechanical shaking technique, the routine analyses and structural elucidation of the target analytes were performed with high capillary gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-mu ECD) and gas chromatography-time-of -flight-mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) techniques, respectively. The mean concentrations of the total PBDE varied in the range of 0.06 - 2.47 ng/g in the Diep River. These values were relatively higher in the Kuils River. The mean concentrations of BB 153 ranged from not detected (ND) -0.39 ng/g. Similarly, the mean concentrations of BB 153 in the Kuils River were in the range of ND -1.21 ng/g. The statistical analyses performed on these data showed that majority of the PBDE congeners, except BDE 209 had strong positive correlation with the total organic carbon (TOC). Although effluent discharges from nearby wastewater treatment plants were identified as important source of PBDEs, other notable sources, including grey water intrusion could contribute to the contamination of the upstream of both rivers.

AB  - Urban Green Spaces (UGSs) can provide social and ecological benefits, and the coordination of these two functions will largely advance human-nature harmony in cities. As such, we proposed a comprehensive framework to evaluate UGSs multifunctionality, i.e. the coupling coordination relationship of ecological connectivity and spatial accessibility of UGSs. Wuhan City in Central China was taken as a case study, and multiple ecosystem service values of green space patches and the disordered use of UGSs multifunctionality were explored. The results demonstrated low-level coupling coordination of UGSs multifunctionality in Wuhan. More than 70% of UGSs were imbalanced, 27.91% of which featured small sizes, low connectivity and accessibility. We suggest that planners should optimize UGSs arrangement to improve species reachability, especially for species with dispersal distance less than 4 km, and to create 15-minute community life circles for residents at the same time. Our findings are expected to support the promotion of UGSs multifunctionality and the balance of urban development and habitat conservation.

AB  - Management strategies for the regional conservation of forest birds sometimes do not consider explicitly their applicability to areas with different degrees of urbanization. I studied the spatial and temporal distribution of forest passerines in wooded parks in the city of Madrid during two consecutive breeding seasons to identify factors relevant to local conservation, and compared these results to previous studies in rural-fragmented forests in central Spain to derive recommendations for local and regional management guidelines. Five independent factors were considered: park size, isolation, density of potential corridors, vegetation structure, and pedestrian rate as an indicator of human disturbance within parks. Species richness and species temporal persistence was positively influenced by park size, shrub and tree cover, number of shrub and tree species, number of thick tree trunks, and negatively by the number of thin tree trunks. Species turnover was negatively affected by park size, such that the temporal persistence of species was enhanced in large parks. The pattern of guild assembly was not random but nested (parks with few species were subsets of progressively richer parks); the accumulation of species being affected mainly by park size and human disturbance, and to a lesser degree by isolation and vegetation structure. With regard to the spatial distribution of individual species, park size and vegetation structure positively influenced five species each, whereas isolation and human disturbance negatively influenced two and one species, respectively. Fragment size and habitat structure were the most relevant factors affecting species richness of forest specialists in both rural and urban fragmented landscapes; therefore, regional conservation strategies to protect these species may also be applicable to urbanized areas in central Spain. However, some specific recommendations should be considered in urban and suburban landscapes: (1) habitat quality ought to be enhanced to meet specific habitat requirements, particularly in large parks; (2) the mechanisms and rates of dispersal of forest birds through the urban matrix should be further studied to improve the movements between regional and local populations; and (3) species-specific variations in tolerance to pedestrians and thresholds levels of human visitation within parks should be determined to minimize human disturbance effects.

AB  - Global biodiversity and land conservation initiatives rely on an accurate understanding of the spatial distribution of species populations and communities. Identifying the spatial habitat use of wildlife communities across land uses and levels of human modification provides the opportunity to produce more efficient and effectual conservation plans. Our goal was to model breeding bird community occupancy across a complete spectrum of human land use modification to determine the habitat characteristics that best maximized the conservation of bird diversity. We used repeatvisit point counts on private and public lands to record the detection/non-detection of breeding bird species across the land use gradient. We modeled multiple proportional land cover and landscape structure covariates and employed a hierarchical multi-species occupancy model to analyze the habitat use of each species and to estimate guild-level species richness dynamics across the study area. We detected a total of 70 breeding bird species and our model estimated a total of 78 species within the total metacommunity. We found that insectivorous species richness was lowest in urban and suburban areas (x = 7), but highest on multiple use working lands with low to moderate levels of human modification (x = 22), not in the fully preserved protected areas (x = 16). In contrast, the richness of the predominately human commensal omnivorous species was highest in urban and suburban areas (x = 10) and across much of the more human modified landscape and lowest in the preserved lands (x = 3). Moderately disturbed working lands, which primarily consisted of a mixture of rotating silvicultural tracts, agriculture, low density housing, and riparian corridors, supported the most species (x = 36) and were especially important for the occupancy of breeding neotropical insectivores. These findings highlight the potential conservation benefits for incorporating private working lands with multiple land uses and land covers into future conservation planning scenarios, both for their wildlife conservation potential and as buffers around traditional protected areas.

AB  - Aims Grassland plant species diversity is affected by local, temporal and landscape environmental factors, but what is the relative importance of those factors? Understanding this is crucial for the effective conservation of grassland vegetation. We analyzed the factors affecting species richness to contribute to native species conservation and alien species management in grassland vegetation. Location Semi-natural grasslands in Shiroi City, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. Methods The species composition in 36 grasslands was surveyed in 2014. Plants were classified as native grassland specialist, other native or alien species. Generalized Linear Models (GLM) were developed, with the number of species in each plant type as the response variable and local (habitat area, use of mowing management), landscape (adjacent land use, connectivity to other grassland habitats) and temporal (period for which the grassland has been preserved from development, i.e., temporal continuity) factors as explanatory variables. Other GLM were developed with the presence/absence of each species as a response variable and three factors as explanatory variables. Results Habitat area, use of mowing management and temporal continuity were most important in explaining the number of grassland specialist species and had significant positive effects on their richness. Species-based analysis identified a significant positive effect of temporal continuity on grassland specialist species. By contrast, habitat area and adjacent land use were most related to alien species richness. The number of alien species was high in grasslands adjacent to farmlands or roads. Conclusions The relative importance of temporal and spatial factors differs between native grassland specialists and alien species. Mowing is effective for the conservation of grassland specialists' species diversity, particularly in historically old grasslands. However, it is necessary to pay attention to the invasion of alien species from adjacent residential or agricultural areas.

AB  - P>1. Linear features associated with transportation and riparian corridors are known to inhibit the mobility of birds and other wildlife, yet the factors contributing to their barrier effects are poorly understood. The diversity of roads in urban landscapes provides an opportunity for elucidating the relative importance of factors such as noise, traffic volume, gap width and adjacent vegetation on animal movement.
   2. Using an avian mobbing call as a lure, we tested the willingness of forest songbirds to cross four types of linear features in the urban landscape of Calgary, Alberta, Canada: (1) roads of varying widths and traffic volumes, (2) conventional railways and light transit lines, (3) transportation bridges across riparian corridors, and (4) rivers.
   3. Using mixed effects logistic regression, we found that the size of the gap in vegetation was the most important determinant of movement (P < 0 center dot 001). As the gap in vegetation exceeded 30 m, the likelihood of movement decreased dramatically and by 45 m, birds were only half as likely to move across gaps as they were to move an equivalent distance in continuous tree cover. Traffic volume also had a significant dampening effect on movement (odds ratio = 0 center dot 952 per 1000 vehicle per day increase; P < 0 center dot 001) and generally explained more variation in the data than noise levels.
   4. Railroads proved to be the most permeable of the features we tested, probably owing to their relatively narrow width, which never exceeded 30 m. Surprisingly, rivers were less permeable than the anthropogenic linear features we tested, with a significant barrier effect evident even at widths < 50 m.
   5. The birds in our study showed a marked preference for flying over, rather than under, transportation bridges, particularly when adjacent vegetation was available.
   6.Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that linear features, both anthropogenic and natural, can significantly impede the movements of forest songbirds and that managing adjacent vegetation is a potentially effective way to mitigate these barrier effects in cities and other fragmented landscapes.

AB  - Context Functional connectivity is vital for plant species dispersal, but little is known about how habitat loss and the presence of green infrastructure interact to affect both functional and structural connectivity, and the impacts of each on species groups. Objectives We investigate how changes in the spatial configuration of species-rich grasslands and related green infrastructure such as road verges, hedgerows and forest borders in three European countries have influenced landscape connectivity, and the effects on grassland plant biodiversity. Methods We mapped past and present land use for 36 landscapes in Belgium, Germany and Sweden, to estimate connectivity based on simple habitat spatial configuration (structural connectivity) and accounting for effective dispersal and establishment (functional connectivity) around focal grasslands. We used the resulting measures of landscape change to interpret patterns in plant communities. Results Increased presence of landscape connecting elements could not compensate for large scale losses of grassland area resulting in substantial declines in structural and functional connectivity. Generalist species were negatively affected by connectivity, and responded most strongly to structural connectivity, while functional connectivity determined the occurrence of grassland specialists in focal grasslands. Restored patches had more generalist species, and a lower density of grassland specialist species than ancient patches. Conclusions Protecting both species rich grasslands and dispersal pathways within landscapes is essential for maintaining grassland biodiversity. Our results show that increases in green infrastructure have not been sufficient to offset loss of semi-natural habitat, and that landscape links must be functionally effective in order to contribute to grassland diversity.

AB  - The spatial morphology of waterfront green spaces helps generate cooling effects to mitigate the urban heat island effect (UHI) in metropolis cities. To explore the contribution and influence of multi-dimensional spatial indices on the mitigation of UHIs, the green space of the riparian buffer along 18 river channels in Shanghai was considered as a case study. The spatial distribution data of the land surface temperature (LST) in the study area were obtained by using remote sensing images. By selecting the related spatial structure morphological factors of the waterfront green space as the quantitative description index, the growth regression tree model (BRT) was adapted to analyze the contribution of various indexes of the waterfront green space on the distribution of the LST and the marginal effect of blue-green synergistic cooling. In addition, mathematical statistical analysis and spatial analysis methods were used to study the influence of the morphological group (MG) types of riparian green spaces with different morphological characteristics on the LST. The results showed that in terms of the spatial structure variables between blue and green spaces, the contribution of river widths larger than 30 m was more notable in decreasing the LST. In the case of a larger river width, the marginal effect of synergistic cooling could be observed in farther regions. The green space that had the highest connectivity degree and was located in the leeward direction of the river exhibited the lowest LST. In terms of the spatial morphology, the fractional cover values of the vegetation (Fv) and area (A) of the green space were the main factors affecting the cooling effect of the green space. For all MG types, a large green patch that had a high green coverage and connectivity degree, as well as was distributed in the leeward direction of the river, corresponded to the lowest LST. The research presented herein can provide methods and development suggestions for optimizing spatial thermal comfort in climate adaptive cities.

AB  - Electric powerline corridors are informal green spaces that encompass large areas of land and have the potential to support biodiversity in urban and suburban landscapes. However, the extent to which these corridors provide novel habitats compared to the surrounding landscape is unclear. Biodiversity in corridors is often compared to that of "natural" habitats despite the fact that the corridors are subject to frequent vegetation management. In urban and suburban landscapes, residential yards may provide a more appropriate comparison because they are a dominant type of green space and are also characterized by frequent vegetation management. We conducted a study of the biodiversity in suburban powerline corridors in northern Illinois, USA, and compared it to the biodiversity found in nearby residential yards. Our goal was to determine whether powerline corridors added ecological value to these suburban landscapes. We included three different management styles of powerline corridors: (1) frequently mowed and kept as lawn, (2) brush mowed on a five-year cycle ("old-field"), and (3) restored and/or maintained as native prairie. We measured the species richness and composition of plants, birds, and insect pollinators in corridors and yards. The corridor management types and comparison yards differed significantly in the richness of all three taxa, with old-field and/or prairie sites having greater species richness than mown corridors and/or comparison yards. Community composition also differed by management category. While the species richness of old-field sites tended to be high, prairie sites generally had more species of conservation interest. Our study shows that both old-field- and prairie-managed powerline corridors add habitat value to Midwestern U.S. suburban landscapes by providing alternative habitat types that support many species. Nonetheless, we suggest that managers looking to specifically support native and/or grassland specialist species in this region should manage sites as prairies when possible.

AB  - Riparian areas are often the only green areas left in urban and suburban landscapes, providing opportunities for conservation and connectivity of both aquatic and terrestrial organisms. While city planners and land managers often tout the importance of riparian networks for these uses, it is not well established if urban riparian plant communities are actually functioning as connected assemblages. Furthermore, urban riparian zones are well known to be highly invaded by non-native plant species and may be functioning to increase the spread of non-native species across the landscape. Here we examine connectivity of plant assemblages in riparian networks within an extensively urbanized landscape. We sampled riparian plant communities at 13 sites along three second-order streams of the Rahway River watershed, New Jersey. We also characterized propagule dispersal at each site by sampling litter packs on the river banks five times between March-October 2011 and identifying germinants from litter packs after cold stratification. Species turnover of both riparian and litter vegetation was more strongly associated with flow distance, particularly for native species, indicating that riverine systems are important for promoting connectivity of native plant assemblages in urban landscapes. However, non-native germinants significantly dominated propagule dispersal along the stream reaches, particularly early in the growing season, suggesting spread utilizing the river system and preemption may be an important mechanism for invasion success in this system. Our data show that management of invasive species should be planned and implemented at the watershed scale to reduce spread via the river system.

AB  - Uncontrolled urban development is threatening the survival of many terrestrial species worldwide, especially those with limited dispersal capabilities. Soil invertebrates account for a high proportion of the global biodiversity but there are few studies on how soil biodiversity varies with different parameters of landscape structure, especially in fragmented tropical habitats. Millipedes are among the most abundant detritivore invertebrates in the soil-litter macrofauna. We examined the relationships between soil millipede diversity and landscape structure in 12 forest patches of approximately 30 years of age, in northeastern Puerto Rico. Spatial characteristics of the landscape were determined from aerial color photographs and were digitized into a GIS package for analysis. Millipede species diversity and composition in these forest patches showed correlations with their surroundings (e.g. amount of forest in the matrix) and with the presence of vegetation corridors that connected to other forest patches, rather than forest patch attributes such as patch area and shape. Millipede species richness correlated negatively with the degree of isolation of forest patch (within 600 m radius), while species evenness correlated positively to the amount of forest within a 50 m buffer. Millipede species composition was related with the presence of vegetation corridors and the distance to the Luquillo Experimental Forest reserve. These findings show that a low degree of patch isolation, forested buffers, and presence of vegetation corridors need to be considered for the conservation and management of forest patches surrounded by urban developments, especially to protect terrestrial invertebrate species that require forested habitats for their dispersal.

AB  - Watershed urbanization leads to chemical and thermal pollution of urban streams and significant declines in aquatic biodiversity. Most investigators have focused on variation in total watershed impervious surface cover (ISC) as the primary driver of urban stream degradation. We asked instead whether the degree of connectivity between ISC and urban stream channels alters its effect. We compared 7 streams in the Raleigh-Durham metropolitan area of the southeastern USA that drained watersheds with similar amounts of pavement (ISC = 7-16% of watershed area) but spanning a wide range of hydrologic connectivity between these pavements and their receiving streams via both subsurface (pipe density range: 1.1-6.9 km/km(2)) and surface (road density range: 5.8-10.7 km/ km(2) ) flowpaths. Despite draining watersheds with similarly low levels of development, these 7 streams exhibited remarkable variability in their hydrologic and thermal regimes and varied in their macroinvertebrate diversity from a low of only 11 taxa to a high of 22. Both macroinvertebrate community composition and the tissue concentrations of Cu, Pb, and Zn in 3 stream invertebrate taxa (Cambaridae, Tipulidae, and Hydropsychidae) found across all sites were correlated with watershed hydrologic connectivity. These results suggest that the connectivity of ISC may drive considerable variation in the magnitude of ecosystem degradation associated with the same level of watershed development, with less connected or disconnected impervious surfaces having proportionally lower negative effects on aquatic organisms.

AB  - Identification of trait syndromes that make species vulnerable to habitat fragmentation is essential in predicting biodiversity change. Plants are considered particularly vulnerable if their capacities for persistence in and for dispersal among local habitats are low. Here we investigated the influence of easily measured functional traits on the presence of 45 plant species in an urban landscape in north-west Germany where patches were separated by distances consistent with regular plant dispersal range. To describe the spatial configuration of patches we calculated species-specific patch connectivities. Then we assessed plant connectivity responses in distribution models calculated from connectivities and environmental predictors. Twenty (45%) of the analysed species showed a positive connectivity response after accounting for species-specific habitat requirements. These species differed from non-responsive species by functional traits associated with dispersal, including reduced seed numbers and higher terminal velocities relative to non-responsive species. Persistence traits played however no role which we attribute to the environmental conditions of urban habitats and their spatiotemporal characteristics. Our study underlines that even ruderal plants experience dispersal limitation and demonstrates that easily measured functional traits may be used as indicators of fragmentation vulnerability in urban systems allowing generalizations to larger species sets.

AB  - Landscape features often shape patterns of gene flow and genetic differentiation in plant species. Populations that are small and isolated enough also become subject to genetic drift. We examined patterns of gene flow and differentiation among 12 floodplain populations of the selfing annual jewelweed (Impatiens capensis Meerb.) nested within four river systems and two major watersheds in Wisconsin, USA. Floodplain forests and marshes provide a model system for assessing the effects of habitat fragmentation within agricultural/urban landscapes and for testing whether rivers act to genetically connect dispersed populations. We generated a panel of 12,856 single nucleotide polymorphisms and assessed genetic diversity, differentiation, gene flow, and drift. Clustering methods revealed strong population genetic structure with limited admixture and highly differentiated populations (mean multilocus F-ST = 0.32, F-ST' = 0.33). No signals of isolation by geographic distance or environment emerged, but alleles may flow along rivers given that genetic differentiation increased with river distance. Differentiation also increased in populations with fewer private alleles (R-2 = 0.51) and higher local inbreeding (R-2 = 0.22). Populations varied greatly in levels of local inbreeding (F-IS = 0.2-0.9) and F-IS increased in more isolated populations. These results suggest that genetic drift dominates other forces in structuring these Impatiens populations. In rapidly changing environments, species must migrate or genetically adapt. Habitat fragmentation limits both processes, potentially compromising the ability of species to persist in fragmented landscapes.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the influence of human pressure and spatial structure of landscape on the occurrence of populations of small mammals in the environment of a large urban agglomeration. The investigations were carried out in Warsaw, Poland in 17 locations. The study sites were located on both sides of the Vistula River, of different landscape spatial structure, in various distances from the city center, and were subject to different degrees of human pressure. Part of the city located on the left bank of the Vistula River is more strongly transformed by man than the part located on the right bank of the river. A total of 933 specimens of 8 species of small mammals were caught using the live-trapping method (Catch-Mark-Release). The richest species composition was found at the city borders and in rural areas. On the left side of Vistula, the species diversity was lower than on the right side, showing significant negative correlation with the human pressure degree. Such pattern was not confirmed on the right side of the river. The only species to occur in all sites on the left side of Vistula was the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius). On the right side of Vistula, the striped field mouse was accompanied by the yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) in all research sites. The results indicate that the degree of human pressure and spatial isolation are crucial for composition of small mammal community. Less advanced urbanization processes in areas on the right bank of Vistula, as compared to districts on the left side, provide better contact between local populations of small mammals, and offer better living conditions to a large number of species, even in areas located in the center of the city.

AB  - The urban landscape is known to form a hostile matrix for wild plant communities because of its sealed infrastructure surfaces. However, green roofs can reduce this hostility by providing new spaces for wildlife directly on buildings. In this extensive study of 115 green roofs in northern France, we focused on wild plant communities and the variables that shaped their diversity and their taxonomic and functional compositions. A total of 176 colonizing vascular plant species were identified; 86% were natives, demonstrating that green roofs can serve as habitats for wild biodiversity despite their isolation in an urban landscape in three dimensions. Nonetheless, all types of green roofs were not equal, with the substrate depth playing a major role in the wild plant diversity. The taxonomic and functional compositions of the colonizing plant communities were also shaped by the substrate depth, green roof age, surface area, and height and maintenance intensity at the building scale. We did not detect any effect of the surrounding potential habitats at the landscape scale. The study of functional traits revealed that the wild plant communities are adapted to open xero-thermophilous conditions. This study led us to consider an ecological typology for green roofs referred to as stratum classification, which is based on the vegetal structures living and colonizing these anthropo-ecosystems. Wild roofs adapted to receive spontaneous species could play an interesting role in urban biodiversity dynamics if they continue to be developed at large scales in cities. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Context Cities are a challenging habitat for obligate nocturnal mammals because of the ubiquitous use of artificial light at night (ALAN). How nocturnal animals move in an urban landscape, particularly in response to ALAN is largely unknown. Objectives We studied the movement responses, foraging and commuting, of common noctules (Nyctalus noctula) to urban landscape features in general and ALAN in particular. Methods We equipped 20 bats with miniaturized GPS loggers in the Berlin metropolitan area and related spatial positions of bats to anthropogenic and natural landscape features and levels of ALAN. Results Common noctules foraged close to ALAN only next to bodies of water or well vegetated areas, probably to exploit swarms of insects lured by street lights. In contrast, they avoided illuminated roads, irrespective of vegetation cover nearby. Predictive maps identified most of the metropolitan area as non-favoured by this species because of high levels of impervious surfaces and ALAN. Dark corridors were used by common noctules for commuting and thus likely improved the permeability of the city landscape. Conclusions We conclude that the spatial use of common noctules, previously considered to be more tolerant to light than other bats, is largely constrained by ALAN. Our study is the first individual-based GPS tracking study to show sensitive responses of nocturnal wildlife to light pollution. Approaches to protect urban biodiversity need to include ALAN to safeguard the larger network of dark habitats for bats and other nocturnal species in cities.

AB  - The ecological impacts of landscape modification and urbanisation have transformed the composition of plant and animal assemblages, and altered the condition of ecosystems globally. Landscape transformation influences the spatial distribution of species and ecological functions by selecting for generalist species with wide ecological niches, which can adapt to opportunities in highly-modified environments. These effects of landscape modification can shape functional diversity on land, but it is not clear whether they have similar functional consequences in the sea. We used estuaries as a model system to test how landscape transformation alters functional diversity in coastal seascapes, and measured how variation in level of urbanisation, catchment modification and habitat loss influenced fish diversity across thirty-nine estuaries in eastern Australia. Fish were surveyed with baited remote underwater video stations and functional diversity was indexed with three metrics that describe variation in the functional traits and niche space of assemblages. The extent of landscape transformation in the catchment of each estuary was associated with variation in the functional diversity of estuarine fish assemblages. These effects were, however, not what we expected as functional diversity was highest in modified estuaries that supported a large area of both urban and grazing land in their catchments, were bordered by a small area of natural terrestrial vegetation and that contained a moderate area of mangroves. Zoobenthivores and omnivores dominated assemblages in highly-modified estuaries, and piscivorous fishes were common in natural waterways. Our results demonstrate, that the modification and urbanisation of ecosystems on land can alter functional diversity in the sea. Intense landscape transformation appears to select for abundant generalists with wide trophic niches, and against species with specialised diets, and we suggest that these changes might have fundamental consequences for ecosystem functioning in estuaries, and other highly modified seascapes.

AB  - Modelling population dynamics of invasive species may help to propose effective management countermeasures. Invasion dynamics generally show recursive patterns across species and regions, where initial lag is followed by spread and eventual dominance phases. However, timing and modes of these phases are highly variable, emerging from the interplay between traits of the invader and characteristics of the invaded landscape. Disentangling this interplay is particularly arduous in species with complex life-histories, where an individual passes through different life stages that alter physiology, behaviour and interactions with the environment. Here, we describe an age structured model that can be utilized to simulate population dynamics of invasive pond-breeding anurans. The model follows a spatially structured population approach, each pond representing a discrete habitat patch that exchanges individuals with other similar patches, and simulates change in survival and dispersal behaviour as a function of age. It also integrates dispersal with landscape complexity through landscape resistance modelling to depict functional connectivity across the pond network. Then we apply the model to a case study, the invasion of the guttural toad Sclerophrys gutturalis in Cape Town, first detected in 2000. Age-structured demographic and spatial dynamics of the focal population are reconstructed in a network of 415 ponds embedded in a heterogeneous landscape. Parameterization is conducted through field and laboratory surveys, a literature review and data collected during an ongoing extirpation from 2010. We use the model to explore: i) occurrence and duration of lag phase; ii) whether the spatial spread fits an accelerating or a linear trend; iii) how simulated dynamics match field observations. Additionally we test model sensitivity to demographic and behavioural traits. We found a lag phase in both demographic and spatial dynamics; however the lag duration of these dynamics does not coincide, where invaders start to spread across the pond network five years before the demographic explosion. Also, we found that the spatial spread fits an accelerating trend that causes complete invasion of the network in six years. Such dynamics noticeably match field observations and confirmed patterns previously detected in other invaders characterized by high dispersal abilities. Sensitivity analysis suggests that it would have been preferable to quantify initial propagule size and post-metamorphic survival in the field; both timing and modes of invasion are particularly sensitive to these parameters. We conclude that the model has potential to forecast amphibian invasion dynamics and test management countermeasures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Like many parts of the US, Maryland is urbanizing rapidly. The scattered pattern of low-density development consumes an excessive amount of land, fragments the landscape, displaces many native species, and disrupts ecosystem functions. Maryland's Green Infrastructure Assessment is a tool developed in the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to help identify and rank those areas of greatest statewide ecological importance, as well as those at greatest risk of loss to development. It identifies large contiguous blocks of natural land (hubs), interconnected by natural corridors to allow animal and plant propagule dispersal and migration. Hubs and corridors were ranked within their physiographic region for a variety of ecological and development risk parameters, as well as combinations of these. Prioritization was also done on a finer scale (0.127 ha) for ecological importance and vulnerability to development, allowing a more detailed analysis for site prioritization within the network. The hub and corridor framework identified through the Green Infrastructure Assessment is being used to guide Maryland's ongoing land conservation efforts. At a multi-state scale, the green infrastructure method has been used as the framework for setting landscape ecological priorities within the Chesapeake Bay program. At a regional scale, the method has been used to rank or focus areas for state land conservation programs. Within a local government planning context, the method is now being translated into locally relevant criteria to support county-scale green infrastructure initiatives. Finally, the cell-based ranking method has been incorporated into parcel prioritization that has been used to aid state, local and private land trust conservation decision-making.

AB  - The Tawawa Woods Natural Landmark, Wilberforce, Xenia Township, Greene County, OH (39degrees 43' N, 83degrees 52' W), and the associated riparian forest corridor along Massies Creek has nurtured at least five human cultures over the past three millennia: Native Americans (Adena ca. 1000 BC, Hopewell ca. 100 BC, and Shawnee in the 17(th) to early 19(th) centuries), European Americans, and African Americans. The purpose of this study was to document the land use patterns of these cultures and their influences on the hydrological and botanical characteristics of Tawawa Woods as a basis for understanding the current dynamics of the woods. Archival accounts from photographs, correspondence, departmental board minutes, surveys, maps, and existing physical structures were used to reconstruct prior land use patterns. Historic tree species diversity was estimated using land surveys from 1799-1856. Current tree species composition of Tawawa Woods was estimated using a combination of plot and point-centered quarter sampling methods. Tree and herbaceous species outside plot sample areas were identified by walk-through surveys and documented with photographs. Historic accounts suggest that the number of springs and flow rates had significantly decreased by the beginning of the 20(th) century. Release of pollutants into Massies Creek, deposits of refuse into the woods, and continued demand for lumber during the late 19(th) and early 20(th) centuries may have altered both water tables and biodiversity. Witness tree data identify 15 different tree species, while current surveys recognize 31 tree species and at least, 79 herbaceous and vine/shrub species.

AB  - Microclimatic condition is a fundamental indicator for evaluating outdoor space livability and vitality. Research has shown that poorly designed building layouts can lead to discomfort; however, the mechanisms influencing outdoor microclimate based on residential building layout are unclear for high temperature and high humidity regions. This study explores the relationship between residential building layouts and the outdoor wind and thermal environment at the pedestrian level in Wuhan, a city renowned for high temperatures and high humidity. Six typical residential building layouts were simulated, using the ENVI-met numerical model, to determine the spatial distribution of wind speed and air temperature. The Universal Thermal Climate Index was adopted as a comprehensive index with which to assess spatial and diurnal variations in microclimates surrounding each building layout. Results showed that parallel building layouts formed a ventilation corridor that increased wind speeds by approximately 0.3 m/s. A staggered building layout, in line with the prevailing wind direction, facilitated airflow in the ventilation corridor and further increased wind speeds. Windward buildings blocked high-temperature airflows and reduced air temperatures by approximately 1 degrees C in parallel layouts, and 1.4 degrees C in enclosed layouts. However, the cooling effect of windward buildings on high-temperature airflow was weaker than the warming effect caused by the wind shadow effect and direct sunlight. Additionally, the performance of the thermal comfort of the enclosed type layout was significantly better, for most of the day, than the parallel type layout.

AB  - The spatiotemporal distribution and dynamic changes of species composition of myxomycetes in humid subtropical forests of Houhe National Nature Reserve in southern China were studied by collecting samples of bark and ground litter within four seasons for isolation of myxomycetes in moist chamber cultures and by collecting fruiting bodies in the field from June to October. A total of 725 specimens of myxomycete fruiting bodies representing 77 species of 25 genera were registered, among them 302 records/51 species from field collections and 423 records obtained from 600 moist chamber cultures of ground litter and bark of living trees, which resulted in 35 and 39 species, respectively. Cornuvia serpula and Perichaena microspora were recorded for the first time in China. Both myxomycete species richness and diversity were significantly different in ground litter among sites and field collections among months. NMDS combined with Permanova indicated that the site had a greater impact on the myxomycete community of bark and litter than the season, while the month of field collections had a greater impact than the sampling sites. CCA and VPA analysis showed that the bark-inhabiting myxomycete species were mainly affected by spatial variables, while the litter-inhabiting and field collected species were more affected by climatic factors.

AB  - Progress is required in response to how cities can support greater biodiversity. This calls for more research on how landscape designers can actively shape urban ecologies to deliver context-specific empirical bases for green space intervention decisions. Design experiments offer opportunities for implemented projects within real-world settings to serve as learning sites. This paper explores preliminary ecological outcomes from a multidisciplinary team on whether purposefully engineered native grassland gardens provide more habitat functions for insects than mainstream gardens in the City of Tshwane, South Africa. Six different sites were sampled: two recently installed native grassland garden interventions (young native), two contemporary non-native control gardens (young non-native) on the same premises and of the same ages as the interventions, one remnant of a more pristine native grassland reference area (old native), and one long-established, non-native reference garden (old non-native). Plant and insect diversity were sampled over one year. The short-term findings suggest that higher plant beta diversity (species turnover indicating heterogeneity in a site) supports greater insect richness and evenness in richness. Garden size, age, and connectivity were not clear factors mediating urban habitat enhancement. Based on the preliminary results, the researchers recommend high native grassland species composition and diversity, avoiding individual species dominance, but increasing beta diversity and functional types when selecting garden plants for urban insect biodiversity conservation in grassland biomes.

AB  - As natural habitats become fragmented by human activities, animals must increasingly move through human-dominated systems, particularly agricultural landscapes. Mapping areas important for animal movement has therefore become a key part of conservation planning. Models of landscape connectivity are often parameterized using expert opinion and seldom distinguish between the risks and barriers presented by different crop types. Recent research, however, suggests different crop types, such as row crops and orchards, differ in the degree to which they facilitate or impede species movements. Like many mammalian carnivores, bobcats (Lynx rufus) are sensitive to fragmentation and loss of connectivity between habitat patches. We investigated how distinguishing between different agricultural land covers might change conclusions about the relative conservation importance of different land uses in a Mediterranean ecosystem. Bobcats moved relatively quickly in row crops but relatively slowly in orchards, at rates similar to those in natural habitats of woodlands and scrub. We found that parameterizing a connectivity model using empirical data on bobcat movements in agricultural lands and other land covers, instead of parameterizing the model using habitat suitability indices based on expert opinion, altered locations of predicted animal movement routes. These results emphasize that differentiating between types of agriculture can alter conservation planning outcomes.

AB  - Loss of forest naturalness challenges the maintenance of green infrastructure (GI) for biodiversity conservation and delivery of diverse ecosystem services. Using the Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi target #11 with its quantitative and qualitative criteria as a normative model, we aim at supporting landscape planning through a pioneering assessment of the extent to which existing amounts and spatial distributions of High Conservation Value Forests (HCVFs) meet these criteria. Highly forested and committed to both intensive wood production and evidence-based conservation targets of 17-20% protected areas, Sweden was chosen as a case study. Specifically, we estimated the amount, regional representation, and functional connectivity of HCVF patches using virtual bird species, validated the results using field surveys of focal bird species, and assessed conservation target fulfilment. Finally, we linked these results to the regional distribution of forest land ownership categories, and stress that these provide different opportunities for landscape planning. Even if 31% of forest land in Sweden is officially protected, voluntarily set-aside, or not used for wood production now and in the future, we show that applying the representation and connectivity criteria of Aichi target #11 reduces this figure to an effective GI of 12%. When disaggregating the five ecoregions the effective GI was 54% for the sub-alpine forest ecoregion, which hosts EU's last intact forest landscapes, but only 3-8% in the other four ecoregions where wood production is predominant. This results in an increasing need for forest habitat and landscape restoration from north to south. The large regional variation in the opportunity for landscape planning stresses the need for a portfolio of different approaches. We stress the need to secure funding mechanisms for compensating land owners' investments in GI, and to adapt both the approaches and spatial extents of landscape planning units to land ownership structure.

AB  - Hybrid zones between species provide natural systems for the study of processes involved in divergence, reproductive isolation and speciation. Townsend's Dendroica townsendi and black-throated green D. virens warblers are phenotypically and genetically divergent groups that occur in western and eastern North America respectively, with potential for range contact in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia, where other west-east avian pairs come into contact. Although one potential hybrid (a phenotypic Townsend's warbler with the black-throated green mitochondrial DNA) has been previously reported, there have been no studies of interactions between the taxa in potential areas of sympatry. To determine whether interbreeding between these species is a regular occurrence we examined variation in individuals across the area of putative range overlap. Analysis of plumage, morphology, and mitochondrial (COI) and nuclear molecular markers (CHD1Z and numt-Dco1) shows surprisingly extensive hybridization between these species, with at least 38% of individuals in the hybrid zone being either hybrids or backcrosses. Each of the traits displays a sigmoidal cline centred along the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains (molecular cline centres averaging 50 km east of the crest of the Rockies, ranging from 41 to 56 km). The clines are narrow (average molecular cline width is 60 km, ranging from 40 to 87 km) relative to the dispersal distance of related warbler species, suggesting that selection is maintaining the hybrid zone; we discuss possible sources of selection. Given the narrowness of the zone we recommend the two forms should continue to be treated as separate taxonomic species. Townsend's warblers also form an extensively studied hybrid zone with their more closely related southern relative, the hermit warbler D. occidentalis. The combined system of three discrete forms separated by narrow hybrid zones provides an excellent system for the study of hybridization, reproductive isolation and speciation.

AB  - In this study, we aim to gain a better insight on how habitat filtering due to urbanization shapes bird communities of Vienna city parks. This may help to derive implications for urban planning in order to promote and maintain high diversity and ecosystem function in an increasing urbanized environment. The structure of wintering bird communities of 36 Vienna city parks - surveyed once a month in January 2009, December 2009, December 2012, and January 2013 - was described by species richness and the functional diversity measurements FRic (functional richness), FEve (functional evenness), and FDiv (functional divergence). Environmental filtering was quantified by park size, canopy heterogeneity within the park, and the proportion of sealed area surrounding each park. Species richness, FRic, and FDiv increased with increasing park size. Sealed area had a strong negative effect on species richness and FDiv. Canopy heterogeneity played a minor role in explaining variance in FDiv data. FEve did not respond to any of these park parameters. Our results suggest a loss of species richness and functional diversity, hence most likely indicate a decline in ecosystem function, with decreasing park size and increasing sealed area of the surrounding urban landscape matrix.

AB  - Linear plant compositions establish a connection between rural and urban landscapes. The green fields, which are abundant in rural areas, are diminished in urban spaces due to rapid urbanization. This problem can be solved by using linear planting techniques in urbanized places. Nearby establishing green corridors in cities, linear planting serve as very nice visual compositions and provide functionalities. Linear plant compositions, which are quite important for the city, were examined owing to 3 different purposes. The first is the identifying of the plants having been used in linear green compositions. The second is the determining of the functional differences while the last one is preference and visual perception differences depending on users. In this study, totally 32 species were identified. Ligustrum japonicum, Biota orientalis and Hydrangea macrophylla were recorded as the most common species. The se linear compositions were used as barrier with the rate of 78% in residential areas and 50% in open green spaces, as border with the rate of 40% in public spaces, as curtain with the rate of 86 in public areas, as separator with the rate of 87% in transportation areas. Visual quality of linear compositions was assessed by using chi(2) analysis. Statistically reliable (%95) P<0.005 results were found between user and visual quality As a result, linear plant compositions in Trabzon possess evergreen plant species by 70%. In addition, the linear plant compositions looking aesthetic were identified to be preferred more according to Semantical Differential Technique.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a significant threat to biodiversity worldwide. Habitat loss and the isolation of habitat fragments disrupt biological communities, accelerate the extinction of populations, and often lead to the alteration of behavioral patterns typical of individuals in large, contiguous natural areas. We used radio-telemetry to study the space-use behavior of the Coachwhip, a larger-bodied, wide-ranging snake species threatened by habitat fragmentation, in fragmented and contiguous areas of coastal southern California. We tracked 24 individuals at three sites over two years. Movement patterns of Coachwhips changed in habitat fragments. As area available to the snakes was reduced, individuals faced increased crowding, had smaller home-range sizes, tolerated greater home-range overlap, and showed more concentrated movement activity and convoluted movement pathways. The behavioral response shown by Coachwhips suggests, on a regional level, area-effects alone cannot explain observed extinctions on habitat fragments but, instead, suggests changes in habitat configuration are more likely to explain the decline of this species. Ultimately, if "edge-exposure" is a common cause of decline, then isolated fragments, appropriately buffered to reduce emigration and edge effects, may support viable populations of fragmentation-sensitive species.

AB  - In this study, we tested whether the spatial distribution of waterbirds is influenced by shoreline urbanization or other habitat characteristics. We conducted monthly censuses along shoreline sections of a continental lake (Lake Balaton, Hungary) to assess the abundance of 11 common species that use this lake as a feeding and staging area during migration and winter. We estimated the degree of urbanization of the same shoreline sections and also measured other habitat characteristics (water depth, extent of reed cover, biomass of zebra mussels, distances to waste dumps and to other wetlands). We applied linear models and model averaging to identify habitat variables with high relative importance for predicting bird distributions. Bird abundance and urbanization were strongly related only in one species. Other habitat variables exhibited stronger relationships with bird distribution: (1) diving ducks and coots preferred shoreline sections with high zebra mussel biomass, (2) gulls preferred sites close to waste dumps, and (3) the abundances of several species were higher on shoreline sections close to other wetlands. Our findings suggest that the distribution of waterbirds on Lake Balaton is largely independent of shoreline urbanization and influenced by food availability and connectivity between wetlands.

AB  - Cemeteries are often seen as monofunctional spaces for burial and mourning and, within the dynamically changing urban fabric, as a planning conundrum. Long periods of stability have also turned these untouched and hidden places into refugia for nature and wildlife. In booming and dense cities with high land use pressures and housing shortages, in particular, as the amount of burial ground needed per citizen decreases and burial cultures change, the cemetery has become a contested nature, as a simultaneous space of emotion, commerce and community. We revisited the diversity and ontogenesis of cemeteries, and the interactions with neighboring uses of the urban matrix. Our review demonstrates a wide range of different ecosystem services of urban cemeteries, beyond potential as hotspots of culture and biodiversity. We highlight their multifunctional character and the need for a holistic and trans-disciplinary evaluation using multistakeholder approaches to further develop cemeteries as a crucial element of sustainable urban landscapes.

AB  - Beijing, the capital and second largest city of China, expanded in a typical concentric pattern. The urbanized area consists of five concentric zones, which are based on the city's ring road system. Willow trees (Salix spp.) are commonly planted and abundant in the city. In this study, we determined the effects of urbanization on willow trunk-dwelling weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea) in a 3-year survey. Our results indicated that species richness and abundance decreased from outskirts to the urban center. It was estimated that within a 30-km limit, species richness and abundance might be reduced by 0.9 species and 59.3% of individuals per 5 km toward urban center. Landscape variables (e.g., the proportion of impervious surface and distance to urban center) explained 59.4% of species richness and 43.9% of species abundance. Local variables (e.g., plant resources and site size) explained only 4.9% of species richness and 4.7% of species abundance. Our results show that there is a negative relationship between urban expansion and weevil diversity. There are several ways in which such detrimental effects on biodiversity could be mitigated: (1) Optimization of urban landscape structures, as well as vegetation planting; (2) increasing connectivity between urban remnants and natural landscapes in the outskirts of the city; and (3) limiting the proportion of impervious surface in inner urban zones.

AB  - Balancing the needs of biodiversity in the context of ecologically sustainable development remains a challenging and ongoing issue for consent authorities, developers and scientists alike. This article explores some of the practical, scientific, legislative and policy issues facing the protection of biodiversity in the context of urbanisation. The application of legislative and policy instruments to environmental decision-making needs to be complemented with more site-specific, evidenced-based research and with regard to the biodiversity of the broader landscape. It is argued that such an approach will help determine more accurately the likely long-term environmental outcomes that can be expected from setbacks, offsets, buffers and corridors within urban landscapes. In examining the question of setbacks adjacent to development, various relevant examples of court decisions are considered. In addition, a range of recent research studies are used to show that riparian zones are ecologically distinct as compared with non-riparian bushland. In addition, riparian corridor width is shown to influence the composition of flora and invertebrate fauna communities, supporting the use of wide buffers to maximise biodiversity outcomes. The application of site-specific empirical findings in biodiversity planning and decision-making will help limit and mitigate the key threatening processes of clearing and fragmentation.

AB  - Obtaining accurate tree cover maps within cities is a first step toward managing for equitable access to their ecosystem services. For example, by removing air pollutants trees contribute to fewer health impacts, and tree cover expansion could extend these benefits by targeting the most polluted areas and vulnerable populations. To support strategic tree expansion, this research created urban tree cover maps using the 2017 NASA MOD44B satellite 250m pixel product for 35 megacities, areas with large levels of pollution and vulnerable populations. Estimates of tree cover from photo-interpretation (PI) were used to characterize map error, city-wide, and from low to high tree cover, using 21 bins from 0 to 100% tree cover. Map accuracy was highest when MOD44B percent tree cover was combined with its tree cover standard deviation product, with average difference of 1.8% compared with PI estimates of 19.9% city-wide tree cover. MOD44B estimates of tree cover spatial patterns had strong explanatory value. Themaps explained the PI estimates of low to high tree cover at 5% tree cover intervals with an R-2 = 0.97. The Getis Ord Gi* statistic determined a non-random spatial distribution of tree cover within the megacities, with significant clustering into hot spots of relatively high tree cover and cold spots of relatively low tree cover. Tree cover hot spots were most often furthest from downtown, at the rural-urban interface or within higher elevation terrain. Tree cover cold spots were most often in areas of concentrated development and along traffic corridors known for high levels of particulate matter and other air pollutants that could be reduced by trees. Given small increases in exposure to particulate matter are associated with significant increases in death rates from viruses, and that climate change and associated heat waves are forecast to exacerbate health risks to air pollution, we need to improve global urban tree cover. These map products can be used to expand tree cover that strategically contributes to pollutant abatement, human well-being, and sustainable cities.

AB  - Compensating for the adverse ecological impacts of waterway development and improving their ecological functioning to achieve good ecological potential (GEP) have become mandatory within the European Union (EU). The technical rehabilitation measures presented here aim to functionally minimize the hydraulic impacts of navigation on aquatic biota in highly urbanized waterways. Their ecological functioning and potential to enhance biodiversity locally was assessed by comparing their macro-invertebrate community composition with nearby non-restored sites. Rehabilitation led to lower hydraulic impact on the littoral zone, which in turn led to the presence of otherwise missing macrophytes and the occurrence of organic mud habitats colonized by invertebrates typically rare in urban waterways. While the control sites were dominated by few, mostly invasive taxa in vast numbers, the rehabilitated sites exhibited a highly diverse community with 22 protected mollusc and insect taxa typically found in the oxbow communities of natural rivers. This major improvement was however not detected using the core metrics of the legally required national assessment tools of the EU Water Framework Directive. Overall results proved the success of this type of rehabilitation measure with respect to improving biodiversity, but they also showed the limiting and key factors influencing the macro-invertebrate communities of highly deteriorated urban waterways. Indeed, future implementations of this type of rehabilitation measure should consider spatial extent, water exchange rates, temporal succession of vegetation and adaptive management to improve its ecological functioning.

AB  - Through a literature review, we determined the current state of knowledge on urban ecology in the larges cities of southern Chile: Temuco, Valdivia, Osorno, Puerto Montt and Punta Arenas. This review revealed the scarcity of studies on urban ecology where urbanization is increasing considerably, unkowning the impacts that this phenomenon may have on their ecosystems. Puerto Montt is the city with greater increase in urban population and simultaneously, the city with the lowest number and diversity of studies. The main impacts generated by the process of urbanization on the landscape are watershed pollution, air pollution, loss of native biodiversity and increasing exotic species. Suggestions are given to increase and conserve local biodiversity in the urban landscapes of southern Chile, as well as the lines of research needed to be done.

AB  - Although the bird communities of some urban habitats have received considerable research attention, the bird fauna of wooded streets have been little studied despite the fact that wooded streets constitute a distinct feature of the urban landscape. In order to examine the effects of vegetation structure and floristic attributes on bird species richness and bird abundance, 216 wooded streets in the city of Valencia (Spain) were surveyed during three consecutive seasons in the year 2000. During the survey 1,378 individuals of 14 bird species were recorded. With the exception of the House Sparrow (Passer domesticus) and the Collared Dove (Streptopelia decaocto), most of these species had very low abundances. Depending on the season, the species recorded in wooded streets represented between 19-25% of the species recorded in the nearby urban habitats. Across seasons, tree species richness, tree abundance and tree height were the main factors influencing bird species richness and bird abundance. 34 tree species out of 41 were used by birds. Some large tree species like the Box Elder (Acer negundo), the Siberian Elm (Ulmus pumilla) and the White Poplar (Populus alba) were preferred. A substantial change in the design and management of wooded streets in order to improve their suitability for bird fauna is suggested.

AB  - The ecological quality of urban is a key standard to evaluate a modern urban. So far many methods have been used to understand environment quality of urban. Some ground information can he obtained directly with the help of the Remote Sensing (RS). The ground thermal radiant is the immediate embodiment of the energy transition of the urban system, then the ground situation could be seen clearly with RS inspecting the ground thermal radiant. Employing Remote Sensing data ETM+ of Guiyang in China on Nov 1(st) 2000, we set up the index of thermal radiant to study the thermal codition and used interpreting mothed to obtain the information of land cover such as the vegetation status, the urban construction volume ratio and water percentage. After analyzing these data, the following results can be acquired: Firstly, ground thermal radiant reflects the character of the urban ground cover. In the urban ecological environment, ground thermal radiant mainly reflects the density of the building the percentage of greenland and water in urban, which indicate the urban ecological environment. The thermal radiant indexes of water, Greenland, road and building are 1.19; 1.20,1.24 and 1.27. So the 1.24 is reasonably regarded as a critical point of the thermal radiant change and can be used as a standard to distinguish the grade of ecological quality in Guiyang. Secondly according to the analysis of the ground thermal radiant and urban greenland spatial distribution, there are two urban greenland ecological corridor discovered in Guiyang Urban. Besides, in order to improve the urban ecological environment and reduce the ground thermal radiant, the Greenland in eight regions in GuiYang should be advised to be built up.

AB  - Riparian zones are important for the many ecosystem services they supply. In settled areas, the vegetation of such zones is shaped by human land-use; this often creates conditions under which alien plant species thrive. Alien plants have been shown to induce large-scale changes in riparian habitats, and they pose a major threat to the continued provision of key ecosystem services. We used direct gradient analysis to assess correlations between land-use and the composition of vegetation along a riparian river corridor in the highly transformed landscape surrounding Stellenbosch in South Africa's Western Cape Province. Vegetation plots were sampled along the entire length of the river from headwaters to estuary (ca. 40 km). Plant community composition was analyzed in relation to land-use data collected in the field, and additional land-use variables computed from digital land-cover data. Patterns of plant community structure were found to be directly related to land-use, with measures of cover, richness, and diversity differing significantly among land-use types. Portions of the riparian zone adjacent to agricultural land had the greatest level of alien plant cover, while areas bordered by urban land maintained the highest alien species richness. Areas adjacent to grazing and natural lands showed intermediate and low levels of invasion, respectively. Several native species were found to persist in areas with high abundance and diversity of invasive alien plants, suggesting that they will be valuable focal species for future restoration attempts. Due to the level of human-mediated change in many areas of the riparian zone, restoration to historic conditions over most of the river is not considered feasible. These areas should be recognized as examples of novel ecosystems, and management efforts should focus on restoring or creating desirable ecosystem functions, rather than on achieving assemblages comprising only native species.

AB  - Landscape connectivity for wildlife populations is declining globally due to increasing development and habitat fragmentation. However, outside of full protection of undeveloped wildlife corridors, conservation planners have limited tools to identify the appropriate level of densification such that landscape permeability for wildlife is maintained. Here we sought to determine the development characteristics that contribute to movement potential in an exurban landscape for a large carnivore, the puma. We first fit a piecewise step-selection function from movement paths from 28 male pumas to identify threshold levels of development that produce barriers to movement. We then applied this threshold to projected housing densities of existing parcels under a full General Plan buildout scenario in Santa Cruz County to illustrate how parcels at risk of increasing above the puma movement threshold can be identified. Finally, we tested the relative importance of characteristics associated with parcels and the surrounding area on relative puma movement. We found that pumas exhibit avoidance of housing density that saturates at a threshold, and that puma utilization of parcels at risk of densification above this threshold is predicted by parcel area and the housing density and area of surrounding parcels. Our work suggests that maintaining permeability in developing landscapes is likely contingent on preventing densification and parcel subdivision in exurban areas. We discuss how our findings and approach can be used by conservation planners to promote landscape permeability in already partially developed landscapes.

AB  - The article discusses the morphological changes of birch trees due to bacterial dropsy growing in the "Green Belt" artificial forest in the surrounding of the Nur- Sultan city. Samples of kernel were taken from diseased tree trunks, and, afterward, isolated bacterial cultures were grown in a nutrient medium. For molecular genetic studies, one strain (designated as DDdd-1), the most typical of morphological characteristics, was selected, the colonies of which showed the greatest growth on nutrient media. The nucleotide sequences 8F and 806R of 16SrRNA were determined on the basis of sequencing. The resulting sequences were compared in GenBank from the NCBI database showing related species and their similarities. Extraction of cores from infected birch trunks, isolation of pure strains of the pathogen, molecular identification of ribosomal RNA 16S nucleotide chains were performed using modern methods in the field of bacteriology. Then, the results obtained were compared with relevant data from the International Genbank database. Molecular characteristics of isolated bacterial DDdd-1 strain have been found to correspond to typical Dickeya dadantii by 96.72%. According to the International Genbank, the DDdd-1 strain is defined as pathovar D. dadantii pv. betulae. The data obtained demonstrate close relation of DDdd-1 strain Dickeya dadantii pv. betulae to some strains of Dickeya chrysanthemi. The species identified in International Genbank as Erwinia chrysanthemi with index numbers KJ541470.1 and AF373175.1 are assumed to be identical to D. dadantii pv. betulae. Dickeya is a complex taxon that still requires a lot of research efforts on species composition, close family bonds, the size and structure of host plants.

AB  - Many estuarine shorelines are influenced by urbanization. Extensive shoreline modification in Upper New York Harbor (UNYH) included port development, landfilling marshes, and armoring. Recent sedimentation in constructed shipping terminal embayments, abandonment of shoreline structure maintenance, subsequent recruitment of upland and intertidal vegetation, and restoration projects have naturalized some shorelines in this urban setting. We determined the species composition and relative abundance of fishes and crabs in shallow shoreline habitats in constructed embayments of UNYH with seine sampling to determine the potential for restoring similar isolated shallow water sites as functional habitats. Twenty-seven identified species of fishes and crabs, including seasonally transient and resident marsh species, were represented in samples dominated by Menidia menidia, but marsh resident and coastal ocean species were also periodically abundant. Differences in assemblage structure among the sampled embayments as measured by principal components analysis were weak despite some differences in the slope and colonization of vegetation along shorelines. The mere presence of shallow shorelines was sufficient to recruit numerous species. Assemblage differences relative to a nearby relatively unaltered estuary revealed a lack of southern, warm affiliated species reflecting a natural clinal gradient. Marsh resident species dominated in UNYH, but not as strongly as at the reference estuary. Together with a previously published evaluation of life cycle connectivity for several sentinel species, this study shows that even small, isolated projects seeking to restore shallow shorelines add value to the estuarine landscape and are worth pursuing.

AB  - Urban green infrastructure (UGI) is an important habitat for birds and acts a leading role in bird diversity conservation. However, the response of bird diversity to UGIs characteristics have not been well understood. Taking Shenzhen as an example, a dataset of bird records was compiled by several citizen science. We quantified the impact of environmental characteristics of UGI on bird diversity by the generalized additive model. Then, the clustering method was used to classify bird diversity bundles for identifying priorities of UGIs. The results showed that: (1) There are significant differences in urban gradients formed the spatial pattern of bird diversity. (2) There was mainly nonlinear relationship between the bird diversity and UGI environmental characteristic, with different response processes and thresholds. Area of UGI was critical for bird diversity, and an area of about 20 km2 plays a relatively large role. Moreover, migratory birds were more sensitive to the negative impact of the surroundings of UGI, such as impervious surfaces and nighttime light. (3) The cluster analysis indicates that UGIs with better eco-environment were conducive to maintaining bird diversity. This study could be helpful to provide guidelines for the implementation of UGI planning and management and bird diversity conservation.

AB  - Urbanization causes fragmentation creating "islands" of natural habitat. The resulting fragmented landscapes represent a challenge for migratory and resident species because of decreased connectivity among fragments. We examined the effects of urbanization on avifauna communities in remnant and restored parks in the greater St. Louis area (St. Louis), Missouri and Illinois, USA. St. Louis is located along the Mississippi flyway, a significant North American migratory bird route, and ranks second among the most sprawl-threatened large cities. We compiled bird assemblages for 20 parks and used multiple linear regressions and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) to analyze seven potential predictors of species richness for breeding, migratory and wintering species: area, habitat diversity, external development within 1 km and 5 km buffers, internal developed areas, road length, and presence of water bodies. The best predictors of resident bird (i.e., breeding and wintering) species richness was park area and external developed area within 5 km, a surrogate for isolation. We suspect that the high species richness in parks in heavily urbanized areas is explained by the parks' relatively large size and the funneling of species to two large parks within the most urbanized areas of St. Louis. For migratory species, the best predictors were habitat diversity and developed area within the park. As development continues to transform natural habitat along important avian migratory flyways, urban planning that includes large, diverse natural areas within urbanized landscapes is key to conserving local and migratory avifauna diversity.

AB  - The federally endangered watercress darter (Etheostoma nuchale) is restricted to only five springs within the greater Birmingham (AL) metropolitan area. Restricted range, subpopulation isolation and threats from the urban landscape are the major factors endangering the species. The preferred habitat of E. nuchale has been described as the deeper, slow-moving portions of spring pools with dense aquatic vegetation, but its habitat use patterns have not been carefully studied. Because the long-term survival of E. nuchale will likely depend on the protection and restoration of suitable habitat, more needs to be known about its preferred habitats. We studied habitat use patterns of E. nuchale and the geomorphologic and environmental conditions associated with these habitats in Seven Springs, a population recently discovered in 2003. Geomorphology and vegetation were surveyed throughout the spring pool and the spring run connecting it to the nearest tributary. Fish were surveyed via seining in eight distinct habitats. We found that E. nuchale can use a greater diversity of habitats than previously appreciated, including both shallow and non-vegetated habitats. While densities of adult fish were higher in vegetated habitats, fish of all ages and sexes were found in non-vegetated habitats where structural diversity is provided by detritus or gravel. Males were most abundant in mats of aquatic moss, while females showed no strong habitat associations other than avoiding habitats with no shelter. Juveniles were mainly associated with aquatic moss and pools with detritus. The best conditions for in-stream vegetation favored by E. nuchale were in the spring pool where the channel was broad, the current slow and shallow margins were extensive. Our findings suggest that habitat conservation plans that reduce storm water runoff and increase streambed and riparian stability, specifically in habitats downstream of springs that house E. nuchale, could promote aquatic vegetation growth and structural diversity, thus expanding the species usable habitat.

AB  - Urban parks can provide a resource for maintaining and increasing bird biodiversity. However, little research has been conducted to show the differences in bird community diversity between parks adjacent to mountains and rivers in the city center of highly urbanized areas. This study analysed whether the bird composition and species diversity differed between parks adjacent to Baiyun Mountain (hillside parks) and Pearl River (riverside parks) in Guangzhou, South China. From January 2018 to December 2020, 137927 birds representing 206 species were recorded. The results indicated that the number of species and individuals of birds were higher in hillside parks than in riverside parks in each season. The number of species and individuals was also higher in hillside parks than in riverside parks in different functional groups according to bird food type, residential type, and ecological type. The number of species shared by the two types of parks was 120. The unique birds' species number in hillside and riverside parks were 67 and 19, respectively. Bird diversity in terms of richness and Shannon index was higher significantly in hillside parks than in riverside parks in summer. Principal component analysis of environmental traits of 18 parks showed that plant traits in parks have relatively high and positive contribution. Correlation analysis indicated that bird diversity was positively affected by water area, the highest altitude, habitats diversity and tree evenness in park, while negatively regulated by building coverage around each park. The top 20 most abundant bird species accounted for 87.5% of the total birds in the study period. Nycticorax nycticorax, Urocissa erythroryncha and Podiceps ruficollis were observed more frequently in hillside parks, while Pycnonotus aurigaster, Passer montanus, Acridotheres cristatellus were observed more frequently in riverside parks. Principal coordinates analysis also indicated that bird communities significantly differed between hillside parks and riverside parks. In conclusion, our findings highlight the importance of conserving mountains and rivers as buffer zones for serious anthropogenic disturbance in the city center. We propose that the conservation of hillside parks is a priority strategy for enhancing urban birds biodiversity.

AB  - While it is appreciated that the biodiversity within vegetated green infrastructure generates ecosystem services that improve the well-being of urban residents, advances in urban sustainability are hindered because we lack a solid mechanistic understanding of how biodiversity provides these services. Here, we outline a trait-based urban ecology agenda for researching how species' traits provide ecosystem services (trait-service relationships) in tandem with how species with desired service-providing traits establish in vegetated green infrastructure (community assembly). Because trait-service relationships and community assembly processes can differ in urban versus natural environments, this agenda will fill major knowledge gaps of how biodiversity promotes urban sustainability. Results from our research agenda can be implemented by planners and managers to enhance service provisioning and ultimately improve urban sustainability.

AB  - Increased urbanization drives habitat loss, yet residential land-use represents significant habitat potential for mammals and could provide connectivity between patches of green spaces. Diverse mammal communities exist across urban gradients, but it is unclear how mammal community composition varies within residential lands. We conducted a camera trapping study in 36 residential yards across an urban gradient to assess the relative contributions of the degree of urbanization in the land-use context versus parcel habitat features, such as vegetation structure, on mammal community diversity and composition. We hypothesized that land-use context would more strongly influence mammal community metrics than parcel features, and that there would be species-specific differences in response. We detected 14 non-domesticated mammal species and found that species richness peaked in the suburbs and tapered off at the rural and urban ends of the gradient in accordance with patterns seen in other taxonomic groups, yet rarely quantified in mammals. Large-bodied interior forest species were associated with rural sites, urban-dwelling species were associated with urban sites, and suburban sites had an overlap of species types. Although composition of mammal species in residential yards appears to be strongly related to land-use context, which is often outside of residents' control, management of parcel habitat features such as retention of large mature trees may facilitate connectivity between patches of habitat across urbanizing landscapes. Informed residential yard management remains an important tool for urban wildlife management in an era of global change.

AB  - This paper is aimed to analyze the existing relationships and controlling functions between the urban green infrastructures on the resilience of the urban sprawl. The analysis begins questioning whether urban sprawl sustainable growth can be controlled after achieving urban supported by urban green infrastructure. The analytic method used is based on developing a conceptual and theoretical framework of reference to review the literature on the main variables of the research: Green infrastructure, resilience, and urban sprawl. It is concluded that while it is difficult to find linear causality in a direct relationship among the variables of the analysis, it is supported by the existence of more holistic connectivity leading to the controlling of the urban sprawl. The analysis suggests that a holistic approach is required to build urban resilience based on green infrastructure by addressing a fuller range of ecosystem disturbances and disasters, to create the outcomes that develop the environmental and ecological benefits of urban spectrum of ecosystem disturbances and disasters, to create the outcomes that develop the environmental and ecological benefits of urban sprawl.

AB  - The ability to predict spatial variation in biodiversity is a long-standing but elusive objective of landscape ecology. It depends on a detailed understanding of relationships between landscape and patch structure and taxonomic richness, and accurate spatial modelling. Complex heterogeneous environments such as cities pose particular challenges, as well as heightened relevance, given the increasing rate of urbanisation globally. Here we use a GIS-linked Bayesian Belief Network approach to test whether landscape and patch structural characteristics (including vegetation height, green-space patch size and their connectivity) drive measured taxonomic richness of numerous invertebrate, plant, and avian groups. We find that modelled richness is typically higher in larger and better-connected green-spaces with taller vegetation, indicative of more complex vegetation structure and consistent with the principle of 'bigger, better, and more joined up'. Assessing the relative importance of these variables indicates that vegetation height is the most influential in determining richness for a majority of taxa. There is variation, however, between taxonomic groups in the relationships between richness and landscape structural characteristics, and the sensitivity of these relationships to particular predictors. Consequently, despite some broad commonalities, there will be trade-offs between different taxonomic groups when designing urban landscapes to maximise biodiversity. This research demonstrates the feasibility of using a GIS-coupled Bayesian Belief Network approach to model biodiversity at fine spatial scales in complex landscapes where current data and appropriate modelling approaches are lacking, and our findings have important implications for ecologists, conservationists and planners.

AB  - European Greenway developments typically 'upcycle' disused transport corridors for multi-use, non-motorised public infrastructure. The linear and relatively undisturbed nature of these disused infrastructures means many currently function as high quality ecological corridors. Corridors providing connectivity among habitat patches can mitigate the effects of fragmentation on biodiversity, allowing species dispersal throughout the landscape matrix. The sustainable integration of Greenway infrastructure and ecological corridor functions requires consideration during design, development and maintenance stages, taking into account surrounding landscape composition and connectivity. This paper presents a method to characterise a proposed Greenway corridor landscape, focusing on habitat composition and ecosystems connectivity. Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) was used to comprehensively describe the structural connectivity of linear and spatial habitats occurring within the study area. A subsequent multivariate classification of structural connectivity and habitat data determined six distinctive landscape characters. Interpretation of these landscape characters highlights the principal habitat compositions and connectivity conditions in terms of habitat core, links and potential linkages. For example one landscape was intensified, yet retained high woodland connectivity, while another diverse habitat landscape supported little connectivity for woodland and grasslands. The results of this study suggest significant opportunities exist to enhance European landscape connectivity through informed Greenway development. Crucial habitat linkages can be optimised along Greenway infrastructure, contributing towards the realisation of European Greenways as Green Infrastructure and true sustainable projects.

AB  - Human land use is one of the primary threats to terrestrial species richness and is considered a priority for meeting global sustainability and biodiversity targets. Decision-support tools, such as life cycle assessment (LCA), are widely used for developing strategies to achieve such objectives. Currently available life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods apply the countryside species-area relationship (c-SAR) to quantify habitat conversion impacts on species richness. However, additional effects of habitat fragmentation are yet ignored in these assessments. We use the species-habitat relationship (SHR), an adaptation of the c-SAR that considers both habitat conversion and fragmentation effects, to develop a new set of land-use characterisation factors for 702 terrestrial ecoregions (in 238 countries), four land-use types (urban, cropland, pasture, and forestry), and four taxonomic groups (amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles; plus the aggregate of these vertebrate groups). The SHR generally predicts higher per-area impacts of land-use than the impacts estimated by the c-SAR (a median relative difference of +9%), indicating that land-use impacts may be systematically underestimated when ignoring fragmentation effects. Whereas per-area impacts of land-use on regional species richness are highest in temperate regions, reflecting the diminished extent of natural habitat, per-area impacts of land-use on global species richness are highest in the subtropics, reflecting the importance of tropical regions and islands to global vertebrate species diversity. The large variety in magnitude of land-use impacts across the world's regions emphasizes the importance of regionalised assessments. The set of characterisation factors proposed here can be readily used in environmental decision-making. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Urbanization has been linked to amphibian population declines globally. Habitat fragmentation can negatively impact gene flow among populations but what role artificially constructed wetlands have in maintaining gene flow in urban amphibian populations remains uncertain. We assessed gene flow in a population of wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) inhabiting both constructed and natural wetlands located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. We genotyped 10 microsatellite loci in 182 frogs from eight wetlands and tested for genetic differentiation between wetlands. We tested if bottlenecks had occurred at constructed wetlands and if there were differences in allelic richness between natural wetlands and constructed wetlands. We found no evidence of bottlenecks, no differences in allelic richness among subpopulations, and no genetic structure within the population. Although significant differences in pair-wise comparisons of allele frequency distributions between wetlands were detected, all F-ST values were low (0.003-0.053) and Bayesian clustering indicated the presence of a single genetic cluster. Despite extensive urbanization within our study area, genetic homogeneity has been preserved indicating that it may be possible to use constructed wetlands to maintain amphibian populations and preserve gene flow among subpopulations living within urbanized landscapes.

AB  - The endangered Grassland Earless Dragon (Tympanocryptis pinguicolla) exists only in fragmented populations separated by agricultural and urban landscapes. To provide the tools for estimating the genetic structure and dispersal characteristics critical for the proper management of this species, we isolated and tested 10 tetranucleotide polymorphic microsatellite markers. The loci were highly polymorphic when tested on 32 individuals from one population showing seven to 18 alleles. The values of both the observed and the expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.350 to 0.938 and from 0.710 to 0.880, respectively. We detected no linkage disequilibrium among these loci following Bonferroni correction, however, one locus (ED2G3) consistently violated Hardy-Weinberg expectations when tested on natural populations and is expected to have null alleles. A second locus (ED2H5) was found to violate Hardy-Weinberg expectations in one population but not in others and will require evaluation more broadly. In summary, we have developed eight or nine markers to study the fine-scale population genetics of Tympanocryptis pinguicolla in the ACT.

AB  - The world is rapidly urbanizing, and many previously biodiverse areas are now mostly composed of impervious surface. This loss of natural habitat causes local bird communities to become dominated by urban dweller and urban utilizer species and reduces the amount of habitat available for migrating and breeding birds. Green roofs can increase green space in urban landscapes, potentially providing new habitat for wildlife. We surveyed birds and arthropods, an important food source for birds, on green roofs and nearby comparable conventional (non-green) roofs in New York City during spring migration and summer breeding seasons. We predicted that green roofs would have a greater abundance and richness of both birds and arthropods than conventional roofs during both migration and the breeding season for birds. Furthermore, we predicted we would find more urban avoider and urban utilizer bird species on green roofs than conventional roofs. We found that both birds and arthropods were more abundant and rich on green roofs than conventional roofs. In addition, green roofs hosted more urban avoider and utilizer bird species than conventional roofs. Our study shows that birds use green roofs as stopover habitat during migration and as foraging habitat during the breeding season. Establishing green roofs in urban landscapes increases the amount of habitat available for migrating and breeding birds and can partially mitigate the loss of habitat due to increasing urbanization.

AB  - Simple Summary The continuous intensification of urbanisation has led to severe degradation and loss of bird habitats, directly affecting the diversity of birds. In this study, we focused on seven representative river wetlands around Chaohu Lake (China) to analyse the impact of urbanisation on bird diversity. The species richness at sections of the lake entrance was higher than in the middle sections of the river, and the Shannon-Wiener index during autumn was higher than that during winter. Urbanisation was an important driving factor that changed land use types near rivers and the structure of bird communities. The response model of river ecological indicators to the intensity of urbanisation shows a negative exponential correlation between the waterbird diversity index and the urbanisation intensity. Our research is of great significance for future urban landscape planning and bird community diversity protection. Urbanisation is known to result in 'urban stream syndrome', which poses a huge threat to the river health. Birds, which are an important part of the river ecosystem, are sensitive to environmental changes in the basin. The ratio of the impervious surface area is a macroscopic indicator of urbanisation intensity in river basins. In this study, we combined the results of a year-round field survey of seven river wetlands around Chaohu Lake (China) with satellite remote sensing image data from the same period. The species richness at sections of the lake entrance was higher than in the middle sections of the river, and the Shannon-Wiener index during autumn was higher than that during winter. The waterbird diversity index declined exponentially with increases in the intensity of urbanisation. The changes in the land use patterns around river wetlands associated with urbanisation resulted in the loss of food resources and habitats. Therefore, the intensity of urbanisation was an important driving factor that leads to changes in the bird community structure of river wetlands, so it had a significant impact on the diversity of river wetland birds in all four seasons combined with a variety of influencing factors. Our research could be a guide for urban landscape planning and bird diversity protection. For example, the results suggested that it is necessary to identify river wetlands as an important part of the urban ecosystem, reduced building area, increased vegetation coverage, and retained slope protection and river beach land.

AB  - Riparian zones provide many ecosystem services and are a frequently found type of green area in urban ecosystems; these areas increase the aesthetic value of urban landscapes. The aim of this 17-year study was to assess the applicability of passive vegetation restoration of the gravel/sand bars that emerged after a devastating flood along the river in the city of Prague. The number of species and the sum of their coverages rapidly increased for the initial six years. After the twelfth year, the vegetation composition gradually began to stabilize. Species diversity increased for seven years after the beginning of the succession and then remained essentially unchanged. The diversity values were lower on finer substrates with higher proportions of dust and clay particles. The neophytes, i.e. species introduced after the year 1500, established with more successful on substrates with greater soil skeleton proportions. Finer substrates were preferred by graminoids; among them, the invasive Arrhenatherum elatius was the most abundant. The share of invasive species in the total vegetation cover initially fluctuated at approximately 40%; after eight years, it stabilized at approximately 10%. The proportion of naturalized alien species stabilized within the range of 20-30%. The results show that a new type of species-rich vegetation spontaneously emerged on gravel/sand bars. The vegetation consisted mainly of native and naturalized non-invasive alien species. However, attention needs to be given to potential alien plant invasions.

AB  - Deficient dispersal ability due to habitat fragmentation adversely impact demographic connectivity and gene flow among population in a metapopulation, and therefore potentially leads to local extinction. A rich body of theoretical work provides distinct predictions regarding the distribution of dispersal abilities in relation to fragmentation gradient. Yet, empirical data remains elusive in general, and it is lacking for anthropogeni-cinduced landscapes in particular. We collected 9884 seeds of a wind-dispersed annual species Geropogon hybridus (Asteraceae) from 807 individual plants of 55 populations spanning three landscapes in a fragmented agroecosystem and measured four major dispersal-related traits at the landscape, population, plant and seed levels. Contrary to previous studies that were based on island or urban landscapes and where fragmentation was associated with reduced dispersal, we revealed increased seed dispersal ability in the more fragmented patches. However, the specific relationships between dispersal-related traits and fragmentation characteristics varied with ecological scale. The discrepancy between our results and those from previous studies may be explained by the milder contrast between the fragmented patches and the surrounding matrix in our system, which is a common feature in many agroecosystems. The findings add to the accumulating evidence that different selection pressures and constraints act on seed dispersal evolution under the global land use change.

AB  - Urbanization is a major contributor to habitat loss and fragmentation and is considered a global threat to biodiversity. We studied reptile and amphibian species diversity and abundance in a highly fragmented landscape adjacent to the second largest metropolitan area in the United States. Habitat patches in our study area were made up of remnant native vegetation surrounded by roads, housing, and other urban development. Species richness and diversity were positively associated with patch size, but patch age was not significantly associated with community characteristics. Four relatively common species were not detected in the small patches, indicating the possibility they had been extirpated by the time monitoring began, and six rarer species were not detected or detected only once in these patches. Although the patch size effect on species diversity was strong, we found that several of the small habitat patches had similar diversity to large patches, indicating potential value of these small habitat patches in protecting species as "microreserves.'' In addition, one lizard species was found to be significantly more abundant in the smaller patches. To determine if abundance changed over time, we compared capture rates for four common lizards at the same sites ten years later. For three of the four species, abundance decreased over that period, specifically in the small patches. Although our long-term monitoring has confirmed that the full suite of herpetofauna is currently preserved in the study area overall, declines even in the common species over time hint at the potential severity of the threat of urbanization to rare species.

AB  - Urbanization negatively impacts the diversity of aquatic insect assemblages in headwater streams and can lead to the homogenization of insect communities at the regional level. However, less is known about the impact of urbanization on insects in headwater streams within smaller cities that have significant upstream portions outside of urban land use. We collected insects monthly from April to September in 2014 and 2015 from five streams that flowed from rural upstream through urban downstream land use, plus two rural reference streams, in Greater Binghamton, New York, in the northeast USA. While urbanization was associated with lower insect taxonomic richness (<mml:mo stretchy="false"><overbar></mml:mover>) and elevated stream water conductivity, the regional diversity () was similar among urban and rural land use. This corresponded to higher dissimilarity among urban sites () than among rural sites. To our knowledge, this is the first report of higher urban stream insect community -diversity. Our results suggest that urbanization in this medium-sized city negatively impacts stream insect richness, but the change of community assemblages is not homogenous across the urban landscape. Connectivity between upstream rural sites and downstream urban sites may provide some relief from the impacts of urbanization in smaller cities.

AB  - The importance of large reserves has been long maintained in the scientific literature, often leading to dismissal of the conservation potential of small reserves. However, over half the global protected-area inventory is composed of protected areas that are <100 ha, and the median size of added protected area is decreasing. Studies of the conservation value of small reserves and fragments of natural area are relatively uncommon in the literature. We reviewed SCOPUS and WOK for studies on small reserve and fragment contributions to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, and fifty-eight taxon-specific studies were included in the review. Small reserves harbored substantial portions (upward of 50%) of regional species diversity for many taxa (birds, plants, amphibians, and small mammals) and even some endemic, specialist bird species. Unfortunately, small reserves and fragments almost always harbored more generalist and exotic species than large reserves. Community composition depended on habitat quality, surrounding land use (agricultural vs. urban), and reserve and fragment size, which presents opportunities for management and improvement. Small reserves also provided ecosystem services, such as pollination and biological pest control, and cultural services, such as recreation and improved human health. Limitations associated with small reserves, such as extinction debt and support of area-sensitive species, necessitate a complement of larger reserves. However, we argue that small reserves can make viable and significant contributions to conservation goals directly as habitat and indirectly by increasing landscape connectivity and quality to the benefit of large reserves. To effectively conserve biodiversity for future generations in landscapes fragmented by human development, small reserves and fragments must be included in conservation planning.

AB  - Semi-natural grasslands harbour many of Europe's species of conservation interest. Although larger grasslands are the focus of most conservation activity, many grassland fragments are scattered across landscapes -in small patches or along linear elements- which can form Grassland Green Infrastructure (GGI). GGI has the potential to enhance landscape diversity by creating functioning metacommunities comprising of large semi-natural grasslands and these surrounding fragments. While often highlighted in conservation policy, little is known about the biodiversity supported by green infrastructure itself and thus its conservation potential.
   +To address this issue, we contrasted plant communities in 36 'core' grassland sites across three European countries with communities in the surrounding GGI. We related compositional differences to amount and type of GGI habitat (patches or linear), and the distances for seed dispersal by livestock from core sites. We found substantial differences between the GGI and the core sites, with a mean 54% species turn-over. These differences indicated filtering of stress tolerant species characteristic of low nutrient conditions, and semi-natural grassland specialists. Species with poorer dispersal abilities declined strongly with increasing distances from the core sites. The many additional species in the GGI, not found in the core sites, were predominantly those with a competitive strategy and high seed dispersal ability.
   We conclude that the biodiversity-supporting role of GGI across Europe is severely constrained by eutrophication, dispersal limitation and external propagule pressure. Actions to improve the quality of GGI might include enhancing dispersal by livestock combined with more type-diversification and less intensively used grassland habitats.

AB  - Urbanisation threatens biodiversity globally, yet some animal populations persist within urban landscapes. Conservation of urban wildlife has prioritised parks and remnant bushland as critical habitat and neglected the role that residential gardens offer for conservation. We explored the potential for residential gardens to assist the conservation of mammals using an online questionnaire administered to residents of two case study cities in Australia to identify how widespread mammals in cities can be, which garden features promote mammal presence, and if the features varied among species with different habitat requirements. From 649 responses we found that three mammal species with different habitat requirements occurred in residential gardens throughout the city landscape. Garden features promoting mammal presence were consistent with broad ecological and habitat requirements of each species, but differed among both species and regions. Our study demonstrates that residential gardens offer a valuable habitat for mammals, and that garden features could be manipulated to promote use of gardens by these species. By considering gardens in urban planning and management actions aimed at conserving urban wildlife, residential gardens offer additional habitat to parks, roadside vegetation and urban bushland, and can play a significant role in biodiversity conservation.

AB  - The historical record of the spatial distribution, source, occurrence, and ecotoxicology of organic matter deposited in the past 100 years was investigated in a sediment core from an urban lake, in central China by analyzing different organic targets. These targets included total organic carbon (TOC), n-alkanes, representative petroleum biomarkers of terpanes and steranes, non-alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and their alkylated congeners (APAHs).
   Three sediment cores were collected from East Lake (Wuhan, China) in September 2013. The freeze-dried samples were Soxhlet extracted and cleaned up/fractionated into saturated and aromatic fractions. Gas chromatography equipped with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to analyze the specific target groups. The TOC content of sediment was determined by an elemental analyzer after the freeze-dried sediments were pre-treated with 1 mol L-1 HCl to remove carbonate.
   The impact of human activities has become more serious since the 1960s as determined by analyzing the historical records of the measured parameters, due to the isolation of the study water body from the Yangtze River and the development of the local social economy. Higher plant wax was the major source of the identified n-alkanes; non-alkylated PAHs were more abundant than their alkylated congeners over the past 100 years. The source identification of n-alkanes, petroleum biomarkers, and PAHs suggested that the mixed sources, including biogenic and petrogenic input, and the incomplete combustion of biomass/solid fossil fuel have contributed to the organic matter in the study lake. The toxicity assessment suggested the presence of PAHs would not cause potential toxicity to the benthic organisms.
   The historical record of organic matter with different molecular compositions reflects the hydrodynamic condition of the study lake and the development of the local social economy. The mixed biogenic, pyrogenic, and petrogenic sources have contributed to the lake sediments. The detected PAHs did not have negative impacts to benthic organics. This study will provide valuable information to control organic contamination and guide potential remediation technologies in the future.

AB  - The present research was conducted to assess the anthropogenic impacts on avian diversity around the river Chenab, Pakistan. The avian diversity was recorded on different landscapes along the river Chenab, that is, forest, agricultural, rural, and urban habitats. The data on diversity and distribution of various avian species were collected through linear count along with direct count methods viz. personal observations and sound records and indirect count methods viz. presences of carcasses and meeting with local communities. The habitat preferences of birds varied significantly. A decline in avian diversity was observed from forest habitat to urban landscapes. One year of bird surveys compiled a total of 150 species from all habitats along the river Chenab. Computed statistical data show that Shannon's index provides a quantitative report of diversity which was highest at forest habitat (4.261) followed by rural forest habitat (3.746), agrierural habitat (3.746), agriculture habitat (3.623), WLH (2.723), urban vegetative habitat (3.215), and very least at urban nonvegetative habitat (2.247). It can be concluded from the present study that many of the avian species have specific habitats and also noted that corridors and connections among different landscapes are important for the conservation of avian diversity.

AB  - Agriculture and urban development have destroyed 95% of native brushland habitat in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of south Texas. Therefore, habitat restoration is an important issue in the LRGV. Since 1982, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been replanting areas in the LRGV to native brushland species to establish a wildlife corridor along the lower reach of the Rio Grande. Vegetation composition of a mature brushland, a replanted habitat and an unaided secondary succession site (fallow field) were examined at one locale in the LRGV in 1999. The mature brushland edge plot had the highest species richness (43) followed by the replanted edge plot (37), mature brushland interior (35), replanted interior plot (33) and fallow field interior (12) and edge (11) plots. Edge and interior plots in the same habitat were similar in species composition (mature brushland, 74%; replanted, 63%; fallow field, 70%). Community similarity was greater for mature brushland and replanted habitats (47%) than the mature brushland and fallow field (32%), or the replanted and fallow field habitats (28%)'. These data suggest that current replanting techniques used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the LRGV achieve a more diverse plant community in a shorter length of time than unaided secondary succession of fallow fields.

AB  - Grassland biomass is the embodiment of grassland productivity, and the material basis for the maintenance of the grassland ecosystem. Grassland is the main vegetation type in the Mongolian Plateau. Grassland changes in the core region of the China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor of the Belt and Road Initiative have an important impact on regional ecology, environmental conservation, and sustainable development. This study established three types of models for estimating grassland production through statistical analysis methods using NDVI, EVI, MSAVI, and PsnNet remote sensing indices retrieved from a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) dataset. This was combined with ground-measured grassland data and meteorological data. Based on model evaluation, the spatial and temporal distribution and variation characteristics of grassland along the Mongolia part of the China-Mongolia Railway were obtained through inversion for the period from 2006 to 2015. The results showed that all the models had good simulation effects. The optimal model was an exponential model based on MSAVIwith its simulation accuracy reaching 78%. Grassland production in the study area has increased slightly in the past ten years, with little change in the first five years and a fluctuating increase in the next five years. The average grassland production (per unit production) in the past ten years was 3400.39 kg/ha and the average total production was 9707.88 x 10(4) t. Grassland production increased slightly in most areas along the railway, and in some areas it continued to decline. The regional spatial distribution of increased and decreased grassland production was significantly different. With better grassland resources in the northeastern part of the study areathe area around Chinggis City and the capital of Hentiy Provincehad the most significant growth. However, the southern Gobi areawith its trend towards land degradation in the area where the southern Gobi and desert steppe transitions to steppe and dry steppehad a significant decrease. This meant that the risk of grassland degradation still existed. There were also quantitative and spatial differences in the areas where grassland production decreased on both sides of the railway. The decrease in grassland production on the western side of the railway was more obvious than on the eastern side, and the reduction area was dispersed on the western side and relatively concentrated on the eastern side. In future research, the identification of key areas of grassland degradation along the China-Mongolia Railway as well as its driving forces should be investigated further.

AB  - Managers tasked with repairing degraded stream ecosystems require restoration strategies that are tailored to local and regional characteristics. Emerging evidence suggests that local reach-scale approaches may be as effective, if not more so, than catchment-scale actions in highly permeable coastal landscapes, particularly if there is hydraulic connectivity to shallow groundwater and where recharge is strongly seasonal. This study assessed the relative influence of catchment-scale land use and reach-scale vegetation structure on the distribution of carbon and nutrient concentrations of streams within urban and agricultural catchments of the Perth region of southwestern Australia. We used linear mixed-effects models to evaluate the extent to which phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon concentrations in different stream zones (streamwater, and fluvial and parafluvial sediments) were explained by catchment and reach-scale attributes and moderated by high versus low-flow periods, i.e., in wet versus dry months. We found that reach-scale vegetation (woody plant cover, annual plant cover) was a better predictor of nutrient concentrations than catchment-scale land use, particularly total imperviousness, a common measure of urbanisation. Flow was also important, with carbon and nutrient concentrations better described by reach- or catchment-scale attributes during the low flow period. The extent to which individual catchment and reach attributes influenced the distribution of nutrients in different stream zones was complex. However, our results suggest that planting woody vegetation can reduce nitrogen concentrations in surface water and fluvial sediments. Reducing the abundance of weedy annual species and restoring woody perennial species may further reduce phosphorus concentrations in surface water. We conclude that local riparian restoration can be a cost-effective strategy for managing excess nutrients and carbon in flat and permeable urban landscapes, particularly during low flow periods.

AB  - Could past land uses, and the land cover changes carried out, affect the current landscape capacity to maintain biodiversity? If so, knowledge of historical landscapes and their socio-ecological transitions would be useful for sustainable land use planning. We constructed a GIS dataset in 10 x 10 km UTM cells of the province of Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain) for 1956 and 2009 with the changing levels of farming disturbance exerted through the human appropriation of photosynthetic net primary production (HANPP), and a set of landscape ecology metrics to assess the impacts of the corresponding land-use changes. Then, we correlated them with the spatial distribution of total species richness (including vascular plants, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals). The results allow us to characterize the main trends in changing landscape patterns and processes, and explore whether a land-use legacy of many complex agroforest mosaics maintained by the intermediate farming disturbance managed in 1956 could still exist, despite the decrease or disappearance of those mosaics before 2009 due to the combined impacts of agroindustrial intensification (meaning higher HANPP levels), forest transition (meaning lower HANPP levels) and urban sprawl. Statistical analysis reveals a positive impact of the number of larger, less disturbed forest patches, where many protected natural sites have been created in 1956-2009. However, it also confirms that this result has not only been driven by conservation policies and that the distribution of species richness is currently correlated with the maintenance of intermediate levels of HANPP. This suggests that both land-sharing and land-sparing approaches to biodiversity conservation may have played a synergistic role owing to the legacy of complex land cover mosaics of former agricultural landscapes that are now under a serious threat.

AB  - The Big East Lake water network (BELWN), located in Wuhan city, China, is mainly composed of six lakes and isolated from the Yangtze river. At the background of restoring the hydrological connectivity between rivers and lakes, four season investigations were conducted during 2014-2015 to study the spatial distribution and seasonal dynamics of macroinvertebrate communities, explore their relationships with environmental factors, and forecast the change trends in assemblages in a long period after restoration measures. A total of 40 species were recorded, oligochaetes and chironomids dominated the communities. Season variation in density and biomass were distinct and the community differences in lakes related to the degrees of organic pollution. In comparison with the historical data, the species richness of mollusks in Donghu lake sharply decreased due to water pollution and the loss of diverse habitat. Concerning on the whole BELWN, the whole taxa recorded in our study was slightly fewer than the previous study. A new recorded species polychaete Nephtys sp. was first collected with an important ecological interest. As an urban lake system dominated by eutrophication, the water nutrients significantly affected the distribution of macroinvertebrates. According to the GAM models, the dominant species responded to environmental gradients with different response curves. After restoring the hydrological connectivity between rivers and lakes, the macroinvertebrate communities would change and the biodiversity would steadily increase with time. Additionally, the new recorded species Nephtys sp. would spread into the whole BELWN in the foresee future.

AB  - To assist land managers responsible for park management, we conducted a pilot study to examine small mammal assemblages at 7 riparian parks in suburban/ urban landscapes and at 1 riparian site in mature forest, all located in central Pennsylvania. Species richness and diversity were lowest in parks containing manicured habitats and surrounded by human-modified landscapes. However, parks managed for passive recreation supported mammalian assemblages that were similar in richness and diversity to our mature riparian forest site. The mature riparian forest site contained four species of small mammals (eastern chipmunks [Tamias striatus], white-footed mice [Peromyscus leucopus], deer mice [P. maniculatus], and woodland jumping mice [Napeozapus insignis]), and Spring Creek Nature Park, a park managed to promote natural and native habitats, contained five species (short-tailed shrews [Blarina brevicauda], eastern chipmunks, white-footed mice, meadow voles [Microtus pennsylvanicus], and meadow jumping mice [Zapus hudsonius]). In contrast, parks located in more urban settings and consisting primarily of mowed habitat contained only 1 or 2 species of small mammals. We did not capture non-native species in our study. Based upon this study, we recommend locating parks along streams or other natural corridors, leaving unmowed 10-15-m buffers along streams, and planting native trees along stream corridors in order to encourage diversity of small mammals in suburban and urban parks.

AB  - Facing increasing human demands on Earth, understanding how endangered species may survive in isolated remnants of natural habitat within heavily transformed landscapes is key to contemporary conservation biology. Against this background we here investigate the factors affecting pond occupancy in the endangered European tree frog (Hyla arborea L.) within an urban landscape, being located in north-eastern Germany where the species is still fairly common. Our survey revealed that 58 out of 122 ponds were occupied by H. arborea. Ponds with a higher percentage of floating vegetation, being deeper and surrounded by higher percentages of crop fields and forests were more likely to be occupied, while factors associated with urbanization such as the percentage of built-up area were strongly detrimental. Habitat requirements of H. arborea were complex as occurrence was simultaneously affected by different spatial scales, including the landscape scale, the immediate surroundings of ponds and the ponds themselves. H. arborea avoided highly urbanized areas, but occurred frequently in agricultural areas surrounding the city. The latter suggests that this species is fairly tolerant towards human-induced transformations, and that vast arable fields yielded positive rather than negative effects on H. arborea occurrence. We conclude that the most important conservation issues for supporting H. arborea populations at the periphery of urbanized areas are (1) maintaining an open (agricultural) landscape structure, (2) providing undisturbed overwintering habitats, and (3) maintaining pond quality by halting shrub and tree encroachment.

AB  - Management of ecosystems often focuses on specific species chosen for their habitat demand, public appeal, or levels of threat. We propose a complementary framework for choosing focal species, the mobile link concept, which allows managers to focus on spatial processes and deal with multi-scale ecological dynamics. Spatial processes are important for three reasons: maintenance, re-organization, and restoration of ecological values. We illustrate the framework with a case study of the Eurasian Jay, a mobile link species of importance for the oak forest regeneration in the Stockholm National Urban Park, Sweden, and its surroundings. The case study concludes with a conceptual model for how the framework can be applied in management. The model is based on a review of published data complemented with a seed predation experiment and mapping of Jay territories to reduce the risk of applying non-urban site-specific information in an urban setting. Our case study shows that the mobile link approach has several advantages: (1) Reducing the vulnerability of ecological functions to disturbances and fluctuations in resources allocated to management, (2) Reducing management costs by maintaining natural processes, and (3) Maintaining gene flow and genetic diversity at a landscape level. We argue that management that includes mobile link organisms is an important step towards the prevention of ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss in increasingly fragmented landscapes. Identifying and managing mobile links is a way to align management with the ecologically relevant scales in any landscape.

AB  - The study of plants and animals on islands, both natural and artificial, has produced a body of generalizations immediately useful to land use planners concerned with minimizing the impacts of habitat destruction on the environment.  A case study of 37 isolated chaparral fragments in San Diego, California, demonstrates the consequences of habitat fragmentation, including rapid and predictable extinctions of native birds in isolated canyons.  This study and others can be used to generate planning guidelines for the prevention of such disappearances.  Among the most important measures that can be taken are consolidation of open space set-asides and the provision of corridors linking habitat patches.  Corridors can mitigate some of the negative effects of development on wildlife, especially where they facilitate the movement of large predators.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation and urbanization not only cause extirpation of species, but also alter the behaviour of species in human modified areas. We evaluated behavioural characteristics of the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus), a keystone species, in the urban landscape of Denver, CO, USA. Specifically, we investigated the proportion of vigilance, foraging, and social behaviour within a system of urban colonies that varied in area, degree of connectivity, and time since isolation. Overall, rates of vigilance were lower than are typically reported for black-tailed prairie dogs in grassland habitats. Colonies that were more isolated exhibited higher levels of vigilance, but colonies isolated for a longer period of time exhibited reduced vigilance. Thus, while urban stimuli may increase alertness in the most isolated colonies, we suggest that black-tailed prairie dogs might eventually adjust to these stimuli and relax their vigilance responses. Because behaviour varies based on age of fragments, we provide evidence that black-tailed prairie dog populations are responding to urbanization through behavioural changes that may be adaptive. The ability to understand how landscape-level factors influence black-tailed prairie dog behaviour provides important information about the response of keystone species to urban settings and can aid conservation and management efforts in fragmented systems.

AB  - Active citizens may contribute to the environmental, social, and institutional resilience of cities. This review discusses how citizen initiatives protect biodiversity hotspots, contribute to social cohesion, institutional innovation, and diversity in urban green space management. Challenges related to social inclusiveness, ecological connectivity and continuity suggest government involvement is pertinent, but needs to be refocused. To maximise environmental outcomes of active citizenship, governments may adopt an enabling and stimulating governance style that harnesses the transformative potential of active citizenship. This paper argues for mosaic governance to work with the heterogeneous array of people, institutions, and spatial practices associated with active citizenship. Mosaic governance aims for a context-sensitive way of urban green infrastructure planning, enhancing relationships between the diversity of landscapes and communities across cities.

AB  - Appropriately designed, greenways may provide habitat for neotropical migrants, insectivores, and forest-interior specialist birds that decrease in diversity and abundance as a result of suburban development. We investigated the effects of width of the forested corridor containing a greenway, adjacent land use and cover, and the composition and vegetation structure within the greenway on breeding bird abundance and community composition in suburban greenways in Raleigh and Cary, North Carolina, USA. Using 50 m fixed-radius point counts, we surveyed breeding bird communities for 2 years at 34 study sites, located at the center of 300-m-long greenway segments.
   Percent coverage of managed area within the greenway, such as trail and other mowed or maintained surfaces, was a predictor for all development-sensitive bird groupings. Abundance and richness of development-sensitive species were lowest in greenway segments containing more managed area. Richness and abundance of development-sensitive species also decreased as percent cover of pavement and bare earth adjacent to greenways increased. Urban adaptors and edge-dwelling birds, such as Mourning Dove, House Wren, House Finch, and European Starling, were most common in greenways less than 100 m wide. Conversely, forest-interior species were not recorded in greenways narrower than 50 m. Some forest-interior species, such as Acadian Flycatcher, Hairy Woodpecker, and Wood Thrush, were recorded primarily in greenways wider than 100 m. Others, including ground nesters such as Black-and-white Warbler, Louisiana Waterthrush, and Ovenbird, were recorded only in greenways wider than 300 m.
   Landscape and urban planners can facilitate conservation of development-sensitive birds in greenways by minimizing the width of the trail and associated mowed and landscaped surfaces adjacent to the trail, locating trails near the edge of greenway forest corridors, and giving priority to the protection of greenway corridors at least 100 m wide with low levels of impervious surface (pavement, buildings) and bare earth in the adjacent landscape.

AB  - Corridors are intended to increase species survival by abating landscape fragmentation resulting from the conversion of natural habitats into human-dominated matrices. Conservation scientists often rely on 1 type of corridor model, typically the least-cost model or current-flow model, to construct a linkage design, and their choice is not usually based on theory or empirical evidence. We developed a method to empirically confirm whether corridors produced by these 2 models are used by target species under current landscape conditions. We applied this method in the Gamba landscape between 2 national parks in southwestern Gabon. We collected signs of presence of African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus), and 2 apes, western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and central chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes), on transects. We used patch-occupancy models to identify least-cost and current-flow corridors for these 4 species. On average, 28.7% of current-flow corridors overlapped with least-cost corridors, confirming that the choice of corridor model can affect the location of the resulting linkage design. We validated these corridors by monitoring signs and examining camera detections on new transects within and outside modeled corridors. Current-flow corridors performed better than least-cost corridors for elephants, whereas the opposite was found for buffalo and apes. Locations of the highest priority corridors for the 3 taxa did not overlap, and only 18.3% of their combined surface was common among 2 species. We used centrality metrics to calculate the average contribution of corridor pixels to landscape connectivity and derived an index that can be used to prioritize corridors. As a result, we recommend protecting at least 17.4% of the land surface area around Gamba town to preserve the preferred travel routes of the target species.

AB  - Disturbance frequently is implicated in the spread of invasive exotic plants. Disturbances may be broadly categorized as endogenous (e.g., digging by fossorial animals) or exogenous ( e. g., construction and maintenance of roads and trails), just as weedy species may be native or exotic in origin. The objective of this study was to characterize and compare exotic and native weedy plant occurrence in and near three classes of disturbance digging by prairie dogs ( an endogenous disturbance to which native plants have had the opportunity to adapt), paved or gravel roads ( an exogenous disturbance without natural precedent), and constructed trails ( an exogenous disturbance with a natural precedent in trails created by movement of large mammals) - in three geographically separate national park units. I used plant survey data from the North and South Units of Theodore Roosevelt National Park and Wind Cave National Park in the northern mixed-grass prairie of western North and South Dakota, USA, to characterize the distribution of weedy native and exotic plants with respect to the three disturbance classes as well as areas adjacent to them. There were differences both in the susceptibility of the disturbance classes to invasion and in the distributions of native weeds and exotic species among the disturbance classes. Both exotic and native weedy species richness were greatest in prairie dog towns and community composition there differed most from undisturbed areas. Exotic species were more likely to thrive near roadways, where native weedy species were infrequently encountered. Exotic species were more likely to have spread beyond the disturbed areas into native prairie than were weedy native species. The response of individual exotic plant species to the three types of disturbance was less consistent than that of native weedy species across the three park units.

AB  - Trees in urban landscapes provide a range of ecosystem services, including habitat, refugia, food, and corridors for other fauna and flora. However, there is some debate whether the richness and abundance of other biodiversity supported is influenced by the provenance of trees, i.e., native or non-native. This study assessed the presence of mistletoes and birds (and nests) in 1261 street trees. There were marked differences between native and non-native street trees, with the former having a significantly higher prevalence of birds (and nests) and supporting more species and in greater densities, whilst the latter supported a higher prevalence of mistletoes. Additionally, for birds, the proximity to green space, tree size and species were also important, whilst for mistletoes, the proximity to green space, slope aspect, and tree species were significant. Preference ratios indicated that some tree species had a higher than random occurrence of birds or mistletoes, whilst others had a low abundance. The indigenous tree species, Acacia karroo Hayne was the only reasonably abundant street tree species that was important for birds, nests, and mistletoes. At the street scale, there was a positive relationship between street tree species richness and bird species richness. These results emphasise the importance of selecting appropriate tree species if biodiversity conservation is a core outcome.

AB  - Cities are characterized by dynamic interactions between socio-economic and biophysical forces. Currently more than half of the global population reside in cities which influence the global biogeochemical cycles and climate change, substantially exacerbating pressures on urban pollution, water quality and food security, as well as operating costs for infrastructure development. Goods and services such as aesthetic values, water purification, nutrient recycling, and biological diversity, that urban ecosystems generate for the society, are critical to sustain. Urban planners are increasingly facing the considerable challenges of management issues for urban ecosystems. Poor understanding of the complementary roles of urban ecology in urban infrastructure, and the functioning of ecosystems and ecological resilience of a complex human-dominated landscape has impeded effective urban planning over time, resulting in social disharmony. Here a complementary framework for urban ecology is proposed, in which ecosystems interact with land use, architecture and urban design - "E-LAUD"-affecting ecosystem and human health, and building on the concept that land uses in urban green areas, road-strips, wetlands, 'habitat islands' and urban architecture could synergistically benefit when clustered together in different combinations of urban landscapes. It is proposed that incorporation of the E-LAUD framework in urban planning forms the context of a new interdisciplinary research programme on ecological resilience for urban ecosystems and helps promote ecosystem services.

AB  - Pine wilt disease (PWD), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, is an extremely threatening invasion forest disease throughout the world, especially in Asia. B. xylophilus is spread in Asia by vector beetles of Monochamus alternatus, which has long no effective control method. Understanding of landscape effects on the dispersal and outbreaks of forest pests is crucial to establishing effective ecological control strategies. Here, we analyzed the samples of M. alternatus collected in a fine-scale in order to estimate the effects of landscape types on the genetic structure and dispersal of M. alternatus. The landscapes included the geographical scales, forest types and land uses. The individuals of M. alternatus were genotyped by using whole-genome resequencing. Population genetic structures were clearly differentiated at the range of 250 kms, suggesting the intermediate scale is an effective barrier against natural dispersal of M. alternatus. We used the least-cost distances, least-cost transect analysis, and distance-based redundancy analysis to estimate the effects of forest types and land uses within the fine scales. The results showed that the gene flow and genetic diversity were positively correlated with host and mixed forests, whereas negatively with non-host forests. Among land-use landscapes, the roads had the positive effect on gene flow and genetic diversity but farmland and urban uses had negative effects. This highlights that humanmediated transport via roads was likely to be the main factor leading to the long-distance invasion of M. alternatus, whereas non-host landscapes could suppress the spread of this species. These findings may be useful to control the PWD dispersed by M. alternatus.

AB  - The Tiber River stretch crossing the metropolitan area of Rome (Italy) is regarded as one of the main biological corridors of the city, as it diversifies the urban landscape while contributing to the plant diversity. This paper aims to document the current plant richness occurring along the Tiber within the city by providing a comprehensive inventory of the spontaneous vascular flora and an overview of its composition, and structural, chorological and ecological features. This flora lists 493 species and it is characterized by: i) high species richness (more than 30% of Rome's flora), ii) presence of species with naturalistic value, as rare or included in Red List IUCN categories, iii) high number of ruderal and multizonal species (including several aliens) that have well adapted to human disturbance, and have partially replaced the typical riverine plants, iv) wide spread of eutrophic aquatic species, and rarefaction of those species that are more sensitive to eutrophication and water pollution. The dataset and the overview reported in this study can be useful for future research, with a special focus on a better naturalistic management of the urban river ecosystem, and the conservation of the floristic heritage within the city of Rome.

AB  - Background Disentangling the relative roles of environmental filtering and spatial processes in structuring ecological communities is a central topic in metacommunity ecology. Metacommunity ecology in the temperate river ecosystems has been well developed, while less attention has been paid to subtropical urban river networks. Here, we examined the ecological factors and seasonal difference in structuring macroinvertebrates metacommunity assembly in the subtropical urban river networks in Shenzhen, South China. Results Our results revealed that there was no significant distinction of macroinvertebrate community composition among seasons, with only the relative abundance of Mollusca and Odonata significantly differed in both wet and dry seasons. One possible explanation was that most macroinvertebrates are generally pollution-tolerant taxa characterized with nonseasonal life cycle. In addition, distance-based redundancy analysis and variation partitioning approach revealed that metacommunity was determined equally by the environmental and dispersal-related factors. Further, our results showed that, although a slight temporal variation of relative contribution, the identity and explanation power of ecological factors were different among seasons. Specifically, stronger environmental filtering structuring community dynamics was observed in the dry than wet seasons, which might be owing to higher environmental heterogeneity under a low water-flow condition. Moreover, we detected that the influence of spatial processes was stronger in the wet than dry seasons, indicating an obvious dispersal processes due to high connectivity among sites. Conclusion Overall, our results revealed that environmental and spatial factors equally explained variations of macroinvertebrate metacommunity, implying the necessity of considering dispersal-related processes structuring ecological communities in river bioassessment programs. Moreover, degraded habitat conditions and water quality were the predominant factors that affected macroinvertebrate communities, indicating the significance and feasibility of improving local abiotic conditions to sustain local biodiversity. Further, our findings revealed the importance of seasonal dynamics of these urban river networks in structuring macroinvertebrate metacommunity. Thereby, our study improves the understanding of ecological processes governing macroinvertebrate metacommunity and underlines the idea that community ecology studies should go beyond the single snapshot survey in river networks.

AB  - The wildland-urban interface lies at the confluence of human-dominated and wild landscapes, creating a number of management and conservation challenges. Because wildlife ecology, behavior, and evolution at this interface are shaped by both natural and human phenomena, this requires greater understanding of how diverse factors affect ecosystem and population processes. We illustrate the challenge of understanding and managing a frequent and often undesired inhabitant of the wildland-urban landscape, the cougar (Puma concolor). In wildland and residential areas of western Washington State, USA, we captured and radiotracked 27 cougars to model space use and understand the role of landscape features in interactions (sightings, encounters, and depredations) between cougars and humans. Resource utilization functions (RUFs) identified cougar use of areas with features that were probably attractive to prey, influential on prey vulnerability, and associated with limited or no residential development. Early-successional forest (+), conifer forest (+), distance to road ( ), residential density ( ), and elevation ( ) were significant positive and negative predictors of use for the population, whereas use of other landscape features was highly variable. Space use and movement rates in wildland and residential areas were similar because cougars used wildland-like forest patches, reserves, and corridors in residential portions of their home range. The population RUF was a good predictor of confirmed cougar interactions, with 72% of confirmed reports occurring in the 50% of the landscape predicted to be medium-high and high cougar use areas. We believe that there is a threshold residential density at which the level of development modifies the habitat but maintains enough wildland characteristics to encourage moderate levels of cougar use and maximize the probability of interaction. Wildlife managers trying to reduce interactions between cougars and people should incorporate information on spatial ecology and landscape characteristics to identify areas with the highest overlap of human and cougar use to focus management, education, and landscape planning. Resource utilization functions provide a proactive tool to guide these activities for improved coexistence with wildlife using both wildland and residential portions of the landscape.

AB  - The urban-rural gradient effect, together with the value of urban green patches, on saving bird diversity has received significant research in recent years. These topics are usually studied in the context of big cities, where the effects are more pronounced. In the present study, we observed how these phenomena affect the avicoenoses in smaller spa town, where landscape protection supports the benefits of biocultural diversity. We assessed the effect of the occurrence of microhabitats (especially particular tree and shrub forms) within the urban-rural gradient on bird fauna composition. We found that the urban-rural gradient in towns is not as relevant as in cities because the effect is covered with a more complicated multi-layered vegetation structure. For the management practices we confirm the high importance of vegetation continuity from the periphery to the city centre, bypassing the isolation of green patches. A proportion of deciduous and coniferous trees and their spatial heterogeneity are important for the occurrence of small songbirds. Next, we conducted a questionnaire-based study with the park visitors and found that there is a biocultural benefit from the presence of songbirds in large urban parks, especially in the spa town. The clear preference of songbirds by park visitors highlights the social benefit of bird diversity.

AB  - Reflecting the lack of critical information for most protected species, recovery plans for organisms listed as threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act tend to oversimplify habitat descriptions. Here we present our approach for improving the definition of habitat for rare and patchily distributed listed species. The valley elderberry longhorn beetle (Desmocerus californicus dimorphus) occurs in riparian and scrub communities in California's Central Valley. Habitat quality for the species currently is defined essentially exclusively in terms of presence and abundance of its larval host plant, elderberry (Sambucus spp.). Using detailed measures of physical and biological attributes at diverse sites occupied by the beetle, we characterized and defined habitat quality on the basis of not only host plants, but on an array of biotic and abiotic environmental characteristics. We identified four geornorphically distinct habitat associations: alluvial plain, narrow riparian corridor, upper riparian plain, and non-riparian scrub. Depending on habitat type, the environmental characteristics most strongly associated with beetle presence were host plant availability, topography and proximity to habitat edge. Increased local population size of beetles was associated with higher elderberry density and the presence of larger, more mature plants. Stochasticity in site occupancy over space and time confounds our ability to identify sites that are most able to contribute to long-term beetle survival, while underscoring the importance of unoccupied habitat to the beetle. Adopting a multivariate definition of habitat may facilitate more effective identification of locations critical to the recovery of the valley elderberry longhorn beetle, and prioritization of those management actions that can contribute effectively to meeting conservation goals for the species.

AB  - Understanding the impacts of habitat fragmentation on dispersal is an important issue in landscape and conservation ecology. Here I examine the effects of fine- to broad-scale patterns in landscape structure on dispersal success of organisms with differing life-history traits. An individual-based model was used to simulate dispersal of amphibian-like species whose movements were driven by land cover and moisture conditions. To systematically control spatial pattern, a landscape model was created by merging simulated land cover maps with synthetic topographic surfaces. Landscapes varied in topographic roughness and spatial contagion in agriculture and urban land cover. Simulations included three different species types that varied in their maximum potential dispersal distances by 1-, 2-, or 4-fold. Two sets of simulations addressed effects of varying aspects of landscape structure on dispersal success. In the first set of simulations, which incorporated variable distances between breeding patches, dispersal success was lowest for all species types when anthropogenic cover was patchily distributed. In the second set, with interpatch distances held constant as landscape composition varied, dispersal success decreased as anthropogenic cover became spatially contagious. Both sets revealed strong main effects of species characteristics, interpatch distances and landscape composition on dispersal success; furthermore, scale-dependent patterns in land cover and moisture gradients had a stronger effect on longer- than shorter-ranging species types. Taken together, these simulations suggest that heuristic conservation strategies could potentially be developed based on important but limited life history information.

AB  - Low Impact Development (LID) is a strategically sound approach to mitigate stormwater pollution and restore landscape hydrology in urbanized watersheds. Since it promotes preserving and enhancing vegetation, open spaces, and soil integrity to mimic natural processes, it provides a myriad of benefits including flood control, habitat protection, climate change mitigation and adaptation, greater livability, greater social connectivity, energy savings, smog reduction, enhanced community aesthetics, and many other ecosystem services. A great number of LID tools are available such as green roofs, raingardens, tree planters, bio swales, which are efficient, simple, and cost effective. Some pioneer cities are successfully implementing this technology in development and redevelopment projects. However, a wide spread adoption has not occurred.
   This paper explores the barriers prevailing in the U.S. cities, with a focus on legal and policy aspects. The analysis will focus on the city codes, ordinances, regulations, and other legal and policy documents related to stormwater and other land development activities of select cities. Finally a policy framework conducive to LID implementation will be presented.

AB  - Urbanization can result in the fragmentation of once contiguous natural landscapes into a patchy habitat interspersed within a growing urban matrix. Animals living in fragmented landscapes often have reduced movement among habitat patches because of avoidance of intervening human development, which potentially leads to both reduced gene flow and pathogen transmission between patches. Mammalian carnivores with large home ranges, such as bobcats (Lynx rufus), may be particularly sensitive to habitat fragmentation. We performed genetic analyses on bobcats and their directly transmitted viral pathogen, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), to investigate the effects of urbanization on bobcat movement. We predicted that urban development, including major freeways, would limit bobcat movement and result in genetically structured host and pathogen populations. We analysed molecular markers from 106 bobcats and 19 FIV isolates from seropositive animals in urban southern California. Our findings indicate that reduced gene flow between two primary habitat patches has resulted in genetically distinct bobcat subpopulations separated by urban development including a major highway. However, the distribution of genetic diversity among FIV isolates determined through phylogenetic analyses indicates that pathogen genotypes are less spatially structuredexhibiting a more even distribution between habitat fragments. We conclude that the types of movement and contact sufficient for disease transmission occur with enough frequency to preclude structuring among the viral population, but that the bobcat population is structured owing to low levels of effective bobcat migration resulting in gene flow. We illustrate the utility in using multiple molecular markers that differentially detect movement and gene flow between subpopulations when assessing connectivity.

AB  - Urbanisation is a significant threatening process for amphibians, causing loss of habitat, altered hydrology and increased mortality. Impacts operate at different spatial scales and consequences vary depending on the sensitivity of individual species. Most studies of the impact of urbanisation on anurans have occurred in large metropolitan cities. There is a paucity of research in smaller urban settlements where the impacts of development may be less pronounced. We examined the richness and occurrence of anuran species in wetlands in regional towns in south-eastern Australia as a factor of natural and built features occurring at multiple spatial scales, and the socio-economic characteristics of surrounding neighbourhoods. Anuran species richness declined with increasing isolation of wetlands and reduced cover of terrestrial vegetation. The occurrence of two wide-spread anuran species was negatively related to level of urban intensity and positively related to neighbourhood vegetation cover, whereas the converse was true for a third common species. Vegetation cover was greater in neighbourhoods with 'higher' socioeconomic status (e.g. more disposable income). These less developed neighbourhoods occurred on the fringes of towns, often in elevated locations, and tended to support more anuran species. The level of urban intensity increased closer to town centres and more developed neighbourhoods with lower socio-economic status were often built in low-lying areas where wetlands tend to form naturally. Yet, these neighbourhoods harboured few anuran species.
   Our study suggests that careful planning of low-lying neighbourhoods near town centres and periurban neighbourhoods on town fringes is required to ensure anuran conservation in urban settlements. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Under climate change many species may need to shift polewards to track suitable bioclimatic conditions. This movement is likely to be impeded by intensively modified landscapes, but little is known in practice about how species undergo range expansion in these conditions. Using biological record data, this paper explores the occurrence of five butterfly species undertaking range expansion in the UK through an urbanised landscape to better understand the pathways' or landscape features used to expand their distributions. The findings demonstrate that the two most adaptable species were able to navigate well through the urban matrix. Significantly, the remaining three species used more rural pathways, with two using stepping stones of habitat patches and landscape corridors and the final, most specialised species using near-connected chains of woodland habitat. These findings emphasise the importance of retaining corridors of open land around hostile matrices and in this instance, a planning designation Green Belt' proved to be particularly effective in providing broad pathways of open land for range expansion through a heavily urbanised landscape.

AB  - In 1996, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and the Republic of Panama's Environmental Authority, with support from the United States Agency for International Development, undertook a comprehensive program to monitor the ecosystem of the Panama Canal watershed. The goals were to establish baseline indicators for the integrity of forest communities and rivers. Based on satellite image classification and ground surveys, the 2790 km(2) watershed had 1570 km(2) of forest in 1997, 1080 km(2) of which was in national parks and nature monuments. Most of the 490 km(2) of forest not currently in protected areas lies along the west bank of the Canal, and its management status after the year 2000 turnover of the Canal from the U.S. to Panama remains uncertain. In forest plots designed to monitor forest diversity and change, a total of 963 woody plant species were identified and mapped. We estimate there are a total of 850-1000 woody species in forests of the Canal corridor. Forests of the wetter upper reaches of the watershed are distinct in species composition from the Canal corridor, and have considerably higher diversity and many unknown species. These remote areas are extensively forested, poorly explored, and harbor an estimated 1400-2200 woody species. Vertebrate monitoring programs were also initiated, focusing on species threatened by hunting and forest fragmentation. Large mammals are heavily hunted in most forests of Canal corridor, and there was clear evidence that mammal density is greatly reduced in hunted areas and that this affects seed predation and dispersal. The human population of the watershed was 113 000 in 1990, and grew by nearly 4% per year from 1980 to 1990. Much of this growth was in a small region of the watershed on the outskirts of Panama City, but even rural areas, including villages near and within national parks, grew by 2% per year. There is no sewage treatment in the watershed, and many towns have no trash collection, thus streams near large towns are heavily polluted. Analyses of sediment loads in rivers throughout the watershed did not indicate that erosion has been increasing as a result of deforestation, rather, erosion seems to be driven largely by total rainfall and heavy rainfall events that cause landslides. Still, models suggest that large-scale deforestation would increase landslide frequency, and failure to detect increases in erosion could be due to the gradual deforestation rate and the short time period over which data are available. A study of runoff showed deforestation increased the amount of water from rainfall that passed directly into streams. As a result, dry season flow was reduced in a deforested catchment relative to a forested one. Currently, the Panama Canal watershed has extensive forest areas and streams relatively unaffected by humans. But impacts of hunting and pollution near towns are clear, and the burgeoning population will exacerbate these impacts in the next few decades. Changes in policies regarding forest protection and pollution control are necessary.

AB  - We used externally applied transmitters to study movements of female grass snakes (Natrix natrix) during the egg-laying period in a near-urban landscape in Sweden. Half of the studied snakes were residents while the other half were translocated individuals with no previous experience of the area. As predicted, resident females moved more goal-oriented and shorter distances than did translocated individuals. Habitat use did not differ between resident and translocated snakes; they were typically found in bushes, reeds, and tall vegetation. Habitat preference (use in relation to availability) showed that bushy habitats, tall grassy vegetation and reedbeds were over-used in proportion to availability, whereas forest and open grass lawns were used less than expected based on availability. Our study highlights the importance of preserving and restoring linear habitat components providing shelter and connectivity in conservation of grass snakes. We suggest that externally applied transmitters are a better option than surgically implanted ones in movement studies of grass snakes, and that translocation as a conservation method for snakes has drawbacks.

AB  - Maryland's Green Infrastructure (GI) is a network of large, intact natural areas (hubs), interconnected by linear swaths of riparian or upland vegetation (corridors). The GI serves significant ecological functions and provides the bulk of the state's natural support system. This study examined whether the GI as mapped does, in fact, identify Maryland's most ecologically valuable forested lands, using forest interior dwelling birds (hereafter called "forest birds") as bio-indicators. We conducted bird point counts within forest both inside and outside of hubs on Maryland's Eastern Shore. We also collected a wide variety of habitat data. We found that both the condition of a forest and its surrounding landscape influenced the bird communities. On average, forest bird richness was significantly higher within hubs; furthermore, almost all sites with at least five forest bird species present were in hubs. Forest bird richness and abundance were highest in undisturbed, mature broadleaf forest with wetlands and streams nearby. We detected a significant relationship between forest bird richness and the ecological score of a finer-scale landscape assessment, focused on "cells" of about 0.1 ha in size. This field study also validated the Rapid Field Assessment (RFA) protocol developed in 2001 to assess, on the ground, the relative condition of individual sites or properties within the GI. Forest bird richness and abundance were positively correlated with the RFA community scores. Our results underscore the importance of maintaining regional biological diversity by retaining large blocks of forest, especially mature forest containing streams and wetlands.

AB  - Urbanization generates shifts in wildlife communities, with some species increasing their distribution and abundance, while others decline. We used a dataset spanning 15years to assess trends in distribution and habitat dynamics of the black-tailed prairie dog, a highly interactive species, in urban habitat remnants in Denver, CO, USA. Both available habitat and number of prairie dog colonies declined steeply over the course of the study. However, we did observe new colonization events that correlated with habitat connectivity. Destruction of habitat may be slowing, but the rate of decline of prairie dogs apparently remained unaffected. By using our estimated rates of loss of colonies throughout the study, we projected a 40% probability that prairie dogs will be extirpated from this area by 2067, though that probability could range as high as 50% or as low as 20% depending on the rate of urban development (i.e. habitat loss). Prairie dogs may fulfill important ecological roles in urban landscapes, and could persist in the Denver area with appropriate management and habitat protections.

AB  - Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) populations in south-east Queensland are in decline. Although various studies have looked at broad-scale tree preference and habitat quality, there has been little attempt to quantify fine-scale activity shifts from one year to the next or examination of activity at the mesoscale. This study quantified koala activity levels in a 909-ha forest patch at Karawatha Forest Park, in south Brisbane. The Spot Assessment Technique was used to quantify activity and tree selection on 33 long-term monitoring plots in 2009 and 2010. In total, 843 trees were searched and koala pellets were found underneath 34 and 47 trees in 2009 and 2010, respectively. A higher proportion of pellets was found underneath Eucalyptus tindaliae and E. fibrosa and there was weak selection for larger trees. A low occurrence of revisits and a minor shift in activity distribution from 2009 to 2010 indicate that the koala population exists at a low density. Rapid declines in koala populations are occurring in primary habitats. Hence, stable low-density koala populations are important for maintaining genetic diversity and connectivity in fragmented urban landscapes.

AB  - Throughout the developing world, urban centres with sprawling slum settlements are rapidly expanding and invading previously forested ecosystems. Slum communities are characterized by untended refuse, open sewers and overgrown vegetation, which promote rodent infestation. Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) are reservoirs for epidemic transmission of many zoonotic pathogens of public health importance. Understanding the population ecology of R.norvegicus is essential to formulate effective rodent control strategies, as this knowledge aids estimation of the temporal stability and spatial connectivity of populations. We screened for genetic variation, characterized the population genetic structure and evaluated the extent and patterns of gene flow in the urban landscape using 17 microsatellite loci in 146 rats from nine sites in the city of Salvador, Brazil. These sites were divided between three neighbourhoods within the city spaced an average of 2.7km apart. Surprisingly, we detected very little relatedness among animals trapped at the same site and found high levels of genetic diversity, as well as structuring across small geographical distances. Most F-ST comparisons among sites were statistically significant, including sites <400m apart. Bayesian analyses grouped the samples in three genetic clusters, each associated with distinct sampling sites from different neighbourhoods or valleys within neighbourhoods. These data indicate the existence of complex genetic structure in R.norvegicus in Salvador, linked to the heterogeneous urban landscape. Future rodent control measures need to take into account the spatial and temporal linkage of rat populations in Salvador, as revealed by genetic data, to develop informed eradication strategies.

AB  - The loss of large natural areas due to development has increased interest for and use of vegetated areas in urban and suburban areas for wildlife habitats. The goal of this study was to quantify vegetation characteristics for each type of land cover found in the greater Tucson, Arizona area, thereby providing a predictive tool for wildlife management and other land management issues. This research was based on and is a continuation of a pilot study that developed a method associating land cover categories to aerial photographs in eastern Pima County, including the City of Tucson. Aggregation of land cover categories used by Tucson and Pima County and verifications of any uncertain classifications of land cover with field evaluations produced a consistent land cover classification system and database. Natural open space was the largest land cover category within our study area, comprising 52% of the total land cover. Riparian areas, low-density housing and natural open space areas had the highest percentage of native vegetation and escape cover. Golf and neighborhood parks ranked much lower than these land covers relative to native vegetation and escape cover (vegetation with foliage/stems at ground level). The most structurally diverse plant communities were associated with medium density residential areas and zoos that contain a relatively high number of exotic species. Results from the wildlife habitats index indicated riparian areas as the most valuable habitats in eastern Pima County (the county where Tucson is located), followed by low-density housing (less than or equal to1 residence/acre), natural open space, and federal/state parks and forests.

AB  - As ecological data and associated analyses become more widely available, synthesizing results for effective communication with stakeholders is essential. In the case of wildlife corridors, managers in human-dominated landscapes need to identify both the locations of corridors and multiple stakeholders for effective oversight. We synthesized five independent studies of tiger (Panthera tigris) connectivity in central India, a global priority landscape for tiger conservation, to quantify agreement on landscape permeability for tiger movement and potential movement pathways. We used the latter analysis to identify connectivity areas on which studies agreed and stakeholders associated with these areas to determine relevant participants in corridor management. Three or more of the five studies' resistance layers agreed in 63% of the study area. Areas in which all studies agree on resistance were of primarily low (66%, e.g., forest) and high (24%, e.g., urban) resistance. Agreement was lower in intermediate resistance areas (e.g., agriculture). Despite these differences, the studies largely agreed on areas with high levels of potential movement: >40% of high average (top 20%) current-flow pixels were also in the top 20% of current-flow agreement pixels (measured by low variation), indicating consensus connectivity areas (CCAs) as conservation priorities. Roughly 70% of the CCAs fell within village administrative boundaries, and 100% overlapped forest department management boundaries, suggesting that people live and use forests within these priority areas. Over 16% of total CCAs' area was within 1 km of linear infrastructure (437 road, 170 railway, 179 transmission line, and 339 canal crossings; 105 mines within 1 km of CCAs). In 2019, 78% of forest land diversions for infrastructure and mining in Madhya Pradesh (which comprises most of the study region) took place in districts with CCAs. Acute competition for land in this landscape with globally important wildlife corridors calls for an effective comanagement strategy involving local communities, forest departments, and infrastructure planners.

AB  - Urbanisation is an important driver of biodiversity loss, also contributing to habitat loss and fragmentation of grasslands at the urban-rural interface. While urban green spaces are known to include many grassland habitats, it is uncertain to what extent urban land use types harbour grasslands of special conservation interest and whether patch characteristics and connectivity of these differ from grasslands on agricultural land. By relating the city-wide biotope mapping to the land use mapping of Berlin, Germany, we assessed (1) to which specific urban land use types the major grassland biotope types belong, (2) differences in patch characteristics and connectivity, and (3) the conservation value of grassland patches at a typological level by means of their legal protection status. Grasslands cover 5% of Berlin's surface, and 43% of that area is assigned to legally protected grassland types. The majority of legally protected grassland (71%) lies on urban land opposed to 29% on agricultural land. Airports and historic parks, which only cover 2% of land in Berlin, contain one-third of all protected dry grasslands. Wet grassland is more confined to agricultural land. In airports and agricultural areas, grassland patches are larger but of a more complex shape than those in historic parks. In airports, grassland patches show greater connectivity as they are situated in grassland-dominated surroundings. Grassland in historic parks appears to be more vulnerable due to smaller patch sizes and higher fragmentation. The example of Berlin demonstrates that the urban green infrastructure can clearly contribute to grassland conservation and may thus partially compensate for the decline of traditional grasslands in cultural landscapes. It will be important to involve residents and landowners in urban grassland conservation and management because most grassland of special conservation interest (57%) was found outside of conservation areas.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation plays a major role in species extinction around the globe. Previous research has determined that species richness in fragments is affected by a number of characteristics. These include fragment age, size, and isolation, edge effects, vegetation coverage, habitat heterogeneity, and matrix content. Although most studies focused on one or a few of these characteristics, multiple characteristics work together to affect species richness, showing that the effects of habitat fragmentation are complex. The goal of our study was to partition the complex effects of habitat fragmentation by determining the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of multiple habitat fragment characteristics on rodent species richness. In 2013, we determined rodent species richness in 25 habitat fragments within Thousand Oaks, California. In addition, we measured the following characteristics for each fragment: fragment age, area, isolation, shrub coverage, habitat heterogeneity, perimeter/area ratio, and percent non-urban buffer. Path Analysis was used to test the hypothesized model which described the direct, indirect, and cumulative effect of each habitat fragment characteristic on rodent species richness. Overall, the path model explained 67 % of the variation in rodent species richness among habitat fragments. Habitat heterogeneity had the greatest direct and total effect on rodent species richness. Fragment size had the next greatest total effect on rodent species richness but this was nearly entirely indirect through its influence on habitat heterogeneity, suggesting that large fragments containing the greatest diversity of habitats will support the most species. Our study shows that large habitat fragments support the greatest habitat diversity, which provides the highest likelihood of conserving rodent species richness in an urban landscape.

AB  - Despite a marked increase in the focus toward biodiversity conservation in fragmented landscapes, studies that confirm species breeding success are scarce and limited. In this paper, we asked whether local (area of forest patches) and landscape (amount of suitable habitat surrounding of focal patches) factors affect the breeding success of raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) in Tokyo, Central Japan. The breeding success of raccoon dogs is easy to judge as adults travel with pups during the breeding season. We selected 21 forest patches (3.3-797.8 ha) as study sites. In each forest patch, we used infrared-triggered cameras for a total of 60 camera days per site. We inspected each photo to determine whether it was of an adult or a pup. Although we found adult raccoon dogs in all 21 forest patches, pups were found only in 13 patches. To estimate probability of occurrence and detection for raccoon in 21 forest fragments, we used single season site occupancy models in PRESENCE program. Model selection based on AIC and model averaging showed that the occupancy probability of pups was positively affected by patch area. This result suggests that large forests improve breeding success of raccoon dogs. A major reason for the low habitat value of small, isolated patches may be the low availability of food sources and the high risk of being killed on the roads in such areas. Understanding the effects of local and landscape parameters on species breeding success may help us to devise and implement effective long-term conservation and management plans.

AB  - Urbanization has been cited as an important factor in worldwide amphibian declines, and although recent work has illustrated the important influence of broad-scale ecological patterns and processes on amphibian populations, little is known about the factors structuring amphibian communities in urban landscapes. We therefore examined amphibian community responses to wetland habitat availability and landscape characteristics along an urban - rural gradient in central Iowa, USA, a region experiencing rapid suburban growth. We conducted call surveys at 61 wetlands to estimate anuran calling activity, and quanti. ed wetland habitat structure and landscape context. We used canonical correspondence analysis ( CCA) to examine patterns in anuran community structure and identify the most important variables associated with those patterns. Urban density at the landscape scale had a signi. cant negative in. uence on overall anuran abundance and diversity. While every species exhibited a decrease in abundance with increasing urban density, this pattern was especially pronounced for species requiring post- breeding upland habitats. Anurans most affected by urbanization were those associated with short hydroperiods, early breeding activity, and substantial upland habitat use. We suggest that broad- scale landscape fragmentation is an important factor underlying anuran community structure in this region, possibly due to limitations on the accessibility of otherwise suitable habitat in fragmented urban landscapes. This study underscores the importance of a regional approach to amphibian conservation in urban and urbanizing areas; in fragmented landscapes, a network of interconnected wetland and upland habitats may be more likely to support a successful, diverse anuran community than will isolated sites.

AB  - Green roofs have recently gained recognition for their potential contribution to urban ecosystems by providing, among other services, habitat for plants and animals, and stepping stones for mobile organisms, thereby enhancing permeability among habitat patches across densely built cities. In Switzerland, investigations over the past 20 years on more than one hundred distinct green roofs across six cities have provided an unprecedented dataset on ground beetles, albeit with information that is scattered across unpublished reports and local databases. We present here for the first time a synthesis of the state of knowledge of ground beetle communities from green roofs in Switzerland. We describe 91 ground beetles species (19,428 individuals) and highlight patterns of species occurrence and composition across green roofs and cities. Most of the roofs host ground beetle communities dominated by five common mobile species with quite diversified ecological requirements. In addition, we observed nine species (10% of all species collected) that are conservation concerns in Switzerland and Central Europe as well as numerous stenotopic species (from grasslands and pioneer vegetation). This indicates that, besides sustaining local populations of common species, green roofs can also offer suitable ecological conditions of high conservation interest. We suggest both improving the design of green roofs (composition and configuration of vegetation, as well as soil depth and substrate composition) to increase their ecological value for species with the most different ecological needs, and to integrate green roofs into urban planning to make them more efficient as biodiversity supports.

AB  - The connectivity of protected areas, such as the Natura 2000 network, is crucial for maintaining healthy ecosystems and for the delivery of ecosystem services into the wider landscapes in which they are embedded.
   We here present a novel combination of methods for connectivity analysis across heterogeneous landscapes, integrating graph-based analyses, least-cost path modelling and the Probability of Connectivity metric, and apply these methods to the network of Natura 2000 woodland sites in mainland Spain. We deliver key insights on the connectors between Natura 2000 sites: their location and width (including transboundary ones), their prioritization in conservation and restoration scenarios involving different land uses, and the bottlenecks (weak points due to land use pressures) found along them. Based on these results, we characterize the landscapes traversed by the connectors within and outside the protected sites to inform related land management decisions.
   We show that forests of public utility play a key role in sustaining Natura 2000 connectivity in Spain. They may qualify as an effective area-based conservation measure significantly contributing to the connectivity element of Aichi Target 11.
   Riparian forests were part of the identified connectors much more frequently than expected by their area. They stand out as a crucial green infrastructure safeguarding the connectivity of Natura 2000 woodland habitats, particularly when forest species need to traverse landscapes dominated by agricultural and artificial land uses.
   Natura 2000 sites have good connectivity conditions compared to unprotected lands. First, the identified woodland connectors preferentially traversed Natura 2000 lands. Second, the large majority of bottlenecks occurred outside Natura 2000. Natura 2000 sites cannot, however, be considered free from connectivity limitations; they still contained a significant number of bottlenecks that would need to be addressed in the site-level management plans.
   The priority connectors for conservation were preferentially found in the well-forested and well-protected landscapes in the main mountain ranges of Spain. On the contrary, the priority connectors for restoration traversed much more frequently landscapes dominated by agriculture. In these landscapes, connectivity improvements largely depend on the restoration of riparian forests and on measures that mitigate the intensification of agriculture by promoting landscape complexity and natural vegetation remnants. The remarkable spatial segregation found between the priority landscapes for connectivity conservation and those of priority for restoration highlights the need for an integrated perspective for land use planning and for the management of the Natura 2000 network in Europe.

AB  - The effects of riparian land uses on water quality and macroinvertebrate communities were examined in three headwater streams of the Taizi River in northeastern China. Land uses of forest, grassland, farmland, and villages were evaluated within different widths of riparian corridors (length = 3km upstream; width = 25, 50, 100, 200, and 500m). Overall, the results revealed a significant trend for each stream linking a relatively low proportion of farmland in the riparian corridor with better water quality and healthier macroinvertebrate community. Cluster analysis confirmed significant variation in the macroinvertebrate communities found among the three streams. Correlation analysis identified significant positive correlations between the proportion of farmland and metrics of water quality (conductivity, dissolved solids, and total nitrogen) at small (25-50m) to medium (100-200m) widths of riparian corridors. The sensitive taxa of stoneflies and functional feeding groups of scrapers and predators were good predictors of anthropogenic disturbance associated with the proportional extent of farmland and village land use across most of all riparian widths. In contrast, correlations between biodiversity indices and proportion of villages and between bioassessment indices and proportion of farmland were only significant at relatively small widths (25-50m) of riparian corridors. The canonical correspondence analysis revealed that the proportions of forest (25m), farmland (200m), grassland (200m), and village (100m) showed independent effects on the spatial distribution of macroinvertebrates in the Taizi River. The first two axes contributed 34.6% of the cumulative percent variance of species-environment relations. This research indicates that management of riparian corridor land uses at relatively small to medium widths (25-200m) could be effective in restoring water quality and macroinvertebrate communities in headwater stream regions.

Disused transport corridors such as old railways and tramways often return to semi-naturalness, and are increasingly upcycled into multi-use, non-motorised public Greenway infrastructure. This study examines bat activity within a proposed rural Greenway corridor in Ireland. Development scenarios are simulated to predict impacts to woodland ecosystem functional connectivity using Probability of Connectivity (PC) index. Generalised Linear Modelling predicts associations of species activity to Greenway corridor habitat and habitat structure. Spatially explicit connectivity models indicate significant impacts to ecosystem connectivity can arise from Greenway development scenarios, such as decreasing connectivity in half, or increasing connectivity four-fold. Species activity modelling identified habitat conditions along the Greenway route that suggest on-going corridor effects and associations to particular habitats and structure, emphasising the importance to consider a sensitive approach to developing disused infrastructure into Greenways.
   Conservation implications: Potential significant increases in woodland ecosystem reach-ability for bats are achievable by conserving canopy cover over Greenway corridors. Species-specific habitat modelling results presented are directly applicable to guide woodland enhancement for the sensitive conservation of Greenway woodland habitat, maximising their multi-functional use and connectivity potential. Opportunities therefore exist for European Greenways to conserve and enhance ecosystem connectivity, providing landscape-scale solutions to the problem of increasing ecosystem fragmentation.

AB  - Floodplain water bodies provide habitat to diversified ecological communities. Floodplains are also among the most impacted aquatic ecosystems. While the link between the lateral connectivity of floodplain sites to the main channel and their plant, fish and invertebrate communities has been well established, detailed information on chemical characteristics and particularly on trace metal spatial distribution and partitioning is scarce. The aim of this study was to examine the link between the lateral connectivity and physico-chemical variables, their trace metal concentrations and partitioning as well as the upstream-downstream gradient of these parameters. In connected and disconnected water bodies of the Rhone River upstream and downstream of the city of Lyon, we measured major ions, dissolved organic carbon, trace metal concentrations (Al, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb and U) in water, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and sediment The results revealed a clear difference between connected and disconnected water bodies. pH, SPM, Na+, and NO3 concentrations were lower in disconnected sites while conductivity, DOC, Ca2+ and Mg2+ were higher. Conductivity and a part of the major ion concentrations increased in the downstream sections. Trace metal concentrations and partitioning varied between connected and disconnected sites. In the dissolved fraction, trace metal concentrations were higher in connected sites. In the surface sediment, concentrations were higher in disconnected sites for the majority of metals. The upstream-downstream gradient was less important than the connected-disconnected gradient Only three metals in the dissolved fraction (Cu, Cd and Pb) showed a clear increase in downstream sections. Overall, the study shows that the functioning of floodplains produces strong spatial patterns concerning the concentrations and partitioning of trace metals. These findings improve our understanding of trace metal biogeochemistry in floodplains and have important applications for floodplain restoration projects. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Earthquakes not only cause the destruction of surface buildings and a large number of casualties, but also have an important impact on regional land-use change. Timely understanding of land cover and its changes before and after earthquakes is of great scientific significance for studying the restoration and reconstruction of the natural ecosystem and the sustainable development of the social economy in disaster areas. At present, there are few studies on land cover changes before and after earthquakes in the earthquake-stricken areas, especially the quantitative assessment of land cover changes before and after earthquakes at the micro scale of landscape spatial distribution. Therefore, this article is based on remote sensing data and uses an earthquake in Jiuzhaigou, Sichuan, as an example. By calculating the land-use degree comprehensive index and its rate of change, the transfer matrix of land-use, quantitative expression methods of the landscape via the landscape pattern index are analyzed from the points of view of the spatial-temporal evolution law of the landscape pattern of land cover before and after the earthquake. The experimental results showed that the area of forest, cropland, shrub. and grassland types in the study area changed greatly, and the area of grassland types in Shuanghe Township changed most obviously, as they increased from 6.57 km(2) in 2015 to 7.43 km(2), and then decreased to 6.21 km(2) in 2020. During the earthquake recovery period, the comprehensive index of land-use degree for most towns in the study area showed an upward trend, and the land cover types were improved. After 2017, the PD and LSI of the study area showed a downward trend, among which the bare land type changed greatly, with the PD value decreasing from 0.38 in 2017 to 0.21 in 2020, and the LSI value decreasing from 58.29 in 2017 to 40.69 in 2020. This indicates that the degree of landscape fragmentation and the spatial heterogeneity of the land surface in the study area are reduced in the later stage of earthquake recovery. After 2017, the AI value of the study area showed an upward trend, and the AI value of the bare land type increased from 63.97 in 2017 to 78.25 in 2020, indicating that the connectivity between landscape patches in the study area was enhanced in the later stage of the earthquake. This also reflects that the ecological environment of the study area gradually showed a good trend in the later stage of the earthquake. The results of this paper not only reveal the spatial-temporal evolution of land cover in Jiuzhaigou County before and after the earthquake, but also help the relevant national decision-making departments to formulate corresponding policies and measures.

AB  - Magnolias are representative shrub and tree species of the tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) in Mexico, which is one of the most endangered ecosystems due to anthropogenic landscape degradation and climate change. Magnolia schiedeana is a vulnerable and restricted endemic TMCF species, occurring in scattered TMCF fragments in the Sierra Madre Oriental. In this study, we investigated spatial patterns of genetic diversity across the M. schiedeana species range and assessed whether gene flow was influenced by topographic and environmental factors. We sampled 11 remnant populations across the species range and genotyped 180 individuals at eight nuclear microsatellite loci. Our data showed a strong spatial structure in five genetic clusters, which match the patchy geographic distribution of M. schiedeana. Contemporary migration rates between these genetic clusters were very low. Levels of genetic diversity within populations were moderate to high, and no evidence of inbreeding was found. Our results from landscape genetic analysis showed that isolation by distance, rather than topography or environmental variation, was the main process shaping genetic differentiation. Urgent actions are needed to protect M. schiedeana populations as most of them persist isolated within agricultural and urban landscapes. Ex situ management actions would be crucial to ensure the conservation of genetically diverse germplasm for the in situ propagation where it has gone locally extinct.

AB  - Landscape changes can result in habitat fragmentation and reduced landscape connectivity, limiting the ability of animals to move across space and altering infectious disease dynamics in wildlife. In this study, we develop and implement an agent-based model to assess the impacts of animal movement behavior and landscape structure on disease dynamics. We model a susceptible/infective disease state system applicable to the transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus in bobcats in the urbanized landscape of coastal southern California. Our agent-based model incorporates animal movement behavior, pathogen prevalence, transmission probability, and habitat fragmentation to evaluate how these variables influence disease spread in urbanizing landscapes. We performed a sensitivity analysis by simulating the system under 4200 different combinations of model parameters and evaluating disease transmission outcomes. Our model reveals that host movement behavior and response to landscape features play a pivotal role in determining how habitat fragmentation influences disease dynamics. Importantly, interactions among habitat fragmentation and movement had non-linear and counter-intuitive effects on disease transmission. For example, the model predicts that an intermediate level of non-habitat permeability and directionality will result in the highest rates of between-patch disease transmission. Agent-based models serve as computational laboratories that provide a powerful approach for quantitatively and visually exploring the role of animal behavior and anthropogenic landscape change on contacts among agents and the spread of disease. Such questions are challenging to study empirically given that it is difficult or impossible to experimentally manipulate actual landscapes and the animals and pathogens that move through them. Modeling the relationship between habitat fragmentation, animal movement behavior, and disease spread will improve understanding of the spread of potentially destructive pathogens through wildlife populations, as well as domestic animals and humans.

AB  - Questions The ecological condition of riparian habitats has been negatively altered by human activities and land-use changes. The aims of this study were to evaluate: (a) how adjacent land use affects the ecological condition of riparian habitats; and (b) whether the ecological condition relates to riparian vegetation properties (i.e., structure, diversity, and species composition). Location Watershed of the Duero River, in the state of Michoacan, Mexico. Methods Sampling sites were established along the Duero River riverbank by considering three different land uses (i.e., native forest, agriculture, and urban). At each site, we assessed the ecological condition of riparian habitats with a riparian condition index (RCI) composed of six subindices, with 17 indicators. Using a survey of woody plants (DBH >= 2.5 cm) in 12 different 0.1-ha sites, we assessed vegetation properties. Results According to the RCI, 76% of the studied riparian habitats had a very poor ecological condition, and only one site scored an excellent condition. The values of all subindices as well as the RCI were significantly greater in the forest than in the agricultural or urban land uses. The significant relationships between the RCI and its components (subindices) with vegetation properties were all positive and explained between 22% and 73% of the variation in structural and diversity attributes, and between 48% and 66% in floristic composition. Conclusions This study shows how human land-use activities affect the ecological condition of riparian habitats and hence riparian forests. Overall, the RCI had a high predictive power for the vegetation properties of riparian forests. This information is critical for programs involved in the management, conservation, and ecological restoration of riparian habitats. Low-cost and time-efficient indices, such as the RCI, facilitate ecological condition assessments of riparian habitats not only by scientists but also by previously trained land managers and the general public.

AB  - Surface runoff can be routed to both pervious areas (PAs) and drainage systems during an overland flow. Excessive runoff from an impervious area (IA) flowing into a drainage system causes an overload, which can be relieved by diverting runoff to PAs. However, the hydrological link between IAs and PAs, especially the runoff response to variation in overland flow areas (OFAs), has not well been considered in runoff simulations due to the complexity of routing. To understand how the OFA within an IA contributes to runoff generation, a novel classification approach was applied to categorize the IA in a study area in Nanjing University, Xianlin campus, China into directly connected impervious area (DCIA) and indirectly connected impervious area (ICIA) by flow routes using high-resolution ground-based images (0.5 m) from an unmanned aerial vehicle. The OFAs then include DCIA and the total impervious area (TIA), which is the sum of DCIA and ICIA. The runoff simulations were supported by Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) calibrated with observed rainfall and runoff data. The resulting proportions of DCIA and ICIA of the study area were 34.13% and 10.99%, respectively. The spatial distributions of DCIA and ICIA are characterized by the subcatchment landscape heterogeneity resulting from vegetation, imperviousness, and slope. The observed runoff coefficients and peak flows were positively correlated with the percentages of DCIA and TIA. The runoff coefficient was significantly correlated with the DCIA in a light rainfall event of 18.4 mm (R-2 =0.82) and with the TIA in a heavy rainfall event of 119 mm (R-2 =0.92). Runoff generation is affected by both the characteristics of the rainfall event and the accompaning variations in OFAs. Results indicate that increasing of the flow connectivity from IAs to PAs and increasing the water retention capacity of PAs may be effective strategies for optimizing landscape patterns for stormwater management.

AB  - Urbanization reduces diversity and alters avian assemblages worldwide. Urban greenspaces can alleviate this effect by promoting habitat for some species, but the relevance of urban greenspaces for megadiverse, Neotropical avifauna is misunderstood. Here, we evaluated whether bird diversity (taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional) and composition would vary with urban greenspace features (size, degree of isolation, heterogeneity and noise) in seven urban greenspaces in southeastern Brazilian coast. Taxonomic diversity was positively related to greenspace size and habitat heterogeneity. Phylogenetic diversity metrics and functional dispersion were not associated with urban greenspace features. Urban greenspaces were dominated by common urban exploiter and non-native species (e.g. Feral Pigeon, Columbia livia, and House Sparrow, Passer domesticus), tanagers (Thraupidae) and tyrants (Tyrannidae), insectivorous and ground foragers, and habitat generalists (only 6 % of forest specialists). Large (and probably more forested) and quiet greenspaces favored forest-dependent species. Species turnover was high among greenspaces (beta = 0.64) but was not related to greenspace features. Our results suggest that the number of urban greenspaces, and the larger and/or heterogeneous urban greenspaces, favor higher taxonomically diverse bird communities; and that noise or a noise-related urban feature can erode abundance of forest-dependent species in urban, Neotropical landscapes.

AB  - Federal, state, and local governments construct thousands of kilometers of roads each year in the U.S.A., as well as undertaking widening, rerouting or repair projects. Under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), environmental impacts from such construction must be offset by mitigation measures (e.g., stream or wetland restoration). Unfortunately, restoration projects often are opportunistic, do not consider a broad landscape context, and have a low benefit-cost ratio. In 2007, the Maryland State Highway Administration asked The Conservation Fund, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to help identify and evaluate natural resource stewardship opportunities in four Maryland watersheds that could potentially be affected by construction of a highway bypass. Stewardship activities, including conservation, restoration, or management of natural resources, would go above and beyond required mitigation. After soliciting feedback from stakeholders and reviewing pertinent literature, we modeled and validated a conservation network of high-quality wildlife and plant habitat (core areas), large contiguous natural areas (hubs), and linkages to facilitate wildlife movement and gene flow (corridors). We then ranked elements of this network at multiple scales, and identified high priority areas for conservation and restoration. Finally, we developed and tested protocols for field assessment and benefit-cost optimization. We hope that this approach can be adapted and improved by highway agencies and other entities for environmental planning and protection, and have a report available upon request with full details.

AB  - Edges are ecologically important environmental features and have been well researched in agricultural and urban landscapes. However, little work has been conducted in flammable ecosystems where spatially and temporally dynamic fire edges are expected to influence important processes such as recolonization of burnt areas and landscape connectivity. We review the literature on fire, fauna, and edge effects to summarize current knowledge of faunal responses to fire edges and identify knowledge gaps. We then develop a conceptual model to predict faunal responses to fire edges and present an agenda for future research. Faunal abundance at fire edges changes over time, but patterns depend on species traits and resource availability. Responses are also influenced by edge architecture (e.g., size and shape), site and landscape context, and spatial scale. However, data are limited and the influence of fire edges on both local abundance and regional distributions of fauna is largely unknown. In our conceptual model, biophysical properties interact with the fire regime (e.g., patchiness, frequency) to influence edge architecture. Edge architecture and species traits influence edge permeability, which is linked to important processes such as movement, resource selection, and species interactions. Predicting the effect of fire edges on fauna is challenging, but important for biodiversity conservation in flammable landscapes. Our conceptual model combines several drivers of faunal fire responses (biophysical properties, regime attributes, species traits) and will therefore lead to improved predictions. Future research is needed to understand fire as an agent of edge creation; the spatio-temporal flux of fire edges across landscapes; and the effect of fire edges on faunal movement, resource selection, and biotic interactions. To aid the incorporation of new data into our predictive framework, our model has been designed as a Bayesian Network, a statistical tool capable of analyzing complex environmental relationships, dealing with data gaps, and generating testable hypotheses.

AB  - The dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an escalating problem and a threat to public health. Comparative metagenomics was used to investigate the occurrence of antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) in wastewater and urban surface water environments in Singapore. Hospital and municipal wastewater (n = 6) were found to have higher diversity and average abundance of ARGs (303 ARG subtypes, 197,816 x/Gb) compared to treated wastewater effluent (n = 2, 58 ARG subtypes, 2,692 x/Gb) and surface water (n = 5, 35 subtypes, 7,985 x/Gb). A cluster analysis showed that the taxonomic composition of wastewaters was highly similar and had a bacterial community composition enriched in gut bacteria (Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Bifidobacterium, Blautia, Roseburia, Ruminococcus), the Enterobacteriaceae group (Klebsiella, Aeromonas, Enterobacter) and opportunistic pathogens (Prevotella, Comamonas, Neisseria). Wastewater, treated effluents and surface waters had a shared resistome of 21 ARGs encoding multidrug resistant efflux pumps or resistance to aminoglycoside, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramins (MLS), quinolones, sulfonamide, and tetracycline resistance which suggests that these genes are wide spread across different environments. Wastewater had a distinctively higher average abundance of clinically relevant, class A beta-lactamase resistant genes (i.e., bla(KPC), bla(CTX-M), bla(SHV), bla(TEM)). The wastewaters from clinical isolation wards, in particular, had a exceedingly high levels of blaKPC 2 genes (142,200 x/Gb), encoding for carbapenem resistance. Assembled scaffolds (16 and 30 kbp) from isolation ward wastewater samples indicated this gene was located on a Tn3-based transposon (Tn4401), a mobilization element found in Klebsiella pneumonia plasmids. In the longer scaffold, transposable elements were flanked by a toxin-antitoxin (TA) system and other metal resistant genes that likely increase the persistence, fitness and propagation of the plasmid in the bacterial host under conditions of stress. A few bacterial species (Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) that were cultured from the isolation ward wastewaters on CHROMagar media harbored the bla(KPC-2) gene. This suggests that hospital wastewaters derived from clinical specialty wards are hotspots for the spread of AMR. Assembled scaffolds of other mobile genetic elements such as IncQ and IncF plasmids bearing quinolone resistance genes (qnrS1, qnrS2) and the class A beta-lactamase gene (bla(TEM-1)) were recovered in wastewater samples which may aid the transfer of AMR.

AB  - In the last decade, the interest to the long-term study of the specific fauna of Arctic mammals has significantly increased. The reason for that is the fact that, due to global climatic changes, the configuration of species ranges is changing significantly. Small terrestrial mammals have turned out to be a good model group for such studies since their taxonomy and ecology have been studied much better than in most other groups, for example, invertebrates. Besides, they do not move for long-distance, therefore, the catching of a small mammal indicates that this individual was born relatively close to the place of capture. Another aspect of the relevance of such studies is that the Societas Europaea Mammalogica (SEM) is preparing the second edition of the Atlas of the distribution of mammals in Europe for publication in 2024, which, unlike the first edition of the atlas, should include the territory of the European part of Russia and other East European countries. This work requires Russian theriologists to analyze all available materials on the distribution of mammals, especially for such inaccessible areas as Nenets Autonomous Okrug (NAO).
   We studied the species composition of small mammals of five hard-to-reach studying sites in the Bolshezemelskaya Tundra. Two of them were situated - in the subzone of the typical tundra, two in the subzone of the southern shrub tundra, and one - at the border of the typical and southern tundras. Four sites were located in close proximity to the coast of the Kara Sea, and only one in the depths of the mainland. The geographic coordinates of the northernmost part (Pakhancheskaya Bay) were 68 degrees 29'07 '' N, 57 degrees 6'03 '' E, and for the southernmost (Lake Yanemdeito) they were 67 degrees 3028 '' N, 56 degrees 29'06 '' E (See Fig.). We caught animals using snap or live traps; some animals were caught into the Barber's entomological traps, and, additionally, we collected the pellets from raptors. The procedures for trapping and collecting animals comply with international and national requirements for the humane treatment of animals.
   We examined a total of 92 animals belonging to 9 species of small mammals, including 3 species of shrews, 6 species of voles and 2 species of lemmings In all typical tundra areas, a Narrow-headed Vole (Microtus gregalis (=Lasiopodomys gregalis) Pallas, 1779)) dominated, while Northern Red-backed Vole (Clethrionomys rutilus (=Myodes rutilus) Pallas, 1779)) dominated in the shrub tundra near the mouth of the Pechora River and never was found in the typical tundra. A very low number of lemmings were observed in all areas, and single individuals of Siberian lemmings (Lemmus sibiricus Kerr, 1792 (=Lemmus lemmus L., 1758)) were found only in the typical tundra (See Table 2). The species composition of small mammals recorded in this study was compared with literature data describing the small mammal fauna of the Bolshezemelskaya Tundra (See Table 3). That comparison showed that two species - the Common Shrew (Sorex araneus L., 1758) and the Eurasian Pygmy Shrew (S. minutus L., 1766), in recent years, have significantly expanded their range to the north by about 150 km. In addition, indirect evidence has been obtained that the number of lemmings in areas of their overlapping with voles is declining, which is the global trend observed for all tundras of the northern hemisphere. Perhaps, all these changes are associated with global warming effect, which leads to such an environmental effect as "greening" of the tundra.
   We suggest that the findings of the common and small shrew in two subzones of the Bolshezemelskaya tundra be considered as the expansion of these species to the north due to climate changes in recent decades. However, discovering these species in those regions may have a different explanation. Besides the Bolshezemelskaya Tundra, common shrews were recently encountered on the Kanin Peninsula [Fredga K, 1996] and in the area of the city of Naryan-Mar [Pavlova SV and Shchipanov NA, 2019]: in territories that were not previously part of the range of this species neither and which have similar natural characteristics with the region of our research. The animals from the Kanin Peninsula and the surroundings of Naryan-Mar-city appeared to be previously unknown chromosomal races of this species. The chromosomal race from the Kanin Peninsula turned out to be especially specific. Such findings cannot be the result of a simple expansion of the species range, but most likely indicate the existence of relict populations of the common shrew in these territories, which, for a long time, have existed in isolation and have had a very low abundance. For further analysis of this phenomenon, it is necessary to study the chromosomal races of the common shrew living in the Bolshezemelskaya Tundra.

AB  - Maintaining animal movement in fragmented landscapes depends upon the levels of connectivity among habitat patches, which in turn may depend upon the landscape matrix. Little is known about how the matrix affects dispersal abilities, in part because few experimental tests have been conducted. We experimentally translocated 142 migratory American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) and resident Jamaican Todies (Todus todus) 0.6-4 km from their territories across landscapes fragmented by pen-urban development and bauxite mining and continuous forest. Redstarts returned more rapidly and with greater success than todies across all landscapes, with 95% of redstarts returning in an average of 2.5 days versus 60% of todies in >20 days. Return success was best predicted by translocation distance for redstarts and by sex for todies, with a trend of fewer birds returning when released in bauxite landscapes. Return time was strongly affected by matrix type, with both species returning more rapidly in a forested relative to a bauxite matrix and intermediately in a pen-urban matrix. These findings provide strong experimental evidence that land cover surrounding forested habitat influences species mobility. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to increasing population and expansion of cities, urban planning issues are becoming more important worldwide. It is realized that biological methodologies ought to be coordinated into urban arranging activities. Particularly in European cities, creating greenways and green corridors is a very recent phenomenon. The advancement of green space along urban waterways could moderate urban warmth island impacts, improve the physical and mental prosperity of city occupants, improve flood resilience and could also sustain biodiversity. The Pedieos River is the longest river in Cyprus. Like most of streams on the island, it is a non-enduring waterway, of fleeting nature that for the most part streams during the blustery winter months or after overwhelming precipitation occasions. A literature review was undertaken to discover the importance of rivers within the urbanized areas. It is known that the Pedieos River is firmly connected to the historical backdrop of Nicosia as it is one reason for the city's presence at the site. The increase of impermeable areas as a result of urbanization is also one of the main causes for flooding in recent years. In this research, the current situation of the river was investigated and its possible rehabilitation discussed for more sustainable city. The aim of this study is to recommend a feasible proposition by examining green territory zones and reason green passages along the Pedieos River so as to improve the living condition of Nicosia city.

AB  - Land-use transformations altering the ecosystem function have impacted the sustenance of natural resources. Implementation of unplanned developmental activities in the ecologically fragile regions has contributed to frequent landslides, conversion of perennial rivers to intermittent or seasonal rivers, reduced water retention capability, etc. Addressing these challenges entails understanding the drivers of land-use change and also their role in altering land uses. Large-scale linear projects such as roads and railways, though contribute to better infrastructure and enhance employment opportunities but severely change the landscape structure affecting peoples' livelihood due to the reduction of ecosystem goods and services. Planned interventions are essential for adopting appropriate land-use trends and shift the trajectory of ecosystem service provision through prior visualization of land-use dynamics with likely impacts. The current study analyses the possible land-use changes in the ecologically fragile central Western Ghats with the proposed railway networks, namely (i) Mysore-Kushalnagar and (ii) Mysore-Thalassery (limited to Karnataka state), using an agent-based model (Fuzzy-AHP-CA-Markov) considering the linear project regions with a buffer of 5 km. The analyses reveal a reduction of forests by 2 and 5%, respectively, during 2010 and 2019. This trend would continue with a significant forest decline by 2026. Areas under built-up have increased over 5% during 2010-2019, which would increase by 7% (2019 and 2026) at the expense of cultivation lands. Major cities such as Mysore and Kushalnagara would witness concentrated urban growth with sprawl in the peripheries, while other towns have undergone leapfrog developments. The spatial distribution of fauna and flora indicates that most parts of the buffer region endow endemic species and serve as foraging grounds. Prediction of likely land uses in 2026 suggests that these regions would undergo large-scale alterations threatening fauna and flora. Implementing linear projects in the ecologically fragile Western Ghats would further destabilize the region, posing a threat with the increased hazard frequencies and the sustenance of natural resources.

AB  - Multifunctional and connected green infrastructure (GI) systems have been linked to urban resilience. Although there have been significant scholarly efforts to assess resilience and to evaluate the benefits of GI, it remains unclear the degree in which GI efforts enhance resilience. Following theoretical frameworks that study coupled infrastructure systems, this paper explores the state of the art on the contribution of GI to urban resilience from multiple dimensions: (1) policy - that promotes the adoption of GI, (2) performance - assessment of GI impacts on water infrastructure systems resilience, (3) connectivity - evaluation of human and wildlife movement through GI, and (4) social - community cohesion as a result of GI efforts. We argue that beyond their individual contributions to supporting urban resilience, the interactions across the various dimensions are key to enhancing resilience. Ultimately, participatory processes are needed to assess resilience originating from GI systems and avoid injustice.

AB  - Evaluating the influences of LUCC (Land Use/Land Cover Change) on landscape pattern is significant for understanding and improving ecological environment system management. This study used landscape pattern as an important indicator to estimate the impacts of the LUCC in the Yangtze River Basin from 2001 to 2019. Based on the remote sensing images of LULC (Land Use/Land Cover) in the Yangtze River Basin in 2001-2019, the dynamic attitude and transfer matrix of LULC, and landscape pattern indices were employed to analyze the LUCC and the impact of LULC on the landscape pattern of the Yangtze River Basin. The results of LUCC show that the main LUCC in the Yangtze River Basin during 2001-2019 is mainly manifested by the increase of water body, forest, wetland, crop/natural vegetation mosaic (NVM) and urban, among which the forest increased the most by 62,635 km2. The areas of grassland and cropland are decreasing, with the grassland decreasing the most. Forest, crop/NVM and cropland are transformed into grassland, which complements the lack of grassland to some extent. LUCC in the Yangtze River Basin is most intense between grassland and forest. Landscape pattern shows: Grassland occupies an important advantage in the whole landscape structure. Forest, grassland and urban landscapes are seriously fragmented, and their LSI (Landscape Shape Index) is more complex than others. The connectivity between various landscape types is weakened, and the degree of landscape fragmentation is increased, but the LULC structure is becoming more and more abundant. The areas with high landscape fragmentation value have richer landscape diversity and diverse LULC types. There is a strong correlation between grassland and the four landscape pattern indices. The change of landscape pattern in the Yangtze River Basin is influenced by natural factors and LUCC in the Yangtze River Basin, and the change caused by human activities is the main driving factor of LUCC.

AB  - The connectivity of green infrastructure facilitating the movement of organisms is the key to strengthening biodiversity in cities. Brownfields are a valuable land resource, with their revitalisation as a Nature Based Solution high on the policy agenda. In supporting cities which simultaneously aim for densification and the maintenance or further development of greenery, this paper develops a model for identifying and prioritising the role of revitalised and prevailing brownfields for the connectivity of green infrastructure using the example of Leipzig, Germany. Comparing metrics between land use categories, brownfields have a central role as stepping stones, with a value of 13%, while revitalised brownfields substantially contribute to global connectivity, with a value of 87% being equally important, for example, with Leipzig's central parks. This paper's spatial-explicit network approach provides a complementary planning tool for prioritising brownfields and the added value of their renaturing by identifying (a) strategic functional corridors formed by brownfields, (b) the connectivity relevance and exposure of individual brownfields, and (c) how renatured brownfields would strengthen existing corridors and form alternative paths. This paper presents an approach using freely available software tools and high-resolution canopy data as a proxy for functional connectivity which serves as a standardised and comparable ex-ante evaluation of NBS strategies being implemented in other cities.

AB  - Urban landscapes contain many barriers to wildlife movement and gene flow, particularly for large terrestrial mammals with extensive natural home ranges. Eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) are a large macropodid, whose biological range partially coincides with areas subjected to high rates of urban expansion, including the Southeast Queensland (SEQ) bioregion of Australia. Within this region, M. giganteus populations have had recent, rapid declines in numbers with ongoing urbanisation posing a significant threat due to the isolation of populations. Therefore, we investigated the genetic profile of kangaroos in a rapidly urbanising SEQ region (Sunshine Coast) by comparing them to other SEQ kangaroos (Greater Brisbane) and to higher density kangaroo populations in a landscape matrix with greater levels of connectivity (Australian Capital Territory; ACT). We utilised a targeted genetic probe of genome-wide SNPs to obtain baseline genetic profiles of M. giganteus using scat samples collected from 24 sites in the Sunshine Coast (n = 103) and compared these to Greater Brisbane (n = 20) and ACT (n = 29) scat samples. Genetic diversity was similar when comparing the ACT, Sunshine Coast and Greater Brisbane regions (HE: 0.224-0.238), yet effective population size was markedly higher for the ACT region (Ne = 3453) than for both the Sunshine Coast and Greater Brisbane (Ne = 43.3 and 25.0, respectively), with clear genetic differentiation on a regional scale. We also identified six genetic groups within our SEQ study area, with significant differences in genetic diversity (HE: 0.188 - 0.289). The presence of high numbers of private alleles in all regions and within some SEQ populations highlights the conservation significance of preserving local populations. We also identified natural and anthropogenic barriers, which may have impacted genetic processes such as gene flow in the region. Therefore, this research highlights the need for localised management of kangaroo pop-ulations to preserve genetic diversity and structure in the SEQ region, by maintaining and improving landscape connectivity. We emphasise that for the conservation of local and global biodiversity, it is imperative to assess baseline genetic status of both common and threatened species, particularly when declines and extirpations are occurring across these species' ranges.

AB  - In many parts of the world, once large and continuous forests have been replaced by a mosaic of isolated forest fragments embedded in an agricultural or urban landscape matrix. At the same time, stand characteristics such as tree population size and tree density have been strongly modified as a result of anthropogenic activities. Because increased geographical isolation can impede gene flow among forest fragments, and because decreased population size and tree density may reduce the number of local mating partners, this can be expected to lower the opportunity to trees for outcrossing, and to result in increased inbreeding, negatively impacting the viability of fragmented tree populations. In this study, we examined eight isolated stands of the wind-pollinated tree species Q. robur that strongly differed in population size, tree density and spatial isolation. In the centre of each Q robur stand, adult leaves and seeds were collected in a circular plot, in which we evaluated the diversity and differentiation of the local pollen pool, and examined mating patterns. Most forest stands showed high proportions of out-of-plot pollen flow (range: 0.24-0.77), which were positively correlated with the number and density of adult trees within the forest stands. Despite high outcrossing rates (>0.998), seeds within seed families were stronger related than what could be expected under panmixia, which could be attributed to small but significant levels of correlated paternity (0.018-0.107) and biparental inbreeding (0.025-0.118) within the study plots. Next to increased coancestry coefficients, deviations from random mating also resulted in significant pollen pool differentiation (0.008-0.059) among seed parents. We also found that stand population size and tree density were significantly correlated to the relatedness of the seedlings and the degree of pollen differentiation within the study plots. These results suggest that, in small and isolated low density forest stands, reduced mate availability may decrease local pollen pool diversity, increasing the likelihood of consanguineous mating and pollen pool differentiation in the next generations. We conclude that preserving high levels of pollen flow within and between forest fragments may be more important in wind-pollinated tree species than what was previously thought.

AB  - Because of their isolation, biotic communities of urban green spaces are expected to be similar to those of oceanic islands. This should be particularly true for insects, which represent an important component of urban faunas. The equilibrium theory of island biogeography (ETIB) allows for the formulation of some hypotheses regarding the influence of the geographical characteristics of green spaces on insect species richness and extinction risk. Based on island biogeography principles, we present eight predictions on how green space characteristics should influence insect species richness and loss. We analysed the current literature in order to determine which predictions were supported and which were not. We found that many studies gave outcomes that support ETIB predictions about the effects of area and isolation of green spaces; we found no strong support for predictions about shape and extent of native habitat in the literature that we reviewed. Most of the available studies dealt with patterns in species richness, whereas insect species loss has been rarely investigated. Future developments in the application of island biogeography principles to urban insect conservation should address temporal trends in species persistence and the analysis of species co-occurrence and nestedness.

AB  - The anthropogenic fragmentation of habitats has altered the distribution and size of populations of many species worldwide. To predict fate of populations and establish management practices that ensure their viability, we need to understand the demographic and genetic consequences of fragmentation. In this study, we analyzed whether the spatial configuration of remnant habitat patches within a fragmented landscape has shaped the patterns of genetic diversity and differences in local populations of the Montane brown frog (Rana ornativentris) in Tokyo, Japan. The species inhabits secondary forests and is particularly affected by fragmentation due to its habitat selectivity and low dispersal capability. We determined allele frequencies of six microsatellites to estimate genetic diversity of 33 local populations and pairwise genetic distances among them. Habitat suitability maps were developed based on two models, one with only climatic and topography as predictor variables (HSn), the second incorporating the potential barrier effect of urbanization as an additional variable (HSu). Ecological distances were calculated using the circuit theory applied to the habitat suitability maps. We found that within-population genetic diversity decreases as the HSu habitat suitability decreases. Moreover, pairwise population genetic distance showed the highest correlations with resistance (i.e., ecological) distances when the HSu map was used. Our results confirmed the expectation that urbanized lands are barriers to gene flow, and that habitat fragmentation restricts inter-population dispersal, thus reducing the genetic diversity of local populations. Our results also demonstrate that landscape genetics is a useful approach for identifying key factors affecting dispersal.

AB  - Aim The global sprawl of marine hard infrastructure (e.g. breakwaters, sea walls and jetties) can extensively modify coastal seascapes, but the knowledge of such impacts remains limited to local scales. We examined the regional-scale effects of marine artificial habitats on the distribution and abundance of assemblages of ascidians, a key group of ecosystem engineer species in benthic fouling systems.
   Location Five hundred kilometers of coastline in the North Adriatic Sea.
   Methods We sampled a variety of natural reefs, marine infrastructures and marinas, and tested hypotheses about the role of habitat type and location in influencing the relative distribution and abundance of both native and non-indigenous species.
   Results Assemblages differed significantly between natural and artificial habitats and among different types of artificial habitats. Non-indigenous species were 2-3 times more abundant on infrastructures built along sedimentary coastlines than on natural rocky reefs or infrastructures built close to rocky coastlines. Conversely, native species were twice as abundant on natural reefs than on nearby infrastructures and were scarce to virtually absent on infrastructures built along sedimentary coasts. The species composition of assemblages in artificial habitats was more similar to that of marinas than of natural reefs, independently of their location.
   Main conclusions Our results show that marine infrastructures along sandy shores disproportionally favour non-indigenous over native hard bottom species, affecting their spread at regional scales. This is particularly concerning for coastal areas that have low natural densities of rocky reef habitats. We discuss design and management options to improve the quality as habitat of marine infrastructures and to favour their preferential use by native species over non-indigenous ones.

AB  - Green-blue space loss and fragmentation are particularly acute in Chinese cities due to rapid urbanization, large ring-road system and the following city compartments. Therefore, connecting urban green-blue spaces has been recently advocated by central government. This paper revised and applied the recently developed urban green network approach to the case of Xi'an city, China, a city which has been rarely studied before from this perspective. The focus was on connecting fragments of urban green-blue spaces to compact green-blue networks, integrating both social and ecological functions into a fully functioning entity. Landscape metric analysis was added to identify that the main city outside the city core should be a planning priority zone. The Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus), Asiatic toad (Bufo gargarizans) and humans at leisure were selected as three focal species to meet the emerged socio-ecological benefits. Sociotope and biotope maps were drawn up to identify patches with high human recreation and wildlife shelter values and providing crucial network structures. Least-cost-path model was used for identifying potential linkages between patches. This model was based on network structures and cost surface, which measures the theoretical energy cost of travelling between landscape elements. By integrating the potential paths for the selected organisms with density analysis, the updated framework generated three improvement maps for species indicators, and 10 network corridors for establishing green-blue networks at city scale. At neighbourhood scale, one site with habitat and linkage examples illustrated specific measures that could be taken in local practice.

AB  - Introduction: In the Pacific Northwest of North America, research addressing lentic-breeding amphibian population vulnerability has emphasized aquatic habitats, frequently neglecting terrestrial habitats. Consequently, wetland protection and restoration often fails to preserve or restore adjacent uplands required by lentic-breeding amphibians. Inattention to the juxtaposition and connectivity of uplands to wetlands could locally extirpate lentic-breeding amphibians. The objective of this research is to identify the relative importance of juxtaposed terrestrial and aquatic habitats in a lentic-breeding amphibian, the northern red-legged frog (Rana aurora), by evaluating the relationship between its occurrence and abundance with its aquatic and terrestrial habitats. To accomplish this, egg mass counts were used to quantify R. aurora populations in 30 stillwater habitats across an urbanization gradient. Using a Geographic Information System, seven descriptors of aquatic and surrounding terrestrial habitats were measured to evaluate their relationships to R. aurora occurrence and abundance.
   Results: Rana aurora occurrence and breeding abundance both reflect the forested area around wetland breeding sites and forest connectivity to those sites. Rana aurora breeding abundance also strongly reflects the percent of forested perimeter around wetland breeding sites. The forest habitat most important for R. aurora breeding abundance seems to be > 200 m from the breeding wetlands. The American bullfrog presence and the two aquatic parameters measured, wetland area and vegetated area, were unrelated to R. aurora occurrence and breeding abundance.
   Conclusions: Area and connectivity of juxtaposed forested terrestrial habitat may represent a basic control on R. aurora presence and population size. Urban development policies should consider preservation and restoration of upland forest habitats beyond current fixed-width buffers and wetland habitat area at landscape scales.

AB  - Global efforts to halt biodiversity loss mandate the establishment of protected areas. In the face of habitat loss and climate uncertainty, large-scale networks of protected areas connected by corridors are needed to increase the dispersal and persistence potential of biota. For example, the recent European Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 defines clear targets for identifying, establishing and integrating ecological corridors, as part of a Trans-European Nature Network. Here, we examined whether rivers could serve as such corridors, facilitating landscape connectivity (i.e. extent to which landscape facilitates or impedes species movement, exchange of genes, natal dispersal and metapopulation dynamics) among protected areas hosted within different countries in the Balkan Peninsula, southeastern Europe. To quantitatively address this question, we calculated the proportion of the river network enclosed within a protected area per country to detect patterns of protection coverage and explored the degree to which spatial connections between 1878 protected areas are supported by the river network. Acknowledging that dams hinder instream continuity, we further quantified potential loss of connections between protected areas caused by the existence of already implemented or planned dam projects upon critical river habitats of endangered fish species. Our results highlight that Balkan rivers have great potential in providing the spatial connections needed to establish landscape connectivity between most of protected areas in the region. Still, heedless hydropower growth and dissimilarities in river protection between neighboring countries remain key challenges for the evolution of a relative framework. Transnational cooperation and systematic planning of infrastructure development could be the only efficient steps towards supporting the establishment of a river-based network to reconstruct connectivity between protected areas and meet biodiversity goals.

AB  - The conflict between humans and wild animals is a special type of phenomena between human development and wild animal conservation, not only leading to massive economic loss to local residents, but also imposing severe impacts upon the production and living activities and even personal safety of the residents. Human-elephant conflict has existed as a phenomenon of human settlement development for more than 20 years in Xishuangbanna, China. There are periodic incidents of wild elephants hurting/killing people as well as feeding on and destroying subsistence and cash crops. It is an increasingly urgent and important issue for China to resolve while protecting and managing Asian elephants. Our study employed an Ecological-Niche Factor Analysis model to perform a risk assessment of areas where the Asian elephant currently is distributed and to predict future risks. It employed a Circuit Theory model based on random walk theory to predict multiple potential movement or migration pathways of Asian elephants within Xishuangbanna. The results indicated that: (1) the regions with human-elephant conflict risk in Xishuangbanna Prefecture had an area of about 4349.08 km(2), accounting for 22.77% of the total prefecture area, with the risk regions primarily present in the middle and north parts of Menghai County and Jinghong City and in Mengla County in which there was a wide geographical distribution covering from the south to the north; (2) The regions of agriculture and garden that were close to Asian elephant distribution and roads were likely occurring risk; (3) There were more potential movement paths of elephants within Mengyang and Menghai distribution regions, which indicated that the connection of these areas was better. While the potential movement paths of elephants within Mengla and Shangyong were little; (4) There were some potential movement paths between different distribution areas of Asian elephant, but the migration possibility of elephants in different distribution areas was decreasing due to natural barriers (Mengyang-Menghai has Lancang river) and discontinuous potential paths between Mengla and Shangyong. Additionally, we discussed that created ecological corridors between different natural reserves to allow more dispersal and gene flow of elephants and diminish conflict between human and elephant. We also put forward compensation suggestions in different risk area. We hope our analytical methods can be applied, improved and expanded to other areas with similar wildlife damage.

AB  - Connectivity is essential to ensure vegetation conservation and adaptation to climate change. Human actions produce a progressive fragmentation of the vegetation, affecting its quality and persistence. Adequate consideration of this effect in environmental assessment is necessary, but is often lacking; project impacts are frequently considered negligible, despite being cumulative. The aim of this review is to analyse the literature on fragmentation and loss of ecological connectivity in vegetation, to identify the main impacts and how to mitigate them. A novelty is the linking of these impacts to the human actions that generate them, which facilitates their consideration in the environmental assessment. Vegetation clearing results in fragmentation, separating patches whose persistence will depend on their size, shape or isolation. Reduced flow also causes loss of connectivity between rivers and floodplains. Fragmentation and induced connectivity favour the entry of invasive plants. These effects become more significant when threatened species or habitats are affected. Mitigation measures need to be implemented to avoid, minimise, restore and compensate for these impacts; ecological corridors can combine all these types of measures. Monitoring is essential to assess the dynamics of restored areas, and to detect changes in vegetation or the entry of invasive species. Only proper consideration of these impacts in decision-making, and appropriate mitigation, can control the negative cumulative effects that are currently occurring.

AB  - The movements of organisms and the resultant flows of ecosystem services are strongly shaped by landscape connectivity. Studies of urban ecosystems have relied on two-dimensional (2D) measures of greenspace structure to calculate connectivity. It is now possible to explore three-dimensional (3D) connectivity in urban vegetation using waveform lidar technology that measures the full 3D structure of the canopy. Making use of this technology, here we evaluate urban greenspace 3D connectivity, taking into account the full vertical stratification of the vegetation. Using three towns in southern England, UK, all with varying greenspace structures, we describe and compare the structural and functional connectivity using both traditional 2D greenspace models and waveform lidar-generated vegetation strata (namely, grass, shrubs and trees). Measures of connectivity derived from 3D greenspace are lower than those derived from 2D models, as the latter assumes that all vertical vegetation strata are connected, which is rarely true. Fragmented landscapes that have more complex 3D vegetation showed greater functional connectivity and we found highest 2D to 3D functional connectivity biases for short dispersal capacities of organisms (6 m to 16 m). These findings are particularly pertinent in urban systems where the distribution of greenspace is critical for delivery of ecosystem services.

AB  - Urbanisation often has profound impacts on ecological processes. Management of these impacts is central to urban conservation efforts. We used data from 6591 individually ringed weaver birds from 42 ringing locations to investigate the influence that the urban matrix, as well as patch isolation, size and quality, had on weaver bird movement between ringing locations in Cape Town, a growing city within a global biodiversity hotspot. Distance-based linear models revealed that proximity to other sites was the dominant predictor of weaver movement while the site variables (wetland size and bird abundance) had a limited and inconclusive influence. Once the variation explained by the proximity and site variables had been accounted for, the composition of the surrounding urban matrix, the length of the least cost path between wetlands, and the presence of rivers as potential movement corridors (measured at three spatial scales) all had little influence on weaver movement. Analysis of the weaver bird movement-wetland network using social network analysis showed that the network is simple, clustered, and non-random, with relatively high vulnerability to node loss and some indication of preferential attachment (i.e., increased use of more used sites). Since proximity (site isolation) is the dominant influence on weaver movements, and the network is already sparse, further wetland loss is likely to reduce population viability. Our results match the predictions of classical theory and suggest that patch management will matter more for wetland passerines than matrix management. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The movements of backyard poultry and wild bird populations are known to pose a disease risk to the commercial poultry industry. However, it is often difficult to estimate this risk due to the lack of accurate data on the numbers, locations, and movement patterns of these populations. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the use of three different data sources when investigating disease transmission risk between poultry populations in New Zealand including (1) cross-sectional survey data looking at the movement of goods and services within the commercial poultry industry, (2) backyard poultry sales data from the online auction site TradeMe?, and (3) citizen science data from the wild bird monitoring project eBird.
   The cross-sectional survey data and backyard poultry sales data were transformed into network graphs showing the connectivity of commercial and backyard poultry producers across different geographical regions. The backyard poultry network was also used to parameterise a Susceptible-Infectious (SI) simulation model to explore the behaviour of potential disease outbreaks. The citizen science data was used to create an additional map showing the spatial distribution of wild bird observations across New Zealand. To explore the potential for diseases to spread between each population, maps were combined into bivariate choropleth maps showing the overlap between movements within the commercial poultry industry, backyard poultry trades and, wild bird observations.
   Network analysis revealed that the commercial poultry network was highly connected with geographical clustering around the urban centres of Auckland, New Plymouth and Christchurch. The backyard poultry network was also a highly active trade network and displayed similar geographic clustering to the commercial network. In the disease simulation models, the high connectivity resulted in all suburbs becoming infected in 96.4 % of the SI simulations. Analysis of the eBird data included reports of over 80 species; the majority of which were identified as coastal seabirds or wading birds that showed little overlap with either backyard or commercial poultry.
   Overall, our study findings highlight how the spatial patterns of trading activity within the commercial poultry industry, alongside the movement of backyard poultry and wild birds, have the potential to contribute significantly to the spread of diseases between these populations. However, it is clear that in order to fully understand this risk landscape, further data integration is needed; including the use of additional datasets that have further information on critical variables such as environmental factors.

AB  - 1. The severe and ongoing decline in semi-natural grassland habitat during the past two centuries means that it is important to consider how other, marginal grassland habitat elements can contribute to landscape-level biodiversity, and under what circumstances. 2. To examine how habitat age and the amount of core grassland habitat in the surrounding landscape affect diversity in green infrastructure, we carried out inventories of 36 rural road verges that were either historical (pre-1901) or modern (established post-1901 and before 1975), and were surrounded by relatively high (>15%) or low (<5%) levels of grassland habitat. We recorded the number of plant species, grassland specialists, grassland conservation species and the fraction of the landscape's species and specialists found in the road verge. 3. Road verge communities were characterised by high levels of grassland specialist species (35% of the 161 species recorded), with road verge sites supporting 15-20% of the specialist species found in the surrounding 25 km(2) landscape. 4. Richness of species and specialists were more closely related to road age than to the amount of surrounding habitat. Higher diversity in historical roads, despite the majority of modern roads being at least 60 years old, suggests a long time lag in the establishment of grassland communities in marginal grassland habitats. We identified no effect of historical surrounding land use on present day diversity in road verges. 5. Road verge richness was not affected by the amount of surrounding grassland. This could be due to the relatively low amounts of grassland remaining in all landscapes, together with dispersal limitation commonly found in grassland plant communities contributing to a potential time lag. 6. We identified road verges as potentially very important habitats for grassland communities. Because of the high levels of grassland specialists present, these and other marginal grasslands and grassland green infrastructure should be explicitly considered in landscape-scale conservation management. Practitioners looking to identify the most species-rich road verges should aim to find the oldest possible, while long time lags in community assembly suggests that seed sowing could be appropriate to enhance roadside diversity, even in decades-old road verges.

We investigated breeding, bird communities on 63 Patches suitable for wildlife in the suburbs of Paris. France. in 2003. After exploring the spatial structure of the data. we tested hypotheses relating local species richness to patch characteristics (size and vegetation). urbanization intensity around patches, and patch isolation relative to the nearest natural remnant. Spatial dependence in the data was considered in the regression analyses because patch distribution may affect local species richness through ecological processes and non-independence between patches situated nearby can pose statistical problems. Fifty-seven regular breeding bird species were recorded over the entire study area. Local bird species richness, patch size and vegetation descriptors were not spatially. autocorrelated. Conversely, urbanization intensity around the patches and patch isolation were spatially autocorrelated. Species richness as mainly related to patch size and to the diversity of trees and shrubs. while neither herbaceous plants, nor patch distance to the nearest large forest remnant had significant effects. Moreover. we found that the degree of urbanization around patches did not provide a strong predictor of bird richness. which is more newsworthy. Overall this study stresses once more the complexity of factors and processes responsible of community patterns in urban landscape. It also highlights the need to explicitly consider spatial issues when investigating these patterns.

AB  - In fragmented landscapes the matrix, i.e. the surrounding but different habitat, can have a strong influence on the biodiversity in fragments. The amount of natural habitat converted for urban use is increasing on every continent, so fragments of natural habitat are becoming more likely to be embedded in a matrix of human-made habitat, rather than other natural habitats. This is particularly prevalent on urbanised coastlines. Yet there has been little research to help us understand the dynamics and consequences of fragmented coastal landscapes. In Sydney, Australia, most of the natural intertidal landscape of Sydney Harbour (a mosaic of rocky shore, mudflats and sandflats) has been replaced by artificial habitat (such as seawalls). I tested the hypothesis that biota on rocky shores in Sydney Harbour would differ depending on whether shores were embedded in a matrix of artificial habitat (here called 'complete fragments'), natural habitat (here called 'natural patches'), or a mixture of the 2 types of matrix (called mixed fragments). Assemblages at mid-shore levels were significantly different among these types of fragments. At mid- and low-shore levels, assemblages were more variable in mixed fragments than in complete fragments and natural patches. The kinds of mobile and sessile taxa that contributed most to differences among fragments differed, depending on which types of fragments were compared. Many taxa were found in greater abundance in natural patches than in mixed or complete fragments, although not all comparisons were statistically significant. Artificial habitat seems to interrupt natural connectivity among local populations of intertidal marine organisms in this urbanised estuary.

AB  - Farm ponds provide a home for birds and numerous species of aquatic animals in Taoyuan, Taiwan. Urbanization and development of infrastructure resulted in the gradual disappearance of these ponds. Currently, only 3800 ponds originally approximately 15.4 % remain, and 84.6 % of the surface area of the ponds has vanished. Aiming to protect avian diversity, this study used logistic regression analysis and the geostatistical approach to analyze the relationship between avian diversity and landscape structure, in an effort to elucidate the spatial driving force of avian diversity. We detected that regression-kriging (RK) was even more accurate than logistic regression (LR). In addition, the value of diversity (H') measures may decrease instead of increase when evenness (J') is increased. The results of this study also indicated that an exceedingly strong relationship existed among avian diversity and landscape scale, agricultural landscape indices, and pond landscape indices. The models predict that preservation of large areas of waterscapes and paddy landscapes result in greater diversity of avian species. Spatial estimation of the research area indicated that human activity substantially affected avian ecology, leading to reductions in avian diversity. Thus, the reduction of the area of ecological corridors due to urban development is expected to further reduce avian diversity in the Taoyuan region. Our approach can be used to effectively analyze the correlations between characteristics of ecosystems and the environmental landscape, to ensure that pondscapes can be appropriately maintained and ecological reserves designated to prevent further decline in avian diversity.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a prevalent threat to biological diversity, and urbanization is a primary agent of fragmentation and a leading cause of species endangerment. Landscape biogeographic and local habitat characteristics can be important determinants of the distribution of species in habitat patches in urban landscapes. However, the specifics of which characteristics are most critical to maintaining biological diversity are not fully known for prairie ecosystems, especially in fragmented urban habitat. This study focuses on black-tailed prairie dogs along an urban gradient in Denver, CO. Prairie dogs have declined precipitously throughout the region and are an essential part of the prairie ecosystem, making them excellent study subjects. We identified a series of habitat fragments along a gradient of urbanization in the fully urbanized areas and south suburbs of Denver, CO, both containing and not containing prairie dogs. Local characteristics, including fragment slope and vegetative cover, and landscape characteristics, including fragment size, age and connectivity, were measured on each fragment. We used likelihood-based methods to explore which variables most accurately predicted prairie dog occurrence within our study area. Multiple factors influenced the distribution of prairie dogs in urban settings, with colony connectivity the strongest predictor of occupancy. Large and recently isolated fragments near other prairie dog colonies, flat areas and those with high graminoid cover were most likely to support prairie dog populations. Our study provides the first attempt to model prairie dog occurrence in highly fragmented urban habitat and has important implications for the management and conservation of prairie dogs.

AB  - In 1996, a coalition of diverse and determined organizations launched a new initiative in the Chicago region. Our vision? Chicago Wilderness: a thriving mosaic of natural areas, connected by greenways and wildlife corridors, embedded in the nation's third largest metropolis. In this vision, the region's human communities reclaim a cultural tradition of protecting and restoring the globally outstanding natural communities that enrich our lives. Today, more than 170 organizations join forces to transform this vision into reality. A regional biodiversity recovery plan, the result of 3 years of assessment and planning by scientists, land managers, educators, and policy strategists, sets priorities and determines the lines of action for the coalition. This regional agenda stems from our vision and recovery goals for each ecological community; it encourages targeted research initiatives that focus on characterizing our native biological diversity and on analyzing elements critical to its recovery. Ultimately, though, the long-term survival of our natural wealth rests on the support from the public. Although the challenges to conservation educators and communicators are many, Chicago Wilderness allows us to work together in understanding our audiences, channeling our resources, and creating novel approaches to engage the widest public in our conservation efforts.

AB  - Roads and highways represent one of the most important anthropogenic impacts on natural areas and contribute to habitat fragmentation, because they are linear features that can inhibit animal movement, thereby causing barrier effects by subdividing the populations adjacent to the roads. The study presented here aims to determine, to which extent roads act as a barrier, subdividing populations of three species of small forest mammals: bank vole, yellow-necked mouse and common shrew, and what is the relative importance of road width and traffic intensity on the barrier effect. The study was carried out at four 125 m long segments of roads, close to the city of Ceske Budejovice. All segments crossed a forest. The capture-recapture method was applied to determine the crossing rates of animals. The traps were checked three times each day during four consecutive nights, in summer and in autumn. We found that: (1) roads strongly prevent crossing movements in all three studied species, (2) there are interspecific differences in road crossing rates, (3) species cross more often narrow than wide roads, (4) traffic intensity does not affect the crossing rates.

   Results: Landscape fragmentation may reduce dispersal opportunities thereby isolating fens and reducing genetic exchange. Species in fragmented wetlands may have lower reproductive success, which can lead to biodiversity loss. While fens may have always been relatively isolated from each other, they have become increasingly fragmented in modem times within agricultural and urban landscapes in both Europe and North America. Dispersal by water, animals and wind has been hampered by changes related to development in landscapes surrounding fens. Because the seeds of certain species are long-lived in the seed bank, frequent episodes of dispersal are not always necessary to maintain the biodiversity of fens. However, of particular concern to restoration is that some dominant species, such as the tussock sedge Carex stricta, may not disperse readily between fens.
   Conclusions: Knowledge of seed dispersal can be used to maintain and restore the biodiversity of fens in fragmented landscapes. Given that development has fragmented landscapes and that this situation is not likely to change, the dispersal of seeds might be enhanced by moving hay or cattle from fens to damaged sites, or by reestablishing lost hydrological connections.

AB  - In the face of ongoing habitat loss and fragmentation, maintaining an adequate level of landscape connectivity is needed to both encourage dispersal between habitat patches and to reduce the extinction risk of fragmented wildlife populations. In a developing region of southwestern Ontario, Canada, a declining population of Eastern Massasauga rattlesnakes (Sistrurus catenatus) persists in fragmented remnants of tallgrass prairie in an urban park system. The goal of this study was to identify potential connectivity pathways between habitat patches for this species by using a GIS least-cost permeability swath model, and to evaluate the outputs with snake road mortality data. Results identified seven pathways between five core habitat blocks, a subset of which were validated with aerial imagery and mortality data. Four high-ranking pathways intersected roads through or near road mortality hotspots. This research will guide conservation interventions aimed at recovering endangered reptiles in a globally rare ecosystem, and will inform the use of permeability swaths for the identification of locations most suitable for connectivity interventions in dynamic, urbanizing landscapes.

AB  - Predicted increases in the human population, in a context of climatic change and limiting freshwater resources, have raised awareness of the need to preserve aquatic ecosystems, their functions, and the biodiversity they harbor. The ecological reconciliation approach proposes the long-term co-existence of biodiversity preservation and the development of human activities. We investigated the ecological and evolutionary contributions of irrigation and hydroelectric canals in the highly fragmented and regulated Durance River (Rhone basin, Southern France), to the genetic diversity patterns of two interbreeding cyprinid species, the native Parachondrostoma toxostoma, and the introduced Chondrostoma nasus species. We observed a high degree of genetic homogeneity along the length of the river. The maintenance of gene flow despite the presence of dams, and the detection of admixed populations and hybridization events in canals suggest that these canals may act as ecological corridors and hybrid zones with the potential to influence genetic resources for the native and introduced species. These anthropogenic structures vary considerably in terms of their spatial organization, size, and overall management, increasing habitat diversity in the urbanized section of river. Together with the restoration of natural habitats, canals can be considered as important structures for biodiversity dynamic in such urban conditions.

AB  - Landscape heterogeneity can shape genetic structure and functional connectivity of populations. When this heterogeneity imposes variable costs of moving across the landscape, populations can be structured according to a pattern of "isolation by resistance" (IBR). At the same time, divergent local environmental filters can limit gene flow, creating an alternative pattern of "isolation by environment" (IBE). Here, we evaluate IBR and IBE in the insect-pollinated, biennial plant Sabatia angularis (L.) Pursh (Gentianaceae) across serpentine grasslands in the fragmented landscape of SE Pennsylvania, USA using similar to 4500 neutral SNP loci. Specifically, we test the extent to which radical alteration of the landscape matrix by humans has fundamentally altered the cost of movement, imprinting a pattern of IBR dictated by land use type and intensity, and the potential for IBE in relation to a gradient of heavy metal concentrations found in serpentine soil. We reveal a strong signal of IBR and a weak signal of IBE across sites, indicating the greater importance of the landscape matrix in shaping genetic structure of S. angularis populations in the study region. Based on Circuitscape and least cost path approaches, we find that both low- and high-intensity urbanization resist gene flow by orders of magnitude greater than "natural" habitats, although resistance to low-intensity urbanization weakens at larger spatial scales. While cropland presents a substantially lower barrier than urban development, cumulative human land use surrounding populations predicts within-population genetic diversity and inbreeding in S. angularis. Our results emphasize the role of forest buffers and corridors in facilitating gene flow between serpentine grassland patches and averting local extinction of plant populations.

AB  - Understanding how habitat fragmentation affects population processes (e.g. dispersal) at different spatial scales is of critical importance to conservation. We assessed the effects of habitat fragmentation on dispersal and regional and fine-scale population structure in a currently widespread and common cooperatively breeding bird species found across south-eastern Australia, the superb fairy-wren Malurus cyaneus. Despite its relative abundance and classification as an urban tolerant species, the superb fairy-wren has declined disproportionately from low tree-cover agricultural landscapes across the Box-Ironbark region of north-central Victoria, Australia. Loss of genetic connectivity and disruption to its complex social system may be associated with the decline of this species from apparently suitable habitat in landscapes with low levels of tree cover. To assess whether reduced structural connectivity has had negative consequences for genetic connectivity in the superb fairy-wren, we used a landscape-scale approach to compare patterns of genetic diversity and gene flow at large (landscape/regional) and fine (site-level) spatial scales. In addition, using genetic distances, for each sex, we tested landscape models of decreased dispersal through treeless areas (isolation-by-resistance) while controlling for the effect of isolation-by-distance. Landscape models indicated that larger-scale gene flow across the Box-Ironbark region was constrained by distance rather than by lack of structural connectivity. Nonetheless, a pattern of isolation-by-resistance for males (the less-dispersive sex) and lower genetic diversity and higher genetic similarity within sites in low-cover fragmented landscapes indicated disruption to fine-scale gene flow mechanisms and/or mating systems. Although loss of structural connectivity did not appear to impede gene flow at larger spatial scales, fragmentation appeared to affect fine-scale population processes (e.g. local gene flow mechanisms and/or mating systems) adversely and may contribute to the decline of superb fairy-wrens in fragmented landscapes in the Box-Ironbark region.

AB  - Urbanisation and agriculture dramatically modify the landscapes available for use by wildlife, affecting key aspects of their ecology such as survival, foraging, predation, competition and reproductive success. Relatively little is known about the effects of urbanisation and agriculture on the genetic structure, gene flow and genetic diversity of wild species. Here, landscape genetic techniques were applied to compare local genetic diversity and gene flow between wood mouse populations in urban and arable landscapes. Using nine microsatellite markers, individuals were genotyped from six arable and seven urban sample sites. Inter-population genetic differentiation was significantly greater in urban than arable habitat, while allele richness, private allele richness and heterozygosity were higher for arable sample sites, with varying degrees of significance. These suggest that urban habitat was sufficiently fragmented to limit gene flow. To test the effect of landscape features on gene flow, several cost-distance measures were generated. Overland distance and Euclidean distance correlated best with inter-population genetic differentiation in arable habitat, whereas distances that accommodated differences in habitat quality better explained differentiation in urban habitat. There was no evidence that margins adjacent to roads, rivers or railways facilitated gene flow. Together, the results indicate that urban landscapes expose wood mice to greater fragmentation in habitat quality than arable areas, leading to greater population isolation that is not mitigated by the presence of dispersal corridors.

AB  - Roads are the link between geographic space and human socio-economic activities, promoting local economic development, and simultaneously causing various negative effects, such as segmentation, interference, destruction, degradation, and pollution. In China, the construction of roads is rapid, which might affect wildlife movement, landscape pattern, and land use change, thereby, affecting the conservation of heritage sites. In the present study, the minimum cumulative resistance model, along with geographic information system technology, was adopted to compute the ecological corridor for wildlife movement between the source patches and to analyze ecological corridor changes under two conditions (road presence/absence) at two time points in Kanas, nominated as a World Natural Heritage site. The relationships between the ecological corridor changes and various factors, including the cutting index of the road-effect zones', terrain, and road geometric characteristics, were examined using the geographical detector model to identify the influencing factors and mechanisms of the corridor changes, in order to rationally simulate the potential ecological corridors. In addition, the detached and fragmented ecological patches can be connected to effectively protect the biodiversity, biological habitats, and species, which are important means to achieve regional sustainable development and ecological construction.

AB  - This study addresses social-ecological dynamics in the greater metropolitan area of Stockholm County, Sweden, with special focus on the National Urban Park (NUP). It is part of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) and has the following specific objectives: (1) to provide scientific information on biodiversity patterns, ecosystem dynamics, and ecosystem services generated; (2) to map interplay between actors and institutions involved in management of ecosystem services; and (3) to identify strategies for strengthening social-ecological resilience. The green areas in Stockholm County deliver numerous ecosystem services, for example, air filtration, regulation of microclimate, noise reduction, surface water drainage, recreational and cultural values, nutrient retention, and pollination and seed dispersal. Recreation is among the most important services and NUP, for example, has more than 15 million visitors per year. More than 65 organizations representing 175,000 members are involved in management of ecosystem services. However, because of population increase and urban growth during the last three decades, the region displays a quite dramatic loss of green areas and biodiversity. An important future focus is how management may reduce increasing isolation of urban green areas and enhance connectivity. Comanagement should be considered where locally managed green space may function as buffer zones and for management of weak links that connect larger green areas; for example, there are three such areas around NUP identified. Preliminary results indicate that areas of informal management represent centers on which to base adaptive comanagement, with the potential to strengthen biodiversity management and resilience in the landscape.

AB  - The fragmentation of landscapes, induced by the growing urbanisation, is a major cause of biodiversity loss. Ecological corridors are landscape elements that make up for the negative effects of habitat fragmentation in agricultural or natural landscapes. However, their effectiveness have been rarely assess in an urban context. To do so, we analysed shrews in woodlots, corridors and domestic gardens that are connected or disconnected from a corridor. Indeed, these mammals are very sensitive to fragmentation and could play an important ecological role even in small and isolated areas such as domestic gardens. Ninety-seven shrews, from three species were trapped. In our study, Sorex coronatus, Sorex minutus and Crocidura russula were not widely distributed and mainly occurred in woodlots, corridors and connected gardens. In gardens, shrew occurrences were mainly determined by landscape configuration with negative effects of the distance to the corridor and the distance to the woodlot, stronger for C.russula than Sorex species. At the local scale, garden management and vegetation showed a positive effect mainly for Sorex species. The quality of gardens seems good enough to permit the co-occurrence of several species of shrews and thus competition was not identified as a major process for determining the occurrence. We showed that, as in other ecosystems, ecological corridors in urban context can play an effective role for the distribution of organisms with low dispersal capabilities and should be develop in planning strategies.

AB  - This article summarizes the data of a survey of flowering plants in 80 sites in five European cities and urban agglomerations (Antwerp, Belgium; greater Paris, France; Poznan, Poland; Tartu, Estonia; and Zurich, Switzerland). Sampling sites were selected based on a double orthogonal gradient of size and connectivity and were urban green areas (e.g. parks, cemeteries). To characterize the flowering plants, two sampling methodologies were applied between April and July 2018. First, a floristic inventory of the occurrence of all flowering plants in the five cities. Second, flower counts in sampling plots of standardized size (1 m(2)) only in Zurich. We sampled 2146 plant species (contained in 824 genera and 137 families) and across the five cities. For each plant species, we provide its origin status (i.e. whether the plants are native from Europe or not) and 11 functional traits potentially important for plant-pollinator interactions. For each study site, we provide the number of species, genera, and families recorded, the Shannon diversity as well as the proportion of exotic species, herbs, shrubs and trees. In addition, we provide information on the patch size, connectivity, and urban intensity, using four remote sensing-based proxies measured at 100- and 800-m radii. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Many birds escape from humans as they do from predators, and it might be that birds in urban parks adjust their escape depending on the closeness of safe places such as trees. We show that birds flew further when disturbed where fewer trees occurred. This suggests that plantings in urban parks might influence how well people and birds coexist.
   Habitat destruction and fragmentation increasingly bring humans into close proximity with wildlife, particularly in urban contexts. Animals respond to humans using nuanced anti-predator responses, especially escape, with responses influenced by behavioral and life history traits, the nature of the risk, and aspects of the surrounding environment. Although many studies examine associations between broad-scale habitat characteristics (i.e., habitat type) and escape response, few investigate the influence of fine-scale aspects of the local habitat within which escape occurs. We test the "habitat connectivity hypothesis," suggesting that given the higher cost of escape within less connected habitats (due to the lack of protective cover), woodland birds should delay escape (tolerate more risk) than when in more connected habitat. We analyze flight-initiation distances (FIDs) of five species of woodland birds in urban Melbourne, south-eastern Australia. A negative effect of habitat connectivity (the proportion of the escape route with shrubs/trees/perchable infrastructure) on distance fled was evident for all study species, suggesting a higher cost of escape associated with lower connectivity. FID did not vary with connectivity at the location at which escape was initiated (four species), apart from a positive effect of habitat connectivity on FID for Noisy Miner Manorina melanocephala. We provide some support for two predictions of the "habitat connectivity hypothesis" in at least some taxa, and conclude it warrants further investigation across a broader range of taxa inhabiting contrasting landscapes. Increasing habitat connectivity within urban landscapes may reduce escape stress experienced by urban birds.

AB  - Cities have a major impact on Australian landscapes, especially in coastal regions, to the detriment of native biodiversity. Areas suitable for urban development often coincide with those areas that support high levels of species diversity and endemism. However, there is a paucity of reliable information available to guide urban conservation planning and management, especially regarding the trade-off between investing in protecting and restoring habitat at the landscape level, and investing in programmes to maintain the condition of remnant vegetation at the local (site) level. We review the literature on Australian urban ecology, focusing on urban terrestrial and aquatic vertebrate and invertebrate fauna. We identify four main factors limiting our knowledge of urban fauna: (i) a lack of studies focusing at multiple ecological levels; (ii) a lack of multispecies studies; (iii) an almost total absence of long-term (temporal) studies; and (iv) a need for stronger integration of research outcomes into urban conservation planning and management. We present a set of key principles for the development of a spatially explicit, long-term approach to urban fauna research. This requires an understanding of the importance of local-level habitat quality and condition relative to the composition, configuration and connectivity of habitats within the larger urban landscape. These principles will ultimately strengthen urban fauna management and conservation planning by enabling us to prioritize and allocate limited financial resources to maximize the conservation return.

AB  - Fragmentation is a critical issue for tree populations because the creation of small patches can reduce local population size and increase isolation, both of which can promote inbreeding and its negative consequences, as well as loss of genetic diversity. To test the hypothesis that patch size and isolation influence mating patterns or seed production in forest trees, we utilize the spatial array of trees of an urban population of Chinese Pine (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.) planted in patches around Beijing. Our design includes 28 urban patches, with patch size ranging from 1 to 2000 adult trees and isolation (edge distance index) ranging from 37.5 m to 245.8 m. We examined the average number of seeds per cone and percentage of viable seed per cone for each patch as measures of seed production. By utilizing seven paternally inherited chloroplast microsatellite loci, we estimated the mating pattern parameters for each patch, including the level of selling, the amount of immigrant pollen and the effective number of pollen sources (N-ep). Using a general linear model selection procedure based on AIC value, we found patch size was the best predictor of the selling and immigration rate; smaller patches had a higher selfing and immigration rate. Small patches with one adult had relatively high Nep which indicates connectivity among urban patches. However, due to the reduced amount of immigrant pollen and limited diversity of local pollen, intermediate sized patches (with 5-10 adults) had the lowest N-ep among the study patches. For patches with more than 10 adults, Nep was increased with patch size. The percentage of viable seeds per cone significantly decreased with patch size, indicating a possible negative consequence of inbreeding. The effect of patch size on mating patterns and seed production suggests that the patches of trees experience less connectivity than trees within continuous forest. These findings indicate that forest management practices should emphasize the maintenance of an optimal patch size because, despite the fact that tree species show the potential for long distance pollen movement, the number of local trees strongly influences the mating patterns.

AB  - The arrival of the phrase nature-based solutions into the lexicon of academics, planners, managers and policy makers in recent years has sparked a heated debate as to the effectiveness of using nature as a viable solution for mitigating the impacts of anthropogenic environmental change. One of the difficulties of evaluating the potential efficacy and impact of nature-based solutions is that it is believed that there is little evidence by way of a precedent or long-term successful examples. Much literature exists on the subject of designing with nature to provide multi-functional green infrastructure, connectivity in the landscape, and ecosystem service provision. Indeed, in the opinion of many, the nature-based solution approach appears to synergise research into green infrastructure, ecological connectivity and ecosystem service provision for building climate-related resilience. However, when a nature-based solution has been specifically selected over, say, an engineered solution the literature is rather less clear. So, decision-makers may find it necessary to rely on less reliable sources of impact evidence. This paper argues that field boundary hedgerows may be considered to be exemplars of a nature-based solution, one that was planned, designed, perfected and mainstreamed at a landscape scale, that was specifically selected over a non-nature-based solution, and one that is still in providing solutions and co-benefits today. Therefore, hedgerows may provide some perspective into the potential or emergent co-benefits that the current nature-based solution approach seeks to provide.

AB  - Plants are key contributors to ecosystem services delivered by green roofs in cities including stormwater capture, temperature regulation, and wildlife habitat. As a result, current research has primarily focused on their growth in relationship to extensive green roof (e.g., substrates < 15 cm depth) ecosystem services. Green roofs are exposed to a variety of harsh abiotic factors such as intense solar radiation, wind, and isolation from ground-level habitats, making survival exceedingly difficult. Plants in natural habitats benefit from a variety of interactions with fungi and bacteria. These plant-microbial interactions improve mechanisms of survival and productivity; however, many green roof substrates are sterilized prior to installation and lack microbial communities with unstudied consequences for green roof plant health and subsequent survival and performance. In this paper, we present six hypotheses on the positive role of microbes in green roof applications. In natural and experimental systems, microbial interactions have been linked to plant (1) drought tolerance, (2) pathogen protection, (3) nutrient availability, (4) salt tolerance, (5) phytohormone production, and (6) substrate stabilization, all of which are desirable properties of green roof ecosystems. As few studies exist that directly examine these relationships on green roofs, we explore the existing ecological literature on these topics to unravel the mechanisms that could support more complex green roof ecosystem and lead to new insight into the design, performance, and broader applications in green infrastructure.

AB  - Corridors (variably called landscape linkages, connectors, and gateways) are expanses of a landscape that facilitate the flow or movement of individuals, genes, and ecological processes. Protected areas with their buffer zones and the corridors that connect them are cornerstones of modern conservation actions to maintain the biodiversity we have and restore what we have lost. Policy and governance to guide the establishment and management of protected areas and supporting buffer zones is well established in the Central Indian Highlands. A policy and governance structure to create the context and enabling conditions for corridor maintenance, creation, and recovery is emerging but is constrained by the reigning land-management paradigm that separates conservation from development rather than mainstreaming species and habitat conservation into the rural development agenda. Well-nourished, healthy human populations and healthy ecosystems are inextricably linked. The worsening ecological conditions in the Central Indian Highlands can trigger the emergence of a common agenda for an inclusive, caring, and environment-friendly mode of development. The alternative is the business-as-usual scenario: a continuation of worsening ecological conditions. Entry points through the biodiversity, agriculture production, resource extraction, and economic/social sectors to enable integrated sustainable landscape management are identified. These include deepening what it means to successfully conserve a species combined with explicit threat analysis for at-risk tigers and the landscapes that supports them; landscape scenario modeling to advance communication by synthesizing diverse forms of research and articulating and evaluating alternative socio-economic futures; and the use of the smart green infrastructure process as an approach to development rather than only as a way to mitigate environmental damage. Models are presented to scale up from isolated conservation interventions to collective impact that unites supportive government partners with individuals, NGOs, and economic interests to achieve viable long-term relationships in human and natural systems to value, maintain, and recover landscape connectivity.

AB  - Gene flow in birds can be affected by urbanization depending on natural history traits and adaptability to habitat change. Contrasting results can be expected when comparing species with opposite resilience to urbanization. In this study, we assessed genetic diversity and structure for two bird species, the urban avoider white-eared ground-sparrow, Melozone leucotis, and the urban dweller house wren Troglodytes aedon. We used seven microsatellite loci and sampled five locations with differing levels of urbanization in Costa Rica. We found considerably higher genetic structure in white-eared ground-sparrows than in house wrens. Circuit theory analyses proved a higher isolation from urban resistance for the white-eared ground-sparrow than for house wrens. These results support that urbanization is a significant barrier for gene flow in urban avoiders, in contrast to urban dweller species that showed little to no impact. Differences could be attributed to a higher plasticity in habitat and nesting site preferences in the house wren, and significant dispersal limitation for the white-eared ground-sparrow. These results emphasize the need for conservation strategies towards white-eared ground-sparrows and other urban avoider species whose habitat and connectivity have been reduced by the recent urban expansion.

AB  - Cities worldwide are expanding in area and human population, posing multiple challenges to amphibian populations, including habitat loss from removal of wetlands and terrestrial upland habitat, habitat fragmentation due to roads and the built environment, and habitat degradation from pollutants, extensive human use and introduced species. We developed an eight-step urban amphibian conservation framework based on established monitoring, analytical methods and community engagement to enable amphibian conservation in a large urban centre. The framework outlines a process used to conserve biodiversity in a complex landuse and decision-making environment supported by a series of successive complementary modelling techniques to measure amphibian presence, priority habitat and functional connectivity. We applied the framework in Calgary, Alberta, Canada to illustrate its potential. Here, urbanization has reduced wetlands by 90% and ecological knowledge on amphibians was poor. We improved knowledge on amphibian diversity and distribution, identified core wetlands and movement pathways for amphibian species and identified barriers in the wetland network where construction or restoration measures could re-establish amphibians or increase their densities. This knowledge was shared with ecologists and city planners for implementation through appropriate policies and plans. Our framework provides a series of stepwise products to improve an urban municipality's ability to restore or conserve priority habitat and movement pathways necessary for amphibian survival under pressure from multiple land uses. The framework provides a platform to identify city plans, policy and or programmes and to derive necessary information to support amphibian conservation.

AB  - Urban greenery is valued not only for its aesthetic value but also for environmental services and the overall health benefits that follows. A large portion of the world population now resides in built environments, and there is growing need to provide a conducive and healthy environment for the dwellers. Vertical greenery systems (VGS) provide greenery opportunities in cities even when there is limited land space especially as recent technology enables people to grow plants outdoors as well as indoors. Indoor vertical greenery (iVGS) was installed to monitor any alteration in the temperature, humidity, particulate matter and use of space. The present study used an actual environment, included paralled corridors in the same building. The movement in both corridors were significantly (p < 0.05) correlated and post green wall establishment data showed the relationship changed significantly (r(2) = 0.8748, P < 0.0001, RMSE = 23.4521) with relatively more people using the corridor after the iVGS installed. Significant difference was seen in the humidity levels but not in the temperature after the installation. Particulate matter levels dropped 48.5%, 82.6%, 5.5% (PM2.5, PM10, > PM10 respectively) in the corridor with iVGS by the end of the data collection. These findings suggest larger green coverage would have a greater positive impact on the environmental conditions of an indoor environment.

AB  - The study focused on the attractiveness of mulches (consisting of the addition of a layer material to the soil surface) and their efficiency to promote recolonization by pedofauna of isolated and degraded areas. The experimental study was set up in the former coal mining area of Northern France. This area is particularly disturbed and fragmented by land-use change, urbanization, industry, intensive agriculture and metal pollution. To examine the movements of pedofauna, four kinds of mulches were applied: (i) Ramial Chipped Wood (RCW), (ii) chopped Miscanthus, (iii) dead leaves and (iv) wheat straw as well as plastic sheeting, a material often used in green spaces. A negative control consisted in soil without mulch addition. The experimental set-up consisted of a set of 18 bands of mulch (6 m long x 0.5 m width x 8 cm thick, i.e. a volume of 0.04 m(3) per band) installed on three adjacent plots on a surface area which stretch on 4400 m(2): (i) plot F1, a mixed plantation, (ii) plot M consisted of three rows of maples (both considered to be the reservoir of biodiversity) and (iii) plot BF, an ash plantation (with lower biodiversity). Faunistic communities of soil present within the mulches were monitoring using pitfall traps for four months (April to July), at a rate of eight surveys for each of the 90 traps installed, i.e. 720 samples. Different life traits and indices of diversity were studied, more specifically on carabid beetles. The main objective of the study was first to check whether mulches could or not reconnect different planted plots in a peri-urban landscape highly modified by human activities. The second aim was to find which type of mulch had the best efficiency in the recovery of the connectivity between plots. The last questions were which type of zoological groups could be favoured by the use of mulches and which benefits for ecosystem functioning. The main hypotheses of this study were: (i) Organic mulches would act as dispersal corridors and refuge zones to the soil organisms; (ii) organic mulches would be attractive to many organisms with various ecological needs.
   This study highlighted the potential benefits of using the mulching technique to support ecological connectivity in disturbed environment since this method highlighted the presence of individuals with different diets (saprophagous, predators, phytophagous and so forth), small and large size species which do not have the same dispersal capacities as well as species that are more dependent on forest environments and others that depend on Ymore open environments. The study concluded that organic mulches are more favourable to pedofauna than soil without mulch or plastic sheeting. With regard to organic mulches, no difference was noted, either in terms of cumulative abundance or monthly monitoring. However, for carabids, it should be noted that dead leaves and wheat straw have higher specific richness than Miscanthus and RCW.

AB  - As an important factor of scenic quality and biodiversity along a greenway, landscape diversity has yet to receive as much attention as it deserves. In the practice of greenway alignment planning, it usually gives way to the primary consideration of land suitability. In this article, we aim to make up this missing link. Upon the new concepts and measurement of linear landscape diversity and cellular landscape diversity, we proposed greenway potential index incorporating land suitability and landscape diversity. The greenway potential index was combined with connectivity analysis to connect path between a future greenway's origin and destination that meets both land suitability and landscape diversity requirements. Specially, with Wuchang (Wuhan City, China) as a case study area, we proposed three greenway alignment planning scenarios respectively according to the criteria of suitability, diversity and the synthesis of them. Markedly differences were revealed between the results of suitability greenways and diversity greenways. The results indicate that the tripartite model we proposed is capable of planning a connecting path between a future greenway's origin and destination that not only meets land suitability requirements for greenway construction, but also incorporates as many landscape types of significant difference as possible.

AB  - The City Biodiversity Index (CBI), or Singapore Index on Cities' Biodiversity, serves as a tool to monitor biodiversity in cities and was endorsed by the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2009. Indicator 2 of the CBI measures the connectivity of natural areas in cities. We propose an improved and straightforward method for measuring connectivity based on the effective mesh size metric to replace the previous method used in the CBI. The previous version did not account for intra-patch (within-patch) connectivity nor for major barriers. Our evaluation of the new version of Indicator 2 through its application to Montreal and Lisbon confirmed its reliability. In Montreal, natural areas have a total connectivity value of 581.7 ha, the majority of which exists between, rather than within, patches of natural area. Smaller patches (<15 ha) contribute significantly to overall connectivity, which may have implications for future conservation efforts. In Lisbon, connectivity (342 ha) is concentrated within patches. We also applied the improved Indicator 2 to a case study in southwestern Montreal, where a greenway network ("green infrastructure") has been proposed by a local community organization. We assessed the contribution of Meadowbrook Golf Course to connectivity in scenarios of the proposed greenway network and the effect that residential development would have. Not only would this development eliminate the golf course's current contribution to connectivity, but also its much greater potential contribution to connectivity in future scenarios. Restoring and establishing additional natural areas would significantly increase connectivity in the network. Our results demonstrate that the improved version of Indicator 2 is a suitable method in the CBI. It is equally useful for identifying options to increase the connectivity of natural areas within cities in the future and for determining the impacts of urban development on connectivity. More advanced methods for quantifying connectivity exist and may also be included in Part I of the CBI. However, they are often challenging to use and this frequently discourages city planners from including any indicator of connectivity in their biodiversity monitoring. The connectivity metric presented here overcomes this problem through its practicality in a wide range of planning structures while still generating meaningful results which may then inspire city planners to move towards using more advanced methods of measuring connectivity.

AB  - Costa Rica is recognized worldwide for its nature conservation policy following the traditional land-sparing approach. However, concerns have been raised about the opposite trends of the agricultural land cover changes driven by the option to expand old and new export crops after the country's external debt crisis of the 1980s. We study what happened during the last 20 years by applying landscape ecology metrics to the REDD+ land cover maps of 1986, 2001, and 2014, and statistically testing these indicators with the locations of species richness of plants and birds recorded by INBio. Our results confirm that deforestation has been reversed and most of the biodiversity considered is housed in forestland, but also that the expansion of export monocultures and urban sprawl have fragmented and isolated these tropical forests. Ecological connectivity values decreased 13% across the territory, all crops are negatively correlated with bird and plant locations, and the metropolitan expansion caused a detrimental impact on coffee agroforestry. All these outcomes are consistent with the growing deficit of the Costa Rican physical trade balance due to a faster increase of tropical exports than the growing imports of staple food, with a loss of soil organic matter filled by high doses of agrochemicals imported. Overcoming these environmental problems require a new land-sharing approach to nature conservation aimed at improving ecological connectivity through an agroecology approach combined with land-use planning to preserve the remaining green belt of the shade coffee plantations as a buffer green infrastructure in the metropolitan area.

AB  - Refueling performance is the primary currency of a successful migration as birds must maintain energy stores to achieve an optimal travel schedule. Migrating birds can anticipate heightened energy demand, not to mention increased uncertainty that energy demands will be satisfied, especially within an urbanizing landscape following long-distance flights. We tested the expectation that refueling performance of songbirds is reduced as densities increase at stopover sites in an urbanizing coastline of the Gulf of Mexico. We measured the density of migrating birds, their refueling performance, and arthropod abundance in two large tracts of contiguous forest paired with two small isolated patches embedded within residential settings throughout spring migration over the course of 2 years. Refueling performance declined with increasing migrant densities, even though the overall daily densities of birds stopping in these landscapes were relatively low and arthropod densities were low throughout. Habitat patch size alone did not account for differences in refueling performance, but smaller habitat patches more often concentrated migrants in higher densities where they experienced reduced refueling performance. We found support for density-dependent refueling performance during spring migration through a region where overall passage and stopover densities are low; suggesting that larger contiguous forest tracks within urban landscapes provide higher quality habitat for refueling and that effect is likely even more pronounced in landscapes within higher density migratory corridors. The nutritional challenges encountered during migration influence the overall pace of migration and changes in access to food resources due to increasing urbanization may ultimately impact optimal travel schedules.

AB  - Urban biodiversity offers important benefits to residents and may be crucial to reaching global biodiversity conservation targets, but little research has been conducted on how cities actually plan for biodiversity. In this study, we conducted a mixed methods content analysis of biodiversity plans by 39 cities around the world to determine whether they measured their actions, how they did so (via quantitative indicators and qualitative outputs), and what topics these actions and measures covered. We based our analytical framework on the Singapore Index on Cities' Biodiversity (also known as the City Biodiversity Index), a widely applied 23-indicator index that helps cities track their progress in biodiversity planning. The Singapore Index groups its indicators into the following three core components: native biodiversity, ecosystem services, and governance and management. For actions and measures not classifiable by the Singapore Index, we inductively derived additional categories. Across all plans, we identified 2,231 actions, 346 indicators, and 444 outputs. We found that all of the plans included actions, while 82% included measures (67% included indicators and 72% included outputs). Only 29% of actions were associated with a measure. Overall, the plans covered all of the categories in the Singapore Index, particularly within the core components of native biodiversity and governance and management, though some plans had a narrower focus. The 20 additional urban biodiversity topics that were not covered by the Singapore Index framework included socioeconomic considerations, data collection, genetic diversity, urban agriculture and forestry, green infrastructure, human-wildlife conflicts, indigenous concerns, and citizen science. Indicators were the most common measures for native biodiversity and ecosystem service topics, while outputs were the most common measures for governance and management. Our results may inform the revision and development of urban biodiversity indicators in the post-2020 framework and of other initiatives that guide cities in contributing to local and global biodiversity goals.

AB  - As urban habitats vary in composition and structure along the urban to rural gradient, different degrees of urbanization likely result in a diversity of landscape responses from wildlife. We investigated this relationship with the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), an urban adapted species that is both common and understudied in highly metropolitan landscapes. We investigated which landscape factors affect opossum occupancy, colonization, extinction, and detection by using a large system of motion-triggered camera traps in the Chicago metropolitan area over 10 seasons from spring 2010 to summer 2012. Opossum patch occupancy rates were highest near natural water sources regardless of urbanization, whereas occupancy rates in patches >= 1000 m from natural water sources decreased with increasing urbanization. Our results suggest opossums have relaxed habitat needs at intermediate levels of disturbance, as the ability to locate anthropogenic water sources may allow them to occupy previously uninhabitable patches.

AB  - As landscapes are increasingly modified due to anthropogenic processes such as urbanisation or development for agriculture, the need to understand wildlife habitat requirements is imperative. This is particularly pertinent for species that are threatened, or apex predators with specific nest, den, or food requirements. Identifying responses to habitat with thresholds can provide an understanding of what resources species are using or avoiding, and their interactions with the surrounding environment. In this research we investigated space use and habitat requirements of the threatened apex predator, the powerful owl (Ninox strenua) in Greater Melbourne, Australia. We deployed GPS devices to 21 urban powerful owls over five years and found owls had an average home range size of 397 ha, and an average core-range of 84 ha. Home range size and positioning was driven by tree cover and urban land cover, while core ranges were restricted to treed environments with a limited area of impervious surfaces and housing. We used thresholds to identify-three priorities for powerful owl conservation in Mel-bourne. Priority 1: Ensuring river corridors and public open spaces are adequately protected. Priority 2: Limit property densities near rivers and protected areas. Priority 3: Finding opportunities for revegetation to expand and enhance habitat over time. Our research demonstrates how species-specific thresholds can inform land use planning to ensure wildlife species are maintained within highly modified environments.

AB  - We investigated the relative importance of vacant lot and urban farm habitat features and their surrounding landscape context on bee community richness, abundance, composition, and resource use patterns. Three years of pan trap collections from 16 sites yielded a rich assemblage of bees from vacant lots and urban farms, with 98 species documented. We collected a greater bee abundance from vacant lots, and the two forms of greenspace supported significantly different bee communities. Plant-pollinator networks constructed from floral visitation observations revealed that, while the average number of bees utilizing available resources, niche breadth, and niche overlap were similar, the composition of floral resources and common foragers varied by habitat type. Finally, we found that the proportion of impervious surface and number of greenspace patches in the surrounding landscape strongly influenced bee assemblages. At a local scale (100 m radius), patch isolation appeared to limit colonization of vacant lots and urban farms. However, at a larger landscape scale (1000 m radius), increasing urbanization resulted in a greater concentration of bees utilizing vacant lots and urban farms, illustrating that maintaining greenspaces provides important habitat, even within highly developed landscapes.

AB  - The Amazonian ecosystems of Madre de Dios (MDD) region, considered Peru's "capital of biodiversity" due to its impressive species richness, are threatened by the rapid expansion of infrastructure. The paving of the Interoceanic Highway in 2010 has brought rapid population growth and environmental degradation, threatening large-scale conservation efforts such as the Vilcabamba-Amboro Conservation Corridor (VACC). To quantify the impacts of development processes and to identify critical areas where further conservation efforts should be focused, we analyzed 20 years of land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics, drivers, and fragmentation patterns in MDD. We mapped LULC in 1993, 2003, and 2013 using Landsat imagery and modeled the proximate drivers of change related to deforestation, forest regrowth, gold mining, agriculture, and urban expansion in two time periods (1993-2003 and 2003-2013). We characterized habitat fragmentation patterns in four regional target areas. Our results show accelerated deforestation triggered by the road network spreading, mining and agriculture expansion, and population growth. LULC changes produced two contrasting spatial landscape patterns: numerous small forest fragments in the north due to agricultural expansion along the Interoceanic Highway and large continuous forest losses caused by gold mining expansion in the south. Current unplanned development in this region is threatening its outstanding biodiversity. We suggest that further conservation efforts should focus on strengthening the legal framework of the VACC, implementing a sustainable management plan for MDD, promoting agroforestry strategies along the Interoceanic Highway, and preserving smaller corridors for animal movement.

AB  - The cognizing of connectivity among small mammal populations across heterogeneous landscapes is complicated due to complex influences of landscape and anthropogenic factors on gene flow. A landscape genetics approach offers inferences on how landscape features drive population structure. Through a landscape genetics approach, we investigated influences of geographical, environmental, and anthropogenic features on populations of Apodemus agrarius, the striped field mouse, the prime vector of hemorrhagic fever by a landscape genetic approach. We identified landscape features that might affect the population structure of striped field mice by analyzing microsatellite markers of 197 striped field mice from 21 populations throughout South Korea. We developed Maximum-likelihood population effects models based on landscape distances and resistance matrices and pairwise F-ST values for meta-populations of striped field mouse. We also conducted Mantel and partial Mantel tests to investigate geographic patterns of genetic similarities. In Mantel and partial Mantel tests, the F-ST was significantly correlated with all three models of movement; movement cost, Euclidian distance and least-cost distance, although the magnitudes of correlations varied. The 4 top-ranked models included three variables; temperature, precipitation and one human disturbance factor (population). We did not attain a significant effect for anthropogenic factors on genetic similarities among populations in the Korean striped field mouse, but we confirmed a significant association for genetic similarity with climatic features (temperature and precipitation).

AB  - Forest fragmentation and the associated potential habitat loss is one of the main causes of biodiversity loss. One strategy that promotes its maintenance at a landscape scale is the establishment of biological corridors that enhance structural and functional connectivity of the biotic components. However, the applicability and functionality of this tool is limited due to the lack of planning at the moment of the design and establishment of corridors or connectivity networks that are guided by detailed and rigorous methods. In this research, we developed a theoretical proposal of ecological connectivity for the Santa Elena village, Medellin municipality, Colombia, using tools from landscape ecology. Initially, 21 forest fragments or nucleus were selected based on their minimum size (larger than 5 ha), core area (larger than 1 ha), and shape index (rounded or nearly rounded). Then, based on a friction matrix, we designed a potential network that would allow to connect 1356.35 ha of remnants forests through 31 ecological corridors of 100 m wide, comprising 208.33 ha in total. Finally, we discussed the importance of promoting this kind of strategies based on landscape ecology that enhance both habitat conservation and landscape connectivity in areas near large Latin-American cities.

AB  - Agroforestry is an alternative kind of land use where the native vegetation is surrounded or intercalated by crops of economic interest. This system may maintain species richness by promoting the habitat heterogeneity or serving as ecological corridors. The aim of this study was to describe the gastrointestinal helminth fauna and to analyse the parasitological parameters of the helminth communities of six sigmodontine rodents in a cocoa agroforestry system in the municipality of Ilheus, state of Bahia, Northeast Brazil. This is a novel study of helminth fauna in this kind of agroforestry. Rodents were captured in live-traps and euthanised for helminth recovery. Specimens were counted and identified to the species level whenever possible. Helminth abundance, intensity, and prevalence were calculated for each species and each host. The total abundance and prevalence of helminths were compared among localities and three attributes of the host: species, gender and age using generalised linear models. Considering all rodents, 52.14% of them were parasitised with at least one helminth species. Eight nematode species were identified and another seven morphospecies were identified to the genus level. The most abundant species were Hassalstrongylus epsilon, Stilestrongylus eta, Guerrerostrongylus zetta, and Syphacia alata. The opportunistic host species Oligoryzomys nigripes and Akodon cursor, besides the water rat Nectomys squamipes, were the most infected species for helminth parasites. Hylaeamys seuanezi was also an important host with the highest helminth species richness. This is the first report of the helminth fauna for this host. The locality most distant from the native vegetation and closest to the city had the highest helminth prevalence and mean species richness. The species richness in the helminth communities of Euryoryzomys russatus, N. squamipes and O. nigripes in these Cabruca agroforestries were within the range found in studies carried out in Atlantic Forest areas.

AB  - Extensive afforestation of agricultural areas has increased the importance of green corridors as a dispersal network. We tested the effect of spatiotemporal connectivity, edge effect and habitat structural quality of wooded corridors on the long-term immigration success of forest specialist plants relative to the performance of forest generalists. In agricultural landscapes of central and southern Estonia, we sampled 28 historically connected and 52 isolated tree lines and alleys with a minimum age of 50 years, and 93 edges of ancient forests. The regional pool of common forest plants was compiled using species' frequency data in 91 ancient forests. Both landscape connectivity and habitat quality affected the richness of response groups, but specialists and generalists responded to different drivers. Forest specialists required long-term neighbourhoods of ancient forest and benefited from a direct connection between forest and corridor. Habitat generalists reacted positively to the recently modified structure of the landscape. When a corridor was connected to forest, the dual edge in the corridor did not result in an increased negative edge effect on forest specialist arrival. Even if both specialists and generalists required wide corridors with optimum shade, forest specialists also benefited from mature overstorey and outward overhanging branches, whereas forest generalists used disturbance-created microhabitats. We conclude that only wooded corridors with long-term connectivity to seed source forests and widely branched tree canopies will function as a green infrastructure supporting forest-specific biodiversity.

AB  - We assessed the Kilpura-Khatima-Surai corridor area within the Terai Arc Landscape, India for tiger presence. Monitoring of tiger presence and movement was recorded by photo-captures generated by deploying camera traps in corridor area in the years of 2012 and 2014. This corridor is the only connectivity between Nandhour WLS and Pilibhit tiger reserve. A total of 17 tigers were recorded in all of the three forest ranges of the corridor assessed even utilizing the bottlenecks of the corridor, which indicates functionality of this important conduit between two bigger forest patches i.e. Nandhour wildlife sanctuary and Pilibhit tiger reserve. We highlight the importance of corridors for large mammals like tigers and elephants and discuss some key points in terms of management implications which could provide a way forward to maintain the functionality of the Kilpura Khatima Surai corridor.

AB  - Context Vehicle-strike has been identified as a key threatening process for koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) survival and persistence in Australia. Roads and traffic act as barriers to koala movement and can impact dispersal and metapopulation dynamics. Given the high cost of wildlife mitigation structures such as purpose-built fauna-specific underpasses or overpasses (eco-passages), road construction and management agencies are constantly seeking cost-effective strategies that facilitate safe passage for fauna across roads. Here we report on an array of detection methods trialled to verify use of retrofitted road infrastructure (existing water culverts or bridge underpasses) by individual koalas in fragmented urban landscapes in south-east Queensland.
   Aims The study examined whether the retrofitting of existing road structures at six sites facilitated safe passage for koalas across roads. Our primary objective was to record utilisation of retrofitted infrastructure at the level of the individual.
   Methods We used a combination of existing monitoring methods such as GPS/VHF collars, camera traps, sand plots, and RFID tags, along with a newly developed animal-borne wireless identification (WID) tag and datalogging system, specifically designed for this project, to realise the study aims.
   Key results We were able to verify 130 crossings by koalas involving a retrofitted structure or a road surface over a 30-month period by using correlated data from complementary methods. We noted that crossings were generally uncommon and mostly undertaken by only a subset of our tagged individuals at each site (21% overall).
   Conclusions An important element of this study was that crossing events could be accurately determined at the level of the individual. This allowed for detailed assessment of eco-passage usage, rather than the more usual approach of simply recording species' presence.
   Implications This study underscores the value of identifying the constraints of each individual monitoring method in relation to site conditions. It also highlights the benefits of contingency planning to limit data loss (i.e. using more than one method to collect data). We suggest an approach that uses complementary monitoring methods has significant advantages for researchers, particularly with reference to improving understanding of whether eco-passages are meeting their prescribed conservation goals.

AB  - Farming, including family farming, is now dominated by vertically controlled operations that deplete the soil, pollute water, and produce food designed more to satisfy marketing requirements than human nutritional needs. Agricultural practices today are a result of abdicating control over our lives to a thoroughly industrialized culture, in which institutions are governed by the single criterion of efficiency--finding least-cost solutions. Standardization is a major part of that process. But living systems cannot be standardized. They require diversity and some degree of redundancy to adapt to changing environmental conditions. In the cultural contest between the machine and the garden, the machine has definitely won, but if we do not make room for the garden again, our victory will be our own funeral. New Agrarianism seeks to encourage diversity of species on each farm and across farms within entire landscapes. But farmers cannot carry out the restoration of ecologically-oriented agriculture on their own. They need support from cities: 1) in the form of markets to sell locally-grown produce at prices that will support their work, 2) in a new understanding of ecosystems that focuses on inhabited spaces and not just wilderness, and 3) in an orientation that questions whether efficiency should be the paramount value of our culture. Finally, the transition to more biologically-diverse human settlements can come about only if economic incentives are modified to remove the unrelenting pressure on farmers to expand their operations or go out of business.

AB  - Cities are socioecological systems that filter and select species, therefore establishing unique species assemblages and biotic interactions. Urban ecosystems can host richer wild bee communities than highly intensified agricultural areas, specifically in resource-rich urban green spaces such as allotments and family gardens. At the same time, urban beekeeping has boomed in many European cities, raising concerns that the fast addition of a large number of managed bees could deplete the existing floral resources, triggering competition between wild bees and honeybees. Here, we studied the interplay between resource availability and the number of honeybees at local and landscape scales and how this relationship influences wild bee diversity. We collected wild bees and honeybees in a pollination experiment using four standardized plant species with distinct floral morphologies. We performed the experiment in 23 urban gardens in the city of Zurich (Switzerland), distributed along gradients of urban and local management intensity, and measured functional traits related to resource use. At each site, we quantified the feeding niche partitioning (calculated as the average distance in the multidimensional trait space) between the wild bee community and the honeybee population. Using multilevel structural equation models (SEM), we tested direct and indirect effects of resource availability, urban beekeeping, and wild bees on the community feeding niche partitioning. We found an increase in feeding niche partitioning with increasing wild bee species richness. Moreover, feeding niche partitioning tended to increase in experimental sites with lower resource availability at the landscape scale, which had lower abundances of honeybees. However, beekeeping intensity at the local and landscape scales did not directly influence community feeding niche partitioning or wild bee species richness. In addition, wild bee species richness was positively influenced by local resource availability, whereas local honeybee abundance was positively affected by landscape resource availability. Overall, these results suggest that direct competition for resources was not a main driver of the wild bee community. Due to the key role of resource availability in maintaining a diverse bee community, our study encourages cities to monitor floral resources to better manage urban beekeeping and help support urban pollinators.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation and habitat loss diminish population connectivity, reducing genetic diversity and increasing extinction risk over time. Improving connectivity is widely recommended to preserve the long-term viability of populations, but this requires accurate knowledge of how landscapes influence connectivity. Detectability of landscape effects on gene flow is highly dependent on landscape context, and drawing conclusions from single landscape studies may lead to ineffective management strategies. We present a novel approach to elucidate regional variation in the relative importance of landscape variable effects on gene flow. We demonstrate this approach by evaluating gene flow between isolated, genetically impoverished mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) populations in Washington and much larger, genetically robust populations in southern British Columbia. We used geneland to identify steep genetic gradients and then employed individual-based landscape genetics in a causal modeling framework to independently evaluate landscape variables that may be generating each of these genetic gradients. Our results support previous findings that freeways, highways, water, agriculture and urban landcover limit gene flow in this species. Additionally, we found that a previously unsupported landscape variable, distance to escape terrain, also limits gene flow in some contexts. By integrating geneland and individual-based methods we effectively identified regional limiting factors that have landscape-level implications for population viability.

AB  - The consequences of river regulation work and other human interventions from the past can still be followed and cause various effects on the Danube river, especially on the formation and state of the islands. We aimed to compile an inventory of the islands along the Hungarian Danube stretch between Venek (1797 rkm) and Budapest (1647 rkm) during the past 250 years, focusing on their landscape history. Real islands were defined as gravel bars that are permanently covered with pioneer woody vegetation, constantly surrounded by water (side-branch is not closed), and their surface remains unflooded at an average water level. We identified 123 real islands that existed on this 150 km long river stretch in the last centuries. These were real islands for a shorter or longer period between the 18th and the 21st century. A total of 66 of them existed at the same time about 200 years ago, i.e., before the large-scale water regulation works, while today this number is only 18, meaning that 73% of current potential Danube islands are at a stage of side-branch succession. Before the river regulation works, the natural successional changes of a real island occurred over hundreds of years, but today they happen rapidly. The formation of new islands became very limited compared to the past due to the lack of sediments and the altered river dynamics. In order to conserve this unique ecological corridor and green infrastructure element in the long run, and restore its damaged floodplain habitats, no more hard-tech interventions should be allowed in the fluvial system. These aspects need to be taken into consideration in decision-making processes with an integrated approach.

AB  - University campuses often contain contiguous areas of urban green space (UGS) which are otherwise scarce in large cities and, thus, may provide critical habitat for numerous species. In this study, we evaluate butterfly and plant diversity at Chiba University in Japan from five UGS types, including intensive green roofs, meadows, roadsides, open spaces. and community gardens. Surveying non-destructively every two weeks from June to November 2010, we identified 707 individual butterflies to 25 species from five families, including red-listed species (e.g. Parantica sita Kollar, 1844). However, one species, Pseudozizeeria maha Kollar, 1848, represented over 50% of all individuals surveyed. Butterflies in the family Papilionidae showed strong preference for roadside habitat, indicating the importance of 'butterfly flyways' and contiguous habitat corridors on University campuses. Butterfly richness and abundance was significantly different between UGS types and highest in the community garden and roadsides. We recorded 70 garden plant species and 117 spontaneous plant species (which grew opportunistically, without design input), of which 58% were native. Total plant richness was positively correlated with butterfly species richness, and non-native spontaneous plant species richness was positively correlated with butterfly richness, abundance, diversity, and evenness. Additionally, 76% of the spontaneous species identified were determined to be used by butterflies as larval hosts or for adult feeding. Identification of spontaneous plant species and use of selective weeding should be included in landscape management planning on campuses to promote butterflies, which can act as ambassadors for biodiversity conservation and help connect people to nature.

AB  - For a highly urbanised city, such as Sydney, there are limited opportunities for revegetation. Through consultation with councils, private landholders, community groups and State Government agencies, realistic opportunities have been identified particularly along riparian and transport corridors occurring on both public and private land. This has been made possible by the Green Web Sydney project. Green Web Sydney proposes the establishment of a green web of native vegetation to protect, conserve and enhance remaining remnant bushland in the Sydney region. Central to this plan is the establishment of habitat corridors that link fragmented patches of bushland to facilitate the movement of wildlife and natural dispersal of native plants, and the implementation of various biodiversity initiatives within Council organisations. The project encourages a consistent and cooperative approach to native vegetation management in the Sydney region. By working locally and regionally within the framework of Green Web, councils and the community will create a green web of bushland corridors, protecting remnant bushland of conservation value and thus enhance Sydney's rich biodiversity and natural heritage.

AB  - A major conservation objective of wildlife overpasses is to maintain levels of dispersal between fragmented areas of habitat, thereby allowing gene-flow and sustaining population viability of target species. We documented crossing rates of a range of avian species, of four defined species guilds, over a vegetated 15 m wide wildlife overpass in suburban Brisbane, south-eastern Queensland, Australia. The overpass spanned a 60 m wide major arterial road, and linked two areas of isolated sub-tropical eucalyptus forest. Crossing rates of these species guilds were also determined over the major road, and two other high-traffic roads, 20 and 90 m wide respectively.
   Species guilds differed markedly in their crossing rates of the overpass, and in their method of crossing. They also differed in their relative ability to cross high-traffic roads of different width. Our results indicate that, although honeyeater and large forest insectivore guilds made extensive use of the wildlife overpass as a foraging resource and as a conduit between forest areas, the conservation value of wildlife overpasses in relation to potential gene-flow lies mainly with the small insectivore species guild, predominantly with forest-dwelling species of lower bodyweight and with flight characteristics not well-suited to sustained direct flight. Differences between species within this guild may be linked to a range of inter-related factors, including flight capacity, habitat use, and evolutionary history.
   Overpasses specifically for birds have rarely, if ever, been constructed. It would, however, be relatively simple to incorporate narrow, linear strips of appropriate vegetation strata into multi-purpose overpasses to benefit these target species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Global wildlife populations are in decline, in part, due to habitat loss resulting from urbanization. Urban green roofs may mitigate such habitat loss by providing supplemental habitat for wildlife, including bats, which are more active over urban green roofs than nearby traditional roofs. To better understand bat activity over urban green roofs, we surveyed bats and arthropods on a 27,316-m(2) green roof planted with Sedum spp. in New York City from June to August 2017. We found that Lasiurus borealis (Eastern Red Bat), a species with a diet consisting mainly of moths, accounted for 88% of identified bat calls. We collected over 15,000 arthropods of 16 taxa and found that moth abundance, while a relatively small proportion of green roof arthropods, correlated positively with bat activity. Our findings suggest that urban green roofs provide useable habitat for moths and other arthropods and, consequently, bats may forage on green roofs when prey are available.

AB  - Simple Summary Accelerated urbanization has changed the composition of regional landscape patterns, directly affecting the composition of bird communities. This study analyzes bird community assembly mechanisms and the driving factors in university campuses in Nanjing, China. We found that the phylogeny of bird communities in all universities followed a pattern of aggregation. Grass, water, and buildings were the main factors affecting the campus bird communities' functional and phylogenetic diversity. Based on our results, we offer several practical measures for urban planners to better protect urban biodiversity and develop eco-friendly cities. University campuses are important components of cities, harboring the majority of urban biodiversity. In this study, based on monthly bird survey data covering 12 university campuses located either downtown or in the newly developed areas in Nanjing, China, in 2019, we studied the assembly processes of each campus's bird population and their main drivers by modeling a set of ecological and landscape determinants. Our results showed that (1) bird abundance and species diversity in the newly developed areas were significantly higher than in those downtown; (2) the phylogeny of bird communities in all universities followed a pattern of aggregation, indicating that environmental filtering played a major role in community assembly; (3) specifically, grass, water, and buildings were the main factors affecting each campus's bird community's functional and phylogenetic diversity, with the areas of grass and water habitats having a significant positive correlation with phylogenetic diversity, while the size of building areas was negatively correlated. Our results emphasize that habitat features play a decisive role in determining urban bird population diversity and community assembly processes. We suggest that increasing landscape diversity, e.g., by reasonably arranging the location and area of water bodies and grasslands and improving the landscape connectivity, could be a powerful way to maintain and promote urban bird diversity.

AB  - Urban patch colonization and species establishment within cities are restricted by the behavioural, life history and physiological attributes of colonizing species, in conjunction with environmental filtering processes at small and large spatial scales. To enhance the local biodiversity in urban greenspaces, these filtering processes need to be assessed so that greenspace design and management can guide establishment of local species pools.
   We investigated the relative importance of local and landscape-scale features on spider community assembly using a functional and taxonomic approach. Within the city of Cleveland, Ohio, USA, we established a field experiment wherein control vacant lots, urban meadows, and low- and high-diversity pocket prairies were established across eight neighbourhoods (N = 32). Spiders were sampled during June-August of 2015 and 2016 using pitfall traps and vacuums. Spider functional diversity was assessed using null models, while local and landscape drivers were analysed via canonical partial least squares and clustered image maps.
   Increased mowing was associated with lower-than-expected spider functional alpha and beta diversity in 2015. Patch isolation and percentage impervious surface increased the functional dissimilarity and taxonomic diversity of spiders in 2016, resulting in higher-than-expected overall functional alpha diversity. We also found that increasing plant height and biomass favoured spiders with large body size and decreased the abundance of small web weavers.
   Synthesis and applications. Our findings suggest that increasing the amount of impervious surface in cities will act as a strong environmental filter, producing more spatially distinct spider communities at a landscape scale. Additionally, while periodic mowing in vacant lots benefits some spider taxa, it has a negative impact on the establishment of several species, mainly larger spiders and those most sensitive to disturbance. To conserve spiders and the biota depended upon them, investment in managed greenspaces such as pocket prairies that require infrequent mowing is warranted. In doing so, cities can enhance urban biodiversity and beautify local neighbourhoods.

AB  - Site-specific and landscape traits of urban green areas have been identified as determinants for the presence/absence of bird species among urban systems. Nevertheless, most urban ecology studies have focused their research on urban park site-specific traits. ignoring the importance of landscape attributes in shaping avian communities. In this study we assessed changes in urban park bird communities related to vegetation traits, urban infrastructure, human activity, potential bird predators, and the distance to the border of Mexico City. Our results show that both site-specific and landscape variables explained bird communities diversity values. Still, the strongest relationship found in this study, with the exception of the abundance of specialist species, was with the distance from the border of the city. Relationships between bird community diversity values and the distance from the border of the city differed among bird species richness and abundances, with specialist and mutual species richness rising significantly towards the border, and mutual species abundance rising significantly towards the center of the city (see "Methods" for definitions regarding specialist and mutual species). Overall, our results show that bird species richness and composition similarity fade out as the distance from border of the city increases. Hence, results derived from this study highlight the importance of the effect that the isolation of urban parks can have on bird communities in a neotropical mega-city. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Background Management of most herbivorous small mammal species considered to be pests in Africa is still challenging partly because of the paucity of information on their biological traits that would help to manage their destructive impacts. This gap also precludes the potential for tapping species with potential food-value to improving the economy of rural communities through, for example, sustainable game farming programs in Africa. This study investigates the genetic diversity and population demography of the African Greater Cane rat (AGC), a rodent pest of crops and game species inhabiting two isolated blocks of the Eastern Arc Mountains (EAMs), Tanzania to contribute to the species management and conservation. Methodology and results We used non-invasive sampling techniques and DNA sequencing of the D-loop region of MtDNA (515bp) from 46 cane rats (Thryonomys swinderianus) samples to characterize the genetic diversity and structure of the species and potential population threats faced in natural habitats. We found 25 haplotypes:15 from Uluguru and 9 from Udzungwa mountains populations, containing 49 polymorphic regions (32 parsimoniously informative and 17 singleton sites). Haplotype diversity (range: 0.849-0.995) did not differ substantially across populations but the median haplotype diversity for Udzungwa South was overall lower than for other populations. Nucleotide diversity averaged 0.00641, 0.01528, 0.0111 and 0.01313, respectively for Udzungwa South, Udzungwa North, Uluguru Rural and Uluguru Urban, suggesting high genetic diversity within the four populations. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated significantly high genetic differences between the four populations (FST = 0.16, p = 0.00098) whereas neutrality test (FU's Fs) values were negative, indicating historical population expansion. Similarly, the Bayesian skyline analysis indicated a recent demographic expansion suggesting limited bottlenecks in the recent past in this population. Conclusions Our results show the AGC population in EAMs consists of four distinct populations which have experienced a recent population expansion, especially among the urban population due perhaps to influence of urbanization process that may have favored assisted species movements across the rural-urban landscapes. Future research should focus on understanding impact of geographical isolation on the genetic structure and diversity of this species.

AB  - Major roads cause barrier effect and fragmentation on wildlife habitats that are suitable places for feeding, mating, socializing, and hiding. Due to wildlife collisions (Wc), human-wildlife conflicts result in lost lives and loss of biodiversity. Geographical information system (GIS)-based multi criteria evaluation (MCE) methods have been successfully used in short-term planning of road networks considering wild animals. Recently, wildlife passages have been effectively utilized as road engineering structures provide quick and certain solutions for traffic safety and wildlife conservation problems. GIS-based MCE methods provide decision makers with optimum location for ecological passages based on habitat suitability models (HSMs) that classify the areas based on ecological requirements of target species. In this study, ecological passages along Motorway 52 within forested areas in Mediterranean city of Osmaniye in Turkey were evaluated. Firstly, HSM coupled with nine eco-geographic decision variables were developed based on ecological requirements of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) that were chosen as target species. Then specified decision variables were evaluated using GIS-based weighted linear combination (WLC) method to estimate movement corridors and mitigation points along the motorway. In the solution process, two linkage nodes were evaluated for eco-passages which were determined based on the leastcost movement corridor intersecting with the motorway. One of the passages was identified as a natural wildlife overpass while the other was suggested as underpass construction. The results indicated that computer-based models provide accurate and quick solutions for positioning ecological passages to reduce environmental effects of road networks on wild animals.

AB  - QuestionsHow does small linear grassland elements (paddy levees and road verges) contribute to plant diversity patterns in sites with modern or traditional management? Which factors determine small-scale plant species richness of small linear grassland elements in a Japanese agricultural landscape?
   LocationShiga Prefecture, Japan.
   MethodsAerial photos from 1963, 1985, 1995 and 2008 were used to investigate landscape changes and to measure landscape structures within a typical agricultural landscape (25km(2)). Plant diversity was investigated in ten paddy levees and ten road verges in each of four traditional (barely any land cover alterations after 1963) and five modern (almost completely changed after 1985) sites. -diversity (mean number of species per plot) and -diversity (total number of species) for all species, specialist and invasive species, respectively, were analysed in relation to site history types and landscape structures. Plot species richness was analysed in relation to site history type, patch age and width, proximity to forest and litter removal.
   ResultsIn total, 204 plant species were found, 55 species unique to traditional sites and 13 unique to modern sites. - and -diversity of paddy levees and road verges was significantly higher in traditional sites. Number of specialist species on paddy levees and number of invasive species in road verges was also higher in traditional sites. Age was the strongest predictor of plot species richness on levees; older levees supported higher species richness than younger ones. Litter removal was the strongest predictor (positive effect) of plot species richness in road verges.
   ConclusionsThese results suggest that the colonization credit of new levees in modern sites is decreasing quite rapidly as species quickly establish, approaching almost the same richness values as in traditional sites. However, long continuity of traditional management is still one of the most important contributors to plant diversity and crucial for many species. But small grassland elements can still be of great significance for preserving and enhancing plant diversity in otherwise depleted landscapes, as long as they are managed and connected throughout the landscape.

AB  - The Royal Sites have been studied and analysed from many points of view and there is an extensive bibliography regarding their historic, artistic and touristic heritage. However, their importance in the conservation of the environment, namely the conservation of soils and ecological corridors allowing the movement of animals and maintenance of biodiversity, has hardly been studied. Their high levels of protection, both as patrimony of the State and as ecological areas, have helped to preserve these natural landscapes even in areas close to big cities. In this paper we will analyse the importance that the Royal Sites, located in the northwest of the Autonomous Community of Madrid and in areas nearby in the Province of Segovia, have had in the conservation of the soils.

AB  - Native bees are declining in many regions, often associated with loss of natural habitat. Urbanisation replaces natural vegetation with a highly-modified landscape, where residential gardens are a major component of urban greenspace. While many cities retain native vegetation remnants within the urban matrix, these are often small, isolated and degraded. However, there is little empirical evidence on the capacity of residential gardens to provide equivalent or beneficial habitat for native bees, and which local and landscape factors influence bee assemblages. We surveyed bee assemblages in the southwest Australian biodiversity hotspot at seven residential gardens and seven bushland remnants over two years. We recorded 153 species/morphospecies of native bees. Native bees were more abundant in bushland remnants than residential gardens. Abundance of the introduced honeybee Apis mellifera was generally high, and did not differ between habitats. Bushland remnants hosted more species, and rare and unique species, than did residential gardens. Native bee body-size and nesting guilds varied in their response to habitat type. Native bee abundance and richness increased with abundance of native plant species, but decreased with total flower species richness. Native bee species richness was negatively impacted by urbanisation (built space and isolation from bushland reserves). There were no significant relationships between honeybee abundance and local and landscape factors. Our study demonstrates that while residential gardens can host native bees, urban bushland remnants harbour a more comprehensive suite of species and are key for the conservation of native bee populations.

AB  - The impacts of urban growth on biodiversity vary according to the form and the intensity of urbanisation. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the consequences of the type of urban structure (e.g. mono centric vs polycentric), the shape of urban boundaries, the local density of residential development, on the habitats of wildlife species. In this context, this paper focuses on the relationship between forms of urbanisation and functional connectivity of ecological habitats. In the urban region of Besancon (eastern France), three emblematic protected species were selected to represent forest mammals. From the initial state describing current land cover, five prospective residential development scenarios were simulated, corresponding to the form currently most commonly found (e.g. compact development, transit-oriented development, polycentric development). For each scenario, we also simulate the volume of traffic on the road network to allow for the barrier effect of roads on habitat connectivity. Then, for each development scenario, we model the functional connectivity of habitats of the various target species using landscape graphs. Results show that compact city maintains more functional connectivity for all the species considered whereas urban sprawl leads to much more marked impacts. Moderately compact and regulated periurban scenarios have intermediate levels of impact. The transit-oriented development scenario produces specific impact values according to the species. An interesting point is that the decline in functional connectivity of forest habitats is more due to increased traffic than residential development proper. This outlines the relevance of integrated models for simulating both land use and transport at a fine scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Given current urbanization trends, understanding the factors that affect local biodiversity is paramount for designing sound management practices. Existing evidence suggests that the assembly of urban communities is influenced by the environmental filtering of organisms based on their traits. Here, we investigate how environmental characteristics including isolation measurements affect the functional composition of avian assemblages in green spaces of Merida, Mexico, a Neotropical city. We sampled 22 sites, analyzed point-count data collected during fall migration, and characterized the habitat with regard to floristic and structural vegetation attributes, vegetation cover within green spaces, urban infrastructure, and isolation. We assessed the relationship between habitat descriptors and bird functional traits using RLQ and fourth-corner tests and compared trait-environment associations between resident and wintering species. Our results showed that functional composition of resident bird assemblages was linked to the environmental characteristics of the site, while the functional composition of wintering species was not. In particular, the degree of isolation revealed to be an important determinant of trait composition. Plant species richness, particularly native tree and shrub species, were critical for the functional composition of resident birds in green spaces. Our findings suggested shifts in body mass from less to more isolated green spaces. Specifically, we observed that large-bodied species predominated in isolated green spaces. This information is useful given the predicted increases in habitat isolation and transformation of green spaces due to urbanization.

AB  - Understanding the factors that influence the characteristics of avian communities using urban parks at both the patch and landscape level is important to focus management effort towards enhancing bird diversity. Here, we investigated this issue during the breeding season across urban parks in Beijing, China, using high-resolution satellite imagery. Fifty-two bird species were recorded across 29 parks. Analysis of residence type of birds showed that passengers were the most prevalent (37%), indicating that Beijing is a major node in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. Park size was crucial for total species abundance, but foliage height diversity was the most important factor influencing avian species diversity. Thus, optimizing the configuration of vertical vegetation structure in certain park areas is critical for supporting avian communities in urban parks. Human visitation also showed negative impact on species diversity. At the landscape level, the percentage of artificial surface and largest patch index of woodland in the buffer region significantly affected total species richness, with insectivores and granivores being more sensitive to the landscape pattern of the buffer region. In conclusion, urban birds in Beijing are influenced by various multi-scale factors; however, these effects vary with different feeding types.

AB  - In the context of conservation biology, we have searched for the most influential characteristics of urban parks on ecological diversity. In this study, therefore, we studied the ant community of 24 parks in two cities of Southern Spain (Cordoba and Seville). In total, 46 species were found. Abundant and widely distributed species were synanthropic ones, such as Lasius grandis, Pheidole pallidula or Tapinoma nigerrimum, and exotic species such as Cardiocondyla mauritanica. However some parks also harbored natural habitat-preferring species. Park size, shape and distance to city outskirts were the most important predictors of species richness and diversity. Likewise, park age influenced the composition of the ant fauna.

AB  - Loss of natural forests by forest clearcutting has been identified as a critical conservation challenge worldwide. This study addressed forest fragmentation and loss in the context of the establishment of a functional green infrastructure as a spatiotemporally connected landscape-scale network of habitats enhancing biodiversity, favorable conservation status, and ecosystem services. Through retrospective analysis of satellite images, we assessed a 50- to 60-year spatiotemporal clearcutting impact trajectory on natural and near-natural boreal forests across a sizable and representative region from the Gulf of Bothnia to the Scandinavian Mountain Range in northern Fennoscandia. This period broadly covers the whole forest clearcutting period; thus, our approach and results can be applied to comprehensive impact assessment of industrial forest management. The entire study region covers close to 46,000 km(2) of forest-dominated landscape in a late phase of transition from a natural or near-natural to a land-use modified state. We found a substantial loss of intact forest, in particular of large, contiguous areas, a spatial polarization of remaining forest on regional scale where the inland has been more severely affected than the mountain and coastal zones, and a pronounced impact on interior forest core areas. Salient results were a decrease in area of the largest intact forest patch from 225,853 to 68,714 ha in the mountain zone and from 257,715 to 38,668 ha in the foothills zone, a decrease from 75% to 38% intact forest in the inland zones, a decrease in largest patch core area (assessed by considering 100-m patch edge disturbance) from 6114 to 351 ha in the coastal zone, and a geographic imbalance in protected forest with an evident predominance in the mountain zone. These results demonstrate profound disturbance of configuration of the natural forest landscape and disrupted connectivity, which challenges the establishment of functional green infrastructure. Our approach supports the identification of forests for expanded protection and conservation-oriented forest landscape restoration.

AB  - The goal of the present study was to assess which variables influence the distribution of birds in urban parks. Twenty parks were studied in a city on the Spanish high plateau during the breeding season, and relationships among park characteristics, bird richness, and individual bird presences were established. The park area and tree cover accounted for 73.1% of the variation in bird richness. Although area size was the best predictor of species richness (65% of the variation), some species did not seem to be related to this variable but rather to others, such as vegetation and the degree of park isolation with respect to other areas. Contrary to what is normally expected, the distance from our parks to the river did not influence their bird species richness.

AB  - On 25 April 1998, the mineral waste retaining wall at the Swedish-owned pyrite mine at Aznalcollar (Seville, Spain) burst, 2 causing the most harmful environmental and socio-economic disaster in the history of the River Guadiamar basin. The damage was so great that the regional government decided in May 1998 to finance a comprehensive, multidisciplinary research initiative with the objective of eradicating or at least minimising all of the negative social, economic and environmental impacts. This paper utilises a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis to identify eight strategic measures aimed at providing policymakers with key guidelines on implementing a sustainable development model, in a broad sense. Empirical evidence, though, reveals that, to date, major efforts to tackle the negative impacts have centred on environmental concerns and that the socio-economic consequences have not been completely mitigated.

AB  - Ponds and the adjacent green spaces are an important part of urban blue-green Infrastructure (BGI) and contribute to a number of ecosystem services, including alleviation of flood risk, amelioration of climatic fluctuations, and improvement of runoff water quality, as well as biodiversity and amenity values. Multiple benefits associated with urban ponds have only recently started to be appreciated, and examples of in-depth interdisciplinary insights remain rare. This paper gives an account of the ecosystem services provided by Blackford Pond, a semi-natural water body located within a nature reserve and nominated as a site globally important for scientific research. Despite elevated levels of polluting substances and eutrophication, the overall species richness of the site is high and the biodiversity of the locality is enhanced by the ecotone effect. The diversity of available plant hosts and substrates appears to benefit the fungal community and the abundance of aquatic invertebrate fauna appears to benefit the higher trophic levels. Hydrological modelling clearly shows that the pond increases the flood resilience of the surrounding area, despite not having been designed as a drainage feature. The application of the Natural Capital Planning Tool (NCPT) also reveals higher values (in relation to the values of amenity grassland) of such ecosystem services categories as biodiversity (+4.76 per hectare), aesthetic values (+4.67), flood risk regulation (+0.41), air quality (+0.28), local (+0.6) and global (+0.14) climate regulations. The discussion highlights a number of trade-offs among different ecosystem services (e.g. water quality vs. diatom research value, flood resilience vs. air quality and carbon capture, biodiversity of ectomycorrhizal vs. lichenised fungi), and considers which of the multiple benefits provided by the site may have not been fully reflected in NCPT calculations or the economic estimates obtained using contingent valuation (e.g. effects on hydrology, water quality, wildlife corridors, education and research value). The simultaneous consideration of biodiversity, hydrology, water chemistry and amenity, education, research and other values presented in this paper contributes towards a better understanding of the ecology and overall functioning of urban ponds, and helps to increase appreciation of their benefits and promote their public acceptability and further implementation.

AB  - Urban insect communities are structured by hierarchical filters including regional processes, human facilitation, and species interactions. We sought to inform future urban conservation endeavors by identifying how landscape composition and configuration as well as the management of vacant lot greenspaces affect native lady beetle (Coccinellidae) community structure within the city of Cleveland, Ohio, USA. We found no effect of habitat treatment on native lady beetle abundance when comparing vacant lots seeded with native wildflowers and those with naturally occurring weedy vegetation mown monthly or annually. Nonetheless, establishing conservation plantings that vary in plant height, biomass, and bloom abundance could aid in supporting a greater richness of coccinellid species, as these variables had differential effects on the abundance of fungivorous and aphidophagous feeding guilds. Further, we found that vacant lots embedded within landscapes with increased impervious surface and a high degree of greenspace isolation contained fewer aphidophagous native and exotic lady beetles. Our findings suggest that landscape context is a critical consideration when aiming to utilize vacant land as conservation habitat for coccinellids. Given their large holdings of vacant land, shrinking cities offer a unique opportunity to incorporate landscape-scale planning into future sustainable development initiatives. For instance, with over 27,000 vacant lots, the city of Cleveland could aid lady beetle conservation by electing to maintain vacant lots that promote greenspace connectivity while targeting isolated lots within intact neighborhoods for new residential development.

AB  - Identifying how natural (i.e., unaltered by human activity) and anthropogenic landscape variables influence contemporary functional connectivity in terrestrial organisms can elucidate the genetic consequences of environmental change. We examine population genetic structure and functional connectivity among populations of a declining species, the Blainville's horned lizard (Phrynosoma blainvillii), in the urbanized landscape of the Greater Los Angeles Area in Southern California, USA. Using single nucleotide polymorphism data, we assessed genetic structure among populations occurring at the interface of two abutting evolutionary lineages, and at a fine scale among habitat fragments within the heavily urbanized area. Based on the ecology of P. blainvillii, we predicted which environmental variables influence population structure and gene flow and used gravity models to distinguish among hypotheses to best explain population connectivity. Our results show evidence of admixture between two evolutionary lineages and strong population genetic structure across small habitat fragments. We also show that topography, microclimate, and soil and vegetation types are important predictors of functional connectivity, and that anthropogenic disturbance, including recent fire history and urban development, are key factors impacting contemporary population dynamics. Examining how natural and anthropogenic sources of landscape variation affect contemporary population genetics is critical to understanding how to best manage sensitive species in a rapidly changing landscape.

AB  - Orchid bees (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Euglossini) are important pollinators of many plant families in Neotropical forests, habitats that have become increasingly degraded and fragmented by agricultural practices. To understand the extent to which loss of natural habitat and isolation has affected the genetic diversity and diploid male production (DMP) of two orchid bee species, Euglossa dilemma and Euglossa viridissima, we collected and genotyped 1686 males at five microsatellite loci and tested for differences in allelic richness, heterozygosity and DMP across three different types of land use (natural, agricultural and urban) and between mainland and island populations in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. We also investigated the impact of land use and geographic isolation on gene flow. Euglossa dilemma and E. viridissima seemed to be particularly resilient to loss of natural habitat; in locations with human impact, we did not find reduced genetic diversity, and populations generally showed very little population genetic structure. Only on islands did E. dilemma show significantly reduced genetic diversity. Even after accounting for putative null alleles, DMP was very low (0.2-1.3%) across all sampling sites, including on islands. We therefore suggest that DMP is an insensitive measure of inbreeding and population decline in our two study species.

AB  - Although habitat fragmentation is recognized as a primary threat to biodiversity, the effects of urban development on genetic population structure vary among species and landscapes and are not yet well understood. Here we use non-invasive genetic sampling to compare the effects of fragmentation by major roads and urban development on levels of dispersal, genetic diversity, and relatedness between paired bobcat populations in replicate landscapes in coastal southern California. We hypothesized that bobcat populations in sites surrounded by urbanization would experience reduced functional connectivity relative to less isolated nearby populations. Our results show that, bobcat genetic population structure is affected by roads and development but not always as predicted by the degree that these landscape features surround fragments. Instead, we suggest that urban development may affect functional connectivity between bobcat populations more by limiting the number and genetic diversity of source populations of migrants than by creating impermeable barriers to dispersal.

AB  - Rapid economic development has accelerated urbanisation and biodiversity loss in Southeast Asia. Studies of urban ecology have suggested urban parks can be effective refuges for wildlife in temperate regions, but their effectiveness as refuges in rapidly urbanising tropical regions is understudied. We examined the species diversity of butterflies in urban parks in the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur and investigated the relationships between butterfly species richness and three park variables: i) park size, ii) distance from the central business district and iii) park age. Standardised butterfly sampling was conducted across different microhabitat types at each park: i) groves, ii) hedges, iii) flowerbeds and iv) unmanaged areas. We recorded 572 butterflies belonging to 60 species (97 % considered common) from five families. Although species richness was positively correlated with park size and age and negatively correlated with distance from the central business district; the correlations were weak and not statistically significant. However, species richness of host-specialist species was significantly positively correlated with park size and age. The highest species richness (65 % of observed species) was recorded in the unmanaged microhabitat. It is likely that both park planting scheme and the presence of early successional plants in unmanaged microhabitat led to highest butterfly species richness in parks that contained all four microhabitat types. Whether a diverse planting scheme and increased size and number of unmanaged areas in urban parks can improve the ability of parks to sustain populations of rare butterflies in the face of future urbanisation remains to be seen.

AB  - Conservationists are calling for bold strategies to connect wildlands and halt extinctions. A growing number of scientists recommend that 50% of all land must be held in a protected area network to maintain biodiversity. We assessed lands adjacent to the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) and Continental Divide Trail (CDT) as possible wildlife corridors connecting protected areas in the American West. We evaluated the connectivity, wildness, and biodiversity values of the lands of each corridor and determined the conservation and land management status. We found that our corridors connect 95 protected areas creating two linear protected area chains from Mexico to Canada. Both the PCT and CDT corridors follow many of the best corridor routes previously found in the literature and hold high wildland conservation values. The American public already owns the majority of land units around the modeled PCT (88%) and CDT (90%) corridor. Therefore, we recommend further analysis of the lands adjacent to recreational trails as wildlife corridors. Employing our methodology on multiple scales could reveal that other recreational trails should be buffered and conserved for wildlife movement.

AB  - Background Habitat loss, fragmentation and decrease of habitat quality caused by urbanization have led to a dramatic decline in biodiversity worldwide. For highly urbanized areas, parks have become "islands" or habitat fragments for wildlife. As an important indicator group of urban ecosystem health, the response of birds to urbanization has attracted the global attention of ecologists. Understanding the key factors affecting bird diversity in urbanized environment is crucial to the protection of biodiversity in urban ecosystems. Methods We used the line-transect method to survey birds in 37 urban parks in Nanjing, China. We also measured a number of park characteristics (area, isolation, shape index, environmental noise, distance to city center, and habitat diversity) that are commonly assumed to influence bird diversity. We then used the information-theoretic multi-model inference approach to determine which park characteristics had significant impacts on bird species richness. Results We found that park area, habitat diversity and the distance to city center were the best positive predictors of bird species richness in Nanjing urban parks. By contrast, park isolation, park shape and environmental noise had little or no influence on bird diversity. Conclusions Our study highlights the importance of park area, habitat diversity and the distance to city center in determining bird diversity in Nanjing city parks. Therefore, from a conservation viewpoint, we recommend that large parks with complex and diverse habitats far away from the city center should be retained or constructed to increase bird diversity in urban design and planning.

AB  - Urbanization and habitat fragmentation have the potential to influence bird communities. In addition, these phenomena, as well as ongoing lethal control measures, have also greatly reduced the range of the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) since the beginning of the 20th century. Although prairie dogs are highly interactive species that can influence avian communities, few studies have investigated whether these interactions persist in urban settings. Our goal was to investigate the relative impacts of habitat fragmentation and prairie dogs on bird communities within an urban matrix. We performed bird surveys on 20 habitat fragments (10 colonized by prairie dogs, 10 uncolonized by prairie dogs) distributed throughout the Denver metropolitan area, and calculated Shannon-Weiner diversity and richness of all birds and native species, as well as total counts of grassland birds and raptors. Diversity, richness, and counts of many species increased with increasing fragment connectivity, and decreased on fragments isolated for longer periods of time. Avian diversity and richness did not differ between fragments with and without prairie dogs, suggesting that this element of the ecological role of prairie dogs is not fully retained in urban habitat. Future studies of the role of prairie dogs as keystone species in urban systems should include other taxa as well as consider the influence of the urban matrix surrounding prairie dog habitat. Our results emphasize that conservation of urban avian diversity should focus on landscape connectivity as well as local habitat features.

AB  - Landscape changes due to urban expansion may severely influence urban biodiversity through direct and indirect effects. Hence, a comprehensive understanding of the urban expansion effects on species diversity is essential for conservation biologists, urban planners, and policymakers to help design more practical and effective conservation strategies. Here, based on monthly bird survey data of 12 university campuses distributed in the center and the Xianlin university town of Nanjing city, we first compared the differences of the campuses bird species richness, Shannon-Wiener, and Simpson indices. Then, we analyzed the effects of a variety of landscape attributes on the campuses bird species richness. Unlike other studies, we also constructed a 2 km buffer area surrounding each campus and analyzed the effects of the landscape attributes of the buffer area on species richness. We found that bird species richness was higher in the campus of Xianlin compared to those in the center. Landscape attributes played an important role on bird species richness, especially for the determinants in the buffer area. Specifically, species richness, Shannon-Wiener, and Simpson indices increased with the increasing area of water and green space both within the campus and the buffer area. Not surprisingly, bird species richness and diversity were more affected by fragmentation of the buffer area, increasing with the aggregation index and decreasing with the splitting index. Our study emphasized that landscape attributes of both campuses and buffer areas determined bird species richness and diversity, offering several practical implications for urban biodiversity maintenance and eco-friendly urban planning.

AB  - Urbanization is a global phenomenon with profound effects on the ecology and evolution of organisms. We examined the relative roles of natural selection, genetic drift and gene flow in influencing the evolution of white clover (Trifolium repens), which thrives in urban and rural areas. Trifolium repots exhibits a Mendelian polymorphism for the production of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), a potent antiherbivore defence. We quantified the relative frequency of HCN in 490 populations sampled along urban-rural transects in 20 cities. We also characterized genetic variation within 120 populations in eight cities using 16 microsatellite loci. HCN frequency increased by 0.6% for every kilometre from an urban centre, and the strength of this relationship did not significantly vary between cities. Populations did not exhibit changes in genetic diversity with increasing urbanization, indicating that genetic drift is unlikely to explain urban-rural clines in HCN frequency. Populations frequently exhibited isolation-by-distance and extensive gene flow along most urban-rural transects, with the exception of a single city that exhibited genetic differentiation between urban and rural populations. Our results show that urbanization repeatedly drives parallel evolution of an ecologically important trait across many cities that vary in size, and this evolution is best explained by urban-rural gradients in natural selection.

AB  - Background: Urbanization is a major cause of habitat fragmentation worldwide. Ecological and conservation theory predicts many potential impacts of habitat fragmentation on natural populations, including genetic impacts. Habitat fragmentation by urbanization causes populations of animals and plants to be isolated in patches of suitable habitat that are surrounded by non-native vegetation or severely altered vegetation, asphalt, concrete, and human structures. This can lead to genetic divergence between patches and in turn to decreased genetic diversity within patches through genetic drift and inbreeding.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We examined population genetic patterns using microsatellites in four common vertebrate species, three lizards and one bird, in highly fragmented urban southern California. Despite significant phylogenetic, ecological, and mobility differences between these species, all four showed similar and significant reductions in gene flow over relatively short geographic and temporal scales. For all four species, the greatest genetic divergence was found where development was oldest and most intensive. All four animals also showed significant reduction in gene flow associated with intervening roads and freeways, the degree of patch isolation, and the time since isolation.
   Conclusions/Significance: Despite wide acceptance of the idea in principle, evidence of significant population genetic changes associated with fragmentation at small spatial and temporal scales has been rare, even in smaller terrestrial vertebrates, and especially for birds. Given the striking pattern of similar and rapid effects across four common and widespread species, including a volant bird, intense urbanization may represent the most severe form of fragmentation, with minimal effective movement through the urban matrix.

AB  - Urbanization is a global process that negatively affects ecosystems in various ways. It is namely an important cause of habitat loss, and animal species inhabiting cities often exhibit highly fragmented populations. Those populations may be prone to problems associated with reduced abundance and isolation such as genetic drift and inbreeding. However, few studies have dealt with animal populations living in cities. In this paper, we assessed the genetic structure of urban red-backed salamander populations located in remnant forested areas within a major city (Montreal) and on two nearby islands. Microsatellite analysis revealed a high degree of genetic differentiation among populations from Montreal and from neighboring islands. Within Montreal island, no clear genetic structure was detected, with some populations as far as 35 km apart not being differentiated. On the other hand, genetic differentiation was observed at a small spatial scale (0.7-1.7 km) for three populations located near downtown area where anthropogenic perturbations are older. We believe these populations had very low effective population size for a long time, allowing for fast genetic drift and subsequent population differentiation. Although no inbreeding was detected in any population, genetic variation was relatively low. These results illustrate the importance of preserving large forested areas within cities, especially given that these patches may also harbor rarer and threatened species which may be even more negatively affected by urbanization.

AB  - Whether urban parks can maintain viable and self-sustaining populations over the long term is questionable. In highly urbanized landscapes, urban parks could play a role in biodiversity conservation by providing habitat and resources to native species. However, populations inhabiting urban parks are usually small and isolated, leading to increased demographic stochasticity and genetic drift, with expected negative consequences on their viability. Here, we investigated a European red squirrel population located in an urban park close to Paris, France (Parc de Sceaux; 184 ha) to assess its viability. Using mitochondrial D-loop sequences and 13 microsatellite loci, we showed that the population presented high levels of genetic variation and no evidence of inbreeding. The size of the population was estimated at 100-120 individuals based on the comparison of two census techniques, Distance Sampling and Capture-Mark-Recapture. The estimated heterozygosity level and population size were integrated in a Population Viability Analysis to project the likelihood of the population's persistence over time. Results indicate that the red squirrel population of this urban park can be viable on the long term (i.e. 20 years) for a range of realistic demographic parameters (juvenile survival at least >40%) and immigration rates (at least one immigration event every two years). This study highlights that urban parks can be potential suitable refuges for the red squirrel, a locally threatened species across western European countries, provided that ecological corridors are maintained.

AB  - In many cities worldwide, urbanization is leading to the rapid and extensive fragmentation of native vegetation into small and scattered urban remnants. We investigated the effects of fragmentation on plant species richness and abundance in 30 remnant Banksia woodlands in the rapidly expanding city of Perth, located in the southwestern Australian global biodiversity hotspot. We considered a comprehensive set of factors characterizing landscape fragmentation dynamics (current and historical remnant area and connectivity, time since isolation, and trajectories of landscape change), disturbance regimes (fire frequency, grazing, and intensity of human activities), and local environmental conditions (soil nutrient status and litter depth). We used generalized linear mixed models to determine the interactive effects of time since remnant isolation and remnant area on plant species richness, and structural equation models to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of landscape and local factors on plant species richness and abundance. Fragmentation impacts were most rapid in smaller remnants. Indeed, in the small remnants, native plant species richness was halved in only a few decades after isolation, suggesting an underlying rapid loss of habitat quality. We found that richness and abundance of woody species were higher in historically large remnants and lower in the rural areas, despite these rural remnants showing greater connectivity. Richness of native herbaceous species declined with time since isolation, mainly in the smaller remnants, and this was associated with altered soil properties. Furthermore, increased litter depth (possibly indicating higher productivity) and increased abundance of nonnative herbaceous species in the older and smaller remnants was associated with a decline in the abundance of native herbaceous species. Our study suggests that in rapidly expanding cities, landscape fragmentation can have major and complex effects on remnant vegetation. Yet these impacts might take several decades to manifest themselves. Hence, understanding the long-term conservation capacity of newly formed remnants, which is key to setting conservation priorities, requires consideration of landscape fragmentation and land use history. Moreover, the smaller and older remnants may already display changes due to fragmentation, providing clues for urban planning and ecosystem management that help to protect urban remnant plant diversity.

AB  - Microreserves may be useful in protecting native arthropod diversity in urbanized landscapes. However, species that do not disperse through the urban matrix may eventually be lost from these fragments. Population extinctions may be precipitated by an increase in genetic differentiation among fragments and loss of genetic diversity within fragments, and these effects should become stronger with time. We analyzed population genetic structure in the dispersal limited Jerusalem cricket Stenopelmatus n. sp. "santa monica" in the Santa Monica Mountains and Simi Hills north of Los Angeles, California (CA), to determine the impacts of fragmentation over the past 70 years. MtDNA divergence was greater among urban fragments than within contiguous habitat and was positively correlated with fragment age. MtDNA genetic diversity within fragments increased with fragment size and decreased with fragment age. Genetic divergence across 38 anonymous nuclear Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) loci was influenced by the presence of major highways and highway age, but there was no effect of additional urban fragmentation. ISSR diversity was not correlated with fragment size or age. Differing results between markers may be due to male-biased dispersal, or different effective population sizes, sorting rates, or mutation rates among sampled genes. Results suggest that genetic connectivity among populations has been disrupted by highways and urban development, prior to declines in local population sizes. We emphasize that genetic connectivity can rapidly erode in fragmented landscapes and that flightless arthropods can serve as sensitive indicators for these effects.

AB  - A regional greenway network is proposed to reconnect ecologically the fragmented landscapes of south Florida. The natural landscapes of the region have been progressively fragmented on account of agricultural and urban development. It is proposed that the regional system of drainage canals and reservoir levees, which was originally developed to facilitate agriculture and urbanization, be ecologically reclaimed and managed to become a network of environmental restoration and cultural opportunity for south Florida. The existing regional system of drainage canals and reservoir levees is restrictively underutilized. Tn general, the value of utility and transportation corridors as natural and cultural resources has not been fully appreciated in south Florida. Their value as resources lies in the ample opportunity they offer for landscape revegetation, wetland reclamation, habitat restoration, and community education and recreation, In particular, the existing regional system of drainage canals and reservoir levees represents an extensive resource that can naturally and culturally link the fragmented landscapes of south Florida while maintaining flood control and water conservation.
   A tripartite method, based on the ecological principles of island biogeography theory and landscape network theory, is used to consider the geographical, morphological, and topological impact on natural diversity and cultural use. Respectively, the effects of network corridor area, network corridor width, and network connectivity and circuitry are described, analyzed, and evaluated for their potential effect on natural diversity and cultural use along the existing regional system of drainage canals and reservoir levees. Results indicate that the proposed regional greenway network is characterized by a large area, broad extent, morphological diversity, and topological connectivity. Variation in greenway structure and function along the regional network can accommodate a multitude of environmental concerns and cultural needs faced by the region. The regional greenway network affords ample flexibility, with three types of corridors (line, strip, and stream) within four types of context (urban, suburban, rural, and natural). Recommendations are made to appraise opportunities further at the regional level, conduct ecological corridor research at the landscape scale, and develop a greenway prototype at a specific community site.

AB  - The Emerald Ash Borer (EAB), Agrilus plaipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) was introduced to North America more than two decades ago and has spread despite management efforts in both the United States and Canada. The insect kills most species of ash tree (Fraxinus sp.) and its management imposes costs to plant health protection agencies, forest industry, private landowners and municipalities. The United States Department of Agriculture - Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) has deemed existing regulation efforts in the United States to be ineffective and has removed federal regulations designed to limit the spread of EAB. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is also trying to determine if continued regulation of EAB in Canada is worthwhile. Here we show that the benefits of slowing the spread of EAB via regulation are likely greater than the costs of implementing regulation if it is minimally effective (i.e. more than 25% effective at preventing anthropogenic spread). To evaluate the economic efficiency of existing Canadian EAB regulations, we examined trade-offs between the monetary benefits of regulation and the costs of regulation. Specifically, we simulated the spread of EAB under various levels of regulation effectiveness and estimated the timing of EAB arrival and associated ash mortality in urban and rural settings. Delaying ash mortality via regulation also delays management costs, a benefit to ash tree owners/users. Our findings suggest that an economic justification to continue regulating the insect exists based on monetary costs alone. The net present value of regulation (benefits less costs) is estimated to range between $23 million to $240 million, depending on the level of regulation effectiveness. Additional environmental and social benefits not addressed here would likely increase the value of EAB regulation but appear unneeded to justify such efforts on allocative efficiency grounds.

AB  - Wastewater collection systems greatly contribute to the cost of the overall municipal sewerage system; a cost-effective design of the collection system will provide significant savings towards the cost of wastewater services. It is impossible to evaluate the full impact that each pipe size and slope would have on the overall cost of the collection system with intuitive designs. However, these solutions generally satisfy the design objectives within the given constraints. A survey of the literature indicates that various optimisation techniques are being applied for least-cost solutions. In general these approaches provide continuous pipe sizes, which are converted to closest commercial sizes for adoption, which would heavily dilute the optimal outcome. Search methods are also adopted to obtain cost-effective design solutions using directly commercial pipe sizes, which are computationally expensive. In the design of a sewerage system, a sewer line is a basic unit occurring repeatedly in the design-process and finally the combinations of these basic units formulate the complete sewer system. However, the branch sewer lines, main sewers, trunk sewers, pumping stations, treatment plant and outfall sewers are in general the main components of an urban wastewater collection, treatment and disposal systems. A method has been developed to optimise this basic unit using Linear Programming technique without transforming nonlinear objective function or constraint equations into linear functions and incorporating commercially available pipe sizes directly in the problem formulation. The current research area of optimal sewer system design is focusing equally on economic considerations and hydraulic feasibility and moving away from conventional design guidelines based on only self cleaning velocity concepts for node to node sewer link hydraulic design. This paper is a step forward in developing optimal design approaches of sewer systems. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban expansion is a pervasive driver of biodiversity loss. To understand the effects of urbanization on diversity, we investigated the response of bird taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity to urban green spaces' characteristics in thirty-one green spaces of Mexico City. Selected sites encompassed variation of environmental factors along a transformation gradient, from natural protected areas to landscaped parks. Bird observations were conducted during winter (non-breeding season), spring (dry breeding season), and summer (wet breeding season). We used multi-model inference to assess the relationship of green space area, shape, isolation, tree richness, habitat diversity, and vegetation cover with species richness, Faith's phylogenetic diversity, and functional richness. We calculated standardized effect sizes from null models to assess phylogenetic and functional structure. We registered 91 species belonging to 28 families across all sites and seasons. The number of detected species was largest in winter and decreased toward the dry breeding season, and then toward the wet breeding season. We found a moderate to strong positive relationship of species richness with phylogenetic diversity and functional richness. Overall, phylogenetic and functional structure of bird communities in green spaces was neither clustered nor over-dispersed. However, few cases of functional clustering, phylogenetic clustering, or both were observed, and they corresponded to natural protected areas. Results showed a predominant role of green space area in determining community diversity and phylogenetic structure while it did not influence functional structure. Contrary to our predictions, habitat diversity had a negative effect on species richness and phylogenetic diversity and this effect was detected only during the wet breeding season, whereas isolation showed a positive relationship with phylogenetic and functional structure, during the wet breeding season and winter, respectively. This study emphasizes the use of complementary measures of diversity together with the comparison between observed and expected values to get a better insight into the mechanisms by which green spaces' characteristics affect bird diversity across the seasons.

AB  - Phaedranassa schizantha (Amaryllidaceae) is an endangered species endemic to Ecuador and two varieties have been described: P. schizantha var. schizantha and P. schizantha var. ignea. We assessed population genetic structure and demographic patterns in 11 populations across the range of the species using 13 microsatellite loci. Our data show that genetic diversity was generally lower in the southern part of the range and was especially low in populations closest to cities. We found significant population differentiation (F-ST=0.14, D-EST=0.34) and evidence of a genetic bottleneck. Genetic variation did not show isolation by distance. Instead, results suggest genetic barriers around two main cities. Bayesian analysis identified two genetic groups, neither of which represents either of the two varieties previously recognized. Coalescent analysis indicates a relatively recent colonization pattern between the two genetic groups (<3000 generations). Conservation efforts need to be taken to facilitate genetic exchange between the groups, especially between locations that seem to be genetically isolated.

AB  - Green roofs, which have become mandatory on new flat-topped buildings in many cities, increase habitat connectivity for wildlife and have contributed to a boom in urban beekeeping. The ecological benefits or risks of green roofs for wild bees (bee species other than the domesticated honey bee, Apis mellifera), however, have not been comprehensively analyzed. We therefore reviewed studies on insects caught on green roofs in Asia, Europe, or North America between 1992 and early 2017 and extracted information on wild bees. The resulting species list includes 236 Apidae identified in 35 studies, with thermophilic species probably overrepresented because roofs provide warm and dry habitats. The percentage of cavity-nesting bees on roofs is higher than that on nearby ground, while the percentage of pollen specialists is lower. Data are almost completely lacking on the reproductive success of bees on green roofs, the effect of roof age on bee diversity, and the genetic or demographic benefits of increased habitat connectivity. Our list of the bee species so far reported on green roofs will help in the selection and implementation of suitable soils, nesting aids, and plantings.

AB  - This study sought to identify critical areas for puma (Puma concolor) movement across the state of Arizona in the American Southwest and to identify those most likely to be impacted by current and future human land uses, particularly expanding urban development and associated increases in traffic volume. Human populations in this region are expanding rapidly, with the potential for urban centers and busy roads to increasingly act as barriers to demographic and genetic connectivity of large-bodied, wide-ranging carnivores such as pumas, whose long-distance movements are likely to bring them into contact with human land uses and whose low tolerance both for and from humans may put them at risk unless opportunities for safe passage through or around human-modified landscapes are present. Brownian bridge movement models based on global positioning system collar data collected during bouts of active movement and linear mixed models were used to model habitat quality for puma movement; then, a wall-to-wall application of circuit theory models was used to produce a continuous statewide estimate of connectivity for puma movement and to identify pinch points, or bottlenecks, that may be most at risk of impacts from current and future traffic volume and expanding development. Rugged, shrub- and scrub-dominated regions were highlighted as those offering high quality movement habitat for pumas, and pinch points with the greatest potential impacts from expanding development and traffic, although widely distributed, were particularly prominent to the north and east of the city of Phoenix and along interstate highways in the western portion of the state. These pinch points likely constitute important conservation opportunities, where barriers to movement may cause disproportionate loss of connectivity, but also where actions such as placement of wildlife crossing structures or conservation easements could enhance connectivity and prevent detrimental impacts before they occur.

AB  - An accurate description of spatial urban growth is a prerequisite step in order to implement appropriated policies to improve the ecosystem service performance of green spaces in a city. Such information is, however, absent in Lubumbashi, the second metropolis of the Democratic Republic of Congo, despite its high demographic growth rate and an unplanned spatial urban growth. This study was designed to characterize the spatial pattern of green spaces and the extent of changes driven by the urbanization along the urban-rural gradient using a combination of landscape metrics and floristic plots. Our results revealed that the number of patches was directly proportional to the degree of urbanization of the city, whereas the area of the green spaces and the index of the largest patch showed an inverse relationship with the urbanization degree. Urban green spaces were dominated by attached and roadside spaces that are more equipped and present a higher occurrence of cultivated plants. By contrast, peri-urban green spaces were characterized by buffer zones, fields, abandoned areas, and informal spaces, with an elevated proportion of invasive species and natural vegetation. Moreover, it was found that the number of exotic species increased with the degree of urbanization, reaching values considered a threat to the indigenous flora. The current results underline the need for urgent measures oriented both toward increasing the spatial connectivity between green spaces (e.g., by creating new green spaces planted with indigenous species) while reducing the spread of invasive species in the city.

AB  - Understanding the effects of local habitat and wider landscape connectivity factors on tick presence, nymph density and Borrelia species (spp.) prevalence in the tick population is important for identifying the public health risk from Lyme borreliosis. This multi-city study collected data in three southern England cities (Bath, Bristol, and Southampton) during spring, summer, and autumn in 2017. Focusing specifically on urban green space used for recreation which were clearly in urbanised areas, 72 locations were sampled. Additionally, geospatial datasets on urban green space coverage within 250 m and 1 km of sampling points, as well as distance to woodland were incorporated into statistical models. Distance to woodland was negatively associated with tick presence and nymph density, particularly during spring and summer. Furthermore, we observed an interaction effect between habitat and season for tick presence and nymph density, with woodland habitat having greater tick presence and nymph density during spring. Borrelia spp. infected Ixodes ricinus were found in woodland, woodland edge and under canopy habitats in Bath and Southampton. Overall Borrelia spp. prevalence in nymphs was 2.8%, similar to wider UK studies assessing prevalence in Ixodes ricinus in rural areas. Bird-related Borrelia genospecies dominated across sites, suggesting bird reservoir hosts may be important in urban green space settings for feeding and infecting ticks. Whilst overall density of infected nymphs across the three cities was low (0.03 per 100 m2), risk should be further investigated by incorporating data on tick bites acquired in urban settings, and subsequent Lyme borreliosis transmission.

AB  - We assessed bird diversity and nesting activity in 54 urban parks in the core of a highly populated East-Asian tropical city to investigate the effects of area, isolation, habitat heterogeneity, and human disturbances on avifauna. Tree density and heterogeneity were lower while isolation was greater in small than in large or medium-sized parks. Yet, park features were often interrelated, with isolation variables negatively correlated to each other, heterogeneity positively correlated to area, and habitat variables mostly positively correlated with one another but variously to disturbances; whereas pedestrian densities wee positively correlated with green area proportions (ISO3) but negatively with the distances to large green areas (ISO2). Park size played a primary role by positively affecting species richness and numbers of nesting species, thus contributing to higher total and nesting species heterogeneity, and determining the occurrence of a greatest number of species. Pedestrian density, canopy cover, and ground heterogeneity played secondary roles, whereas isolation appeared less influential at the community level. Omnivores, granivores, and aerial insectivores appeared more abundant but were dominated by several common species. Nesting was restricted to even fewer species. While species varied in the occupancy responses to these factors, tree heterogeneity positively affected the nesting of Zosterops japonicus and cavity-nesting birds, and predator density negatively affected those of Lonchura punctulata and Streptopelia doves. Improved urban land use planning and park management incorporating these effects should be implemented to enhance breeding and avoid compositional homogenization for long-term sustainability of urban avian diversity.

AB  - Background Studying population genetic structure and gene flow of plant populations and their influencing factors is of particular significance in the field of conservation biology, especially important for species such as rare and endangered plants.Tetraena mongolicaMaxim. (TM), belongs to Zygophyllaceae family, a rare and endangered plant with narrow distribution. However, for the last decade, due to excessive logging, urban expansion, industrial and tourism development, habitat fragmentation and loss of natural habitats have become major threats to the population of endangered plants. Results In this study, genetic diversity, population genetic structure and gene flow of TM populations were evaluated by reduced representation sequencing technology, and a total of more than 133.45 GB high-quality clean reads and 38,097 high-quality SNPs were generated. Analysis based on multiple methods, we found that the existing TM populations have moderate levels of genetic diversity, and very low genetic differentiation as well as high levels of gene flow between populations. Population structure and principal coordinates analysis showed that 8 TM populations can be divided into two groups. The Mantel test detected no significant correlation between geographical distances and genetic distance for the whole sampling. Moreover, the migration model indicated that the gene flow is more of a north to south migration pattern in history. Conclusions This study demonstrates that the present genetic structure is mainly due to habitat fragmentation caused by urban sprawl, industrial development and coal mining. Our recommendation with respect to conservation management is that, all 8 populations should be preserved as a whole population, rather than just those in the core area of TM nature reserve. In particular, the populations near the edge of TM distribution in cities and industrial areas deserve our special protection.

AB  - Exploration activities with standard methods have already encountered many obstacles in the field. Geological survey is often difficult to find outcrop because they are covered by vegetation, alluvial layer or as a result of urban development and housing. Seismic method requires a large expense and licensing in the use of dynamite is complicated. Method of gravity requires the operator to go back (looping) to the starting point. Given some of these constraints, therefore it needs a solution in the form of new method that can work more efficiently with less cost. Several studies in various countries have shown a correlation between the presence of hydrocarbons and Radon gas concentration in the earth surface. By utilizing the properties of Radon that can migrate to the surface, the value of Radon concentration in the surface is suggested to provide information about the subsurface structure condition. Radon is the only radioactive substance that gas-phased at atmospheric temperature. It is very abundant in the earth mantle. The vast differences of temperatures and pressures between the mantle and the earth crust cause the convection flow toward earth surface. Radon in gas phase will be carried by convection flow to the surface. The quantity of convection currents depend on the porosity and permeability of rocks where Radon travels within, so that Radon concentration in the earth surface delineates the porosity and permeability of subsurface rock layers. Some measurements were carried out at several locations with various subsurface geological conditions, including proven oil fields, proven geothermal field, and frontier area as a comparison. These measurements show that the average and the background concentration threshold in the proven oil field (11,200 Bq/m(3)) and proven geothermal field (7,820 Bq/m(3)) is much higher than the quantity in frontier area (329 and 1,620 Bq/m(3)). Radon concentration in the earth surface is correlated with the presence of geological faults. Peak concentrations of Radon takes place along the fault.

AB  - The ability of insects to persist in urban greenspace depends on their ability to usefully interact with available plant resources. Greenspace design influences plant-insect interactions by: (1) limiting the plant-species pool available for interaction through plant choice, (2) limiting the insects that are available for interaction through site-occupancy dynamics, and (3) mediating insect preferences based on the context of particular plant-insect interactions through structural barriers, microclimatic changes or competition. We designed an experiment to measure the effect of greenspace design attributes on site occupancy and insect preferences while keeping plant availability constant. Using a set of five functionally distinct flowering plant species ("phytometres"), we used occupancy-detection modelling to test factors affecting probability of visitation for eight groups of pollinating insects (ants, beetles, butterflies, bumblebees, honeybees, small bees, and hoverflies amend other flies) across 102 urban squares in Munich, Germany. We found that the probability of detecting an interaction was low for most functional groups, and situational factors, such as weather or competition from co-occurring flowers, were the primary drivers of visitation. Increasing the proportion of unsealed surfaces and quantity or diversity of flowers on the site had a positive influence on the probability of interaction, and, to a lesser extent, on probability of occupancy. Landscape connectivity and site area were important for only a few groups. Together, our results suggest that small-scale habitat conditions are more important than site context for influencing pollinator visitation. Designers can encourage interaction through contiguous provision of floral resources and unsealed surfaces while limiting internal barriers.

AB  - Environmental and ecological degradation can be monitored by biological indicators such as plants, yet little research has been done using subterranean organisms such as collembola, especially in cities. Collembola, a soil fauna group, can be used to assess soil quality and to decipher assembly rules of soil organisms in cities. Here, we review 75 articles on soil collembola in an urban context. We found that soil properties and landscape characteristics influenced soil communities. There is a need for more connectivity between green urban spaces to allow the dispersion of collembola. Little information is available on the assembly of collembola communities, on biotic interactions and on dynamics of colonisation.

AB  - Severe fragmentation is a typical fate of native remnant habitats in cities, and urban wildlife with limited dispersal ability are predicted to lose genetic variation in isolated urban patches. However, little information exists on the characteristics of urban green spaces required to conserve genetic variation. In this study, we examine whether isolation in New York City (NYC) parks results in genetic bottlenecks in white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), and test the hypotheses that park size and time since isolation are associated with genetic variability using nonlinear regression and information-theoretic model selection. White-footed mice have previously been documented to exhibit male-biased dispersal, which may create disparities in genetic variation between males and females in urban parks. We use genotypes of 18 neutral microsatellite data and four different statistical tests to assess this prediction. Given that sex-biased dispersal may create disparities between population genetic patterns inferred from bi-vs. uni-parentally inherited markers, we also sequenced a 324 bp segment of the mitochondrial D-loop for independent inferences of historical demography in urban P. leucopus. We report that isolation in urban parks does not necessarily result in genetic bottlenecks; only three out of 14 populations in NYC parks exhibited a signature of a recent bottleneck at 18 neutral microsatellite loci. Mouse populations in larger urban parks, or parks that have been isolated for shorter periods of time, also do not generally contain greater genetic variation than populations in smaller parks. These results suggest that even small networks of green spaces may be sufficient to maintain the evolutionary potential of native species with certain characteristics. We also found that isolation in urban parks results in weak to nonexistent sex-biased dispersal in a species known to exhibit male-biased dispersal in less fragmented environments. In contrast to nuclear loci, mitochondrial D-loop haplotypes exhibited a mutational pattern of demographic expansion after a recent bottleneck or selective sweep. Estimates of the timing of this expansion suggest that it occurred concurrent with urbanization of NYC over the last few dozens to hundreds of years. Given the general non-neutrality of mtDNA in many systems and evidence of selection on related coding sequences in urban P. leucopus, we argue that the P. leucopus mitochondrial genome experienced recent negative selection against haplotypes not favored in isolated urban parks. In general, rapid adaptive evolution driven by urbanization, global climate change, and other human-caused factors is underappreciated by evolutionary biologists, but many more cases will likely be documented in the near future.

AB  - By using microsatellite markers, we investigated the population genetic structure of three mainly clonally propagating bryophyte species-the hepatic Plagiochila asplenioides (L.) Dumort and the mosses Pleurozium schreberi (Willd. ex Brid.) Mitt. and Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus (Hedw.) Warnst-that occupy habitats differing in the level of human disturbance. Sampled populations, located in southern Finland, were classified as natural or disturbed. All species possessed a fair amount of genetic variation both within populations (mean diversities per population of 0: 411 +/- 0: 118, 0: 403 +/- 0: 111, and 0: 307 +/- 0: 077, respectively) and across populations (0.599, 0.618, and 0.400, respectively). On average, natural and disturbed populations possessed similar levels of genetic diversity. Differentiation levels (F-ST values of 0.356, 0.298, and 0.302, respectively) were significant but showed that there is some gene flow taking place. The Bayesian STRUCTURE analysis provided additional information on the population genetic structures. Although R. squarrosus was the species with the lowest level of genetic variation, its populations inhabiting urban, disturbed habitats tended to contain highly differentiated genotypes of different origins, which suggests that human-mediated dispersal is important in urban habitats. In addition, detailed analyses of the spatial genetic structure of R. squarrosus showed that at short distances (1 to <30 m) individuals are more closely related than expected, while at greater distances (30 to 500 m) kinship decreases with increasing distance. Thus, the rarity of sexual reproduction was visible in the spatial genetic structure within R. squarrosus populations, as aggregations of similar genotypes were found at short distances in populations otherwise showing isolation-by-distance effect.

AB  - Forest fragmentation as a result of urbanisation can adversely affect gene flow between wildlife populations. Although gene flow among fragmented populations has been investigated for many species, there has been little research into the effects of urbanisation on gene flow in large mammals. Singapore is a small, densely urbanised tropical city-state where more than 99% of its original forest has been cleared. The wild pig is currently the largest native terrestrial mammal in Singapore and has important roles in maintaining plant diversity and seed dispersal. Pigs are widespread and present in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve (CCNR) as well as other forest patches in Singapore. Due to the extent of urbanisation, it is unclear if genetic connectivity exists between the CCNR and other forest fragments. In this study, genome libraries from 48 samples of pig blood were collected from two sites: 1) the CCNR and 2) forest fragments in the northeast of Singapore. Genome-wide SNP loci were used to understand the population genomics of the two pig populations. The results indicated that the pig populations formed two distinct genetic clusters that did not align with the respective sites. Both sites included individuals with signatures from both genetic clusters, although with different frequencies. This suggests that pigs can move across heavily urbanised landscapes. Future studies should involve long term collaring studies to identify specific corridors used by the pigs for dispersal, and a larger population genomic assessment to understand pig dispersal and gene flow to and from forest patches other than the CCNR and the Northeast.

AB  - Land-use conversion and habitat loss and degradation are among the factors affecting populations and species genetic integrity. Understanding how these factors govern the genetic structure of threatened plant populations is essential to design efficient conservation strategies. Here we analyze how environmental correlates, geographic location and anthropogenic disturbance (at local, landscape and regional scales) relate to population differentiation and genetic diversity of a keystone semiarid long-lived shrub,Ziziphus lotus. The European range of this species is restricted mainly to the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula (> 90%) but its area has shrunk considerably as a consequence of intensive agriculture and urban expansion since the 1950s. We characterize its genetic diversity and structure across the Iberian Peninsula with microsatellite markers, considering 21 populations. All populations showed high and relatively similar values of genetic diversity (mean/pop:H-o = 0.54;H-e = 0.55;A(R) = 3.59). Three main genetic clusters were defined by clustering analyses corresponding largely to west, central (core) and east of its distribution. Molecular variance analysis revealed that 87.3% of genetic variation was grouped within populations, 5% among populations and 7% between regions. Geographic location (37.88%) has stronger correlation with population genetic differences than landscape characteristics (5.82%). Natural habitat cover at the landscape level was the only environmental variable associated withF(ST)population differences. The detected population genetic patterns are probably related primarily to historical gene flow and secondarily to intensive land-use change of this area in the last 60 years. Our results suggest that, although the long-lived and resprouting strategy of the species is buffering the erosion of genetic diversity at population and regional level, there are already genetic consequences of landscape degradation, which could be aggravated in the future.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the genetic diversity and population genetic structure of Avicennia marina, an important mangrove tree species with a wide distribution. Samples were collected from four sampling localities, characterised by different environmental conditions, situated along the coast of Mozambique within southern Africa: Pemba-Metuge, Bons Sinais Estuary, Costa do Sol and Inhaca Island. We used five speciesspecific polymorphic microsatellite loci for screening 20 samples from each of the sampling localities. The overall level of polymorphism observed was relatively high with 3?22 alleles detected at each locus. AMOVA showed the highest level of variation, 96.6 %, was located within populations. Pairwise FST comparisons were non-significant between sampling localities. No isolation by distance was detected. Structure results suggested the presence of one population after independent clustering of all samples. The results showed high levels of gene flow for A. marina along the coast of Mozambique and suggested the absence of barriers to gene flow. The results and information from this study will inform strategies for the conservation of A. marina. We discuss the importance of preserving the mangrove forest, supported by our own result, by managing and reducing anthropogenic activities that can damage the genetic diversity within these localities that are under high pressure due to urban growth. This will positively contribute to how and where effort and resources should be focused on for its conservation and sustainable management and utilisation.

AB  - The pursuit of urban agriculture as part of a city's green infrastructure is often a challenge, particularly within compact cities, where there is a limited amount of space between buildings for urban farming and gardening. Instead, such high-rise urban developments present often under-utilized spaces on the vertical surfaces of buildings. A key unknown is the adequacy of light for plant growth. Many leafy vegetables that require high amounts of light form a significant proportion of the staple diet in many Asian countries. We report on the assessment of sunlight adequacy for growing leafy vegetables in a compact tropical city, based on the high-rise and high-density residential environment of Singapore. Leaf physiological traits of seven leafy vegetables were assessed and used to estimate plant light requirements. A survey of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) along exposed corridors showed that the daily light integral (DLI) value ranged from 2 to 35 mol m(-2) d(-1) under relatively ideal weather conditions during days with abundant solar insolation, and facades that experienced a minimum of half-day direct insolation matched the light requirements of vegetables within the moderate to very high-light categories. With regard to the building form, PAR increased gradually with height, but remains highly influenced by facade orientation and configuration. Owing to the annual north-south oscillation of the sun's path, reduced annual PAR variability and higher total annual PAR at facades, buildings with an east-west orientation will better support continuous vegetable cultivation, especially for basic building typologies without self-shading configurations. However, excessive PAR and temperatures during mid-day hours may hinder plant growth. By highlighting such patterns in levels of PAR, this study confirms the potential for high-rise and high-density conditions in the tropics to support farming using typically under-utilized vertical spaces of residential buildings.

AB  - Cities contain a diverse range of habitats that support plant establishment and persistence. This study focuses on a particular vertical artificial habitat: masonry retaining walls in Hong Kong. We explored the diversity and co-existence of different plant growth forms, synoptic assessment of habitat conditions, and relationship between habitat factors and vegetation occurrence. Some 270 walls with notable plant colonization in old districts were studied. We surveyed intrinsic wall fabric, extrinsic site condition, tree species and abundance, and other types of plant cover. The data were evaluated with the help of principal component and multiple regression analyses. A wide assemblage of species and growth forms have established spontaneously on walls. The tree flora is dominated by Moraceae (Mulberry family) members, genus Ficus (figs or banyans), and particularly Ficus microcarpa. Trees with strangler characteristics pre-adapted to grow on the vertical habitat are strongly favoured, followed by ruderals and garden escapees. Natives outnumber exotics by a large margin. Multiple wall attributes could be condensed into four factors, classified as water-nutrient supply, habitat connectivity, structure-maintenance, and habitat size. The action of habitat factors on vegetation occurrence hinges on plant growth form and dimension. The occurrence of diminutive lichen-moss is related to the fundamental sustenance water-nutrient factor. The bigger mature trees are more dependent on the larger-scale habitat size factor. The medium-sized plants, including herbs, shrubs and tree seedlings, are contingent upon the dual influence of water-nutrient and habitat connectivity. Spatial contiguity with natural ecosystem can secure continual supplies of seeds, water, nutrient, genial microclimate, and clean air to foster wall vegetation growth. The conservation of walls and their companion flora could avoid degrading or reducing these critical enabling factors. The urban ecological heritage deserves to be protected from unnecessary, misinformed and harmful impacts. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban ecosystems are expanding throughout the world, and urban ecology is attracting increasing research interest. Some authors have questioned the value of existing ecological theories for understanding the processes and consequences of urbanization.
   In order to assess the applicability of metacommunity theory to urban systems, I evaluated three assumptions that underlie the theory - the effect of patch area, the effect of patch isolation, and species-environment relations - using data on assemblages of pond-breeding amphibians in the Greater Melbourne area of Australia. I also assessed the relative impact of habitat fragmentation, habitat isolation, and changes to habitat quality on these assemblages.
   Poisson regression modelling provided support for an important increase in species richness with patch area (pond size) and a decrease in species richness with increasing patch isolation, as measured by surrounding road cover. Holding all other variables constant, species richness was predicted to be 2.8-5.5 times higher at the largest pond than at the smallest, while the most isolated pond was predicted to have 12-19% of the species richness of the least isolated pond. Thus, the data were consistent with the first two assumptions of metacommunity theory evaluated.
   The quality of habitat at a pond was also important, with a predicted 44-56% decrease in the number of species detected at ponds with a surrounding vertical wall compared with those with a gently sloping bank. This demonstrates that environmental differences between habitat patches were also influencing amphibian assemblages, providing support for the species-sorting and/or mass-effect perspectives of metacommunity theory.
   Without management intervention, urbanization may lead to a reduction in the number of amphibian species persisting in urban ponds, particularly where increasing isolation of ponds by roads and associated infrastructure reduces the probability of re-colonization following local extinction.

AB  - Bryophytes seem particularly suitable to investigate genetic diversity in relation to habitat disturbance due to their large employment as bioindicators and to the recent application of molecular markers to moss population studies. Genetic variation and structure were analysed in seven urban, extraurban and remote populations of Leptodon smithii, an epiphytic moss of Quercus ilex, a phanerogamic species of Mediterranean climax vegetation. A total of 210 individual shoots were DNA extracted and amplified with internal simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers, and 54 haplotypes were identified. An uneven distribution of haplotype number and frequencies was observed among sites, with a higher number of haplotypes and more homogeneous haplotype frequencies in the extraurban/remote populations. Molecular diversity indices were overall higher in the extraurban sites than in the urban ones. Multilocus linkage disequilibrium values were in line with the occurrence of sexual/asexual reproduction in the seven populations. The isolation-by-distance model was not supported by Mantel test among sites; however, within-population fixation index (F-ST) highlighted a clear relation between genetic and physic distances among trees, suggesting a limited dispersal range for L. smithii's spores. The genetic structure was mainly affected by population size, wood structure and extent, and genetic drift consequent to habitat fragmentation and human-induced disturbance.

AB  - Maintenance of genetic variation is of critical importance for wild populations since low levels limit the species' ability to respond to different threats (diseases, predators, environmental changes) in both the long and the short term. Human activities could impact the genetic variation of wild species in multiple ways, including via fragmentation and harvesting. We used an individual-based landscape genetics approach to describe the impact of landscape elements and trapping pressure on the spatial genetic structure of a large sample (n = 370) of the stone marten (Martes foina) in central-eastern France (Bresse). An analysis of isolation-by-resistance using a causal modeling approach showed an influence of landscape cover and/or trapping pressure on gene flow according to age and sex class. Overall, the connectivity in the study area is provided mainly by vegetation cover, while roads and open areas partially impede it. Unexpectedly for this "urban adapter" species, buildings could reduce gene flow. We also emphasized the sex-dependent effect of trapping on gene flow. Genetic differentiation in males was influenced by trapping pressure and landscape structure while only the latter influenced genetic differentiation in females. A stronger isolation by distance in males than in females suggested that at the scale of the study area, males are more exposed to trapping pressure, which reduces effective dispersal. Overall, the combination of both landscape and trapping costs might create an 'ecological trap' that could disrupt gene flow, leading to a north-south division in the study area.

AB  - The carabid fauna of 28 derelict sites in the West Midlands (England) were sampled over the course of one growing season (April-October, 1999). The study aimed to investigate the relationship between carabid assemblages and five measures of landscape structure pertinent to derelict habitat. At each site measurements of landscape features pertinent to derelict habitat were made: (i) the proximity of habitat corridors; (ii) the density of surrounding derelict land; (iii) the distance between the site and the rural fringe; and (iv) the size of the site. Concurrent surveys of the soil characteristics, vegetation type, and land use history were conducted. The data were analysed using a combination of ordination (DCA, RDA), variance partitioning (using pRDA) and binary linear regression. The results suggest that:
   1. There is very little evidence that the carabid assemblages of derelict sites were affected by landscape structure, with assemblages instead being principally related to within-site habitat variables, such as site age (since last disturbance), substrate type and vegetation community.
   2. No evidence was found to support the hypothesis that sites away from railway corridors are more impoverished in their carabid fauna than sites on corridors.
   3. There are some suggestions from this study that rarer and non-flying specialist species may be affected by isolation, taking longer to reach sites. We infer from this that older sites with retarded succession, and sites in higher densities of surrounding derelict land may eventually become more species rich and that these sites may be important for maintaining populations of rarer and flightless species.
   4. Conservation efforts to maintain populations of these species should focus principally on habitat quality issues, such as maintaining early successional habitats that have a diversity of seed producing annuals and perennial plants and enhancing substrate variability rather than landscape issues.

AB  - Urbanisation is one of the most pervasive agents of contemporary landscape change globally. Rapid land use change and competing land uses pose multiple challenges for biodiversity conservation, particularly in periurban fringe areas where suburban development encroaches into natural habitats. The quenda (Isoodon fusci-venter) is one of the very few ground-dwelling critical weight range mammals to persist in the peri-urban fringe of the rapidly expanding city of Perth, Australia. We investigated the genetic connectivity of 42 populations of quenda across the Greater Perth metropolitan region using microsatellites and generalised dissimilarity modelling to evaluate the impact of landscape elements on functional connectivity. Spatially-explicit Bayesian cluster analysis indicated quenda exhibit significant population structure across the Perth region, which, at the broadest scale, was associated with hydrological and topographical features. Inter-population genetic connectivity was facilitated by the presence of native vegetation, particularly low vegetation (< 1.4 m height) that is the species' preferred habitat. Surprisingly, measures of urbanisation were not significant predictors of gene flow, potentially as quenda show some characteristics of urban utilizers. Given the rapid pace of development in the region, knowledge on the distribution and population structure of quenda, and understanding the processes that contribute to them, provides a basis for a landscape conservation approach to urban planning. Retention of suitable habitat that facilitates persistence of this important mammal is critical.

AB  - We monitored the last remaining Asian elephant populations in China over the past decade. Using DNA tools and repeat genotyping, we estimated the population sizes from 654 dung samples collected from various areas. Combined with morphological individual identifications from over 6,300 elephant photographs taken in the wild, we estimated that the total Asian elephant population size in China is between 221 and 245. Population genetic structure and diversity were examined using a 556-bp fragment of mitochondrial DNA, and 24 unique haplotypes were detected from DNA analysis of 178 individuals. A phylogenetic analysis revealed two highly divergent clades of Asian elephants, alpha and beta, present in Chinese populations. Four populations (Mengla, Shangyong, Mengyang, and Pu'Er) carried mtDNA from the a clade, and only one population (Nangunhe) carried mtDNA belonging to the a clade. Moreover, high genetic divergence was observed between the Nangunhe population and the other four populations; however, genetic diversity among the five populations was low, possibly due to limited gene flow because of habitat fragmentation. The expansion of rubber plantations, crop cultivation, and villages along rivers and roads had caused extensive degradation of natural forest in these areas. This had resulted in the loss and fragmentation of elephant habitats and had formed artificial barriers that inhibited elephant migration. Using Geographic Information System, Global Positioning System, and Remote Sensing technology, we found that the area occupied by rubber plantations, tea farms, and urban settlements had dramatically increased over the past 40 years, resulting in the loss and fragmentation of elephant habitats and forming artificial barriers that inhibit elephant migration. The restoration of ecological corridors to facilitate gene exchange among isolated elephant populations and the establishment of cross-boundary protected areas between China and Laos to secure their natural habitats are critical for the survival of Asian elephants in this region.

AB  - We investigated the relationship between species diversity of pteridophytes and the environmental factors of 39 fragmented forest patches in the Kyoto city area. There was a significant correlation between the number of species and the micro-landform diversity, artificial habitat diversity, and logarithm of the area of the forest patch. When we performed a multiple regression analysis to identify the best-fit model so as to optimize the amount of variation in species diversity explained by using stepwise selection, three species diversity indices (species richness or Shannon's diversity index, logarithm of inverse Simpson index) had significant positive partial correlations with the logarithm of area of the forest patch, and negative correlations with the logarithm of isolation distance from mountain forest. Therefore, we conclude that pteridophyte species diversity depends on patch size and isolation distance from mountain forests. Comparison of the woody plant species-area curve with the pteridophyte species-area curve showed that the rate of increase of species number (inclination) with area was the same, but the Y-intercept of the pteridophyte species-area curve was lower than that of the woody plant curve. Therefore, the minimum conservation area required for ferns and fern. allies is greater than that for woody plant species. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Landscape restoration through revegetation is being increasingly used in the conservation management of degraded landscapes. To effectively plan restoration programs information is required on how the landscape context of revegetation influences biodiversity gains. Here, we investigate the relative influence of patch area and connectivity on bird species richness and abundance within urban revegetation patches in Brisbane, Australia. We carried out bird surveys at 20 revegetation sites, and used hierarchical partitioning and model selection to test the relative importance of patch area (the area of revegetation including all directly connected remnant vegetation) and landscape connectivity (the vegetated area connected by less than 10 m, 20 m, 30 m, 40 m and 50 m cleared gaps). We controlled for a number of possible confounding variables within the hierarchical partitioning procedure. Both the hierarchical partitioning and model selection procedures indicated that connectivity had an important influence on bird species richness. Patch area in combination with connectivity were important influencing factors on overall bird abundance. We also carried out the hierarchical partitioning procedure for bird abundance data within a range of feeding guilds, yielding results specific to species groups. Overall our data suggest that greater connectivity enhances the habitat area that colonists can arrive from (resulting in greater species richness), whereas increased patch area allows for increased abundance by expanding the habitat available to species already present in a patch. A combined approach where connectivity and overall habitat area is enhanced across the landscape is likely to be necessary to meet long-term conservation objectives. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - How increasing urbanization affects biodiversity is one of the most understudied aspects of global change biology. It is, however, known that it may negatively affect plant population genetic diversity in numerous ways, for example through its negative effects on plant population size, between-population connectivity, and reproductive success. Therefore, it is important to investigate to what extent different levels of urbanization result in these negative phenomena. Here we used microsatellite markers to investigate urbanization effects on the population genetic structure of 23 populations of the self-incompatible, partially clonal herb Linaria vulgaris which were sampled across a gradient of urbanization. Clonal diversity as measured by the Pareto-parameter varied between 1.11 and 2.97 and was negatively correlated to both the degree of urbanization and to population size. Urbanization and population size were not interrelated. The least clonally rich populations also experienced significantly reduced seed set. Irrespective of the degree of urbanization, L. vulgaris populations exhibited strong genetic differentiation (F-ST=0.33) and there was no significant correlation between genetic and geographic distances, suggesting low gene flow among populations. In conclusion, we showed that urbanization negatively affected fitness of L. vulgaris populations through decreasing their clonal diversity and reproductive success, an effect that may be exacerbated by the low gene flow between populations. Although the effect was modest, the results could probably be extrapolated to bigger cities where it would be considerably more pronounced.

AB  - Amazonian understory antbirds are thought to be relatively sedentary and to have limited dispersal ability; they avoid crossing forest gaps, and even narrow roads through a forest may limit their territories. However, most evidence for sedentariness in antbirds comes from field observations and plot-based recapture of adult individuals, which do not provide evidence for lack of genetic dispersal, as this often occurs through juveniles. In this study, we used microsatellite markers and mitochondrial control-region sequences to investigate contemporary and infer historical patterns of genetic diversity and structure of the Rufous-throated Antbird (Gymnopithys rufigula) within and between two large reserves in central Amazonia. Analyses based on microsatellites suggested two genetically distinct populations and asymmetrical gene flow between them. Within a population, we found a lack of genetic spatial autocorrelation, suggesting that genotypes are randomly distributed and that G.rufigula may disperse longer distances than expected for antbirds. Analyses based on mitochondrial sequences did not recover two clear genetic clusters corresponding to the two reserves and indicated the whole population of the Rufous-throated Antbird in the region has been expanding over the last 50,000 years. Historical migration rates were low and symmetrical between the two reserves, but we found evidence for a recent unilateral increase in gene flow. Recent differentiation between individuals of the two reserves and a unilateral increase in gene flow suggest that recent urban expansion and habitat loss may be driving changes and threatening populations of Rufous-throated Antbird in central Amazonia. As ecological traits and behavioral characteristics affect patterns of gene flow, comparative studies of other species with different behavior and ecological requirements will be necessary to better understand patterns of genetic dispersal and effects of urban expansion on Amazonian understory antbirds.

AB  - We investigated the genetic variability and differentiation among 12 Ae. aegypti populations collected within the Madurai city in Tamil Nadu state of Southern India. Genotyping of 12 microsatellite markers in 353 individual samples showed moderate levels of genetic diversity among 12 populations. UPGMA tree, hierarchical clustering, Bayesian clustering and Discriminant Analysis on Principal Components roughly divided these populations into two genetic clusters: main city populations and the populations located at the border of the corporation limit. Significant positive correlation between genetic and geographic distance was observed among 12 populations, however, the correlation was non-significant within each genetic cluster. Population assignment and divMigrate graph depicted less migration between two groups. Overall, the findings of this study provided an overview of Ae. aegypti population structure within an urban setting in India that have implications in effective implementation of vector control in the city area.

AB  - Mile-a-minute (Mikania micrantha Kunth) is a tropical American species and has become a worldwide invasive weed. It was first introduced to mainland China in 1983 in Yingjiang City, Dehong State, Yunnan Province. To assess the origins of populations from Dehong State, Yunnan Province, the genetic structure of 427 individuals from 11 M. micrantha populations from Yunnan, Guangxi, Hainan, and Guangdong provinces were analyzed. A total of 28 alleles were detected in 12 nuclear microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity at the population level was relatively high. An analysis of molecular variance showed that most of the variation occurred within populations (82.73%), and only 18.27% occurred among populations. The genetic differentiation coefficient (F-ST) was 0.183. The estimated gene flow (N-m) from F-ST was 1.116. The independent origins of four populations collected from Dehong State, Yunnan Province, was determined by the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means clustering and STRUCTURE analysis. Three gene clusters and one admixture gene cluster were found. A Mantel test of pairwise Nei's genetic distances and pairwise geographic distances revealed no evidence for isolation by distance (r = 0.068, P = 0.343). These results suggest that the post-introduction admixture caused by multiple introductions and high gene flow might contribute to the evolutionary adaptation of M. micrantha. These results could provide a scientific basis for the management of invasive M. micrantha.

AB  - Context With the expansion in urbanization, understanding how biodiversity responds to the altered landscape becomes a major concern. Most studies focus on habitat effects on biodiversity, yet much less attention has been paid to surrounding landscape matrices and their joint effects. Objective We investigated how habitat and landscape matrices affect waterbird diversity across scales in the Yangtze River Floodplain, a typical area with high biodiversity and severe human-wildlife conflict. Methods The compositional and structural features of the landscape were calculated at fine and coarse scales. The ordinary least squares regression model was adopted, following a test showing no significant spatial autocorrelation in the spatial lag and spatial error models, to estimate the relationship between landscape metrics and waterbird diversity. Results Well-connected grassland and shrub surrounded by isolated and regular-shaped developed area maintained higher waterbird diversity at fine scales. Regular-shaped developed area and cropland, irregular-shaped forest, and aggregated distribution of wetland and shrub positively affected waterbird diversity at coarse scales. Conclusions Habitat and landscape matrices jointly affected waterbird diversity. Regular-shaped developed area facilitated higher waterbird diversity and showed the most pronounced effect at coarse scales. The conservation efforts should not only focus on habitat quality and capacity, but also habitat connectivity and complexity when formulating development plans. We suggest planners minimize the expansion of the developed area into critical habitats and leave buffers to maintain habitat connectivity and shape complexity to reduce the disturbance to birds. Our findings provide important insights and practical measures to protect biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes.

AB  - Accelerated rates of urbanization negatively impact natural habitats and biodiversity. Studies of the effects of urbanization on fauna have emphasized taxonomic diversity, but this does not necessarily reflect effects on the evolutionary history of assemblages. Here, we study how urbanization influences phylogenetic diversity (PD) of bird assemblages in a small-medium city in the Central Andes of Colombia. Between 2016 and 2017, we performed bird surveys in 76 urban cells and 23 rural cells around the city. Then, we measured habitat characteristics (e.g. anthropogenic noise level, impervious and forested area) in sampled cells. PD of birds was between 1.37-1.42 MY higher in the rural than in the urban habitat. Within the urban habitat, the PD of birds reduces as impervious area and noise levels increase, while in the urban cells with most forested areas reach the highest PD values. Most of these differences and relationships disappear when we performed similar analysis controlling for differences in species richness. A low turnover of PD between assemblages of birds recorded inside Armenia and its less urbanized surroundings suggest green areas in the study area could mitigate the effects of urbanization in native fauna, and ameliorate connectivity between urban cells.

AB  - Anthropogenic land transformation, especially agriculture and urban development, are the leading causes of natural land cover loss and ultimate decline in environmental functionality and connectivity in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. However, recent developments in the form of housing estates with conservation and environmental management intentions (termed eco-estates) have increased. These eco-estates generally improve species and functional diversity in urban regions of coastal KwaZulu-Natal and improve connectivity for biodiversity between urban green spaces and existing natural landscapes. To provide the first comprehensive development and management guidelines for eco-estates, we reviewed and assessed research into the effects of eco-estate development on environmental functionality and connectivity using case studies from coastal KwaZulu-Natal. We suggest suitable regions for eco-estate establishment and provide detailed guidelines for ecoestate development, environmental rehabilitation and conservation, and eco-estate flora and fauna management. These guidelines will hopefully facilitate biodiversity conservation and improve current and future eco-estate management and, ultimately, the ecosystem health of coastal KwaZulu-Natal. They are applicable for ecoestate development and management in similar tropical and sub-tropical mixed land-use matrices.

AB  - Private gardens provide vital opportunities for people to interact with nature. The most popular form of interaction is through garden bird feeding. Understanding how landscape features and seasons determine patterns of movement of feeder-using songbirds is key to maximising the well-being benefits they provide. To determine these patterns we established three networks of automated data loggers along a gradient of greenspace fragmentation. Over a 12-month period we tracked 452 tagged blue tits Cyantistes caeruleus and great tits Parus major moving between feeder pairs 9,848 times, to address two questions: (i) Do urban features within different forms, and season, influence structural (presence-absence of connections between feeders by birds) and functional (frequency of these connections) connectivity? (ii) Are there general patterns of structural and functional connectivity across forms? Vegetation cover increased connectivity in all three networks, whereas the presence of road gaps negatively affected functional but not structural connectivity. Across networks structural connectivity was lowest in the summer when birds maintain breeding territories, however patterns of functional connectivity appeared to vary with habitat fragmentation. Using empirical data this study shows how key urban features and season influence movement of feeder-using songbirds, and we provide evidence that this is related to greenspace fragmentation.

AB  - Historically ubiquitous throughout the state, Florida's only two extant large carnivores, the federally endangered Florida panther and black bear, are now geographically restricted with small populations. Rapid human population growth and sea level rise (SLR) threaten to diminish these species' habitats. To aid landscape-scale conservation efforts, we estimated changes in habitat across a set of alternative future land-use and SLR projections. Intermediate-high (0.9 m) to extreme (1.8 m) SLR projections inundated 2.2-4.8% of panther and 3.3-5.4% of bear habitat by 2070. Unmitigated urban sprawl with minor protection policies (a Trend 2070 land-use projection) eliminated 8.8% of panther and 11.3% of bear habitat but increased protected habitat by 3.3%. In contrast, increased urban densities coupled with extensive land protection policies (an Alternative 2070 land-use projection) eliminated 4.1% of panther and 7.3% of bear habitat, and it increased protected habitat 52.1% for panther and 64.1% for bear. In combination, the Trend 2070 and extreme SLR projections reduced protected habitat 3.4% for panther and 6.6% for bear. However, the Alternative 2070 projection offset habitat area lost to extreme SLR, increasing protected habitat 45.3% for panther and 51.6% for bear. Protecting land along the Caloosahatchee River may accommodate panther dispersal to large habitat patches in northern Florida, while protecting inland habitat corridors may compensate for black bear habitat connectivity lost to inundation along the Gulf Coast. These alternative future projections prognosticate the impacts of climate and land-use change on the viability of Florida's two large carnivores.

AB  - The Mediterranean basin is a global hotspot of biological diversity and the most rich biodiversity region in Europe. Nevertheless, climate-driven habitat loss is one of the most serious concerns for biodiversity conservation in this region. We assess Mediterranean habitat loss and conversion into arid habitat under scenarios of climate change and evaluate protected areas, including Natura 2000 sites, which will be affected by these changes. We mapped shifts of Mediterranean and arid domains using four bias corrected simulations from Regional Climate Models for two emission scenarios over this century, dis-aggregated to a 1 km grid size. Our results indicate that by the end of the century the Euro-Mediterranean domain is projected to shift into other climatic domains by an area equivalent to 53 -121% of its current size. However it is projected to lose 11-25% of its current extent, which represents an area close to the size of Greece and Portugal combined. The loss is entirely due to shifts of the arid domain. Additionally, our results indicate that the extent of the arid domain is projected to increase by 228-450% of its current size in the European region. The shrinking of the current Euro-Mediterranean domain is projected to affect 15-23% of the Mediterranean Natura 2000 sites, and the loss in these sites is projected at 13-30% of its current area. Loss is projected to occur in central and southern areas of the Iberian Peninsula, southern Italy and the island of Sicily, south-eastern Greece, Cyprus, Malta and central Turkey. Computed changes in projected climatic parameters indicate that current areas of the Euro-Mediterranean domain will be hotter and drier. Temperature increase and precipitation decrease are projected to be more marked in the summer half of the year. As early as in the 2020s annual temperature is projected to increase by 0.9-1.4 degrees C with respect to the present reference climate, reaching an increase of 2.2-3.6 degrees C by the end of the century. By this period, summer precipitation is projected to decrease by 24-46% and annual precipitation by 14-23%. We provide insight into several aspects of adaptation and management of Mediterranean protected areas. A proactive approach taking into consideration landscape connectivity and the concomitant threats triggered by climate change is a priority. Proactive adaptation and management promoting investments in Green Infrastructure and a denser network of interconnected protected areas are necessary instruments for preserving Mediterranean biodiversity from the threats of habitat loss.

AB  - Bird species richness (S) and numbers (N) were studied in the breeding season in housing developments of different ages in a small English town and compared with village sites, urban green corridors and adjacent arable farmland. S and N were highest in village and green corridor sites. S in urban plots ranged from 13 to 18 species, similar to farmland, but N was much lower in farmland. Marked differences in the number of individual species between plots were recorded. S and N were independent of age of development and area of gardens within plots but both were correlated with the area of greenspace. Greenspace alone and combined with gardens was correlated with the numbers of several individual species. The results are discussed in relation to proposed new large-scale housing developments in England.

AB  - Our goal was to determine whether it is more cost-effective to control feral cat abundance with trap-neuter-release programs or trap and euthanize programs. Using STELLA 7, systems modeling software, we modeled changes over 30 years in abundance of cats in a feral colony in response to each management method and the costs and benefits associated with each method . We included costs associated with providing food, veterinary care, and microchips to the colony cats and the cost of euthanasia, wages, and trapping equipment in the model. Due to a lack of data on predation rates and disease transmission by feral cats the only benefits incorporated into the analyses were reduced predation on Wedge-tailed Shearwaters (Puffinus pacificus). When no additional domestic cats were abandoned by owners and the trap and euthanize program removed 30,000 cats in the first year, the colony was extirpated in at least 75% of model simulations within the second year. It took 30 years for trap-neuter-release to extirpate the colony. When the cat population was supplemented with 10% of the initial population size per year, the colony returned to carrying capacity within 6 years and the trap and euthanize program had to be repeated, whereas trap-neuter-release never reduced the number of cats to near zero within the 30-year time frame of the model. The abandonment of domestic cats reduced the cost effectiveness of both trap-neuter-release and trap and euthanize. Trap-neuter-release was approximately twice as expensive to implement as a trap and euthanize program. Results of sensitivity analyses suggested trap-neuter-release programs that employ volunteers are still less cost-effective than trap and euthanize programs that employ paid professionals and that trap-neuter-release was only effective when the total number of colony cats in an area was below 1000. Reducing the rate of abandonment of domestic cats appears to be a more effective solution for reducing the abundance of feral cats.

AB  - Aim Despite the common myna's widespread distribution, and the significant impact it has caused in parts of its non-native range, there have been no comprehensive genomic studies of its invasion of any region. We aimed to characterize the common myna invasion of the Australian continent to understand its population genetic landscape, introduction history, dispersal characteristics, and the interconnectedness between different source populations and invasive fronts. Location Common mynas from 26 geographical locations spanning the Australian continent were utilized in this study. Taxon Common myna (Acridotheres tristis). Methods We used a reduced genome representation method (DArTseq) to generate thousands of single nucleotide polymorphism markers in 462 common mynas. We then applied population genomic techniques to identify the common myna's population attributes such as gene flow, genetic diversity, and effective dispersal, all of which are critical for understanding geographical range expansion of pest species. Results We found significant genetic structuring across the common myna's Australian distribution, indicating limited levels of effective dispersal amongst the populations founded from historic introductions in the 19th century. The historic introduction points were found to be genetically distinct, such that in the region on the invasion front where admixture did occur, myna populations exhibited higher genetic diversity than in the source populations. Significant isolation by distance was evident amongst populations derived from the same founding population, with genetic diversity decreasing moving away from the point of colonization, and in general, higher levels of gene flow from source to front than vice versa. Main conclusions This study indicates that despite a 150-year colonization history of mynas in Australia, contemporary genetic structure still largely reflects human-mediated dispersal. However, expanding populations are now connecting and the consequent increased genetic diversity may improve evolutionary potential. These results suggest that more management focus should be directed towards the invasion fronts, rather than the large, historic source populations.

AB  - The area of semi-natural grasslands has decreased dramatically causing many grassland specialist species to persist in small habitat fragments. Furthermore, ecological communities once shaped by disturbances related to traditional agriculture now face the impacts of modern agriculture and urbanization. Many of the species have become endangered due to the combined effects of habitat destruction and degradation. We studied the responses of vascular plants and bryophytes to present and past connectivity in semi-natural grasslands, while accounting for the effects of local environmental conditions. We conducted vegetation surveys in 33 fragmented, unmanaged dry grasslands in Southwest Finland. A total of 191 vascular plant species and 60 bryophyte species were recorded. Higher vascular plant diversity was associated with higher historical connectivity, whereas bryophyte diversity declined with increasing current connectivity. Edaphic conditions, microclimate and disturbances were found to structure both vascular plant and bryophyte communities, but the responses to individual environmental variables were very different. The contrasting responses could be explained by the differences between the typical life-history strategies in vascular plants and bryophytes as well as resource competition between the two groups. These results highlight the need to consider different species groups when planning conservation measures. Vascular plant richness may best be conserved in connected grasslands whereas bryophyte richness in isolated ones. The results also indicated that trampling by humans could result in positive disturbance and to some extent help maintain richness of grassland specialist species.

AB  - Green roofs are often promoted as a mean to counter the negative environmental effects of urbanization on nature and to increase the amount of green space in cities. Green roofs often enhance aboveground biodiversity, especially herbivores and pollinators. However, if and in what way they support belowground biodiversity, and more specifically soil fauna, is rarely studied. Therefore, we evaluated the diversity of a dominant group of soil fauna, Collembola (springtails), on twelve extensive green roofs in three cities in Belgium (Antwerp, Ghent and Hasselt), over a one year period. The roofs differed in height above the ground, surface area, vegetation type, and age, i.e. time since construction. We analysed if these roof characteristics influenced species richness, abundance or diversity of Collembola. In total we found ten species of Collembola. Species richness was not higher on roofs that were larger (habitat area) or closer to the ground (isolation to surrounding soil), indicating that island biogeographic theory is not applicable to species richness in our study system. However, significant differences in the mean number of individuals (abundance) were found between different months. Collembola taxonomical composition also varied between the roofs, but this variation could not be related to any of the measured roof variables. Roof communities were characterised by hemiedaphic life forms, preferring neutral to semi-moist conditions. Apart from the age of the roof that showed a positive significant impact on the abundance of Collembola present, our results suggested that the collembolan fauna showed no significant differences in abundance, species richness or diversity between roofs with different characteristics. However, we suggest that future studies are needed to investigate whether our findings are applicable to other groups of soil-living arthropods.

AB  - CONTEXT: Accelerated intensification/disintensification and urbanization are changing agricultural systems and propel the need for spatial approaches to understand sustainability-enhancing resilience. Landscapes are key to this understanding though little is known of the broad-scale, cross-landscape connectivity of social-ecological factors amid changing agricultural systems.OBJECTIVE: This study's goals are to identify broad-scale types of agricultural landscapes in Spain that are associated with intensification/disintensification and urbanization and then to use case studies to assess the types and extent of cross-landscape connectivity. It examines the social-ecological connectivity of environmental resources, resource users, and governance. The overarching purpose is to improve the understanding of socialecological connectivity in strengthening the sustainability-enhancing resilience of agricultural landscapes amid global agri-food changes.METHODS: To pursue these goals, we conducted a structured literature review of publications to identify major types of agricultural landscapes in Spain that reflect intensification/disintensification and urbanization trends. Case studies of agricultural landscapes and connectivity were undertaken in the Madrid and Granada regions. These case studies used a structured interview with experienced professional experts in fields of social-ecological sustainability and agricultural landscapes in each region. Analyses including Latent Block Modelling were applied to interview results on types and extent of cross-landscape connectivity in both conventional and alternative agriculture.RESULTS and CONCLUSIONS: The structured literature review identified the predominance of three types of broad-scale agricultural landscapes in Spain: intensive, "traditional" rural, and peri-urban/urban. Analysis of case-study results revealed variation of the extent and structure of connectivity among clusters of landscape interactions and social-ecological factors. Landscape-level connectivity created both negative agricultural impacts (e.g., extensive water transfers and nutrient pollution in conventional agriculture) and positive impacts (e. g., knowledge system and seed exchanges in alternative agriculture). Interactions of alternative agricultural systems in peri-urban/urban and "traditional" rural landscapes have benefitted from cross-landscape connectivity amid accelerated agricultural change.SIGNIFICANCE: Research and policy on the landscape-level connectivity of agricultural systems are needed to strengthen sustainability-enhancing resilience of both conventional and alternative agriculture. This study's approach and results are a strategic complement to existing emphasis on within-landscape cycles of socialecological factors in alternative agriculture. This study's insights are important in the transition phases of alternative agriculture and associated food systems amid changes due to agricultural intensification/disintensification and urbanization. Understanding selective cross-landscape connectivity is important for spatial approaches to strengthen the sustainability-enhancing resilience of agricultural systems.

AB  - We studied the ability of insect herbivores and their natural enemies to colonize exposed, potted mugwort plants (Artemisia vulgaris L.) along a rural-urban gradient in 1994 in Hamburg (northern Germany). Ectophagous insects, leafmines and galls were monitored weekly from mid-May to mid-September. Endophagous insects were counted by harvesting and dissecting the stems at the end of the growing season. The rural-urban gradient was characterized by a gradient of vegetation-free areas and increasing proportion of ground covered in concrete, tarmac, paving and other impermeable surfaces surrounding the Artemisia plots, i.e. six different zones of increasing isolation. Numbers of insect species (herbivores, parasitoids and predators) decreased along the gradient from 43 to 12. Monophagous herbivores were not more affected than polyphagous herbivores, but parasitoids, especially-rare species, were more strongly affected by isolation than predators. Some dominant herbivorous species were very successful colonizers and occurred in inner city sites devoid of all natural vegetation. Sometimes their abundance increased in the inner city to significantly higher densities than in the urban fringe. Isolation appeared to be the main reason for the observed patterns, since area and soil conditions were held constant in the experiment. Microclimate and pollution were considered to play a minor role.

AB  - 1. The spatial structure of plant patches has been shown to affect host-parasitoid interactions, but its influence on parasitoid diversity remains largely ignored. Here we tested the prediction that parasitoid species richness of the specialist leafminer Liriomyza commelinae increases in larger and less isolated patches of its host plant Commelina erecta. We also explored whether parasitoid abundance and body size affected the occurrence of parasitoid species in local assemblages.
   2. A total of 893 naturally established C. erecta patches were sampled on 18 sites around Cordoba city (Argentina). Also, two experiments were performed by creating patches differing in the number of plants and the distance from a parasitoid source. For these tests, plants were infected with the miner in the laboratory prior to placement in the field.
   3. Plant patch size, independently of host abundance, positively affected the number of parasitoid species in both survey observations and experimental data. However, plant patch isolation did not influence parasitoid species richness.
   4. The probability of finding rare parasitoid species increased with patch size, whereas occupation of isolated patches was independent of dispersal abilities (body size) of parasitoid species.
   5. Overall, the results highlight the importance of considering spatial aspects such as the size of plant patches in the study of parasitoid communities.

AB  - The urbanization process of Bogota has a direct impact on tree cover, because construction projects prioritize logging instead of transplant, and their landscape projects do not generate sufficient compensation. The progressive reduction of green spaces and trees, diminish the necessary habitats for the birds. In the management of the urban trees that includes activities of planting, pruning, transplant and logging, the city applies procedures to reduce its impact on avifauna. Its environmental authority has generated information to expand knowledge and allow understanding of the dynamics between trees and urban birds, which serves as a basis to analyze the efficiency of its action, both in the birdlife management procedure and in the design and selection of species in new tree plantings. This article shows statistics from a review of avifauna management final reports in various infrastructure projects and the work's results of a study prepared between the District Department of Environment -SDA- and the Bogota's Ornithology Association -ABO-, in which technical criteria are formulated for the ecological connectivity with emphasis on bird conservation and consolidation of restoration processes in the city's main ecological structure.

AB  - The Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River are imposing barriers for wildlife, and the additive effect of urban and agricultural development that dominates the lower Great Lakes region likely further reduces functional connectivity for many terrestrial species. As the climate warms, species will need to track climate across these barriers. It is important therefore to investigate land cover and bioclimatic hypotheses that may explain the northward expansion of species through the Great Lakes. We investigated the functional connectivity of a vagile generalist, the bobcat, as a representative generalist forest species common to the region. We genotyped tissue samples collected across the region at 14 microsatellite loci and compared different landscape hypotheses that might explain the observed gene flow or functional connectivity. We found that the Great Lakes and the additive influence of forest stands with either low or high canopy cover and deep lake-effect snow have disrupted gene flow, whereas intermediate forest cover has facilitated gene flow. Functional connectivity in southern Ontario is relatively low and was limited in part by the low amount of forest cover. Pathways across the Great Lakes were through the Niagara region and through the Lower Peninsula of Michigan over the Straits of Mackinac and the St. Marys River. These pathways are important routes for bobcat range expansion north of the Great Lakes and are also likely pathways that many other mobile habitat generalists must navigate to track the changing climate. The extent to which species can navigate these routes will be important for determining the future biodiversity of areas north of the Great Lakes.

AB  - Intra-city natural structures have always had a key role in creating sustainable urban greenspaces. Adapting to natural features and relating the intra-city greenspaces to such natural structures as river-valleys, hillsides, lakes and forests, guarantee the endurance, sustainability and longevity of the natural quality of city. This paper looks at intra-city natural structures which have undergone wholesale changes and been ruined, and considers the lives of these invaluable natural structures which have been endangered due to gross human interference and pressure, regardless of physical and biological features. River-valleys in Tehran have always had a significant role in offering valuable bio-environmental services to the city From the time of Qadjar era, villages enjoying favorable climate were built outside the city, and the villa of the governors and affluent people were built near hillsides across river-valleys because of the abundance of running water, cool weather in the summer and natural plant life. Little by little green corridors of Shemiranat were built near river-valleys, which formed the axes of the development of the city at the time Pahlavi dynasty. From then, the development of the city towards hillsides, regardless of these natural structures, increased and the destruction of these urban natural spaces have posed serious problems nowadays. Familiarity with these natural structures, their preservation and organization, and making the optimum use of them seem to be a very critical issue. Taking an ecological approach in this paper, is an attempt to look at the intra-city river-valleys. To do so, the data collected from a natural river-valley is used as evidence to back up any claims made in this regard.

AB  - Urban green space can help to reduce PM2.5 concentration by absorption and deposition processes. However, few studies have focused on the historical influence of green space on PM2.5 at a fine grid scale. Taking the central city of Wuhan as an example, this study has analyzed the spatiotemporal trend and the relationship between green space and PM2.5 in the last two decades. The results have shown that: (1) PM2.5 concentration reached a maximum value (139 mu g/m(3)) in 2010 and decreased thereafter. Moran's I index values of PM2.5 were in a downward trend, which indicates a sparser distribution; (2) from 2000 to 2019, the total area of green space decreased by 25.83%. The reduction in larger patches, increment in land cover diversity, and less connectivity led to fragmented spatial patterns of green space; and (3) the regression results showed that large patches of green space significantly correlated with PM2.5 concentration. The land use/cover diversity negatively correlated with the PM2.5 concentration in the ordinary linear regression. In conclusion, preserving large native natural habitats can be a supplemental measure to enlarge the air purification function of the green space. For cities in the process of PM2.5 reduction, enhancing the landscape patterns of green space provides a win-win solution to handle air pollution and raise human well-being.

AB  - The conservation of biological diversity in landscapes dominated by human use is emerging as an increasingly significant challenge, given the rate at which the Earth's remaining vegetation resources are being lost. Whilst traditional approaches to conservation have relied upon the ability of species to persist within the scattered fragments to which they have been confined, recent scientific evidence suggests that the long-term viability of fragmented populations may only be secured through the establishment of ecological connectivity between existing fragments.
   In the absence of a suitable methodology within which to design connective habitat configurations, a conceptual approach to landscape design was devised for a highly urbanised environment within the Shellharbour Local Government Area (LGA), New South Wales (NSW). This approach utilises beneficial landscape attributes advocated in the literature, and tailors existing rapid assessment methodologies traditionally used to provide simple measures of ecosystem health. Using this methodology, conservationally significant stepping-stone sites were identified between selected terminal habitat patches. The determination of an optimal corridor configuration linking these patches was found to heavily utilise riparian habitat and adjacent residential yard space. Planting endemic species in these areas will support ecological flow by increasing the area of core habitat relative to edge habitat. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The interrelated nature of landscape metrics calls for their joint application in analyzing complicated landscape patterns and associated ecological processes. Using geographic information system, remote-sensing and factor-analysis techniques, the landscape patterns of urban green spaces (UGS) in the compact city of Hong Kong were analyzed for their landscape-ecological quality in different land uses and districts. Using the Fragstat software, some key indices were selected to characterize the landscape mosaic with reference to patch size, patch shape, proximity relationship and edge configuration. Some old districts have smaller and more heterogeneous UGS than newer ones due to relatively low-quality landscape attributes. The landscape patterns of UGS have not improved with old-town renewal and new-town developments. In land uses with less human disturbance, UGS tend to be larger, and more homogeneous to enhance ecosystem services, and are closer to each other with more green cover to enhance connectivity and facilitate movements of organisms and people between proximal patches. Furthermore, vegetation-dominated land uses often have more complicated and hence longer UGS edges than other land uses to augment interfacial benefits. Of the 11 land uses, Government, institution and community and open space have more complicated UGS edges than more human-dominated types. The findings could inform the landscape-pattern design of UGS in compact cities to optimize their ecological qualities and benefits to both nature and residents, and to reinforce urban nature conservation.

AB  - We studied population size, genetic diversity and differentiation of common frog (Rana temporaria) populations at urban golf courses and reference natural ponds in the greater Helsinki region, southern Finland. A total of 248 tadpoles from 12 locations (six golf courses, six reference sites) were genotyped with 13 polymorphic microsatellite markers. The most urban populations, situated in northern Helsinki, were the largest breeding sites having > 120 (golf courses) and > 200 (reference sites) spawn clumps at the time of sampling. On average, there was no difference in the number of spawns between the anthropogenic ponds at golf courses and the natural water bodies. Genetic variation within populations was substantial (H (O) = 0.68) while genetic differentiation between populations was low (F (ST) = 0.016; average distance = 17.6 km). The golf course populations did not differ from natural populations in terms of genetic variability or differentiation. Hence, our results suggest that golf courses contribute positively to urban amphibian populations by providing suitable water bodies for reproduction and green corridors for dispersal, thus preventing isolation and loss of genetic variability within populations.

AB  - Hundreds of plants and half a kilogram of seeds of Spartina alterniflora, which were collected from Morehead City in North Carolina, Sapelo Island in Georgia, and Tampa Bay in Florida, were introduced to China in 1979. However, according to documented records, S. alterniflora from different origins were introduced to different areas when the species was first introduced to the coastal areas of China in the 1980s. In order to understand the relationship between the invasive S. alterniflora populations of China and the native S. alterniflora populations of the United States, and whether the genetic structure and genetic diversity of the invasive populations of China were affected by different introductions in the 1980s, molecular markers were used to determine the levels of gene flow and its effect on population differentiation. A total of 715 samples of S. alterniflora were collected from nine invasive populations in China and nine native populations from the United States. The genetic diversity and genetic structure of invasive and native populations were compared using microsatellite markers. The heterozygosity of Chinese invasive populations of S. alterniflora (H-O = 0.538, H-E = 0.725) were similar with those of native populations (H-O = 0.530, H-E = 0.744), which may attribute to its multiple introductions with the multisource populations from different geographic areas of the United States. However, the lower allelic diversities of Chinese invasive populations were detected, which may be due to the founder effect, or the bottleneck, which supports the theory that the allelic diversity is more sensitive to population bottlenecks than heterozygosity. The results of the STRUCTURE analysis among all sampling sites showed that the value of Delta K was largest when K = 2, which indicated that the invasive S. alterniflora populations in China had completed differentiated from the native populations of the United States. This may be because of admixture and hybridization of three non-overlapping original populations, or the postintroduction rapid evolution in China, and reproductive isolation under long-term geographic isolation. There was significant differentiation among invasive populations, which was mainly affected by different human-mediated introductions in 1980s. Significant genetic structure (K = 7) and high genetic differentiation (Fst = 0.30193) were detected in Chinese invasive populations, which may due to the low natural gene flow among populations. The genetic structure of the invasive populations in China was still affected by the human-mediated introductions in the 1980s, and the different initial introductions might promote differentiation among the invasive populations. In fact, the human-mediated long-distance dispersal should take the most of responsibility for the rapid spread of S. alterniflora along the coast of China. Multisource introductions of S. alterniflora are perhaps helpful for local adaptation but itself cannot cause rapid spread along the whole coast of China. Meanwhile, we suggest that the prevention of gene exchange among populations of S. alterniflora is the first and most important step in the control of the species on the coast of China, because admixture and hybridization of isolated populations might generate new heterosis and increase the difficulty of managing S. alterniflora in China.

AB  - Anthropogenic disturbances can have negative effects on species assemblages. This study was established to form baseline data on the environmental structure and reptile assemblages within a planned energy corridor in Pinal County, Arizona, prior to construction. We emphasized evaluating the differences in reptile assemblages in two subdivisions of the Sonoran Desertscrub, the Lower Colorado River Valley (LCV) and Arizona Uplands (AZU). Surveys were conducted on 50 sites (LCV = 15; AZU = 35) along the proposed 67.1-km long energy corridor through environmental surveys and 50 drift-fence trapping arrays with 400 box funnel traps. Vegetation height, number of burrows, and percent rock, ground cover, and coarse woody debris were significantly higher in the AZU than in LCV. Eighteen reptile species (n = 995 captures) were detected on the energy corridor including 8 lizard species (n = 952 captures) and 10 snake species (n = 43 captures). Species richness, evenness, and capture rates were not significantly different between the LCV and AZU; however, species diversity was significantly higher in the LCV. Reptile abundance (LCV = 281; AZU = 714) differed in the two subdivisions, yet rank-abundance curves revealed no difference in dominance of species. Post hoc examination revealed that the geographic separation of sites within the LCV and the location of the study area (along the ecotone) may have contributed to our results. We conclude that both subdivisions are equally important to the maintenance of local biotic diversity and recommend that any future land set-asides consider both subdivisions.

AB  - Pollinators are among the first to be lost when natural habitat is reduced to small patches and this can have cascading effects on multiple plant species. Simultaneously, the loss of natural habitat cuts people off from nature and, when people are out of touch with nature they do not care for biodiversity, resulting in further losses. Theoretically, the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on pollinators can be mitigated by reconnecting isolated conservation areas with stepping stones and, if these are located in an urban matrix, they offer opportunities for people to reconnect with nature. Here we assess the effect of creating stepping stone habitats for nectar-feeding birds across Cape Town, South Africa. With the help of pupils, we planted gardens of indigenous, bird-pollinated plants at eight schools in the urbanized matrix between two conservation areas. To test for change in the bird community on school grounds we conducted 398 bird observation sessions over a seven-year period. Changes in attitudes and knowledge were assessed with questionnaires distributed to 176 pupils. We found that, as gardens matured, nectar availability increased and the probability of observing a Southern Doublecollared Sunbird (Cinnyris chalybeus) on school grounds during a 30 min period increased from 10% to 50%. Bird species richness increased from -5 to -7 species. Questionnaire scores increased by 30% in participating pupils versus 8% in non-participating pupils. Although effects were small, the results suggest that it is possible to restore the bird-pollination mutualism in cities and in the process reconnect people with nature.

AB  - Urban riparian zones are highly valuable for a range of environmental, social and economic reasons. Despite their ecological complexity, legislative instruments underpinning riparian protection focus predominantly on minimum corridor widths required to fulfill environmental functions. This study sought to identify the dominant environmental variables that influence riparian corridor biodiversity in northern Sydney, Australia. Ant and plant assemblages were sampled from 18 riparian corridors of various widths. Environmental data pertaining to each corridor were collected using field and desktop surveys. Generalised Linear Modelling found perimeter:area ratio and the gradient of the slope perpendicular to the stream to predict significantly ant and plant richness. Plant richness was also influenced by vegetation community type and corridor width. When streamside vegetation communities were considered in isolation, many of the same factors were found to influence species richness. Likewise, Distance-based Linear Modelling identified vegetation community type and landscape connectivity as significant predictors of ant composition both in streamside habitats and those located across the full width of each riparian corridor sampled. While width was the best predictor of plant assemblage composition across the whole riparian corridor, streamside vegetation was influenced more significantly by soil pH. This result arose principally due to a dominance of exotic plants in alkaline soils. Although wider corridors were likely to encompass a greater variety of biotic assemblages, landscape and site scale environmental characteristics appeared to be of greater ecological significance. Environmental managers should therefore consider these factors and target weed invasion when seeking to enhance biodiversity in urban riparian corridors. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conversion and fragmentation of wildlife habitat often leads to smaller and isolated populations and can reduce a species' ability to disperse across the landscape. As a consequence, genetic drift can quickly lower genetic variation and increase vulnerability to extirpation. For species of conservation concern, quantification of population size and connectivity can clarify the influence of genetic drift in local populations and provides important information for conservation management and recovery strategies. Here, we used genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and capture-mark-recapture methods to evaluate the genetic diversity and demography within seven focal sites of the endangered San Francisco gartersnake (Thamnophis sirtalis tetrataenia), a species affected by alteration and isolation of wetland habitats throughout its distribution. The primary goals were to determine the population structure and degree of genetic isolation among T. s. tetrataenia populations and estimate effective size and population abundance within sites to better understand the present and future importance of genetic drift. We also used temporally sampled datasets to examine the magnitude of genetic change over time. We found moderate population genetic structure throughout the San Francisco Peninsula that partitions sites into northern and southern regional clusters. Point estimates of both effective size and population abundance were generally small (<= 100) for a majority of the sites, and estimates were particularly low in the northern populations. Genetic analyses of temporal datasets indicated an increase in genetic differentiation, especially for the most geographically isolated sites, and decreased genetic diversity over time in at least one site (Pacifica). Our results suggest that drift-mediated processes as a functiyon of small population size and reduced connectivity from neighboring populations may decrease diversity and increase differentiation. Improving genetic diversity and connectivity among T. s. tetrataenia populations could promote persistence of this endangered snake.

AB  - Rapid rates of urbanisation affect biodiversity through habitat fragmentation and loss. Because urban golf courses are large green spaces, they potentially harbour much biodiversity if managed for such. The area of untransformed land of golf courses in the Eastern Cape (South Africa) was determined using Geographic Information System (GIS), the woody plant composition of a subsample was determined by field sampling and the greenkeepers were interviewed. There was a significant relationship between climate and woody cover, species richness and percentage native plants but not species diversity. There was no relationship between management scores and species richness, diversity and percentage native. Significant relationships were evident between woody plant species richness and course income, number of grounds staff, number of club members and greenkeepers' years of experience. These results suggest a complex suite of factors that play a role in the woody plant composition of urban golf courses and their contribution to urban biodiversity.

AB  - Urbanization represents the most extreme form of land cover transformation and is expected to restrict dispersal of animals, both because of the structural unsuitability of the novel habitat, as well as through mechanisms associated with human activity, such as disturbance. Fragmentation of populations by urbanization is considered to be a significant threat to several endangered bird populations, although isolation has seldom been demonstrated genetically. The aim of this study was to explore the utility of genetic criteria for identifying at-risk populations, using a salt-marsh-inhabiting bird, the white-fronted chat Epthianura albifrons, as a case study. DNA was extracted from feathers from 78 individuals from five sites, including two salt marsh remnants situated within the intensively urbanized zone of a city of more than three million people, and three sites up to 500 km distant. Microsatellite markers were used to measure genetic diversity and compare genetic structure between populations. Analyses of population structure demonstrated that the two populations surrounded by intensive urban development were genetically distinct from each other despite being separated by less than 20 km. They were also distinct from larger populations beyond the urban zone that showed much lower levels of genetic differentiation and no evidence of isolation by distance, despite being separated by continuous forest, which is not a recognized habitat for this species. The two endangered populations had low levels of genetic diversity reflected in the number of alleles and heterozygosity. Two immigrants were detected in one of the isolated populations, but their reproductive success was very low and they failed to effect genetic rescue. This study demonstrates that the endangered population satisfies the genetic criteria for listing, and although the population is unlikely to have special evolutionary significance in itself, flagging the population highlights the vulnerability of some coastal fauna to the impacts of urbanization.

AB  - Urbanization results in major changes in stream morphology, hydrology, and water quality; the consequences on fish assemblage of Neotropical urban streams remain poorly understood. Due to the importance of better understanding fish assemblage responses towards urbanization in biodiversity hotspots, we evaluated the factors structuring the fish assemblages in a Neotropical mediumsized city. Additionally, we evaluated possible differences in fish diversity and biotic homogenization between the urban and control streams. To do so, fish were sampled along with physical habitat and water quality parameters in 16 urban streams in southern Brazil. Multiple regression and distance-based linear models (DistLM) were used to assess the importance of predictor variables in determining species richness and fish assemblage composition, respectively. The fish abundance rank curves were plotted to evaluate graphic differences in fish diversity between urban and control streams, while the relationship between distance and similarity (Bray-Curtis index) was used to evaluate biotic homogenization. The results revealed the importance of variables linking habitat diversity and basin connectivity to fish assemblage richness and structure. In addition, riparian vegetation was the main driver of fish assemblages, explaining 78% of abundance variation. We identified lower diversity and higher biotic homogenization in urban streams, with higher dominance of the non-native species Poecilia reticulata. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating the physical and biotic variables of streams outside of water pollution levels alone. Finally, it is necessary to support urban planning practices that recover riparian vegetation, avoid canalization, and promote connectivity along stream networks as well as the removal of artificial structures in urban basins.

AB  - This article uses a multiscale approach for assessing landscape changes in one of the world's biodiversity hotspots in Brazil, the Rio Doce State Park (PERD). In this article, we assess land use changes over a 30 year period. Our results show that, while inside the park landscape changes were minimal, in the park buffer zone human induced changes are steadily rising due to an increase in eucalyptus plantations and urban sprawl that grew by 4% and 1.9%, respectively. Agricultural land has been reduced by 6.35%, but there are trends that a form of welcome forest transition has been occurring. We report an increase in native forests from 40,588 ha in 1985 to 45,690 ha in 2015. The analysis of human impacts in the study area delivers very different results when varying the pixel size from 25 ha to 900 m(2). The former shows a very high level of human influence while the latter reveals small but vital patches of native forest offering hopeful opportunities for sustainable natural resource management in this critical biome. Our work stresses the importance of better targeted policy making and sympathetic land use management of buffer zones of protected areas. Currently, such zones suffer from many development pressures and often experience contradictory policy frameworks which encourage a clash between biodiversity conservation and intensive agro husbandry production.

AB  - The consequent deforestation of urban sprawl is one of the causes of the decline of wild bee communities. In this context, urban green areas (UGA) may play an important role and constitute refuge areas for bees. This study analyzed the influence of UGA conditions and their surroundings in bee guilds' responses in a medium-sized Brazilian city (Campos dos Goytacazes, RJ). The bees were sampled for 12 months (2017-2018) in 12 UGAs, and bee abundance and species richness were evaluated in guilds considering: nesting behavior, nesting site, and trophic specialization. We used as explanatory variables conditions of UGAs-the number of trees (NT), diameter at breast height (DBH), flower cover (FC), plant richness (PR), percentage of paving (PV)-and of their surroundings-paving (SPV) and the number of buildings (NB). Results showed 80% of eusocial bees, 82% nest in cavities, and 99% were generalists. FC, DBH, and NB mainly explained the responses of different guilds in study areas from all explanatory variables. Thus, this study confirms different responses associated with bee guilds' attributes. In order to conserve bee diversity, city planning must include more green areas with large flower covers and avoid long corridors of high buildings that can impact bee dispersion.

AB  - Urban green spaces (UGSs) play a crucial role in supporting urban ecological systems and improving human well-being in cities. The spatial patterns of UGS are vital bases for analyzing various ecological processes. However, few studies have investigated morphological UGS patterns, especially in high-density cities. The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) in China is one of the four major bay areas in the world. The aim of this study was to investigate the patterns and distributions of UGS in the core GBA cities (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Hong Kong, and Macao), and discuss the shortcomings and potential environmental impacts of the contemporary patterns of UGS. Morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) was used to analyze the spatial UGS pattern. Seven MSPA metrics (core, islet, perforation, edge, loop, bridge, and branch) were assessed to measure morphological UGS patterns. The results showed that: (1) Hong Kong has the highest quality habitat, with a large and continuous distribution of UGSs, and a few smaller green spaces scattered in built-up areas; (2) Guangzhou's UGSs are unevenly distributed, with large green spaces concentrated in the northern part of the city and many small, scattered green spaces distributed in built-up areas, demonstrating the most prominent pattern of green space fragmentation; (3) green space patches in the Shenzhen-Hong Kong region exhibit a relatively complex form; and (4) the UGS in Zhuhai-Macao is relatively discrete, and its connectivity is relatively low. These findings not only improve the depth of understanding of the spatial pattern of UGS in the GBA, but also confirm the applicability of MSPA in the analysis of spatial patterns of UGS.

AB  - Avian influenza virus subtype H9N2 is endemic in Bangladesh's poultry population. The subtype affects poultry production and poses a potential zoonotic risk. Insufficient understanding of how the poultry trading network shapes the dissemination of avian influenza viruses has hindered the design of targeted interventions to reduce their spread. Here, we use phylodynamic analyses of haemagglutinin sequences to investigate the spatial spread and dispersal patterns of H9N2 viruses in Bangladesh's poultry population, focusing on its two largest cities (Dhaka and Chattogram) and their poultry production and distribution networks. Our analyses suggest that H9N2 subtype avian influenza virus lineage movement occurs relatively less frequently between Bangladesh's two largest cities than within each city. H9N2 viruses detected in single markets are often more closely related to viruses from other markets in the same city than to each other, consistent with close epidemiological connectivity between markets. Our analyses also suggest that H9N2 viruses may spread more frequently between chickens of the three most commonly sold types (sunali-a cross-bred of Fayoumi hen and Rhode Island Red cock, deshi-local indigenous, and exotic broiler) in Dhaka than in Chattogram. Overall, this study improves our understanding of how Bangladesh's poultry trading system impacts avian influenza virus spread and should contribute to the design of tailored surveillance that accommodates local heterogeneity in virus dispersal patterns.

AB  - Extensive agricultural and urban development has contributed to the decline of riparian forests across North America. An urban-rural gradient was used to identify species- and guild-level indicators of riparian forest degradation in southern Manitoba. Twenty-five sites were categorized according to urban, suburban, high-intensity rural, low-intensity rural, and relatively high quality reference land use. Generalists, which frequented all land use types, dominated (69%) the understorey community, whereas opportunistic (15%) and vulnerable (16%) species were relatively less common. Opportunistic species, which characterized city sites, tended to be exotic, woody and annual, and effective dispersers (i.e., endozoochores). In contrast, vulnerable species, which characterized non-city sites, tended to be native, perennial, and ineffective dispersers (i.e., barochores or anemochores). Indicators of disturbed forests were opportunistic and positively associated with disturbance measures including connectivity and cover of garbage, and negatively correlated with native and overall diversity. They included exotics Solanum dulcamara, Rhamnus cathartica, and Lonicera tartarica. In contrast, indicators of high-integrity forest were vulnerable, often excluded from urban sites and were negatively associated with disturbance measures and positively correlated with native and overall diversity. They included natives Rubus idaeus, Carex spp., and Galium triflorum. Our results suggest that opportunistic and vulnerable species, and their associated guilds, can be used as effective indicators of disturbance and forest integrity and to identify forest patches that warrant further protection or restoration.

AB  - For better or worse, in those parts of the world with a widespread farming, livestock rising, and urban expansion, the maintenance of species richness and ecosystem services cannot depend only upon protected natural sites. Can they rely on a network of cultural landscapes endowed with their own associated biodiversity? We analyze the effects of land-cover change on landscape ecological patterns and processes that sustain bird species richness associated to cropland-grassland landscapes in the Great Plains-Denver metropolitan edge. Our purpose is to assess the potential contribution to bird biodiversity maintenance of Great Plain's cropland-grassland mosaics kept as farmland green belts in the edge of metropolitan areas. We present a quantitative landscape ecology assessment of land-cover changes (1930-2010) experienced in five Great Plains counties in Colorado. Several landscape metrics assess the diversity of land-cover patterns and their impact on ecological connectivity indices. These metrics are applied to historical land-cover maps and datasets drawn from aerial photos and satellite imagery. The results show that the cropland-grassland mosaics that link the metropolitan edge with the surrounding habitats sheltered in less human-disturbed areas provide a heterogeneous land matrix were a high bird species richness exists. They also suggest that keeping multifunctional farmland-grassland green belts near the edge of metropolitan areas may provide important ecosystem services, supplementing traditional conservation policies. Our maps and indicators can be used for selecting certain types of landscape patterns and priority areas on which biodiversity conservation efforts and land-use planning can concentrate.

AB  - This work aimed to evaluate domestication effects on the genetic structure of two dioecious species Brosimum alicastrum Sw. (Moraceae) and Spondias purpurea L. (Anacardiaceae), and a heterostylous one Cordia dodecandra A. DC. (Cordiaceae), growing in remnant forests and homegardens within two climatic regions of the Peninsula of Yucatan. The trees of B. alicastrum and C. dodecandra are propagated by seeds in both population types, while those of S. purpurea are propagated asexually in the homegardens. ISSRs genetic markers were amplified from foliar tissue of 18 to 21 plants per population type/region combination for each species. Genetic diversity, genetic differentiation, and genetic structure estimators were obtained and compared among species at the regional and population level. We found higher polymorphism (37.5-41), but lower private alleles (4-4.4) and similar heterozygosity (0.1-0.12) in the species with sexual reproduction compared to S. purpurea (34, 8, and 0.11, respectively). Genetic diversity in B. alicastrum populations varied with the region; in C. dodecandra, to the population type; and in S. purpurea, to both the population type and the region. Unrestricted gene flow among regions was suggested by low phi(RT) in C. dodecandra and S. purpurea (-0.006 and 0.002) but not for B. alicastrum (0.1). Gene flow between populations within the regions for the sexually reproducing species was suggested by lower theta(II) (0.005-0.07 and 0.008-0.1) estimates than those of S. purpurea (0.09 and 0.13). Even though the lowest paired F-ST (0.002-0.05) and phi(ST) (0.002-0.12) values were found between the northeastern forest and homegarden populations for the three species, the dendrogram, Bayesian assignment, and K-Means analyses suggest that the least differentiated populations are southwestern forest and homegarden populations of B. alicastrum and S. purpurea, and the southwestern forest and northeastern homegarden of C. dodecandra. The sexual reproduction, biotic interactions, and extensive management of B. alicastrum and C. dodecandra in the agroforestry and the urban systems may contribute to connectivity between wild and domesticated populations, while in S. purpurea this connectivity is interrupted by the clonal propagation of the species in the homegardens.

AB  - Tenebrionid beetle records from 55 sites in urban Rome (Italy) were used to study the influence of structural parameters (area, isolation, forest cover, and shape) of green spaces on species richness and extinction trends. In line with biogeographical predictions, species richness correlated positively with area size of green spaces, extinction was enhanced by isolation and hindered by area size, but, in contrast with common findings, forest extent had a negative impact on tenebrionid persistence. This is explained by the fact that most of tenebrionid species from Rome are associated with open habitats typical of the landscape that characterized the study area before modern urbanization. In contrast with results obtained in other studies of urban ecology, distance to city centre (which expresses the urban-rural gradient) was never recovered as an important correlate of tenebrionid richness or extinction, which may be explained by the fact that tenebrionids include both urban avoider and urban adapter species. These results warn against making generalizations on urban diversity patterns and conservation strategies without reference to past land-use and species characteristics.

AB  - Dispersal is a key element of the invasion process for introduced species, and is influenced by landscape connectivity. The red-bellied squirrel (Callosciurus erythraeus) was introduced to Argentina in 1970. Suitable forest habitat for this arboreal species is highly fragmented in a rural-urban matrix, but despite this, the squirrel population has spread. Squirrels disperse into new habitat patches using connective features such as forest corridors. They may also cross gaps but up to what extent is not known. Gap crossing success is influenced by perceptual range, which is the distance from which animals can perceive suitable habitat. Perceptual range has been previously estimated for vulnerable species, but not for introduced species. We used a model relating perceptual range to body mass to predict the perceptual range of the red-bellied tree squirrel in Argentina. We then tested our prediction of 202-221 m by releasing squirrels in an unfamiliar arable field at different distances (300, 200, 100 and 20 m) from woodland habitat. We assumed that if woodland could be perceived, squirrels would orientate toward it. We estimated perceptual range to be between 20 and 100 m, considerably lower than predicted. Our results indicate that squirrels can potentially cross small habitat gaps, but dispersal over greater distances lacking connectivity is less likely. Incorporating this information when modelling the spread of exotic squirrels in the Pampas Region can yield more accurate prediction of the invasion process and guide management practices to minimise their expansion.

AB  - Anthropogenic impacts contribute to the fragmentation of urban mangrove forests, and in the Sydney region of Australia, Avicennia marina is commonly found in small stands of < 50 adult trees that have altered pollinator services. However, genetic diversity may not vary with stand size because insufficient time has passed since stands were established or pollen and propagule dispersal are sufficient to overwhelm the effects of genetic drift and founder events. We tested the predictions that, despite the potential of mangroves for dispersal of propagules by water and long distance dispersal of pollen by honeybees, fragmentation and localized foraging by honeybees causes small stands of A. marina to display reduced genetic diversity and elevated inbreeding. Using four microsatellite markers, we quantified the genetic and genotypic diversity present within samples of 20 adults taken from three large (> 1500 trees), intermediate (300-500 trees) and small (< 50 trees) stands within each of two urbanized estuaries and estimated mating system parameters using progeny arrays for sets of five adults within the large and small stands. We detected no significant effect of stand size on levels of single-locus genetic diversity. There were low, although significant, levels of allelic differentiation within (F (SE) = 0.021, P = 0.003) and among (F (ET) = 0.055, P = 0.005) estuaries but no evidence of isolation by distance. In contrast, our analysis of progeny arrays revealed that, while all stands displayed high levels of biparental inbreeding, an expected consequence of pollination by honeybees, current outcrossing rates (t (m) ) were significantly lower in small (0.55) as compared to large (0.75) stands. The genetic makeup of the adult populations imply that stands are interconnected and suggest little impact of habitat fragmentation, while the progeny arrays suggest that plants within small stands may display reduced fitness.

AB  - Purpose The white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) is an important reservoir host for the pathogen responsible for Lyme disease in eastern North-America. Indigenous cases of Lyme disease in southern Quebec have increased from two cases in 2004 to 160 cases in 2015. Because of the strong relationship between the white-footed mouse occurrence and the Lyme disease pathogen prevalence, we can estimate the risk of Lyme disease by finding areas of high contact between mice. In this study, we inferred the movement patterns and contact rate of the white-footed mouse in southern Quebec.
   Methods We used pattern-orientated modelling to estimate a directional measure of functional connectivity from an Individual-Based Model. We replicated the spatial pattern observed in previously published molecular analysis of a white-footed mouse population.
   Results A perceptual range of 80 m best explained the genetic structure of the white-footed mouse in the region. The paths of individuals generally overlapped the edges of urban centers and the boundary of linear obstacles such as highways and water bodies. We show that the contact probability of mice was a good predictor of the number of mice caught in the field.
   Conclusions Our findings highlight the usefulness of individual-based models to potentially predict high contact areas and disease hotspots across landscapes.

AB  - Riparian vegetation performs important ecosystem functions, since it maintains regional biodiversity and provides a range of environmental services. However, anthropogenic activity, land use type, and edge effects are factors that modify the riparian species assemblage and properties. The present study analyzes the influence of adjacent land use on the structure and diversity of riparian vegetation in four hydrographic regions that form the watershed of the river Duero, in the state of Michoacan, Mexico. Using a survey of woody plants of dbh a parts per thousand yen 2.5 cm in ten different 0.1 ha sites, we found that the average number of stems and individuals was lower under agricultural (AGR) and urban (URB) land use, compared to forested areas (FOR). The proportion of multistemmed plants differs among land uses: this value was greater in AGR than in the FOR and URB categories. This proportion also differed among the four hydrographic regions. The land use type FOR presented the highest alpha and beta diversity, with a high number of native species occurring only in areas defined by this land use. The results indicate that the category FOR plays an important role in the conservation of regional flora and is a possible source of germplasm for restoration programs in sites degraded by human disturbance. This study shows how anthropogenic activities affect riparian vegetation and highlights the importance of further study of this ecosystem to apply sustainable management strategies that are compatible with its conservation.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation can have severe negative and irreversible effects on biodiversity. We investigated the effects of forest fragmentation on frog diversity in Singapore because of its high rates of deforestation and the demonstration that frogs are some of the most sensitive species to habitat degradation. We surveyed frog species in 12 forest fragments varying from 11 to 935 ha. We compared differences in species richness, abundance, and Shannon's index in relation to forest fragment size, connectivity (distance between fragments), and breeding habitat heterogeneity. A total of 20 species from 12 genera and five families were encountered in 12 fragments. Larger fragments and those closer to larger fragments had higher species richness. Abundance, however, was not correlated with forest area or connectivity, but we found fewer individual frogs in the larger fragments. We also found that breeding habitat heterogeneity best explained frog species diversity and abundance in forest fragments. Fragments with a high diversity of breeding habitats had more species. We found no evidence to suggest that abundance and diversity are strongly correlated, particularly in disturbed areas, but that breeding habitat heterogeneity is an under-appreciated factor that should be considered when prioritizing areas for anuran conservation. Enriching breeding habitat heterogeneity, creating corridors between fragments, and reforesting degraded areas are some of the most beneficial strategies for preserving urban frog biodiversity.

AB  - The alteration of landscapes by human activities worldwide has forced many animal species to persist in remnants of natural habitats. One of the best examples of this process occurs in central-east Argentina, where the original prairies were almost completely replaced by agricultural land, cattle production areas and increasing urbanization. We used nine microsatellite loci to analyze the population genetic structure of the Sigmodontine rodent Calomys musculinus in two anthropically altered habitats: an agroecosystem and a city. Rodents inhabiting urban vacant lots showed higher levels of relatedness and genetic differentiation than rodents inhabiting the agroecosystem. Urban rodents presented a pattern of isolation by distance: in the rural habitat this pattern was present only along the border of a secondary road, but not over the entire area surveyed. In the city, a spatially limited but buffered environment, populations would be small, demographically stable, and dispersal would be restricted. On the contrary, in agroecosystems populations would experience a high rate of turn over: local demes would originate each year by a mixture of overwintering individuals, and dispersal would occur preferentially along the weedy borders of fields.

AB  - Analyzing the genetic diversity of a population can be useful in identifying some of the silent effects of habitat fragmentation. We examined and compared 4 mitochondrial loci of the near threatened Short-tailed Babbler (Pellorneum malaccense), a rainforest understory bird, between a highly fragmented population in Singapore and populations from elsewhere in the Sundaic region. We found that the fragmented Singaporean population is genetically impoverished, with <20% of the intrapopulation genetic diversity present in a comparable sample from Borneo within intact forest. Differences in haplotype diversity among Singaporean sites of occurrence suggest that there may be extremely poor genetic diversity and connectivity among Singaporean subpopulations. These findings highlight the importance of connectivity in maintaining population genetic diversity in urban tropical forest patches. Our results also corroborate previous findings that there are 3 deeply diverged lineages of Short-tailed Babbler across the Sundaic region.

AB  - Here, the abundance of macro-invertebrates (Arthropoda and Gastropoda) of eight green roofs and their adjacent ground level habitats in the city of Antwerp, Belgium, is compared. All higher-level taxa found were present in both types of habitats without significant differences in their overall abundance between green roofs and ground level habitats. However, we found significant differences in abundances between the two types of habitats, when specific taxa were compared. Beetles (Coleoptera), isopods (Isopoda) and bees (Anthophila) were more abundant at ground level sites compared to green roofs, while for true bugs (Heteroptera) and cicadas (Auchenorrhyncha) the opposite was found. Our results support the idea that extensive green roofs in Belgium can provide a suitable habitat for different invertebrate taxa, but further research is needed to identify the true drivers behind differences in abundance between ground level and adjacent green roofs.

AB  - Urban vegetation is an essential element of the urban city pedestrian walkway. Despite city forest regulations and urban planning best practices, vegetation planning lacks clear comprehension and compatibility with other urban elements surrounding it. Urban planners and academic researchers currently devote vital attention to include most of the urban elements and their impact on the occupants and the environment in the planning stage of urban development. With the advancement in computational design, they have developed various algorithms to generate design alternatives and measure their impact on the environment that meets occupants' needs and perceptions of their city. In particular, multi-agent-based simulations show great promise in developing rule compliance with urban vegetation design tools. This paper proposed an automatic urban vegetation city rule compliance approach for pedestrian pathway vegetation, leveraging multi-agent system and algorithmic modeling tools. This approach comprises three modules: rule compliance (T-Rule), street vegetation design tool (T-Design), and multi-agent alternative generation (T-Agent). Notably, the scope of the paper is limited to trees, shrubbery, and seating area configurations in the urban pathway context. To validate the developed design tool, a case study was tested, and the vegetation design tool generated the expected results successfully. A questionnaire was conducted to give feedback on the use of the developed tool for enhancing positive experience of the developed tool. It is anticipated that the proposed tool has the potential to aid urban planners in decision-making and develop more practical vegetation planting plans compared with the conventional Two-Dimensional (2D) plans, and give the city occupants the chance to take part in shaping their city by merely selecting from predefined parameters in a user interface to generate their neighborhood pathway vegetation plans. Moreover, this approach can be extended to be embedded in an interactive map where city occupants can shape their neighborhood greenery and give feedback to urban planners for decision-making.

AB  - Extreme hydrological events (floods, droughts) in flowing waters can alter habitat availability and structure and produce significant shifts in biodiversity, species assemblages and ecosystem processes. Extreme floods and droughts occur over large spatial extents and can greatly alter links between streams and their catchments. The nature and strengths of these links differ between degraded and intact streams and their catchments, strongly influencing the responses to and recovery from extreme events. It is essential that these catchment-stream linkages be identified and considered when planning stream restoration. Despite the scarcity of comprehensive, long-term monitoring of most stream restoration projects, our understanding of the influence of extreme events on running waters suggests both positive and negative impacts on restoration efforts. Extreme hydrological events can impair stream restoration efforts giving rise to delays or complete failures in achieving restoration objectives. Alternatively, extreme floods may facilitate progress towards restoration goals by engendering key ecological processes. Understanding the impacts and the temporal-spatial scales over which extreme events alter the ecological structure and function of streams (in both natural and damaged systems), as well as their underlying mechanisms, is a challenge for stream restorers that will only progress with the accumulation of long-term data. Restorers should recognise and plan for hydrological extreme events and their interactions with other disturbances (e.g. fire, urban development). Increasing connectivity of restoration efforts along with their spatial extent can lessen the negative effects of extreme hydrological events on stream restoration. Successful ecological stream restoration requires long time spans and thus with a changing climate the prediction of more frequent and intense extreme events only strengthens the need to incorporate their likelihood into restoration planning and implementation.

AB  - Natural habitats, and the populations they sustain, are becoming increasingly fragmented by human activities. Parallels between 'true' islands and 'habitat' islands suggest that standing levels of individual genetic diversity in naturally fragmented populations may predict the genetic fate of their anthropogenically fragmented counterparts, but this hypothesis remains largely untested. We compared neutral-locus genetic diversity of individual song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) breeding in a naturally fragmented landscape (small coastal islands) to that of song sparrows in similar-sized 'urban islands' separated by roads and housing developments rather than by water. Individuals on coastal islands were more heterozygous and less inbred than those in urban islands. Estimates of population genetic structuring (assessed by pairwise genetic differentiation and Bayesian clustering methods) and contemporary dispersal (based on assignment tests) revealed little structure within either landscape, suggesting that lack of connectivity at the geographic scale we investigated cannot explain the reduced heterozygosity of urban birds. However, within-site genetic similarity was higher in the urban than the coastal landscape. Assuming that historic genetic diversity was similar in these two environments, our findings suggest that anthropogenically fragmented populations may lose genetic diversity faster than their naturally fragmented counterparts.

AB  - Yeast abundance and diversity were studied in the soils (topsoil) of Moscow city: urban soils under lawn vegetation and close to the areas of household waste disposal, as well as in zonal soddy-podzolic soils (retisols) in parks (Losiny Ostrov and Izmailovo). The numbers of soil yeasts were similar in all studied urban biocenoses (on average 3.5 x 10(3) CFU/g). From all studied soils, 54 yeast species were isolated. The highest yeast diversity was found in the soils adjacent to the areas of household waste storage. Soils from different urban sites were found to have different ratios of ascomycetous and basidiomycetous yeasts: basidiomycetes predominated in urban soils under lawn vegetation, while in the areas close to the waste disposal sites their share was considerably lower. The differences between the studied urban soils were also found in the structure of soil yeast complexes. In urban soils with high anthropogenic impact, the isolation frequency of clinically important yeast species (Candida parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, Diutina catenulata, and Pichia kudriavzevii) was as high as 35% of all studied samples, while its share in the community was 17%. The factors responsible for development of specific features of yeast communities in various urban soils are discussed in the paper.

AB  - Genetic studies constitute a powerful approach to study the introduction and expansion of invasive species. Senecio inaequidens DC is one of the Europe's fastest plant invaders and is suspected to use railway corridors to expand. In France, the species has first been observed in the city of Paris in the late 1990's and today it is present throughout the region. In order to assess the role of railways in S. inaequidens invasion, we used innovative multivariate analyses to study population genetic diversity of this allotetraploid species. We analyzed the genetic diversity at 11 microsatellite markers of a total of 450 individuals sampled at 15 locations along railways connecting the city of Paris to the surrounding suburban/rural areas. Geographical distances among locations ranged from 1 to 83 km with four locations within Paris at the departure train stations of the national/international train lines studied. To our knowledge, studies on invasive allotetraploid plants where data were kept in the tetraploid format are still scarce. Our analyses revealed substantial genetic diversity and clear genetic differentiation among some populations, with a genetic gradient detected along one railway line. Results also showed no genetic bottleneck between Parisian populations and the historically introduced population located in South of France. Our study thus revealed the role of railways as a corridor among S. inaequidens populations within central Paris. However, connecting networks appeared more complex in the suburban and rural areas suggesting other potential vectors.

AB  - Landscape-level variables operating at multiple spatial scales likely influence wetland amphibian assemblages but have not been investigated in detail. We examined the significance of habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as selected within-wetland conditions, affecting amphibian assemblages in twenty-one glacial marshes. Wetlands were located within urban and agricultural regions of central and southwestern Minnesota, USA and were distributed across two ecoregions: tallgrass prairie and northern hardwood forest. We surveyed amphibian assemblages and used a geographic information system to quantify land-use variables at three scales: 500, 1000, and 2500 m. Ten species of amphibians were detected, the most abundant being Rana pipiens, Ambystoma tigrinum, and Bufo americanus. Amphibian species richness was lower with greater wetland isolation and road density at all spatial scales in both ecoregions. Amphibian species richness also had a negative relationship with the proportion of urban land-use at all spatial scales in the hardwood forest ecoregion, and species richness was greater in wetlands with fish and Ambystoma tigrinum. These biotic relationships are less consistent and more difficult to interpret than are land-use relationships. The data presented here suggest that decreases in landscape connectivity via fragmentation and habitat loss can affect amphibian assemblages, and reversing those landscape changes should be an important part of a regional conservation strategy.

AB  - Communities that live in linear systems such as streams or riparian zones may be particularly sensitive to changes in habitat connectivity. I examined the relationship between environmental variables, the number of low-head dams downstream of each reach, and fish species richness in first-order streams in Wisconsin, USA. The analysis was based on an extensive database of 13 628 localities and similar to 180 000 individual collection records. The environmental variables included climate, elevation, distance from nearest town, and network-specific measures such as link number (the number of first-order tributaries upstream of the current reach), downstream link number, stream order, and fractal dimension. The link number of the downstream reach was the strongest broad-scale correlate of fish species richness in first-order streams. Path analysis of a simple directed graph suggested that, although downstream dams have a significant effect on fish species richness, this effect is small by comparison to the influence of water quantity and summer maximum temperatures. From a management perspective, the results imply that modifications of water volume and temperature are greater threats to fish communities than the decrease in connectivity that results from low-head dams.

AB  - Spatially heterogeneous landscape factors such as urbanisation can have substantial effects on the severity and spread of wildlife diseases. However, research linking patterns of pathogen transmission to landscape features remains rare. Using a combination of phylogeographic and machine learning approaches, we tested the influence of landscape and host factors on feline immunodeficiency virus (FIVLru) genetic variation and spread among bobcats (Lynx rufus) sampled from coastal southern California. We found evidence for increased rates of FIVLru lineage spread through areas of higher vegetation density. Furthermore, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation among FIVLru sequences was associated with host genetic distances and geographic location, with FIVLru genetic discontinuities precisely correlating with known urban barriers to host dispersal. An effect of forest land cover on FIVLru SNP variation was likely attributable to host population structure and differences in forest land cover between different populations. Taken together, these results suggest that the spread of FIVLru is constrained by large-scale urban barriers to host movement. Although urbanisation at fine spatial scales did not appear to directly influence virus transmission or spread, we found evidence that viruses transmit and spread more quickly through areas containing higher proportions of natural habitat. These multiple lines of evidence demonstrate how urbanisation can change patterns of contact-dependent pathogen transmission and provide insights into how continued urban development may influence the incidence and management of wildlife disease.

AB  - As cities overgrow, the need for ecological restoration is becoming increasingly urgent, especially in densely populated areas. Urban ecological restoration represents the best approach to undertake damages to restore native ecosystem remnants fulfilling biodiversity but also social goals in dense urban settings such as Mexico City. The feasibility of restoring unique xerophytic scrub vegetation in lava field remnants was evaluated in a portion of a university campus in Mexico City. Here we present an index (Need and Feasibility of Restoration Index, NFRI) for such purpose. The NFRI was designed through multicriteria analysis and considered ecological, economic, and social indicators. Cluster and principal components analysis were carried out to identify different groups of lava field remnants with similar characteristics and to point out critical variables that in turn would support management strategies. The outcomes made evident the necessity of restoring native vegetation for all of the evaluated remnants; however, the group containing the largest ones obtained the highest values for restoration feasibility and NFRI. The recovery of the rest of the remnants is critical to support the ecological restoration of the area as this may provide connectivity with better-preserved ecosystem remnants. When the restoration is unaffordable due to financial constraints, it is highly recommended to direct efforts towards ecological rehabilitation actions. The establishment of native xerophytic gardens is promoted when remnants cannot support a self-sustainable plant community. It is crucial to include the diversity of views and values of the community and the economic and ecological aspects to guarantee the sustainability of the landscape, especially in the urban context. The latter can provide better planning and design processes, ensuring benefits for humans and nature.

AB  - The extreme fragmentation of natural habitats due to urbanisation can influence the evolution of dispersal strategies in species persisting in cities. The brown garden snail Cornu aspersum is an anthropophilic species, capable of maintaining its populations in highly fragmented habitats despite a high cost of movement. In this species, we studied the variation of dispersal-related behaviours and traits along an urbanisation gradient characterised at two biologically relevant spatial scales (10 and 50 m), in order to identify the effects of habitat fragmentation on movement. The olfactory perceptual range was low, between 1 and 2.5 m, meaning that snails should perceive a large range of landscapes as fragmented. In line with previous results, subadults were more prone to explore than adults in the least urbanised populations. The boundary-crossing behaviour of subadults was not affected by urbanisation, while exploration propensity of adult snails increased with urbanisation at the 50 m (long-distance dispersal) scale, to reach subadult levels in more urban sites. Foot mass (a correlate of movement speed) and perceptual range were not affected by urbanisation. These results are interpreted in relation to the different levels of competition snails are likely to experience in different environments, the high risk of local extinction in urban fragmented landscapes, and the available opportunities for reproduction. They indicate that benefits of dispersal still need to be considered even in situations where movement costs are extremely important. The maintenance of relatively high mobility and its extension to the adult stage in response to anthropogenic changes may thus play a major role in the success of Cornu aspersum in urban habitats.

AB  - Species diversity, host specificity and species turnover among phytophagous beetles were studied in the canopy of two tropical lowland forests in Panama with the use of canopy cranes. A sharp rainfall gradient occurs between the two sites located 80 km apart. The wetter forest is located in San Lorenzo Protected Area on the Caribbean side of the isthmus, and the drier forest is a part of the Parque Natural Metropolitano close to Panama City on the Pacific slope. Host specificity was measured as effective specialization and recorded by probability methods based on abundance categories and feeding records from a total of 102 species of trees and lianas equally distributed between the two sites. The total material collected included more than 65,000 beetles of 2462 species, of which 306 species were shared between the two sites. The wet forest was 37% more species rich than the dry forest due to more saproxylic species and flower visitors. Saproxylic species and flower visitors were also more host-specific in the wet forest. Leaf chewers showed similar levels of species richness and host specificity in both forests. The effective number of specialized species per plant species was higher in the wet forest. Higher levels of local alpha- and beta-diversity as well as host specificity based on present data from a tropical wet forest, suggests higher number of species at regional levels, a result that may have consequences for ecological estimates of global species richness.

AB  - 1. Spatially explicit landscape models have revealed the importance of spatial arrangement of habitat patches in the behaviour of mobile organisms. Such models fail to account for creation and destruction of habitat, which may interrupt the movement of slowly migrating species such as forest herbs.
   2. To explore the interaction of habitat turnover and population migration, we present a dynamic landscape model inhabited by a dispersing species. The landscape is represented as a square lattice in which individual cells may be either habitat or non-habitat, and a hypothetical species may spread among habitat cells. Rate of species spread, habitat frequency and habitat clearance and regeneration are allowed to vary.
   3. In static landscapes, the fraction of the landscape occupied by the species is limited by connectivity among habitat patches and rate of population migration. Slow species often cannot reach all available habitat despite the presence of continuous paths to it.
   4. In dynamic landscapes, slow-moving species show reduced map-scale frequency and high risk of extinction due to the cumulative effects of habitat patch destruction and the failure to colonize newly created habitat. Such species decline cannot be predicted based on static descriptions of habitat connectivity or migration rate.
   5. Fast-moving species may be reduced in dynamic landscapes by the cumulative effect of numerous local isolation events. Fast-moving species may also experience a modest range expansion in low-connectivity landscapes due to the cumulative effects of short-lived patch adjacency.
   6. These results suggest a novel mechanism that could account for species impoverishment in fragmented landscapes. They emphasize the importance of maintaining habitat connectivity on a time-scale that accommodates slow-migrating species such as forest herbs.

AB  - In this paper, we examine how cities are working with nature-based solutions for biodiversity. Drawing on a sample of 199 nature-based solutions across Europe, we identify how cities work with nature-based solutions to conserve nature, restore nature, and to find ways to thrive through harnessing nature's contribution to people. Our findings show that cities are making explicit contributions to biodiversity through nature-based solutions, and often adopt specific and quantifiable targets to guide their actions. Yet there is significant variation in the ways in which biodiversity goals and interventions are being pursued. Where biodiversity goals and actions are included in nature-based solutions, they are mainly ecosystem-based - focusing on the protection, restoration or enhancement of the integrity, functionality, and connectivity of habitats and ecosystems - with fewer focused on specific species, and very few projects concerned with genetic diversity. Although it is often assumed that urban action towards biodiversity goals will be undertaken through local planning processes, our analysis shows that European cities are taking project-based actions for biodiversity through a set of explicit, quantitative and measurable targets, which are tailored to the specific conditions of urban settings. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that if cities are to achieve ambitious goals for biodiversity over the next decade, new international frameworks being developed for the post-2020 period should include targets that acknowledge the way in which biodiversity is governed in cities and the contribution that cities make to conserve, restore and thrive with nature to guide urban action.

AB  - Bees provide a variety of ecological services for urban ecosystems, while green roofs can also be of high value to bees through providing habitats and foraging sites. In this study, four hypotheses about impacts on abundance and diversity of pollinators were proposed from the roof and the surrounding environment. The evidences revealed that the height of the building affected the diversity of some bee species; increasing proportions of surrounding green space helped to increase abundance of bees and wasps; the colonies of bees were significantly affected by habitat connectivity, a frequent movement of bees and other mobile insects between roofs and ground guaranteed pollination of plants; plentiful plants combination was better than a single species in roof ecosystem services, and native forbs were beneficial for pollinations and foraging of pollinators; using fine substrate on green roofs may have a greater ecological value than common soil.

AB  - Many studies have refuted the opinion that urban floras are poor in total species number and characterized primarily by neophytes. Also, it has been proved that urban flora differs from its surroundings, and at the same time reflects its richness. Our study focused on urban flora, structure and similarities, and the possible correlation with the urban attributes. Therefore, we selected 11 cities in Southeast Europe, which differ in the development of transportation networks (roads, rails and inland waterways) and population size. Next, we compared two sets of data (structure of urban flora and urban attributes) to define the correlation patterns. Analyzed urban floras were primarily distinguished by a total number of species, number of unique species and neophytes. Belgrade is a city with the highest urbanization level, the most species and the highest number of unique species and neophytes as well. Kosovska Mitrovica, Grocka and Pozarevac stand out by floristic richness. These cities have a high number of species, yet a small proportion of neophytes. Other cities are characterized by similar floristic structure, with a relatively similar proportion of neophytes and approximately similar number of unique species in relation to the total number. It can be concluded that other factors beside the chosen urban attributes have additional effects on floristic structure, except for the factor - the presence of neophytes. This is in accordance with predefining subjects, since urban attributes were chosen based on knowledge about important corridors for invasive species.

AB  - Parks and private and public gardens do not exist in isolation, but form part of the urban fabric, contributing to ecological functioning. There is growing interest in how civil society shapes urban ecologies and vegetation patterns. This paper explores the ecological outcomes of a series of indigenous plant greening interventions in Cape Town. The six different sites were sampled: two civic-led intervention sites, one expert-led rehabilitation site, two conservation sites and one abandoned site. These sites are compared in terms of their plant and insect diversity and then discussed in relation to their contingent management arrangements and in relation to conservation and abandoned land. Plant and insect diversity measured at the civic-led greening intervention sites suggest these sites are similar to adjacent conservation sites, while floristic composition differs. The inclusion of a vacant lot with poor species and growth form diversity shows the significant role of intervention in the ecological reformation of urban green space. By emphasizing the ecological outcomes, this study highlights the importance of civil society in linking conservation goals to more broad-based notions of quality of life and the 'good and just city'. Our results indicate that civic-led efforts warrant attention in keeping with those of experts, both in relation to meeting indigenous conservation targets, as well as supporting functional groups and wider ecological processes, with the acknowledged exception of fire. How to integrate such civic-led interventions into urban biodiversity management planning is still an open question. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The limited seed dispersal range of cycads, longevity of individuals, including a long juvenile phase, coupled with dioecy, suggest that the impacts of habitat fragmentation are not straightforward. Cycas megacarpa K.D. Hill. is an endangered cycad that occurs in a highly fragmented landscape derived from past agricultural land clearing. Current threats continue to be land clearing for both urban and rural developments and major infrastructure development for coal seam gas. This study investigated the effect fragmentation has had on C. megacarpa populations across its entire range. Twelve microsatellite loci were developed with next generation sequencing and used to analyse 992 samples from 33 populations. Geographic information system (GIS) analysis of the total reduction in suitable regional ecosystem (RE) habitat in Queensland revealed a 69% loss between 1960s pre-clearing records and 2009 with only 29% of remaining habitat occurring in protected areas. Populations are highly variable with many small populations, and there is evidence of possible declining recruitment of seedlings. The relatively low proportion of adult sized plants that reproduce synchronously promotes outcrossing; however, there is some evidence that reduced population sizes may lead to inbreeding. Genetic diversity is not correlated with population size but it is weakly correlated with isolation. There is evidence of considerable historic gene flow among populations and little genetic differentiation among broad geographic regions. The results show genetic clustering and are consistent with hypotheses that C. megacarpa existed as a set of metapopulations historically linked by gene flow. This has maintained diversity in small populations but suggests that fragmentation that increases population isolation has and will continue to reduce the species viability. The persistence of adult cycads through multiple generations may allow rare alleles to remain within populations over a longer period of time.

AB  - Especially in urbanized landscapes, habitat fragmentation and increasing numbers of infrastructural features may limit genetic exchange among wildlife populations. Yet, whether this results in genetic differentiation among individuals in different habitat fragments will depend on both the species studied and the composition of the landscape. European pine martens (Martes martes) show clear spatial structure at a Europe-wide scale, but whether gene flow among habitat patches can be maintained at a more local scale in intensively urbanized areas remained unclear. Here, we analysed genotypic data from 270 pine martens sampled from locations scattered across the Netherlands, one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Using Bayesian clustering models we show that most likely maximum two large subpopulations exist in the Netherlands. We observed relatively low levels of genetic differentiation and genetic evidence of regular long-distance dispersal by juveniles that must have crossed one or multiple major highways. Our results suggest that genetic exchange among Dutch pine martens has, until 2010, not been impacted severely by the countries' dense infrastructural network. Furthermore this species seems to have maintained its genetic diversity despite a recent demographic bottleneck. These conclusions support the idea that the effects of habitat fragmentation may strongly differ between (groups of) species, and that prioritization and optimization of management decisions thus requires direct study of the targeted species.

AB  - Background Although the species-urban green area relationship (SARu) has been analyzed worldwide, the global consistency of its parameters, such as the fit and the slope of models, remains unexplored. Moreover, the SARu can be explained by 20 different models. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate which models provide a better explanation of SARus and, focusing on the power model, to evaluate the global heterogeneity in its fit and slope. Methods We tested the performance of multiple statistical models in accounting for the way in which species richness increases with area, and examined whether variability in model form was associated with various methodological and environmental factors. Focusing on the power model, we analyzed the global heterogeneity in the fit and slope of the models through a meta-analysis. Results Among 20 analyzed models, the linear model provided the best fit to the most datasets, was the top ranked model according to our efficiency criterion, and was the top overall ranked model. The Kobayashi and power models were the second and third overall ranked models, respectively. The number of green areas and the minimum number of species within a green area were the only significant variables explaining the variation in model form and performance, accounting for less than 10% of the variation. Based on the power model, there was a consistent overall fit (r(2) = 0.50) and positive slope of 0.20 for the species richness increase with area worldwide. Conclusions The good fit of the linear model to our SARu datasets contrasts with the non-linear SAR frequently found in true and non-urban habitat island systems; however, this finding may be a result of the small sample size of many SARu datasets. The overall power model slope of 0.20 suggests low levels of isolation among urban green patches, or alternatively that habitat specialist and area sensitive species have already been extirpated from urban green areas.

AB  - Swedish forest and environmental policies imply that forests should be managed so that all naturally occurring species are maintained in viable populations. This requires maintenance of functional networks of representative natural forest and cultural woodland habitats. We first review the policy implementation process regarding protected areas in Sweden 1991-2010, how ecological knowledge was used to formulate interim short-term and strategic long-term biodiversity conservation goals, and the development of a hierarchical spatial planning approach. Second, we present data about the amount of formally protected and voluntarily set aside forest stands, and evaluate how much remains in terms of additional forest protection, conservation management and habitat restoration to achieve forest and environmental policy objectives in the long-term. Third, a case study in central Sweden was made to estimate the functionality of old Scots pine, Norway spruce and deciduous forest habitats, as well as cultural woodland, in different forest regions. Finally, we assess operational biodiversity conservation planning processes. We conclude that Swedish policy pronouncements capture the contemporary knowledge about biodiversity and conservation planning well. However, the existing area of protected and set-aside forests is presently too small and with too poor connectivity. To bridge this gap, spatial planning, management and restoration of habitat, as well as collaboration among forest and conservation planners need to be improved.

AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) maps are a key input in environmental evaluations for the sustainable planning and management of socio-ecological systems. While the impact of map spatial resolution on environmental assessments has been evaluated by several studies, the effect of thematic resolution (the level of detail of LU/LC typologies) is discordant and still poorly investigated. In this paper, four scenarios of thematic resolutions, corresponding to the four levels of the CORINE classification scheme, have been compared in a real case study of landscape connectivity assessment, a major aspect for the biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service provision. The PANDORA model has been employed to investigate the effects of LULC thematic resolution on Bio-Energy Landscape Connectivity (BELC) at the scale of the whole system, landscape units, and single land cover patches, also in terms of ecosystem services. The results show different types of impacts on landscape connectivity due to the changed spatial pattern of the LULC classes across the four thematic resolution scenarios. Moreover, the main priority areas for conservation objectives and future sustainable urban expansion have been identified. Finally, several indications are given for supporting practitioners and researchers faced with thematic resolution issues in environmental assessment and land use planning.

AB  - Over the next half century the human population is expected to grow rapidly, resulting in the conversion of rural areas into cities. Wetlands in these regions are therefore under threat, even though they have important ecosystem services and functions. Many obligate marsh-nesting birds in North America have shown declines over the past 40 years, and it is important to evaluate marsh bird community response to increased urbanization. We surveyed 20 coastal marshes in southern Ontario, Canada, and found that obligate marsh-nesting birds preferred rural over urban wetlands, generalist marsh-nesting birds showed no preference, while synanthropic species showed a trend towards increased richness and abundance in urban marshes. The Index of Marsh Bird Community Integrity (IMBCI) was calculated for each wetland and we found significantly higher scores in rural compared to urban wetlands. The presence of a forested buffer surrounding the marsh was not an important factor in predicting the distribution of generalists, obligates, synanthropic species, or the IMBCI. More isolated marshes had a lower species richness of obligate marsh-nesters and a lower IMBCI than less isolated marshes. Based on our results, we recommend that urban land use is not the dominant land use within 1000 m from any wetland, as it negatively affects the abundance and richness of obligate marsh-nesters, and the overall integrity of the avian community. We also recommend that all existing wetlands be conserved to mitigate against isolation effects and to preserve biodiversity.

AB  - Clear delimitation of management units is essential for effective management of invasive species. Analysis of population genetic structure of target species can improve identification and interpretation of natural and artificial barriers to dispersal. In Aotearoa New Zealand where the introduced ship rat (Rattus rattus) is a major threat to native biodiversity, effective suppression of pest numbers requires removal and limitation of reinvasion from outside the managed population. We contrasted population genetic structure in rat populations over a wide scale without known barriers, with structure over a fine scale with potential barriers to dispersal. MtDNA D-loop sequences and microsatellite genotypes resolved little genetic structure in southern North Island population samples of ship rat 100 km apart. In contrast, samples from major islands differed significantly for both mtDNA and nuclear markers. We also compared ship rats collected within a small peninsula reserve bounded by sea, suburbs and, more recently, a predator fence with rats in the surrounding forest. Here, mtDNA did not differ but genotypes from 14 nuclear loci were sufficient to distinguish the fenced population. This suggests that natural (sea) and artificial barriers (town, fence) are effectively limiting gene flow among ship rat populations over the short distance (similar to 500 m) between the peninsula reserve and surrounding forest. The effectiveness of the fence alone is not clear given it is a recent feature and no historical samples exist; resampling population genetic diversity over time will improve understanding. Nonetheless, the current genetic isolation of the fenced rat population suggests that rat eradication is a sensible management option given that reinvasion appears to be limited and could probably be managed with a biosecurity programme.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation due to urbanization are the most pervasive threats to biodiversity in southern California. Loss of habitat and fragmentation can lower migration rates and genetic connectivity among remaining populations of native species, reducing genetic variability and increasing extinction risk. However, it may be difficult to separate the effects of recent anthropogenic fragmentation from the genetic signature of prehistoric fragmentation due to previous natural geological and climatic changes. To address these challenges, we examined the phylogenetic and population genetic structure of a flightless insect endemic to cismontane southern California, Stenopelmatus 'mahogani' (Orthoptera: Stenopelmatidae). Analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequence data suggest that diversification across southern California began during the Pleistocene, with most haplotypes currently restricted to a single population. Patterns of genetic divergence correlate with contemporary urbanization, even after correcting for (geographical information system) GIS-based reconstructions of fragmentation during the Pleistocene. Theoretical simulations confirm that contemporary patterns of genetic structure could be produced by recent urban fragmentation using biologically reasonable assumptions about model parameters. Diversity within populations was positively correlated with current fragment size, but not prehistoric fragment size, suggesting that the effects of increased drift following anthropogenic fragmentation are already being seen. Loss of genetic connectivity and diversity can hinder a population's ability to adapt to ecological perturbations commonly associated with urbanization, such as habitat degradation, climatic changes and introduced species. Consequently, our results underscore the importance of preserving and restoring landscape connectivity for long-term persistence of low vagility native species.

AB  - Trees are key ecosystem engineers. Many analyses of the genetic diversity of forest trees over substantial parts of their distributional ranges are appearing. These studies are of relevance for forest and landscape management, the inventory of botanical genetic resources and the conservation biology of rare, endemic, relictual, and endangered tree species. This review focuses on (i) recent investigations of the influence of human disturbances, (ii) comparative analyses of closely related and hybridizing species, (iii) reconstructions of refugia and of the spread of tree populations during the postglacial, (iv) studies of both range-wide and range-edge genetic patterns, and (v) assessments of the role of tree genetic diversity in the face of future climate warming. There is a need to include more tropical and austral trees in genetic analyses, as most studies have dealt with the relatively species-poor Palaearctic and Nearctic regions. Further studies are also needed on the role of tree genetic diversity in variations in phenology, resistance to insect defoliators and fungal pathogens, reactions to increased CO,, and ozone concentrations, growth, mortality rates and other traits. Most macroecological and scaling patterns of species richness still need to be studied for genetic diversity. Open research questions in this rapidly evolving field involve invasion biology, island biogeography, and urban ecology. There is a need for more knowledge transfer from the many studies of tree genetic diversity to the day-to-day management of trees and forests. (C) 2009 Rabel Foundation, ETH Zurich.

AB  - Riparian forests are increasingly threatened by urban expansion and land use change worldwide. This study examined the relationships between landscape characteristics and woody plant diversity, structure, and composition of small order riparian corridors along an urban-rural land use gradient in the Georgia Piedmont, US. Riparian plant diversity, structure, and composition were related to landscape metrics and land use. Species richness was negatively associated with impervious surfaces and landscape diversity, and positively associated with forest cover and largest forest patch index. Shannon species diversity was strongly related to the biomass of non-native species, especially for the regeneration layer. Urban sites were characterized by high richness of non-native and pioneer species. Developing sites were dominated by the non-native shrub, Ligustrum sinense Lour., and several native overstory trees, mainly Acer negundo L. While agricultural and managed forest sites were composed of ubiquitous species, unmanaged forest sites had a structurally distinct midstory indicative of reduced disturbance. Urban and agricultural land uses showed decreased native stem densities and signs of overstory tree regeneration failure. Results from this study highlight the impact of the surrounding landscape matrix upon riparian forest plant diversity and structure.

AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) is considered as a major threat to biodiversity, especially to nocturnal species, as it reduces availability, quality and functionality of habitats. However, its effects on the way species use landscape elements such as rivers are still largely understudied, especially the effect of crossing infrastructure lighting on bridges. These elements are nevertheless key commuting and foraging habitats in heavily urbanised landscapes for several taxa such as bats that are particularly affected by ALAN. We studied the effects of the illumination of facades and undersides of bridges on the relative abundance of pipistrelle bats, on their 3D distribution and their behavioural response (i.e. flight speed) close to bridges. We set-up an innovative approach based on a microphone-array to reconstruct positions and flight trajectories in 3D. We studied the effect of lighting on bats in the close proximity of six similar bridges, mostly differentiated by the presence or absence of lighting (3 lit and 3 unlit). All bridges cross the same waterway, within a uniformly and highly urbanized agglomeration (Toulouse, France). We found that bat activity was 1.7 times lower in lit sites. Bats tended to keep a larger distance, and to fly faster close to illuminated bridges. These results suggest that bridge lighting strongly reduces habitat availability and likely connectivity for bats. In that case, results call for switching off the illumination of such bridges crossing riverine ecosystems to preserve their functionality as habitats and corridors for bats.

AB  - Nestedness is an important pattern frequently reported for species assemblages on islands or fragmented systems. However, to date, there are few studies that comprehensively investigated faunal nestedness and underlying processes in urbanized landscapes. In this study, we examined the nestedness of bird assemblages and its underlying causal mechanisms in 37 urban parks in Nanjing, China. We used the line-transect method to survey birds from April 2019 to January 2020. We used the Weighted Nestedness metric based on Overlap and Decreasing Fill (WNODF) to estimate the nestedness of bird assemblages. We applied spearman partial correlation test to examine the relationships between nestedness ranks of sites and park characteristics (area, isolation, anthropogenic noise, number of habitat types, and building index), as well as between nestedness ranks of species and their ecological traits (body size, geographic range size, clutch size, minimum area requirement, dispersal ratio, and habitat specificity). We found that bird assemblages in urban parks were significantly nested. Park area, habitat diversity, building index, habitat specificity, and minimum area requirement of birds were significantly correlated with nestedness. Therefore, the nestedness of bird assemblages was caused by selective extinction, habitat nestedness, and urbanization. However, the nestedness of bird assemblages did not result from passive sampling, selective colonization, or human disturbance. Overall, to maximize the number of species preserved in our system, conservation priority should be given to parks with large area, rich habitat diversity, and less building index. From a species perspective, we should focus on species with large area requirement and high habitat specificity for their effective conservation.

AB  - A number of societal changes such as an ageing population and a lack of economic prosperity mean that Japanese greenway planners will be faced with a number of new challenges in the coming decades. These societal changes will be particularly dramatic in the Japanese New Towns, which were constructed in the late 1950s. Some of these New Towns marked a departure for Japanese planning by including a network of greenways, which were planned to provide pleasant corridors for pedestrians and bikers. Around 30 years have passed since these areas were developed; today the greenways in these New Towns have become corridors with dense and rich greenery. Such matured greenways, which were supposed to provide an amenity for local residents, have increasingly come to be regarded as a cause of fear of crime. To try and mitigate this, trees and shrubs along the greenways are now closely trimmed or even removed.
   However, such mature vegetation along the greenways may be regarded as a feature that maintains the history of the town. Such vegetation is also expected to provide ecological corridors that accommodate wildlife species which were abundant in the rural areas surrounding these New Towns. Within the context of proposing an optimum management scheme for Japanese greenways, the following study aims to explain and discuss how the fear of crime on greenways can be prevented whilst maintaining their ecological and historical functions.

AB  - Aedes aegypti, being the principal vector of dengue (DENV1 to 4), chikungunya and Zika viruses, is considered as one of the most important mosquito vectors. In Brazil, despite regular vector control programs, Ae. aegypti still persists with high urban density in all the states. This study aimed to estimate the intra and inter population genetic diversity and genetic structure among 15 Brazilian populations of Ae. aegypti based on 12 microsatellite loci. A total of 510 specimens were analyzed comprising eight locations from northern (Itacoatiara, Manaus, Novo Airao, Boa Vista, Rio Branco, Porto Velho, Guajara-Mirim and Macapa), three from southeastern (Aracatuba, Sao Jose de Rio Preto and Taubate), one from southern (Foz do Iguacu), one from central west (Cuiaba) and two from northeastern (Campina Grande and Teresina) regions of Brazil. Genetic distances (pairwise values of F-ST and Nm) and the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) were statistically significant, independent of geographic distances among the sites analyzed, indicating that them are under a complex dynamic process that influence the levels of gene flow within and among regions of the country. Bayesian analysis in STRUCTURE revealed the existence of two major genetic clusters, as well as there was genetic substructure within them; these results were confirmed by AMOVA, BAPS and DAPC analyses. This differentiation is the cumulative result of several factors combined as events of multiple introduction, passive dispersal, environmental and climatic conditions, use of insecticides, cycles of extinction and re-colonization followed by microevolutionary processes throughout the country. Isolation by distance also contributed to this differentiation, especially among geographically closer localities. These genetic differences may affect its vector competence to transmit dengue, chikungunya, Zika and the response to vector control programs.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is one of the major threats to amphibian species. In a previous study, population genetic analyses of the Japanese brown frog Rana japonica were conducted using a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) marker in a typical Japanese agricultural landscape (known as satoyama) in Chiba, Japan. This previous study revealed that gene flow was restricted by the roads and cement-walled urban river that divide this site. In the present study, we reanalyzed the genetic structure of the same meta-population using microsatellite markers in comparison with the mtDNA results and elucidated fine-scale gene flow. The genetic structure derived from the microsatellite clustering analysis was almost identical to that of the mtDNA results, although some important details differed. We recognized boundaries of genetic structure are consistent with the major roads and cement-walled river, however, we also detected gene flow across those artificial barriers. We concluded that the current genetic structure was formed in the past when gene flow was strongly restricted. Gene flow among breeding populations is now being restored by the maintenance of breeding sites, although it is not sufficient to erase the signature of historical isolation.

AB  - Deforestation around large urban centers usually creates a fragmented landscape with reduced natural areas. Biodiversity studies in these forest remnants provide useful tools for designing conservation strategies that maximize the persistence of local diversity and promote their connectivity. Inventories focused on particular taxa have been proposed as a useful mechanism that allows a better knowledge of the state of biodiversity in a given area, the butterflies are one of the taxonomic groups more frequently used for these studies. In this paper, we study the diversity and composition of the butterfly community in the cloud forest of the reserve El Romeral located southwest of the Medellin City in the Aburra Valley, Colombia. We recorded 75 species belonging to 5 butterfly families, more than recorded for similar forests associated with periurban areas. El Romeral shares only 50% of the species with the main periurban forest located east of the valley, indicating that each of the surrounding forest remnants of the city may have a unique composition of species being complementary and useful for regional conservation.

AB  - Genetic data are increasingly used to describe the structure of wildlife populations and to infer landscape influences on functional connectivity. To accomplish this, genetic structure can be described with a multitude of methods that vary in their assumptions, advantages and limitations. While some methods discriminate distinct subpopulations separated by sharp genetic boundaries (i.e. barrier detection or clustering methods), other methods estimate gradient genetic structures using individual-based genetic distances. We present an analytical framework based on individual ancestry values that combines these different approaches and can be used to a) test for local barriers to gene flow and b) evaluate effects of landscape gradients through individual-based genetic distances that account for hierarchical genetic structure. We illustrate the approach with a data set of 371 cougars Puma concolor from a 217 000 km(2) study area in Idaho and western Montana (USA) that were genotyped at 12 microsatellite loci. Results suggest that cougars in the region show a complex, hierarchical genetic structure that is influenced by a local barrier to gene flow (an urban population cluster connected by high traffic volumes), different landscape features (the Snake River Plain, forested habitat), and geographic distance. Our novel approach helped to elucidate the relative influence of these factors on different hierarchical levels of population structure, which was not possible when using either clustering methods or standard genetic distances. Results obtained with our analytical framework highlight the need for multi-scale management of cougars in the region and show that landscape heterogeneity can create complex genetic structures, even in generalist species with high dispersal capabilities.

AB  - Agricultural intensification has caused drastic declines in the area and species richness of semi-natural grasslands across Europe. Novel habitats, such as power line clearings, provide alternative habitats and niches for grassland species, and might therefore mitigate these declines. However, it is not fully understood which environmental factors determine the occurrence of grassland species in the clearings. Identifying the most important drivers for grassland species occurrence would help understand the value of the clearings for grassland conservation and target enhanced management into clearings with most potential as grassland habitat. We studied the effects of local environmental conditions, and past and present connectivity to semi-natural grasslands, on the species richness of grassland plants and butterflies in 43 power line clearings in Finland. The results of generalized linear models and hierarchical partitioning showed that increasing time since clear-cut and amount of clearing residue decreased the species richness of both species groups, while the cover of mesic habitats increased it. However, the two species groups showed also divergent responses. Present-day local environmental conditions appeared to be the sole driver of grassland butterfly species richness, whereas the richness of grassland plants was related both to current conditions and historical connectivity to grasslands in 1870-1880s. This suggests the presence of an extinction debt in the studied grassland plant communities, emphasizing the need for enhanced management to increase suitable grassland habitat in the clearings. This would diminish the potential future losses of grassland plant species in the clearings and create valuable habitat for grassland butterflies as well.

AB  - The ocelot Leopardus pardalis has become a conservation priority in the US as a result of severe population decline and loss of habitat during the 20th century. Only two small populations remain in this country. Their short-term viability is threatened by the disappearance of dense thornshrub communities, human-caused mortality and demographic stochasticity. The influence these factors have on ocelot persistence must be considered to develop effective conservation initiatives. We therefore examined neutral genetic diversity and connectivity among ocelots in the US and northeastern Mexico using 25 autosomal microsatellites and a 395-bp segment of the mitochondrial control region. Genetic variation was lowest in the population occurring on Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge, Texas (autosomal microsatellite HE=0.399 and mtDNA-haplotype diversity=0) and highest in northeastern Mexico (0.637 and 0.73, respectively), while intermediate on private lands in Willacy County, Texas (0.553 and 0.252, respectively). Significant genetic differentiation between the two Texas populations was observed, despite their close proximity (similar to 30 km). Both populations were also significantly divergent from northeastern Mexico. The absence of any detectable gene flow implies that the human modified landscape of the Lower Rio Grande Valley in southern Texas acts as a strong barrier to ocelot movement, disrupting metapopulation dynamics and contributing to loss of diversity. As a consequence, continued genetic erosion among the Texas populations is expected. The lack of movement through the fragmented landscape also suggests it is unlikely ocelots will recolonize unoccupied habitat patches along the Lower Rio Grande and the delta interior where agriculture and urban land uses predominate. The continued rapid development will exacerbate this problem. These factors threaten the persistence of the Texas populations and limit their recovery. Translocations are necessary to link ocelot populations in the US.

AB  - A recent issue highlights the need for a wildlife corridor to mitigate habitat fragmentation and biodiversity degradation caused by intensive urbanization in the country, such as the development of infrastructure, roads, and highways. Indeed, the issues of frequent road and vehicle-animals collisions are ever-increasing in urban corridors. As a result, flora and fauna populations can become isolated, leading to an unbalanced ecosystem. This study developed the Wildlife Corridor Design and Conservation (WCDC) index, assessment model. The study has investigated the wildlife corridor design and conservation features through a systematic literature review, clustered them into three criteria (biophysical, structural, and environmental designs) and twenty-one sub -criteria. The study applied the Analytic Network Process method to measure the weights of features; habitat preservation (WC1.1 = 0.280), species varieties control (WC1.2.=0187), and conduit for movement (WC1.3. = 0.100) play critical roles in wildlife corridor design and conservation. The Weighted Sum Method verified the WCDC model through a case study (Red Earth overpass, Canada). The model assigns certification labels (Gold, Silver, Bronze, or not-certified); accordingly, it ranked the evaluated site as Gold, which means the Red Earth overpass performs intimately in biophysical, structural, and environmental preservation of mammal habitat. The study conducted regression analysis for model validation, determining a significant association between the base and case-study models.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore the 15-minute city concept's underlying principles, sustainability con-tributions, and implementation challenges. We show that it relies on the seven basic principles of human-scale urban design, density, diversity, flexibility, proximity, digitalization, and connectivity. These principles can contribute to social, economic, and environmental sustainability in various ways. However, the 15-minute city can also been criticized for being physically deterministic, failing to take into account the needs of different social groups, biodiversity, energy-efficiency, clean energies, and culture and heritage.

AB  - Invasive species have been causing important and irreversible impacts to native species and communities of ecosystems. They distort ecosystem functions by degrading forest lands, wetlands, and agricultural habitats and replace the native vegetation and reduce biodiversity, forest productivity, and suitable wildlife habitat. To address disturbances caused by invasive species occurrence, further information is needed regarding the occurrence, extent, and dispersal of invasive species and how land use may increase the spread of these species. The objective of this study was to find the frequency and dominance of three invasive species common to riparian areas of east Alabama: Ligustrum sinense (Chinese privet), Elaeagnus pungens (silverthorn), and Triadica sebifera (Chinese tallow tree). Surveys of these species in riparian forests in and around Auburn, Alabama were conducted to show the relative extent of these shrubs and their relation to urban land use. It was expected to see the highest levels of invasive species in the city center with decreasing levels radiating outward into rural areas. Another objective was how urban land use may affect the presence-absence and prevalence of these non-native plant species within study sites. The results showed that around the city center and suburban lands, cover of both Chinese privet and silverthorn tended to increase. In contrast, Chinese tallow tree density percent cover showed an opposite trend with landscapes close to city center often having slightly less cover. This study shows that urban land use may be an important association with distribution of invasive plant species.

AB  - On Jersey (British Channel Islands), common toads often reproduce in small, urban ponds. This atypical breeding strategy has implications for their persistence and they have declined on the island in recent times. We used polymorphic microsatellite markers to compare genetic diversity in Bufo bufo from five different ponds in Jersey with two populations from north-west France. Genetic diversity of Jersey toads was comparable with that of populations elsewhere in Europe. Numbers of breeding female toads in Jersey were correlated with pond area but estimators of genetic diversity were unrelated to pond area or female numbers. F-st estimates and isolation by distance tests indicated that there is little gene flow between breeding sites on the island. Jersey populations last shared a common ancestor with those of north-west France long before the island's physical separation about 6000 years ago. Toads have a long history in Jersey and were once probably very numerous there. The average effective historical population size of Jersey toads is estimated to be 15,000-16,000. Although genetic diversity of Jersey B. bufo is currently quite high, recent developments on the island may threaten this situation in the near future.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation caused by urbanization often have negative impacts on wildlife in cities. There are considerable studies investigating the relationship between species traits and fragmentation vulnerability. However, so far, very few studies have examined the influence of species traits combined with landscape factors on vulnerability to urbanization in urbanized landscapes. In this study, we investigated how species traits and park characteristics influenced bird sensitivity to urbanization in the highly urbanized city of Nanjing, China. We used the line-transect method to survey birds in 37 urban parks. For each bird species, we collected data on nine life-history and ecological traits that are commonly assumed to influence urbanization vulnerability. For each park, we selected six landscape variables that are commonly considered to influence bird response to urbanization. After phylogenetic correction, the nine species traits were used separately and in combination to evaluate their associations with species abundance, an indicator of urbanization vulnerability. We then used the RLQ and fourth-corner analyses to test relationships between species traits and environmental variables. We found that the 75 species analyzed demonstrated considerable variation in vulnerability to urbanization. Using PGLS analyses and model averaging, we found that habitat specificity was the single best ecological predictor of urbanization vulnerability in birds in Nanjing city parks. The RLQ analysis showed that body size and habitat specificity were correlated with distance to city center and connectivity of the parks, reflecting strong effects of trait-mediated environmental filters that selectively benefit species with smaller body mass and lower habitat specificity in urbanized landscape. Therefore, conservation efforts giving priority to species with high habitat specificity and to parks with high connectivity and far away from the city center may prove effective for the preservation of bird diversity in our highly urbanized system. Meanwhile, preventing future habitat loss and destruction in existing city parks may also effectively conserve these vulnerable species.

AB  - Urban expansion can fundamentally alter wildlife movement and gene flow, but how urbanization alters pathogen spread is poorly understood. Here, we combine high resolution host and viral genomic data with landscape variables to examine the context of viral spread in puma (Puma concolor) from two contrasting regions: one bounded by the wildland urban interface (WUI) and one unbounded with minimal anthropogenic development (UB). We found landscape variables and host gene flow explained significant amounts of variation of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) spread in the WUI, but not in the unbounded region. The most important predictors of viral spread also differed; host spatial proximity, host relatedness, and mountain ranges played a role in FIV spread in the WUI, whereas roads might have facilitated viral spread in the unbounded region. Our research demonstrates how anthropogenic landscapes can alter pathogen spread, providing a more nuanced understanding of host-pathogen relationships to inform disease ecology in free-ranging species. Nick Fountain-Jones et al. use genomic and spatial data to examine how urbanization affects the spread of the pathogen feline immunodeficiency virus in pumas from areas of varying anthropogenic development. Their results show that landscape variables and host gene flow explained significant amounts of variation in virus spread in a region bounded by urban development but did not in a more wild landscape, demonstrating how anthropogenic landscapes can alter pathogen spread.

AB  - Urbanization strongly affects biodiversity, altering natural communities and often leading to a reduced species richness. Yet, despite its increasingly recognized importance, how urbanization impacts on the health of individual animals, wildlife populations and on disease ecology remains poorly understood. To test whether, and how, urbanization-driven ecosystem alterations influence pathogen dynamics and avian health, we use house sparrows (Passer domesticus) and Yersinia spp. (pathogenic for passerines) as a case study. Sparrows are granivorous urban exploiters, whose western European populations have declined over the past decades, especially in highly urbanized areas. We sampled 329 house sparrows originating from 36 populations along an urbanization gradient across Flanders (Belgium), and used isolation combined with 'matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry' (MALDI-TOF MS) and PCR methods for detecting the presence of different Yersinia species. Yersinia spp. were recovered from 57.43% of the sampled house sparrows, of which 4.06%, 53.30% and 69.54% were identified as Y. pseudotuberculosis, Y. enterocolitica and other Yersinia species, respectively. Presence of Yersinia was related to the degree of urbanization, average daily temperatures and the community of granivorous birds present at sparrow capture locations. Body condition of suburban house sparrows was found to be higher compared to urban and rural house sparrows, but no relationships between sparrows' body condition and presence of Yersinia spp. were found. We conclude that two determinants of pathogen infection dynamics, body condition and pathogen occurrence, vary along an urbanization gradient, potentially mediating the impact of urbanization on avian health.

AB  - Recent interest in converting abandoned railroad lines to public recreation trails holds the potential to conserve and restore wildlife habitat along these corridors, but questions emerge about wildlife use and how best to manage for the multiple interests of wildlife and people. We evaluated the use by birds of 2 abandoned railroad rights-of-way in southeast Nebraska, one a partially converted 42-km urban-rural corridor and the other a converted urban recreational trail. We surveyed birds from 1992 to 1994 in 22 400-m transects (14 rural, 8 urban) that had either continuous woody vegetation (woody) or a more open mixture of grasses and forbs with scattered trees or shrubs (mixed). Of the 112 bird species (99 rural, 77 urban) observed, 47% were neotropical migrants, 38% short-distance migrants, and 15% permanent residents. Overall abundance was generally greater in rural woody and urban mixed transects, but there was no clear urban versus rural difference. Overall mean species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity index were generally greater in urban transects during autumn and winter but shifted to greater in rural woody transects during spring and rural during summer. Abundance, richness, and diversity for permanent residents were generally greater in urban transects than in rural through all seasons, but for neotropical migrants they were greater in rural woody (spring) or rural (summer). Richness and diversity of short-distance migrants were generally greater in rural transects during spring and summer, but abundance did not differ. For some species, abundance in urban versus rural transects changed seasonally and such patterns in mourning dove (Zenaida macroura) numbers support the concept that doves may behave as migrants in rural segments but as permanent residents in urban. Within the rural right-of-way, woody transects, compared to mixed, had greater total mean bird abundance during spring, summer, and winter and greater species richness and diversity during all seasons. However, these differences did not hold in urban transects, probably because of influences from surrounding suburban landscaping. We found 5 species to be more abundant overall in woody transects and one in mixed during one or more seasons, and within rural transects an additional 7 species more abundant in woody and 2 in mixed. Management along such rights-of-way should consider potential differences among migratory guilds and species in their response to right-of-way vegetation and urban versus rural surrounding land use.

AB  - Several recent studies have shown that amphibian populations may exhibit high genetic subdivision in areas with recent fragmentation and urban development. Less is known about the potential for genetic differentiation in continuous habitats. We studied genetic differentiation of red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) across a 2-km transect through continuous forest in Virginia, USA. Mark-recapture studies suggest very little dispersal for this species, whereas homing experiments and post-Pleistocene range expansion both suggest greater dispersal abilities. We used six microsatellite loci to examine genetic population structure and differentiation between eight subpopulations of red-backed salamanders at distances from 200 m to 2 km. We also used several methods to extrapolate dispersal frequencies and test for sex-biased dispersal. We found small, but detectable differentiation among populations, even at distances as small as 200 m. Differentiation was closely correlated with distance and both Mantel tests and assignment tests were consistent with an isolation-by-distance model for the population. Extrapolations of intergenerational variance in spatial position (sigma(2) < 15 m(2)) and pair-wise dispersal frequencies (4Nm < 25 for plots separated by 300 m) both suggest limited gene flow. Additionally, tests for sex-biased dispersal imply that dispersal frequency is similarly low for both sexes. We suggest that these low levels of gene flow and the infrequent dispersal observed in mark-recapture studies may be reconciled with homing ability and range expansion if dispersing animals rarely succeed in breeding in saturated habitats, if dispersal is flexible depending on the availability of habitat, or if dispersal frequency varies across the geographic range of red-backed salamanders.

AB  - In cities, trees planted along streets could play an important ecological role for spontaneous plants growing at their bases. For example, these trees could represent corridors by potentially connecting large green spaces (e.g., parks, gardens), which allow species to move within the urban matrix. We considered sets of urban trees in 15 streets in Paris, France, as metapopulations for 15 plant species. Our objective was to determine the factors influencing the dynamics of colonization and extinction of populations based on the distance of the streets to green spaces and biological traits of each species. Plant species in 1,324 tree bases of the Bercy District of Paris were surveyed annually from 2009 to 2015. For each species and each street, we used SPOMSIM software to identify the best-fit metapopulation model between four models with different colonization and extinction functions: propagule rain model (PRM) and Levins' model with or without rescue effect. Results demonstrated that species more often conformed to the PRM in streets near green spaces, which suggested that green spaces could act as sources for the populations in those streets. Species with seeds with long-term persistence more often conformed to the PRM, indicating that a soil seed bank helps species invade entire streets. Finally, a higher percentage of species with a short height conformed to models with a rescue effect, which indicated that those small species resisted the effects of weeding by the city technical services better than taller species. Synthesis and applications. This study showed how biological traits of species and geography of the district determine the dynamics of plants in the streets, and these results may provide important information for biodiversity management in cities.

AB  - Urbanization affects amphibian communities through habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation of habitat quality. The effects of these changes in habitat at different scales vary depending on the sensitivity of individual species. We assessed the breeding distribution of anurans along an urban-rural gradient in Shanghai, China, a region experiencing intensive urbanization. Our results showed that urban density had a significantly negative influence on the overall anuran abundance and diversity and that the responses of individual species to urbanization varied. Pond age was an overall predictor in models describing the responses of Pelophylax nigromaculatus, Fejervarya multistriata, and M. fissipes and total anuran abundance. The quality of habitat at a pond was also important, and the high abundance of Bufo gargarizans and Pelophy lax plancyi was associated with ponds with aquatic vegetation coverage. Urban density showed strong negative effects on B. gargarizans, total anuran abundance, and species richness. The broad-scale landscape variables associated with forests, agricultural fields, and wetlands surrounding breeding ponds have been shown to affect anuran abundance and species richness. The response of individual species, total abundance, and species richness to urbanization reflected differences in their ecological requirements. We quantified the effects of urbanization on frogs in a rapidly urbanizing region, and our results demonstrated that both multi-spatial and temporal variables affect anurans in Shanghai. Our results emphasized the importance of anuran conservation planning in urbanized areas to preserve and/or restore terrestrial habitat and to improve connectivity between ponds and other wetlands.

AB  - Previous genetic studies of the blue crab Callinectes sapidus along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts have reported weak or temporally variable spatial structure, suggesting high gene flow among distant populations possibly facilitated by long-distance larval dispersal or other features of blue crab life history. The use of relatively few genetic markers, however, may have limited power to detect subtle but significant structure that could inform fisheries management. In this study, the potential for genome-scale datasets to uncover subtle patterns of population structure in the blue crab was examined using a high-throughput genotyping approach (genotyping-by-sequencing) that generated data for more than 9,600 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in crabs from three populations: Panama City Beach, FL, Agawam River, MA, and Porto Alegre, Brazil. Principle components analyses among the three populations revealed very distinct clustering of the Brazilian samples from U.S. populations, likely reflecting restricted gene flow across the equator. Detailed analysis of population structure between the two U. S. populations revealed low but significant genetic differentiation (F-ST = 0.0103), with F-ST values ranging from -0.05 to 0.48. Previous studies have failed to detect significant genetic structure on a similar geographic scale. F-ST outlier analysis identified 242 loci (2.45% of total) with statistically extreme values at the false discovery rate alpha = 0.05 level, only 16 of which showed significant sequence homology to annotated proteins via BLASTx alignment. Top BLASTx hits were to crustacean or arthropod sequences and 8 of the 16 had high sequence similarity to transposable elements or related machinery. Finally, results of population assignment tests for the two U. S. populations showed that the full marker dataset provided good power to assign individuals back to their population of origin (similar to 83% and 92% success for Panama City Beach and Agawam River, respectively), which dropped significantly when using only 500 randomly selected SNPs (similar to 61% and 72% success). Overall, this study demonstrates the great utility of high-throughput sequencing technologies for characterizing fine-scale patterns of genetic structure in blue crabs, and this approach should substantially improve the delineation of stock structure and further advance our understanding of blue crab population connectivity and ecology.

AB  - ContextAlterations of landscapes and riverscapes by humans have fundamentally altered patterns in freshwater biodiversity throughout the world's aquatic systems. Past research has demonstrated precipitous declines in small- and medium-sized streams, with much less attention given to patterns and drivers of fish biodiversity in larger riverine systems.ObjectivesBy examining alpha and beta diversity of fishes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, China, we aimed to address the following question: What is the role of river-lake connectivity, wetland extent, and human stress factors (e.g., urbanization, fishing pressure, navigation, and shoreline modifications) in shaping fish alpha (species richness) and beta (species nestedness and turnover) diversity?MethodsWe examined associations among three classifications of fish assemblage data (i.e., all species, nonmigratory species, and migratory species) sampled along gradients of river-lake connectivity (i.e., Dongting and Poyang lakes), wetland extent, and a suite of human stress factors (urbanization, fishing pressure, navigation, shoreline modification). We conducted redundancy analyses and distance-based redundancy analyses to facilitate mechanistic interpretations of the associations between the explanatory variables and fish alpha and beta diversity.ResultsLongitudinally from the middle to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, fish alpha diversity showed marked decreases while fish beta diversity increased. River segments with greater levels of human impact were generally associated with reduced fish species richness, while segments with higher wetland extent and greater river-lake connectivity tended to support greater species richness. River-lake connectivity, wetland extent, and fishing pressure largely influenced total fish beta diversity. Species nestedness was primarily associated with amount of wetlands, and exhibited the strongest associations with nonmigratory fish species. Turnover was primarily associated with river-lake connectivity (mainly Poyang Lake), especially for migratory species.ConclusionsOur analyses demonstrate the roles of river-lake connectivity, wetland extent, and human stress factors in shaping patterns of alpha and beta diversity for migratory and nonmigratory fishes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Fish diversity conservation in this large river ecosystem calls for protecting hydrological connectivity and wetland habitats, along with reducing fishing pressure. Results from this study will help better inform fish conservation efforts in the Yangtze River and have implications towards other large river systems of the world.

AB  - Large cities in the tropics often comprise a myriad of manmade and natural elements that influence wildlife composition. Based on a citizen science-based project conducted in 2015, this study examined the combined effects of landscape factors on the bird assemblages in Kuala Lumpur and its conurbation, Peninsular Malaysia. A total of 48 species including 2,599 individual birds were recorded; the majority of which (>80%) were species of open habitat. Generalized linear mixed model indicated that the area of green cover had the strongest influence on number of individuals. Specifically, the abundance of individuals was increased by the presence of river corridors and roadside reserves. Areas located further away from water bodies and with less green cover had fewer birds. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating a varied landscape matrix into urban planning so as to maintain urban bird diversity and demonstrate the usefulness of citizen science in biodiversity monitoring.

AB  - Habitat loss and degradation are considered major threats to freshwater biodiversity and to invertebrates in particular. These often irreversible processes may lead to local and regional extinctions of species, most notably of stenotopic taxa. In spite of this, a number of studies have shown that small habitat patches can sustain rich and abundant communities. The present work assesses the relevance of a group of four small man-made (secondary) wildlife ponds to Odonata species diversity and abundance. Results obtained on pond recruiting capacity, species richness, abundance and habitat use by means of exuviae collection and monitoring of adults using a capture-mark-recapture (CMR) method indicate the potential suitability of these small aquatic biotopes and the surrounding landscape as habitat providers and stepping stone connectors in the VallSs lowlands (Catalonia, Spain). This region, close to the metropolitan area of Barcelona, has severely degraded natural habitats and high landscape fragmentation due to infrastructure, urban and industrial expansion. A comparison among a greater number of sites (ponds and sections of streams and rivers) distributed across the region showed that adequately managed small waterbodies harbour richer Odonata communities than others that are unmanaged or managed specifically for other types of fauna or uses. Appropriate care of these small biotopes avoids disturbance and keeps them free from vertebrates like fish and waterfowl which, under certain conditions, may have a strong influence on the invertebrate communities because, apart from feeding on larvae, they may have a negative impact on macrophyte development and water quality. While rivers and streams, the only natural aquatic habitats in the area, may be both expensive and technically challenging to restore and manage successfully, the creation and/or restoration of small ponds and short river sections in suitable locations can be a cost-effective method for enhancing freshwater vegetation and invertebrate diversity in this impacted landscape.

AB  - Coordinated efforts by ecologists and natural resource managers are necessary to balance the conservation of biological diversity with the potential for sustained economic development. Because some amphibians have suffered world-wide declines during the last 20 years, it is important to consider biologically based management strategies that will preserve local and regional populations. This paper provides a brief overview of potential threats to local and regional populations, the state of knowledge on population and landscape processes, and the critical elements needed for an effective management plan for amphibians. Local population dynamics and ecological connectivity of amphibian metapopulations must be considered in effective management plans. There are 3 critical factors to consider in a management plan (1) the number or density of individuals dispersing from individual wetlands, (2) the diversity of wetlands with regard to hydroperiod, and (3) the probability of dispersal among adjacent wetlands or the rescue and recolonization of local populations. Wetland losses reduce the total number of sites where pond-breeding amphibians can reproduce and recruit juveniles into the breeding population. Loss of small, temporary wetlands (<4.0 ha) may be especially harmful to amphibians because of their abundance and high species diversity. Alteration of wetlands, particularly hydrologic cycles, can severely impair completion of larval metamorphosis through either early pond drying (if hydroperiod is shortened) or through increased predation (if hydroperiod is lengthened or connections made with. fish-infested lakes, rivers, or canals). Wetland loss also increases the distance between neighboring wetlands that is critical to metapopulation source-sink processes. Reduction in wetland density reduces the probablity that populations will be rescued from extinction by nearby source populations. Local populations cannot be considered independent of source-sink processes that connect wetlands at the landscape or regional level. Further, the fragmentation of natural habitats From timber harvesting, agriculture, roads, drainage canals, or urban development impedes or prevents dispersal and decreases the probability of wetland recolonization. If our goal is to maintain or enhance present levels of amphibian diversity, then resource managers must incorporate critical elements into plans that protect population and landscape processes thereby maintaining viable populations and communities of amphibians.

AB  - Landscape fragmentation and structural changes are associated with spatial ecological and social processes. Landscape fragmentation modeling and land use distribution analysis provide a framework within which landscape pattern and structure can be studied and quantified. The Greater Bay Area (GBA) is one of the fastest growing urban agglomeration in China and due to the speedy socioeconomic development and urban expansion, the landscape became more diverse, fragmented, and complex in land use, structure, and shape. This study analyses the spatiotemporal variations in landscape pattern and structure in the Greater Bay Area based on the 40 years' time-series remote sensing data (19802020), fragmentation modeling, and structure change analysis. We used the fragmentation analysis at category and patch level and analyzed the fragmentation over forest, cropland, and grassland. We further employed the economic model of spatial Lorenz Curve and Gini Index for estimating the distribution of land use land cover (LULC) categories and structure changes. The results indicated that the landscape pattern indices of Greater Bay Area as whole, and its eleven cities had an obvious variations and diversity during 1980 to 2020. However, the diffusion and coalescence processes in each city follow distinct patterns. Due to the anthropogenic modifications, the landscape pattern and structural complexity increased gradually during the study period.

AB  - Animal species living in small populations with small ranges may be particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation. We investigated genetic population structure of the camas pocket gopher (Thomomys bul-bivorus), a species endemic to the Willamette Valley, Oregon, an area strongly affected by human development. Pocket gophers collected across much of the range of the species were analyzed for genetic structure, diversity, and influences of landscape on gene flow using microsatellite markers identified in closely related gopher species. We used k-means clustering to group individuals into genetically similar clusters based on their locations along principal component axes, and we evaluated the strength of evidence for this clustering using discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC). We used mixed-effects modeling to evaluate the influence of rivers and hills (represented by slopes) as explana-tory variables for pairwise individual genetic distances along principal component axes. Results supported a clinal, isola-tion-by-distance or isolation-by-resistance model, with greater genetic diversity near the central portion of the range. A model with both rivers and slopes was best supported, compared to either variable alone or a simple distance model. The Willamette River, which divides the range of the camas pocket gopher, appeared to have some restrictive effect on gene flow but was not a complete barrier. In population-level analyses, we observed strong genetic differentiation as well as persistent Wahlund effects, suggesting that complex genetic structure exists within a population connected across gradients of distance, rivers, and hills. The camas pocket gopher has persisted despite persecution as an agricul-tural pest and intensive habitat fragmentation due to agriculture, but the future may hold new conservation challenges as human population and urban development increase in the limited range of this endemic Oregon species.

AB  - Land-use changes often facilitate alien species invasion, impacting on biodiversity and ecosystem processes at the regional scale. Transport infrastructure is a potential corridor for biological invasion, but processes underlying invasion of alien species from human settlements along transport networks are uncertain. We surveyed alien and native plant species and their functional traits in roadside vegetation in Shiretoko National Park, Japan. The site is unique because there is a single invasion source (i.e., town). Vegetation, environmental and spatial factors were measured in 362 quadrats on two transects established along roads. Mean species richness within each quadrat (taxonomic alpha-diversity) was higher for alien assemblages, whereas mean functional richness (functional alpha-diversity) was higher for native assemblages. Alien species shared similar traits as generalists, which show lower functional diversity than specialists. Functional alpha-diversity of alien assemblages decreased with increasing distance from the source town, and the nestedness-resultant component of functional beta-diversity of alien assemblages accounted for a relatively high proportion of their total functional beta-diversity. Alien species with high dispersal ability were widely distributed, whereas other alien species were still limited to areas adjacent to the human settlement. Alien species showed a greater probability of having seed floss, lower percentage of perennial species, and lower seed dry mass than native species. Thus, alien species showed superior dispersal and competitive abilities compared with native species, and exclusion of all alien species is likely impractical. Consideration of functional traits may aid selection of alien species of particular concern for implementation of control and extermination measures.

AB  - We tested whether the landscape occupancy and local population size of the monophagous butterfly Cupido minimus can be predicted by patch size and isolation of its host plant or by other habitat characteristics. C mininius and its larval food plant Anthyllis vulneraria are classified as rare and endangered in northern Germany. Adults of C minimus are ranked as the most sedentary butterfly species in northern Europe.
   Around the city of Gottingen (Germany), we checked all known locations of A. vulneraria (n = 70) in June 2002 for butterfly eggs (in blooming flowerheads) and adult butterflies (within 20-min transects).
   We found eggs of C minimus or a high number of adults (>7) in all habitats with A. vulneraria (which are calcareous grasslands) even when isolated up to 2-4 km. In multiple regression analyses, local population size of adult butterflies was positively related to the cover of its larval food plant A. vulneraria explaining 65% of variance. Cover of A. vulneraria increased with increasing habitat area and increasing cover of plant species in flower and decreased with increasing cover of shrub layer. Habitat isolation and further factors describing habitat quality were not related to C. minimus population size or cover of its larval food plant.
   The results suggest that dispersal ability of C minimus is greater than expected and that management should focus to increase A. vulneraria patches. For conservation, low impact grazing once a year and removing of excessive shrubs in winter seems to be the most appropriate strategies. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim Hotspots of human activity are focal points for ecosystem disturbance and non-native introduction, from which invading populations disperse and spread. As such, connectivity to locations used by humans may influence the likelihood of invasion. Moreover, connectivity in freshwater ecosystems may follow the hydrological network. Here we tested whether multiple forms of connectivity to human recreational activities promotes biological invasion of freshwater ecosystems.
   Location England, UK.
   Time period 1990-2018.
   Major taxa studied One hundred and twenty-six non-native freshwater birds, crustaceans, fish, molluscs and plants.
   Methods Machine learning was used to predict spatial gradients in human recreation and two high risk activities for invasion (fishing and water sports). Connectivity indices were developed for each activity, in which human influence decayed from activity hotspots according to Euclidean distance (spatial connectivity) or hydrological network distance (downstream, upstream and along-channel connectivity). Generalized linear mixed models identified the connectivity type most associated to invasive species richness of each group, while controlling for other anthropogenic and environmental drivers.
   Results Connectivity to humans generally had stronger positive effects on invasion than all other drivers except recording effort. Recreation had stronger influence than urban land cover, and for most groups high risk activities had stronger effects than general recreation. Downstream human connectivity was most important for invasion by most of the groups, potentially reflecting predominantly hydrological dispersal. An exception was birds, for which spatial connectivity was most important, possibly because of overland dispersal capacity.
   Main conclusions These findings support the hypothesis that freshwater invasion is partly determined by an interaction between human activity and species dispersal in the hydrological network. By comparing alternative connectivity types for different human activities, our approach could enable robust inference of specific pathways and spread mechanisms associated with particular taxa. This would provide evidence to support better prioritization of surveillance and management for invasive non-native species.

AB  - Urban sprawl poses a major threat to aquatic biodiversity. The species richness in fish assemblages of fifteen ecosystems with different degrees of hydraulic connectivity in the floodplain of the Grijalva River watershed has been analysed and described along five years. After human interventions, four lagoons are permanently disconnected and three are temporarily connected. The other three lagoons stay permanently interconnected. Native cichlids and poeciliids dominated in number of species, representing 24 of the 55 listed species. These 55 species include six non-native invasive species in the Usumacinta Province. The lowest number of species was recorded in urban lagoons, while they were similar in rural lagoons and rivers. In addition, 60% of the fish absent in the lagoons of the Metropolitan Area of Villahermosa (MAV) are species with a marine or an estuarine affinity; thus, the permanently disconnected MAV lagoons have seven species less than the permanently connected rural lagoons. Diversity corresponds to that reported in the literature. In urban lagoons, low diversity and the high percentage of lacking fish with a marine or an estuarine affinity indicate that ichthyological diversity is favoured by the interconnection of rivers and rural lagoons in the floodplain of the Grijalva River Basin.

AB  - The context of urban rivers is one of pollution of their courses, the degradation of riparian habitats, the loss of biodiversity, and the marginalization of the human populations that live next to them. Due to urban growth, the hydrological dynamics in entire basins and the hydromorphology of rivers are changing. This situation increases flooding, decreases the availability of water for human use, and disconnects the rivers from the dynamics of the city. Agroforestry is the integration of cultural, wild, and domesticated diversity with use, conservation, and restoration objectives. These practices in cities can contribute to addressing the problems mentioned. We analyze agroforestry practices and the socio-ecological contributions to urban river rehabilitation. We review 37 experiences worldwide. Agroforestry practices included in the review are trees and hedgerows; wetland agroforestry; aquatic, botanical, edible, educational, and rain gardens; bioswales; green parking lots; food forestry; vegetation in alleys and streets; vertical terrace walls, among others. Agroforestry contributes to efforts to solve urban river problems, improve water quality and access, restore riparian habitats, enhance river hydromorphology, support local economies, and create a river culture. We emphasize promoting multi-relational people-river interactions based on theoretical and practical frameworks that integrate diverse disciplines, perspectives, and experiences.

AB  - Since the 1990s, brown root rot caused by Phellinus noxius (Corner) Cunningham has become a major tree disease in Taiwan. This fungal pathogen can infect more than 200 hardwood and softwood tree species, causing gradual to fast decline of the trees. For effective control, we must determine how the pathogen is disseminated and how the new infection center of brown root rot is established. We performed Illumina sequencing and de novo assembly of a single basidiospore isolate Daxi42 and obtained a draft genome of similar to 40 Mb. By comparing the 12,217 simple sequence repeat (SSR) regions in Daxi42 with the low-coverage Illumina sequencing data for four additional P. noxius isolates, we identified 154 SSR regions with potential polymorphisms. A set of 13 polymorphic SSR markers were then developed and used to analyze 329 P. noxius isolates collected from 73 tree species from urban/agricultural areas in 14 cities/counties all around Taiwan from 1989 to 2012. The results revealed a high proportion (similar to 98%) of distinct multilocus genotypes (MLGs) and that none of the 329 isolates were genome-wide homozygous, which supports a possible predominant outcrossing reproductive mode in P. noxius. The diverse MLGs exist as discrete patches, so brown root rot was most likely caused by multiple clones rather than a single predominant strain. The isolates collected from diseased trees near each other tend to have similar genotype(s), which indicates that P. noxius may spread to adjacent trees via root-to-root contact. Analyses based on Bayesian clustering, F-ST statistics, analysis of molecular variance, and isolation by distance all suggest a low degree of population differentiation and little to no barrier to gene flow throughout the P. noxius population in Taiwan. We discuss the involvement of basidiospore dispersal in disease dissemination.

AB  - Understanding the spatial patterns and environmental drivers of freshwater diversity and community structure is a key challenge in biogeography and conservation biology. However, previous studies have focussed primarily on taxonomic diversity and have largely ignored the phylogenetic and functional facets resulting in an incomplete understanding of the community assembly. Here, we examine the influence of local environmental, hydrological proximity effects, land-use type and spatial structuring on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic (using taxonomic relatedness as a proxy) alpha and beta diversity (including the turnover and nestedness-resultant components) of pond macroinvertebrate communities. Ninety-five ponds across urban and non-urban land-uses in Leicestershire, UK were examined. Functional and phylogenetic alpha diversity were negatively correlated with species richness. At the alpha scale, functional diversity and taxonomic richness were primarily determined by local environmental factors while phylogenetic alpha diversity was driven by spatial factors. Compositional variation (beta diversity) of the different facets and components of functional and phylogenetic diversity were largely determined by local environmental variables. Pond surface area, dry phase length and macrophyte cover were consistently important predictors of the different facets and components of alpha and beta diversity. Our results suggest that pond management activities aimed at improving biodiversity should focus on improving and/or restoring local environmental conditions. Quantifying alpha and beta diversity of the different biodiversity facets facilitates a more accurate assessment of patterns in diversity and community structure. Integrating taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity into conservation strategies will increase their efficiency and effectiveness, and maximise biodiversity protection in human-modified landscapes.

AB  - Allozyme electrophoresis was used to evaluate levels and distribution of genetic diversity in Iberian populations of the threatened coastal sand dune plant Stachys maritima (Lamiaceae). During the last century, this species was subjected to severe habitat fragmentation, mainly as a consequence of tourism activities and urban pressures, with a decreasing of area up to 99% in the Iberian Peninsula and a remaining total population size of ca. 250 individuals. Extremely low levels of genetic variation were detected (P = 14.0, A = 1.16 and H-e = 0.066). From the 20 interpretable loci found, only 4 were polymorphic and another one, the ldh-2 locus, showed a fixed heterozygous banding pattern, which may be attributed to gene duplication. Low values of diversity can be related to small population size and isolation of populations. The degree of threat has been increased from vulnerable (VU) to critically endangered (CR), according to the IUCN criteria. Conservation policies should be focused on maintaining population size and gene flow, in addition to preserving its habitat, although reintroductions and reinforcements appear to be necessary to ensure long-term viability of populations.

AB  - Aedes albopictus is a highly invasive disease vector with an expanding worldwide distribution. Genetic assays using low to medium resolution markers have found little evidence of spatial genetic structure even at broad geographic scales, suggesting frequent passive movement along human transportation networks. Here we analysed genetic structure of Aedes albopictus collected from 12 sample sites in Guangzhou, China, using thousands of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We found evidence for passive gene flow, with distance from shipping terminals being the strongest predictor of genetic distance among mosquitoes. As further evidence of passive dispersal, we found multiple pairs of full-siblings distributed between two sample sites 3.7 km apart. After accounting for geographical variability, we also found evidence for isolation by distance, previously undetectable in Ae. albopictus. These findings demonstrate how large SNP datasets and spatially-explicit hypothesis testing can be used to decipher processes at finer geographic scales than formerly possible. Our approach can be used to help predict new invasion pathways of Ae. albopictus and to refine strategies for vector control that involve the transformation or suppression of mosquito populations.

AB  - Previous research has shown that trees and other roadside vegetation can mitigate adverse environmental conditions on urban street corridors, and, in turn, positively contribute to pedestrian perceptions of safety and walkability. In this study, pedestrian surveys (n = 181) were collected from three Massachusetts post-industrial cities to understand if street trees moderate pedestrian perceptions of safety. Three street tree conditions - sparse street tree abundance, mature street trees, and new street tree plantings - were compared as study settings. Several methods were used to correlate perceived safety with street trees and sociodemographic variables, including repeated measures and between-group ANOVA, qualitative open-coding, exploratory factor analysis, and simple moderation analysis. This study did not find empirical evidence that street trees influence people's perceived safety, nor that street trees substantively contribute to feelings of safety while walking. These findings suggest that pedestrians do not have universal experiences of safety in walking environments, and different sociocultural backgrounds may contribute to diverging experiences of safety or fear when walking. Our research supports previous findings on the ways in which pedestrians value street trees; this can be extended to municipal or regional Complete Streets guidance and technical assistance programs.

AB  - Forest fragments are increasingly common in the tropics as pristine forests are cleared. Fragments stranded within cities are especially stress-prone due to their greatly altered environment and high human impacts. We review biodiversity and ecological studies from Bukit Timah, a tropical forest fragment in Singapore, to ask how this forest has contributed to our understanding of tropical ecology and fragmentation effects, and list the conservation values of this forest. Evidence from Amazonian fragments predicts that losses in diversity and forest function follow fragmentation, and although Bukit Timah has adhered to some of those predictions, other aspects of the forest appeared remarkably resilient. As might be expected, declines in plant, invertebrate, bird, and mammal diversity occurred not only historically but also across two surveys made about 20 years apart. In other ways Bukit Timah proved surprising. Aboveground biomass fluctuated but did not plummet drastically, and was comparable to levels found in primary forests in the region. The extirpation of large fauna did not appear to reduce the dispersal of large seeded plant species, likely due to continued dispersal by small-mammals and birds. Exotic tree species are confined to recovering secondary forest fringes and do not threaten the primary forest, except for perhaps shade tolerant Par ' a rubber and a handful of cultivated fruit trees. Studies of birds and plants found that life history differences could account for differences in genetic connectivity or isolation for different species, with population genetic implications for other taxa. Despite being a small fragment, new species of plants and animals continue to be discovered or re-discovered. Clearly, there are reasons to celebrate Bukit Timah as a forest fragment that withstood two centuries of human impacts. Nonetheless, many measures can be implemented to better secure its future.

AB  - Farmland ponds are a highly threatened freshwater habitat which has undergone dramatic losses during the last 200 years due to land drainage schemes and agricultural intensification. Agri-environment schemes (AES) incentivize farmers to adopt farming methods to benefit biodiversity, yet there are a paucity of data evaluating the success of artificially created AES ponds as analogues of natural ponds in an attempt to recreate lost environments. We examined variation in environmental parameters and aquatic and terrestrial invertebrate communities between 38 natural ponds and 91 artificial ponds that were created in south-west Ireland (n = 129). Artificial ponds in agricultural grassland did not replicate natural ponds in adjacent semi-natural habitats differing significantly in size, pH, conductivity, productivity (indicated by submerged and emergent plant cover including algae) and surrounding vegetation structure that is, sward height. These differences significantly influenced aquatic and terrestrial invertebrate community structure with a suite of indicator taxa in both natural and artificial ponds. The conservation value of artificial ponds in agricultural grasslands should not be underestimated as they had 43% higher aquatic species richness and 33% higher aquatic species abundance than natural ponds in adjacent semi-natural habitats. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that artificial agri-environment scheme ponds created in agricultural grasslands, whilst not direct analogues of natural ponds in adjacent semi-natural habitats, do fulfil a role in preserving high local biodiversity albeit representing a different community of species. Creation of ponds in farmland as well as in adjacent natural habitats could provide a wider range of environmental conditions and richer associated macroinvertebrate communities, increasing landscape connectivity and further enhancing regional biodiversity.

AB  - Urbanization has negative consequences for the integrity of ecosystems and services they provide, by reducing their extent and quality in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Few studies have explored how urban infrastructure expansion affects the spatial connectivity of coastal ecosystems by provoking their fragmentation and loss. Here we explore changes in the spatial connectivity of coastal ecosystems due to urbanization, analyzing ecosystem extent and concatenation with urban infrastructures (shared perimeter) in four bays of the Coquimbo region of northern Chile (from 29 degrees S to 32 degrees S) as model systems. Increase in natural-to-urban concatenation patterns were observed in most urbanized bays; sandy beaches and wetlands were the habitats most connected with urban infrastructures like roads and coastal artificial defenses. Availability of ecosystem services is compromised by progressive loss of natural connectivity and poor governance structure, which seems to confer high vulnerability to urbanized bays with future urban expansion. Complementary actions are proposed to reduce the vulnerability of coastal urban systems, considering 1) investment in nature-based infrastructures for coastal defenses, 2) restoration-rehabilitation of natural (remnant) urban ecosystems and eco-engineering of current artificial infrastructures, focusing on reestablishment of biodiversity patterns and habitat connectivity, and 3) limitation of coastal town and village expansion.

AB  - Information on mechanisms of differentiation or homogenization of urban floras is deficient, despite their importance for urban nature conservation and urban land management. Roads, as a major human promoter of urbanization, can be an initial habitat for plants dispersed by transportations. We assumed that variation in weed vegetation along urban-rural roadside gradients is small, particularly in curbside cracks. We classified vegetation occurring in curbside cracks along the National Route 3 in southern japan and compared the characteristics of the vegetation types recognized. Species in curbside cracks were recorded on 40 plots. Three vegetation types were classified, in part related to surrounding land-use types. Although the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and the number of native species clearly differed among the vegetation types in the curbside cracks, no significant differences between the three floristic vegetation types were found in the number of non-natives and invasive alien species. This may result from the small specificity and complexity of landscape structures, due to the continuity and connectivity of paved-road networks. Of the 122 species, 44 were non-natives or invasive alien species. The vegetation types generally involved the same plant families, with large numbers of species from the Asteraceae and Poaceae, regardless of vegetation types, but frequency of occurrence of the two families clearly differed between natives and non-natives and invasive alien species. Ephemeral non-natives and invasive alien species. particularly Asteraceae and Poaceae, seem to have advantageous dispersal strategies or low habitat dependency facilitating their occurrence in curbside cracks, regardless of adjacent land uses and the urban-rural landscape gradient. Expansion of these species may cause a homogenization of regional floras along roads. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Habitat alteration has been identified as one of the major causes of amphibian decline. In this study, the genetic structure of seven fire salamander subpopulations in the urbanized area of Salzburg (Austria) was investigated based on seven polymorphic microsatellite loci. We combined Bayesian clustering approaches (STRUCTURE, TESS) with the traditional F-statistics to evaluate the effect of potential barriers on gene flow. Both clustering approaches suggested that all sampled individuals belong to a single genetic pool (K = 1). While no clear-cut sign of genetic differentiation could be detected, pairwise FST-values suggest that the city of Salzburg potentially has an effect, but the effect of the highway leading to it remains hypothetical. This study corroborates that habitat alteration effects might take several generations before leading to isolated genetic pools, particularly in long-lived species. Such delayed effects have to be taken into account for population genetic analyses, in particular when it comes to conservation management and planning.

AB  - Amphibians are particularly sensitive to landscape fragmentation. Potential barriers between breeding sites can negatively influence the dispersal of individuals and increase genetic structure between populations. In this study, we genotyped 10 microsatellites for 334 marbled newts (Triturus marmoratus) at 11 different locations in Western France. Samples were collected in different regions with contrasting agricultural landscapes (low and high proportion of arable land in the north and south, respectively). We found a strong genetic structure between the northern and southern sampling sites. Isolation by distance was recorded after 62 km, but within the northern region, little or no genetic structure was detected over large distances (up to 114 km). Genetic structure at shorter distance (43 km) was found between sites situated in landscapes with larger amounts of arable lands. A significant positive relationship was found between the pairwise genetic distance (F-st) between sites and the amount of arable land together with the distance between sites. Our results suggest that the Loire River might act as a corridor for the marbled newt, while arable land might act as a barrier. Finally, although a large city is located between sampling sites, no effect was detected on population structure.

AB  - The landscape patterns of urban green spaces have been proven to be important factors that affect urban thermal environments. However, the spatial effect of the landscape patterns of urban patches with different vegetation densities on land surface temperature (LST) has not been investigated in detail. In this study, the built-up area of Xuzhou City was taken as the study region, and the four phases of Landsat 8 images and their corresponding ground observations from 2014 to 2020 were selected as the basic data. Normalized spectral mixture analysis and an improved mono-window algorithm were used to invert the vegetation component fraction (VF) and LST maps of the study area, respectively, and the surface patches were classified into five levels according to the VF values, from low to high. Four landscape-level and five class-level metrics were then selected to represent the landscape characteristics of each VF-level patch. The tested values of 60 and 780 m were regarded as the best grain size and spatial extent, respectively, in the calculation of all landscape metrics of ALL VF-level patches (VFLM) using the moving-window method. The results of bivariate Moran's I for VFLM and LST showed the following: (1) for landscape-level metrics, only the Shannon diversity index and patch diversity have substantial negative spatial correlations with LST (with average |Moran's I| < 0.2), indicating that the types of VF levels and the number of patches exert weak negative effects on the thermal environment for a certain area; (2) for class-level metrics such as percentage of landscape, patch cohesion index, largest patch index, landscape shape index, and aggregation index, only the class-level metrics of sub-high VF (LV4) and extreme-high (LV5) VF levels patches have significant negative spatial correlations with LST (with high Moran's I value, and high-high and low-high distributions in local indications of spatial association cluster maps), indicating that only the patches of high VF levels can effectively alleviate LST and that patch proportion, natural connectivity degree, predominance degree, shape complexity, and aggregation degree are important landscape factors for regulating the thermal environment. Principal component analysis and multiple linear regression were applied to determine the impact weights of the class-level VFLMs of LV4 and LV5 patches on LST, which revealed the contributions of these landscape metrics to mitigating the urban heat island effect (UHI). These results signify the importance of and differences in the spatial patterns of various VF-level patches for UHI regulation; these patterns can provide new perspectives and references for urban green space planning and climate management.

AB  - This study utilized a finite mixture distribution model (FMDM) to identify the distribution of bird diversity in urban and suburban areas of the Taipei basin. The spatial patterns of Shannon's diversity index were estimated using Sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS) with bird investigation data. To validate the results of FMDM, bird groups were classified by two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) based on bird presence-absence records. The probabilities exceeding FMDM's cut-off values for suburban bird communities were obtained from SGS realizations. The results showed that bird diversity in the Taipei basin could be comprised of two-component mixture distributions for urban and suburban bird communities, respectively. The FMDM bird diversity classifications fit the TWINSPAN groups of urban and suburban species. The spatial maps of bird diversity in the study area provide evidence that a metropolis can cause changes in the spatial characteristics of bird communities at the landscape level. Furthermore, the bird diversity and land use maps could be useful for future conservation and urban planning in Taipei Basin, particularly urban green spaces and wetlands. The maps could also be utilized in network planning of green belts or corridors for ecological conservation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Resources for biodiversity conservation and invasive plant management are limited, and restoring invaded vegetation is labour-intensive and expensive. Managers must prioritize their actions to achieve their goals efficiently and effectively. They must distinguish between areas that require only the removal of invasive alien plants ("passive restoration"D) from those that require additional restoration measures ("active restoration"). This study used a multi-criterion approach (Analytical Hierarchical Process) to develop a framework for identifying areas that require active restoration, and then to prioritize these areas for active restoration. The South African city of Cape Town is used as a test case to illustrate the utility of the framework. Framework criteria selected in determining the need for active restoration included: dominant alien species invading the area, density of invasion, duration of invasion, indigenous vegetation cover, adjacent land use, level of disturbance, size of the area, aspect, soil texture, soil depth and erodibility, slope and vegetation type. In deciding which areas to prioritize for active restoration, factors such as vegetation conservation status, selection in a regional conservation plan and connectivity function were assessed. Importance in ecosystem functioning (by providing a diversity of habitats and soil conservation) and the delivery of ecosystem service benefits were also considered. The resulting framework provides an objective tool for prioritizing sites for active restoration.

AB  - The world is rapidly urbanizing, thereby transforming natural landscapes and changing the abundance and distribution of organisms. However, insights into the effects of urbanization on species interactions, and plant-pathogen interactions in particular, are lacking. We investigated the effects of urbanization on powdery mildew infection on Quercus robur at continental and within-city scales. At the continental scale, we compared infection levels between urban and rural areas of different-sized cities in Europe, and investigated whether plant traits, climatic variables and CO2 emissions mediated the effect of urbanization on infection levels. Within one large city (Stockholm, Sweden), we further explored whether local habitat features and spatial connectivity influenced infection levels during multiple years. At the continental scale, infection severity was consistently higher on trees in urban than rural areas, with some indication that temperature mediated this effect. Within Stockholm city, temperature had no effect, while local accumulation of leaf litter negatively affected powdery mildew incidence in one out of three years, and more connected trees had lower infection levels. This study is the first to describe the effects of urbanization on plant-pathogen interactions both within and among cities, and to uncover the potential mechanisms behind the observed patterns at each scale.

AB  - Understanding how human-dominated landscapes affect biodiversity and ecosystems is essential for effective conservation planning. This work aims to understand the relationship between the acoustic diversity of forested landscapes, and descriptors of habitat structure, composition, and anthropogenic pressure, as well as to identify the characteristic scale at which acoustic community diversity relates to those metrics in central Massachusetts. Ten passive acoustic recorders were placed within forest areas in central Massachusetts, during the breeding season. Mono audio recordings were collected during the dawn chorus. The relationship between acoustic indices (AI), and core habitat quality, connectivity, vegetation productivity, percent tree cover, human edge, artificial illumination, and traffic noise were assessed. Significant relationships were found between AI and variables related to habitat structure and human pressure. Sounds related to biota (biophony) and acoustic complexity were positively correlated with core habitat quality, connectivity, and vegetation while negatively correlated with human pressure variables, including nighttime lights, traffic noise, and human edge. AI can therefore act as successful indicators of habitat quality in highly modified landscapes The highest correlations were found at buffers between 1.5 and 3 Km. This response of AI to the broad spatial context and not to the local site characteristics indicate that they can act as robust landscapescale indicators. The large characteristic scale indicates that urban planning should consider potential impacts acting at scales beyond site planning. Moreover, conservation planning can benefit from managing the context matrix to support biodiversity, particularly traffic noise and artificial illumination reduction initiatives.

AB  - Isolation of a population can result in decreased genetic variability as a consequence of inbreeding, random genetic drift and reduced gene flow This effect is reinforced when it concerns a small population. We used two molecular techniques, multilocus minisatellite DNA fingerprinting and microsatellite analysis, to compare population genetic parameters between a small, possibly isolated natural population of moorhens and a large, presumably non-isolated population at a distance of approximately 30 km. Although sample sizes were still relatively low both minisatellite and microsatellite analysis indicated that the small population is not genetically impoverished, despite being located at the centre of a large city. Nevertheless, we found significant between-populational genetic differentiation, which suggests that there is little gene now between the two populations studied.

AB  - The ongoing discussion on the nature of the organization of Early Bronze Age settlements and their social structure in an intensely settled part of the southern Levant (independent 'city-states' vs 'neither cities nor states') calls for data on which to base our understanding of shared economic patterns and regional connections. Here, we report the results of our macrobotanical investigation of the Early Bronze Age III (2,680-2,600 cal BCE) levels at Tell es-Safi/Gath, a large fortified settlement in central Canaan. A dense residential neighborhood was sampled at high resolution for a multi-faceted analysis of plant use in order to address its economic strategies and regional relationships. The resulting rich and diverse plant assemblage enables reconstruction of the diversity of agriculture, fuel sources, land use practices, mobility, and connectivity. Results of the study provide, for the first time, direct botanical evidence for the structural patterns of an intensive localized agro-pastoral economy and enable comparative analysis of the regional diet. Moreover, the results shed light on rare yet continuous long-distance plant dispersal and human mobility across biogeographical boundaries within the southern Levant.

AB  - The three main landscape dynamics now underway in Europe urban sprawl, agricultural intensification and rural abandonment are observed in a Catalan study area located in an edge environment between a metropolitan fringe and two natural protected sites. In this context, ecological connectivity becomes a key to host biodiversity. By applying to the available land cover maps several landscape metrics and modelling, we perform a historical landscape analysis of the changes experienced in land-use patterns and ecological processes. The results show up the relevant connectivity role played by the traditional agro-forest mosaics that linked both sides of the edge, providing a heterogeneous but continuous land matrix able to maintain high species richness. However these agro-forest mosaics are currently disappearing due to the ongoing urban sprawl and agricultural intensification in the plain, and reforestation leading to rural abandonment in the mountains. The current location of Mediterranean orchids in the study area is used to demonstrate that the results obtained through the ecological landscape assessment are not an analytical construct, but reflect the actual loss of meadows and open grazing spaces formerly created in woodland areas by a traditional multiple-use of forest and pastures now abandoned. The results show up that recovering the historical dynamics behind the current land-use patterns is a necessity for the emerging approaches to integrated biological conservation seeking a more complex and multidimensional management of sustainable cultural landscapes.

AB  - Green roofs could mitigate the negative effects of urbanization by providing habitats for arthropods. However, more studies are necessary to understand if these new ecosystems can harbor similar numbers of species and levels of ecological processes than habitats at the ground-level. In 15 houses of 1-2 floors with extensive green roofs from a semi-rural area in Cordoba (central Argentina), we analyzed the species richness and abundance of arthropods on green roofs and their neighboring ground-level habitats and evaluated the influence of landscape composition (proportion of buildings, grasslands, and streets). We focus on feeding groups (herbivores, predators, omnivores, detritivores, parasitoids, and pollinators) and two ecological processes (herbivory and predation). Moreover, we tested two factors that may drive the communities on ground-level habitats and green roofs: habitat area and plant species richness. Species richness and abundance of arthropods (total and by feeding groups), and predation rates were significantly higher in ground-level habitats than on green roofs. Nevertheless, arthropod diversity on living roofs was striking, with almost 400 species from different feeding groups. Street cover in the landscape negatively affected total richness and several feeding groups. On ground-level habitats, herbivory increased with street cover and predation with grassland cover. The main factor driving arthropods in both green roofs and ground-level habitats was habitat area, whereas plant richness had a positive effect only in predators, detritivores, and omnivores. Our results reinforce the role of green roofs as habitat for arthropod species in semi-rural areas of Latin-American countries, where the evidence was so far lacking.

AB  - Railway networks contribute to the direct mortality of wildlife through collisions with trains, which can threaten vulnerable wildlife populations even in protected areas, including grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in Banff and Yoho National Parks, Canada. Mitigation to reduce bear-train collisions requires information about how grizzly bears use the railway spatially and temporally and how particular types of use might increase collision vulnerability. We used data from 27 grizzly bears fitted with global positioning system (GPS) collars between 2000 and 2016 to relate railway use by bears via resource selection functions to variables that described land cover, human use, and topography. We used the same suite of explanatory variables to distinguish pairs of 4 types of steps, in which 3 successive GPS points (with 2-hr fix rates) included >= 1 within 30 m of the rail (hereafter on) and 2 others that defined locations where bears effectively entered the railway (first fix off rail, next 2 on), crossed it (only the middle fix on the rail), continued along the railway (all 3 fixes on), or exited the railway corridor (first 2 on, last off). We compared both sites of higher use and each of these 4 step types to the relative frequency of bear-train collisions, predicting a positive correlation for continue step types. Relative to available locations, bears were more likely to use the railway close to railroad sidings (sections of twinned track where trains sometimes stop), at intermediate distances from human-use features (e.g., town sites, highways, trails), in areas with lower values of the compound topographic index (a proxy for wetness; within 500 m), and within 90 m of rugged terrain. Seasonally, bears made greater use of the railway in spring and fall. Among 1,515 sequences of 3 steps, crossing locations comprised >50% and were most distinct from continue locations (about 20%), which occurred in areas with more rugged terrain (within 300 m), closer to railway sidings, in spring and fall, and with steps that were 60% shorter. Contrary to our prediction, past reports of bear-train collisions were negatively correlated with continue locations and unrelated to overall use or any other movement type. Our results suggest that railway use by bears increased where it provided increased forage or easier travel, particularly in spring and fall, but more work will be needed to determine the mechanistic basis of bear-train collisions. Meanwhile, mitigation efforts such as habitat alteration or warning systems might target locations where past strikes are concentrated for grizzly bears or other sensitive populations.

AB  - By social connectivity we refer to the communication and movement of people, goods, ideas, and culture along and across rivers, recognizing longitudinal, lateral, and vertical connectivity, much as has been described for other riversfor hydrology and ecology. We focus on rivers as they pass through cities, and the relationships between these rivers and city dwellers. Historically, the most important longitudinal connectivity function of rivers was their role as major transport routes and the simplification of formerly complex, irregular banks and beds, into straight, uniform shipping channels has resulted in a loss of lateral and vertical connectivity, notably the quotidian uses such as fishing, washing clothes, water supply, swimming and other recreation.
   The scale of the river itself, and its scale in comparison to the scale of the city, largely determine the river's social function and the degree to which it influences city form. River width affects the perception of 'closeness' of the other bank, ease of bridging the river, influence of the river on the city's street pattern, and type of waterfront uses that occur. Up to 15 m wide, people can converse, whereas across rivers similar to 50 to similar to 200 m wide, people are not recognizable but still clearly visible, instilling the banks with a 'lively' atmosphere. At widths over similar to 200 m, people blur, yet moving vehicles and trees branches shaldng in wind may still provide some dynamic elements to an otherwise static landscape composed of building facades. In exceptionally wide rivers, the city on the opposite bank is little more than a skyline, which often becomes a signature and symbol of regional identity.
   In contemplating how people use rivers, we can define a range of human activities in relation to height above the water (i.e., instream to banktop), a vertical dimension of human connectivity with rivers. Many uses occur on the top of the bank, such as quiet contemplation, walking, or cycling along a riverside trail, while others depend on contact with the water itself, such as wading, diving, and canoeing (which presupposes adequate water quality). Many of these relationships are illustrated by the challenge of reconnecting Cairo with the Nile. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Metapopulations occur in fragmented landscapes, and consist of demographically-independent populations connected by dispersal. Nevertheless, anthropogenic habitat fragmentation may be fatal to metapopulations, as it disrupts dispersal and gene flow, and undermines the balance between population extinction and colonization. Understanding the extent to which particular land-use practices disrupt dispersal and gene flow is therefore crucial for conserving metapopulations. We examined the structure and fragmentation of metapopulations of the endangered growling grass frog (Litoria raniformis) in an urbanizing landscape in southern Australia. Population clustering analyses revealed three distinct genetic units, corresponding to the three wetland clusters sampled. Isolation-by-distance was apparent between populations, and genetic distance was significantly correlated with the presence of urban barriers between populations. Our study provides evidence that urbanization fragments metapopulations of L. raniformis. Managers of L. raniformis in urbanizing landscapes should seek to mitigate effects of urbanization on dispersal and gene flow.

AB  - Cryptococcus neoformans causes the second most common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. In Brazil, 4.5% of the AIDS-related opportunistic infections are caused by C neoformans and all varieties are recognized as etiological agents of cryptococcosis. This pathogen is a ubiquitous environmental yeast, commonly associated with avian excreta and decaying wood, especially Eucalypt species. The aim of the present study was to search for C neoformans in Eucalypts and analyze the genotypic diversity of the obtained isolates by RAPD and PCR fingerprinting. All obtained isolates have been C neoformans var. neoformans, serotype D molecular type VNIV Serotype D, was isolated from 3 (37.5%) out of 8 cities surveyed in the South Brazilian state Rio Grande do Sul. Nine (9%) out of 99 environmental samples were obtained from Eucalypt species, Eucalyptus calmadulensis and Eucalyptus tereticornis. Molecular analysis using RAPD and PCR-fingerprinting revealed very little genetic diversity in the obtained cryptococcal serotype D isolates. To our knowledge this is the first report of the isolation of serotype D from Eucalyptus trees in Brazil. More studies are required in order to establish the ecological significance of this finding.

AB  - Ecosystem restoration is the practice of assisting recovery in degraded ecological communities. The aims of restoration are typically broad, involving the reinstatement of composition, structure, function, and resilience to disturbances. One common restoration tactic in degraded urban systems is to control invasive species, relying on passive restoration for further ecosystem-level recovery. Here, we test whether this is an effective restoration strategy in Garry oak savanna, a highly threatened and ecologically important community in the North American Pacific Northwest. In urban savanna patches surrounding Victoria, British Columbia, community members have been actively removing aggressive invasive exotic species for over a decade. Based on vegetation surveys from 2007, we tested ecosystem changes in structure, composition, and resilience (i.e., functional redundancy and response diversity) across 10 years of varied management levels. We expected higher levels of invasive species management would correspond with improvements to these ecosystem metrics. However, management explained little of the patterns found over the 10-year-period. Woody encroachment was a complicated process of native and exotic invasion, while resilience and compositional changes were most closely tied with landscape connectivity. Thus, though invasive species management may prevent further degradation, active restoration strategies after removal are likely required for recovery of the ecosystem.

AB  - Firewood and charcoal are used on a daily basis both in rural areas and in cities. This type of energy is produced by one of the most ancient traditional methods, known as coppice, which harvest tree sprouts. There is controversy about its effects on forests: it preserves populations and tree cover of species used, but reduces density, inhibits sexual reproduction and generates genetic erosion. We inquired if it was possible to identify a loss of genetic diversity in oak populations traditionally used for charcoal by the Zongolica Nahuas in Veracruz state, Mexico. We studied populations ofQuercus laurina,Quercus calophyllaandQuercus rugosain three different altitudes. Molecular analysis with eight nuclear codominant microsatellites was performed to determine the diversity, structure and gene flow of these species. Results forQ. laurinawere Na = 8.458,I= 1.766, Ho = 0.679, polymorphism = 100%, Fis = 0.079, with intraindividual variation of 81.55%. ForQ. calophylla: Na = 7.250,I= 1.563, Ho = 0.646, polymorphism = 91.67%, Fis = 0.083, with intraindividual variation of 83.80%. ForQ. rugosa: Na = 6.958,I= 1.510, Ho = 0.574, polymorphism = 91.67%, Fis = 0.204, with intraindividual variation of 81.99%; this species shows signals of an early genetic isolation process. Our findings indicate thatQuercusgenetic diversity for the three species is high and comparable with oak species in Mexico and worldwide. We conclude that at the present, coppice is preserving a historical diversity in adult trees kept alive through sprouting. Nonetheless, problems with coppice systems elsewhere, unregulated harvesting and expansion of pine plantation in the region suggest that further studies, hand in hand with a landscape management approach that improve charcoal and firewood production, may be valuable for Sierra de Zongolica genetic biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Background: Dengue fever, the most prevalent global arboviral disease, represents an important public health problem in Indonesia. Control of dengue relies on the control of its main vector, the mosquito Aedes aegypti, yet nothing is known about the population history and genetic structure of this insect in Indonesia. Our aim was to assess the spatio-temporal population genetic structure of Ae. aegypti in Yogyakarta, a densely populated region on Java with common dengue outbreaks.
   Methods: We used multiple marker systems (microsatellites, nuclear and mitochondrial genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms generated via Restriction-site Associated DNA sequencing) to analyze 979 Ae. aegypti individuals collected from the Yogyakarta city and the surrounding hamlets during the wet season in 2011 and the following dry season in 2012. We employed individual-and group-based approaches for inferring genetic structure.
   Results: We found that Ae. aegypti in Yogyakarta has spatially structured and seasonally stable populations. The spatial structuring was significant for the nuclear and mitochondrial markers, while the temporal structuring was non-significant. Nuclear markers identified three main genetic clusters, showing that hamlets have greater genetic isolation from each other and from the inner city sites. However, one hamlet experienced unrestricted mosquito interbreeding with the inner city, forming a single genetic cluster. Genetic distance was poorly correlated with the spatial distance among mosquito samples, suggesting stronger influence of human-assisted gene flow than active mosquito movement on spatial genetic structure. A star-shaped mitochondrial haplotype network and a significant R-2 test statistic (R-2 = 0.0187, P = 0.001) support the hypothesis that Ae. aegypti in Yogyakarta originated from a small or homogeneous source and has undergone a relatively recent demographic expansion.
   Conclusion: We report the first insights into the spatio-temporal genetic structure and the underlying processes in the dengue fever mosquito from Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Our results provide valuable information on the effectiveness of local control measures as well as guidelines for the implementation of novel biocontrol strategies such as release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes.

AB  - Loss and fragmentation of habitat resulting from the clearing of forests for agriculture and urban development threaten the persistence of thousands of species worldwide. The clearing of native forest to plant a monoculture of exotic trees may also reduce and fragment the habitat available for indigenous plants and animals. Metacommunity theory suggests that the species richness of a community in a patch of habitat will increase with patch size but decrease with patch isolation. We investigated whether replacement of native Eucalyptus forest with a plantation of Pinus radiata has reduced and fragmented habitat for frogs, leading to a lower species richness of frog communities in the pine plantation and in small and/or isolated remnant patches of native forest. We surveyed frogs at 60 sites at streams and wetlands in the pine plantation, remnant patches of native forest surrounded by pines, and adjacent areas of contiguous native forest near Tumut in New South Wales, Australia. Only two of eight species of frogs were recorded in the pine plantation, and regression modelling indicated that streams and wetlands in the pines supported fewer frog species than those in remnant patches or the intact native forest. In addition, species richness tended to be higher at wide, shallow swamps and marshes near the headwaters of streams, with herbs, grasses, shrubs, reeds, sedges and rushes in the emergent and fringing vegetation. There was little evidence to suggest that larger eucalypt remnants supported more species of frogs, or that remnants isolated by greater expanses of pines supported fewer species, but we had low power to detect these effects with our data set. Our results support the preservation of all remnants of native forest along drainage lines and around swamps, soaks and bogs, regardless of size. Where new pine plantations are established, for example, on cleared agricultural land, care should be taken to maintain the structural and vegetative characteristics of water bodies to ensure that they continue to provide suitable breeding habitat for frogs.

AB  - Spatial differentiation in avian models has been extensively studied at a coarse scale for both theoretical and conservation purposes. Yet, studies at a finer spatial scale are also particularly relevant in birds because their dispersal ability may be much more reduced than expected. In the Forest Thrush Turdus lherminieri, we studied morphological characters commonly used to assess differentiation because they mirror both demographic and selective processes. The Forest Thrush is an endemic and vulnerable Antillean bird species which has dramatically declined in the last 15 years, and whose population functioning and structure remain unknown. We compared birds from 11 sites in Guadeloupe, which were distributed from 2 to 42 km apart over the two main geographic zones of the island (i.e. Grande-Terre and Basse-Terre). Using two synthetic descriptors (for body size and feather size), we detected a strong micro-geographic differentiation between Forest thrush populations for the body-size descriptor but not for the feather-size descriptor. Both males and females were significantly larger in Basse-Terre than in Grande-Terre despite the fine geographic scale. Several hypotheses could explain these results: (i) geographic isolation and differentiation caused by (1)absence of gene flow, (2) phenotypic plasticity, or (3) divergence with gene flow. Although further investigation is needed to identify the exact process generating phenotypic divergence, our study provides a first highlight to the high local variability of this species.

AB  - Habitat loss and urbanisation in the tropics have been recognised as major drivers of species extinctions. Concurrently, novel habitats such as urban parks have been shown to be important as habitats and stepping stones in urban ecosystems around the world. However, few studies have assessed long-tenn patterns of species extinctions and discoveries in response to these drivers in the tropics. We know little about long-term persistence and utility of novel habitats in tropical urban ecosystems. In this study, we produced an updated and exhaustive butterfly checklist of species recorded from Singapore till December 2017 to investigate trends in butterfly extirpations (local extinctions), discoveries (new country records) and rediscoveries and how these relate to land use change in 28 years (1990-2017) in Singapore. Up to 144 butterfly species were identified to be extirpated in Singapore by 1990. From 1990-2017, an additional nine butterfly extirpations have potentially occurred, which suggests a maximum of 153 butterfly extirpations to date. The rate of extirpations between 1990 to 2017 (< 0.33 extirpations per year) was much lower than the rate of extirpations between 1926 to 1989 (> 1.52 extirpations per year). The majority of potentially extirpated butterflies between 1990 to 2017 were species restricted to mature forests. Over this period, 51 new species were discovered, while 65 species were rediscovered, which collectively represent 24% of the total and 35% of the extant butterfly fauna of Singapore. Interestingly, 33% of discovered species were only observed in degraded secondary forests or urban parks in Singapore, the former maturing with age and the latter having increased in area during the same time period. We hypothesise that the current slowdown in butterfly extirpations may be representative of habitat recovery and/or improved habitat connectivity, lower undetected extirpations, and/or lengthening of extinction debts. A slowdown in extirpations and an increased utilisation of novel habitats by discovered species present a window of conservation opportunity to restore native habitats and increase habitat connectivity among existing patches of managed vegetation.

AB  - Hedychium coronarium is an invasive plant widespread in the Brazilian Atlantic forest, especially in riparian areas. However, its distribution along streams is not continuous and the factors that are related to its local occurrence are unknown. We investigated which natural and anthropogenic drivers, particularly concerning dispersal and disturbance, facilitate establishment of H. coronarium. We sampled 148 randomly chosen riparian sites (each containing two plots) in a subtropical basin in southern Brazil and recorded presence/absence of the plant and some environmental variables in situ; other variables were extracted via GIS software. We performed a GLMM with presence/absence as the response variable, sampling site as a random factor and five predictors: intensity of ecosystem degradation, dominant type of terrestrial vegetation, river substrate size class, Strahler stream order and downstream distance to the nearest urban centre. Our results point out that invader presence is favoured by local human disturbance (high riparian degradation and presence of non-native forest), and possibly dispersal, as there is a higher H. coronarium presence probability in proximity to urban centres. Furthermore, a higher presence probability in downstream sections (higher Strahler order) might be explained by hydrologic dispersal of rhizome fragments. Our study illustrates that in the case of riparian invasions it is important to consider terrestrial and aquatic drivers, both natural and anthropogenic.

AB  - Coastal seascapes are composed of a diversity of habitats that are linked in space and time by the movement of organisms. The context and configuration of coastal ecosystems shapes many important properties of animal assemblages, but potential seascape effects of natural and artificial habitats on nearby habitats are typically considered in isolation. We test whether, and how, the seascape context of natural and urban habitats modified fish assemblages across estuaries. Fish were sampled with underwater videos in five habitat types (mangroves, rock bars, log snags, unvegetated sediments, armoured shorelines) in 17 estuaries in eastern Australia. Different habitats supported distinct fish assemblages, but the spatial context of mangroves and armoured shorelines had pervasive ecological effects that extended across entire estuaries. In most estuarine habitats, fish diversity and abundance was greatest when they were in close proximity of mangroves, and decreased due to the proximity of armoured shorelines. Many cities are centred on estuaries, and urban expansion is often associated with the fragmentation of mangrove forests. Our findings emphasize that these transformations of urban estuarine landscapes are likely to propagate to broader ecological impacts detectable in multiple habitats beyond mangrove forests.

AB  - Approximately 100 years ago, unregulated harvest nearly eliminated white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from eastern North America, which subsequently served to catalyze wildlife management as a national priority. An extensive stock-replenishment effort soon followed, with deer broadly translocated among states as a means of re-establishment. However, an unintended consequence was that natural patterns of gene flow became obscured and pretranslocation signatures of population structure were replaced. We applied cutting-edge molecular and biogeographic tools to disentangle genetic signatures of historical management from those reflecting spatially heterogeneous dispersal by evaluating 35,099 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived via reduced-representation genomic sequencing from 1143 deer sampled statewide in Arkansas. We then employed Simpson's diversity index to summarize ancestry assignments and visualize spatial genetic transitions. Using sub-sampled transects across these transitions, we tested clinal patterns across loci against theoretical expectations of their response under scenarios of re-colonization and restricted dispersal. Two salient results emerged: (A) Genetic signatures from historic translocations are demonstrably apparent; and (B) Geographic filters (major rivers; urban centers; highways) now act as inflection points for the distribution of this contemporary ancestry. These results yielded a statewide assessment of contemporary population structure in deer as driven by historic translocations as well as ongoing processes. In addition, the analytical framework employed herein to effectively decipher extant/historic drivers of deer distribution in Arkansas is also applicable for other biodiversity elements with similarly complex demographic histories.

AB  - In course of our survey of aquatic vegetation, 49 species (Table 1) in three different man-modified waterbodies - two altered river-arms of the Danube river and one seepage canal - in the area of Bratislava city were evaluated in 2000-2001. The greatest impact on the richness of species diversity was caused by the loss of connectivity with the Danube river system. A continuous type of macrophyte distribution prevailed in the canalised bed. Timing of flood disturbances and historical genesis of the habitats have reflected in proportion of growth forms. The submersed hydrophytes dominated in the most recently created aquatic habitat, alternating with the local patches of acro-pleustophytes. The higher presence of floating leaf rhizophytes was recorded in more advanced successive stages. To retard the process of succession towards the terrestrial ecosystem, future management should consider the restoration of flow conditions in analysed habitats.

AB  - Although the impacts of the legal and illegal wildlife trade are broadly recognised for flagship species (e.g., elephant, rhino and tiger), less is known about how exploitation affects more common, and less charismatic species. This is of especial concern in Asia in general, and particularly in China, where demands for wild game species, and derived products are increasing, but a lack of data on illegal bushmeat hunting limits the development of effective species and ecosystem conservation measures. Genetic monitoring provides an informative tool to assess the pressures on regional populations, particularly for species that are difficult to monitor, for example, using arboreal or subterranean refugia. Here, using microsatellite markers, we investigated the effect of hunting on the genetic diversity of a regional population of the hog badger. Samples were collected from hog badgers confiscated from illegal traffickers and local hunters by forest authorities in the market towns of Wufeng and Yuguan, which lie 40 km apart in Hubei Province, China. To isolate novel hog badger microsatellite loci, we constructed a biotin-enriched microsatellite DNA library. Furthermore, we also tested the suitability of microsatellite loci designed for the European badger in the hog badger. Using these microsatellite markers, we found that these seized hog badgers exhibited a high level of genetic diversity-mean alleles per locus (A) were 8.33 and mean expected heterozygosities (H (E)) were 0.77. Despite 40 km separation between sample sites, spatial segregation was not apparent from genetics. This suggests that our confiscated hog badgers belong to the same meta-population. Although limited by a lack of geographical data on the source of these hog badgers, preventing the analysis of isolation by distance effects, hunting likely eroded hog badger population social structure, promoting gene flow among demes. We conclude that the exploitation of this wild source population seems unsustainable.

AB  - AimUnderstanding the relationships between species turnover, environmental features and the geographic distance between sites can provide important insights into the processes driving species diversity. This is particularly relevant where the effective distance between sites may be a function of the habitat or topographic features of the landscape and the means of dispersal of the organism. River networks, in particular in human-modified landscapes, are a striking example of such a situation. Here, we use data for both aquatic and terrestrial organisms across an urban river network to examine patterns of species turnover and to determine whether these patterns differ between different taxonomic groups.
   LocationSheffield area, UK.
   MethodsAquatic (macroinvertebrates, diatoms) and terrestrial (birds, plants, butterflies) organisms were surveyed at 41 sites across an urban river network. We assessed the relationship between turnover and three alternative geographic distance measures (Euclidean, network and flow distance), whilst also taking into account the environmental distance between sites, using Mantel and partial Mantel tests.
   ResultsTurnover of all taxonomic groups apart from butterflies was significantly correlated with at least one measure of geographic distance. The aquatic taxonomic groups showed the strongest correlations with the geographic distance measures, and in particular with network distance. Terrestrial taxa were more closely associated with environmental than any of the geographic distance measures, although network distance remained significant for birds and some plant groups after removing the effect of environmental distance. Water-dispersed and neophyte plant groups were significantly related to network and flow distance.
   Main conclusionsThe results suggest that aquatic communities are strongly influenced by spatial processes occurring within the river network. Terrestrial taxa have a more complex relationship with distance, with different components of these communities displaying different responses. Nevertheless, it is clear that connectivity along the river corridor is important for both aquatic and terrestrial communities.

AB  - Arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps, sticky traps, sweep netting, Malaise traps and visual sampling at a national botanic garden, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where the taxonomic impediment is great. The aims were to compare two sites, one of native vegetation and the other of mainly exotic plants, to determine the possible localized extent of biodiversity change across the land mosaic, and to test and compare methodologies and indicator taxa and to make recommendations for ecological landscaping of a botanic garden. Species richness and evenness varied considerably with sampling technique used. From results of a single replicate of data from all trapping methods including 821 arthropod species and 3831 individuals, a number of conclusions could be drawn. Trapping procedures such as sweep netting and pitfall traps, which focus on species with restricted mobility and/or host plant requirements, indicated greatest differences in diversity between two closely located sites. Taxa varied in sensitivity to microlandscape, again depending on the extent of their mobility. Cicindelid and carabid beetles were particularly good indicators of habitat disturbance and type. The management recommendations are that in a species-rich urban botanic garden such as this, as many ecotopes as possible should be preserved or created. These should vary in topography, landscape characteristics and vegetation composition, with as much connectivity as possible. This is a feasible blanket approach to give home to a large number of nameless species and morphs. Patches of different ecotopes should not be separated by more than a few metres by expanses of mown lawn which isolates much of the fauna.

AB  - Urbanisation is a rapidly growing phenomenon that is affecting global biodiversity, but the integration of conservation goals into urban planning can minimise ecological damage. Conservation planning for birds can be informed by knowledge of species-habitat relationships, but opportunities for studying these relationships before urbanisation occurs are rare. Our study took place in the Molonglo Valley, southeastern Australia, where approximately 30% of the area will be developed for new human settlement over the next 30 years. We surveyed 80 sites for birds and used multiple regression to explore the role that land use, vegetation cover and structure play on total species richness, woodland species richness and prevalence (proportion of total species), and also on the presence of 10 woodland species. We found that total species richness was higher in river corridors and eucalypt woodland. Woodland species richness was higher in river corridors and eucalypt woodlands, and when leaf litter was present. Woodland species prevalence was higher in river corridors and when leaf litter and eucalypt regeneration were present. Individual woodland species showed a range of responses to five main structural and compositional categories: (1) land use, (2) tree cover and composition, (3) eucalypt regeneration, (4) shrub cover, and (5) ground cover attributes. We use these data on bird-habitat relationships to develop five recommendations on: (1) eucalypt woodland. (2) high quality riparian areas, (3) scattered trees, (4) eucalypt regeneration, and (5) structurally complex habitats, to aid policy makers, planners and developers to integrate conservation for woodland birds into their urban planning.

AB  - Urban sprawl has led over wide areas to alteration and fragmentation of so many ecosystem types that it becomes essential to consider biodiversity conservation in urban planning. As the urbanisation is usually irreversible, the urban context has to be taken into account when defining appropriate management measures to sustain viable populations. Connectivity through pollen flow appears to be a key-factor for the long-term persistence of populations of insect-pollinated plant species. We investigated pollen dispersal using fluorescent dye as pollen analogue in Lychnis flos-cuculi, an insect-pollinated wetland herb, along the Woluwe River, in Brussels urban zone (Belgium). Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution, with particles mainly deposited on neighbouring individuals and populations. The mean distance of dye transfer was 133.6 m, with a maximal distance of 523.7 m. Dye deposition was positively related to the number of potential recipient plants when distance to dye source was held constant. This may be associated with a higher flowering plant density across the flying distance that increases attractiveness and visitation rate of pollinators, and/or with secondary dye transfer. When connected, small and large populations only differed in response to the number of potential recipients. The small isolated population received little immigrant pollen flow, but remained a dye donor. Our study demonstrates that small populations of L. flos-cucli along an urban river may still exchange pollen thanks to pollinator movements, and might therefore be regarded in management planning as potential connecting components between populations.

AB  - The visual imaginary of the future city is increasingly dichotomized between visions of hyper-technological digital urbanism and the city in a state of ruin, without people, overtaken by nature. These alternating imaginaries key into concerns over urban futures, as questions of sustainability and rising inequality come to bear on urban life. Such binary imaginaries produce volumes of visual material, lauding and critiquing philosophies of newness, endless progress and the city without decline. This article uses an inventive visual methodology to ask how these imaginaries become situated in the everyday ecologies of living. This methodology focuses on several so-called 'brownfield' sites in Salford, UK, and the 'smart' Oxford Road Corridor in neighbouring Manchester, to playfully and visually map the entanglement of digital urban ecologies through the themes of wilderness, play and compost. These three themes relate to the pleasure of urban wilderness described by Rose Macaulay, reflecting on London's wild ruins after the Second World War; the playful contrast between smart urbanism and urban wastelands, understood through interdisciplinary visual methods; and Haraway's notion of compost as the fertile ground of collaboration that marks a material-semiotic entanglement between place, people and nature. The authors investigate how these frameworks reflect the diversity of urban ecology (animals, plants and humans) and might provide an alternative vision of how the city could be, a vision built from how the city currently is.

AB  - The spatial arrangement of reserves within a network is critical to the long-term persistence of dispersing species. In this paper, based on network environ analysis, an approach is presented to explicitly measure such ecological function, in which the dispersal-based interactions between reserves are considered from a holistic view by exploring not only species' direct dispersals but also their indirect ones. The proposed method first defines the ecological function of spatial arrangement of reserves as the probability that a species will survive for long time in a reserve network, and then expands this function by taking the reserve loss into account when evaluating a species' extinction probability at each reserve. A case study for L. nycthemera and M. thibetana from Wuyishan Nature Reserve, Fujian Province, China, is further conducted. The highest probabilities of lone-term survival are identified for both species in the reserve networks that contain several migrations with high successful dispersal probability. In addition, the path number of each common reserve under neighboring scenarios is found to be influenced by the changes of direct dispersal, from which the criteria for protecting and optimizing the spatial configuration of reserves in a nature reserve are derived. For Wuyishan Nature Reserve, these criteria may act as important bases to restrict and guide the development of tourism of surrounding cities and the socio-economic activities of local residents. It is concluded that the proposed method can provide an effective way to examine the ecological function of spatial arrangement of reserve network and contribute to species' long-term persistence in nature reserves.

AB  - Community-driven vertical greenery provides a previously under-appreciated resource that could be an important component of tropical urban ecology. While the corridors of buildings have been designed to facilitate the circulation of residents between spaces, this study shows that such corridors incidentally served as an informal space for community-driven vertical greenery. Across 1.86 ha of surveyed corridors, a total of 265 plant species and cultivars were present, with an average richness of 124 species per hectare. This is beneficial to urban ecology through its high species diversity, occurrence of endangered and vulnerable native species. Based on a classification of specific plant attributes referenced from literature, provision of food and medicinal resources (77.5%), and aesthetic benefits (72.3%) were the key ecosystem services provided by the species present. Community-driven vertical greenery could function as refugia for native species of conservation interest through providing an additional buffer against further losses in the wild. It also provides immediate opportunities for interactions between humans and nature. This study finds that corridors with larger areas and simpler geometries typically hold a higher abundance of plant pots. Future efforts to increase the abundance and diversity of vertical greenery, and its concomitant increase in the provision of ecosystem services, could be driven by local communities, rather than be formally planned by landscape architects, engineers and urban planners.

AB  - Most river corridors have been highly modified and managed but they still support diverse assemblages of birds. To aid conservation it is important to know which river corridor habitats support the greatest diversity and numbers of bird species. All birds were counted on three occasions in winter along 50 one kin stretches of lowland rivers in eastern England, and habitat variables were recorded. A total of 81 species was recorded. Species richness was greatest on tidal stretches of river, followed by urban/amenity sites, with lowest richness on rural stretches. Mute Swans, Mallards and Moorhens were significantly more numerous at urban/amenity stretches and were scarce or absent in headwater reaches. Three terrestrial species also occurred in significantly greater numbers in urban/amenity stretches. No species was significantly more numerous in rural stretches. TWINSPAN analysis separated out tidal and urban/amenity stretches, while bird species were separated into those associated with riparian trees and shrubs, and those of more open stretches, with further groups associated with wider rivers and the tidal stretches. A CANOCO analysis showed river width to be the most significant factor explaining bird distributions, followed by presence of floodbanks, riparian tree cover and amount of thick marginal vegetation. The rivers studied and their immediate floodplains have long been managed and modified from source and this has an overriding influence on habitat quality and on the species richness and numbers of birds utilizing any particular stretch.

AB  - Landscape connectivity is important for a wide range of ecological processes, including to disease spread, once it describes the degree to which landscapes facilitate or impede vector and hosts dispersion. Understanding connectivity is extremely important to identify where pathogens can move, and at what speed, allowing the organization of vaccination campaigns or other preventive measures. To better understand the effects of landscape connectivity on yellow fever virus (YFV) dispersion in Brazil, we used a network approach and modelled the movement of non-human primates' cases, the so-called epizootic events, over time. The networks consider each epizootic event as a node and the dispersion between nodes as links. Those links were established considering, respectively, the date of each epizootic event, the distance among the nodes and the permeability of the landscape between each pair of nodes. Our results demonstrated that on average YFV dispersed 1.42 km/day, with the largest movement being 6.9 km/day. Dispersions were longer in summer (1.2 km/day) than in winter (0.22 km/day). Most dispersal movements occurred up to 1 km/day (71%) and within a week after the arrival of the virus in the source node (73%), except in winter, where dispersions occurred within a period of up to 20 days. The best model indicates that YFV disperses mainly through roads adjacent to forest areas, and along forest edges (within a range of 100 m) in interface with agricultural areas, water and forestry areas. Core areas of urban, agricultural and forest regions were important barriers for virus movement. Synthesis and applications. Through landscape connectivity analyses, we provided here the first evidence that highly fragmented landscapes with a wide road network and large densities of forest edges facilitate yellow fever virus propagation, and that the maintenance of large blocks of forest can help to inhibit this spread. These results can contribute to guide forest restoration and landscape management actions in order to amplify health benefits related to restoration projects, in addition to their benefits for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation.

AB  - The subterranean termite Reticulitermes chinensis Snyder is an important pest of trees and buildings in China. Here, we characterized genetic structure and reproductive modes of R. chinensis from China for the first time. A total of 1,875 workers from 75 collection sites in Huanggang, Changsha and Chongqing cities were genotyped at eight microsatellite loci. Analysis of genetic clusters showed two subpopulations in Chongqing city. The Huanggang population showed a uniform genetic pattern and was separated from the other populations by the largest genetic distances (F-ST: 0.17-0.20). In contrast, smaller genetic distances (F-ST: 0.05-0.12) separated Changsha, Chongqing-1 and Chongqing-2 populations. Chongqing-1 was the only population showing a genetic bottleneck. Isolation by distance among colonies in the Huanggang population indicated limited alate dispersal or colony budding. Lack of isolation by distance among colonies within the populations of Changsha, Chongqing-1 and Chongqing-2, suggested long-range dispersal by alates and/or human-mediated transport. Overall, extended family colonies (73.91%) were predominant in all four populations, followed by simple (20.29%), and mixed family colonies (5.80%). Most simple families were headed by inbred related reproductive pairs in the Changsha population, while most simple families in the Chongqing-1 population were headed by outbred unrelated pairs. Simple families in the Huanggang population were a mixture of colonies headed by outbred or inbred reproductive pairs. The sample size of simple families in the Chongqing-2 population was too small to yield significant results. Extended families in all four populations were headed on the average by <= 10 neotenics. Mixed families likely originated from pleometrosis. Presence of heterozygote genotypes showed that all neotenic reproductives collected in addition from five field colonies in Wuhan city were sexually produced, suggesting that these colonies did not undergo parthenogenesis. This study contributes to better understanding of the variance of genetic structure and reproductive mode in the genus Reticulitermes.

AB  - Suitability of the local habitat (habitat filtering') and dispersal between stream reaches determines the composition of insect communities, and urban land use may affect both processes. While urban streams are often poor habitats for insects and dispersal between them is often hindered, conservation and restoration activities generally focus solely on the local (in-stream) environment.
   We determined whether in-stream habitat filtering (a local' process) or dispersal between reaches (a regional' process) controlled assemblage composition in a landscape subject to ongoing urban development (urbanizing'). We compared models incorporating geographic distance between sites, environmental dissimilarity, and land-use/land-cover attributes of dispersal pathways in an attempt to explain the dissimilarity of stream insect assemblages. Distance and land-use/land-cover attributes were characterised along both overland (straight line) and corridor pathways.
   Both in-stream habitat filtering and dispersal affected assemblage composition, but habitat had a stronger influence. Overland distance was a better predictor of assemblage dissimilarity than corridor distance, implying stream insect dispersal occurs across catchment boundaries as well as along stream corridors. The best model incorporated land-use/land-cover attributes along dispersal pathways, which supported the idea that urban land-use in the terrestrial environment mediates dispersal.
   Conservation and restoration strategies for streams in urbanizing landscapes that focus on local habitat quality and ignore dispersal are missing a potentially important mechanism affecting insect assemblage composition. While the primary focus should be on maintaining or improving the local habitat, potential dispersal pathways should also be considered.

AB  - This article uses an urban intervention in Panama City to discuss fundamental concepts in public space projects from a critical and theoretical perspective.
   First, the functions of the street as a basic structure of public space are illustrated. Its importance is recognized not only as an element of urban connectivity, but also as a place of movement, encounter, support and creation of urban meanings and social identities.
   Secondly, our case study is contextualized: the urban renewal of via Argentina, a street in the urban center whose environment was in a state of degradation like most streets in the city, largely occupied by the presence of vehicles. The intervention is part of a series of urban projects aimed at improving the physical structure of the city.
   The third section begins a critical analysis of the actions on Via Argentina, starting with the redistribution of street space, the relationship between vehicles and pedestrians, and the consolidation of public space.
   Next, we discuss in detail the new primary elements used for the urbanization of the street. Curbs, fords, pavement, rigola, gutters, tree surrounds and bollards become part of a system that must maintain a coherent relationship between all its parts. In addition, emphasis is placed on the design of the ground and the application of the pavement as a tool for the construction of an urban image and identity.
   Finally, the article ends with an analysis of the parameters of accessibility in the project, relating the concept to the use of the pavement and the configuration in some sections of the street as a single platform. The article uses a wide repertoire of documentary photography to contextualize the case study.

AB  - Instream barriers (e.g. dams, weirs and road crossings) fragment aquatic habitat and prevent the upstream movement of fish, impairing the ability of fishes to complete critical life stages, access critical habitat and for dispersal among local populations. Mitigation efforts have improved aquatic connectivity to some degree, but it has been challenging to quantify the overall improvement in connectivity without long-term and costly field assessments. The development of spatially explicit habitat connectivity indices make it possible to evaluate current stream connectivity, and quantify the improvement prior mitigation projects have had on connectivity. We combined a list of instream barrier mitigation projects completed in five watersheds in the Toronto (Ontario, Canada) area from 1987-2016 (mitigated barriers) and a previously established inventory of all known instream barriers in 2016 (current barriers). The cumulative improvement to connectivity was measured for potadromous (remain in tributaries) and diadromous (move between tributaries and lake) fish species using the dendritic connectivity index. Aquatic connectivity improved for diadromous species between 0 and 14.5% and for potadromous species between 0.1 and 4.4% in the five studied watersheds. Some variation in improvement among the watersheds can likely be attributed to differences in mitigation strategies among the watersheds and a historical emphasis on mitigating instream barriers to benefit migratory salmonid species.

AB  - How urbanization shapes population genomic diversity and evolution of urban wildlife is largely unexplored. We investigated the impact of urbanization on white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, in the New York City (NYC) metropolitan area using coalescent-based simulations to infer demographic history from the site-frequency spectrum. We assigned individuals to evolutionary dusters and then inferred recent divergence times, population size changes and migration using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped in 23 populations sampled along an urban-to-rural gradient. Both prehistoric climatic events and recent urbanization impacted these populations. Our modelling indicates that post-glacial sea-level rise led to isolation of mainland and Long Island populations. These models also indicate that several urban parks represent recently isolated P. leucopus populations, and the estimated divergence times for these populations are consistent with the history of urbanization in NYC.

AB  - The Lobau, a former floodplain area of the Danube River situated within the city limits of Vienna (Austria), was strongly affected by the river regulation in 1875. The reduced hydrological connectivity led to an increasing loss of aquatic habitats. A water enhancement scheme with a maximum water input of 0.5 m(3) s(-1) was initiated in 2001. The present study assesses the effect of this scheme on biodiversity using three target species groups - aquatic molluscs, dragonflies and fish - following a common Before-After Control-impact design (BACI). Dragonflies and molluscs were positively affected, reflecting the habitat alterations in the system. For fish. no significant impact was observed. The aim of the scheme has been achieved: increased habitat diversity and improved habitat conditions for the system's initial community and further rheophilic/rheotolerant species. Water enhancement schemes can be effective remediation measures and deserve further attention in the management of urban wetlands. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The urban design project proposed for possible intervention in Carrer de Santander seeks to provide quality public space, due to its peripheral location and its edge character., is not properly integrated into the various spaces surrounding it.
   Along the street both residential and industrial zones are present. Integration problems between the street and these spaces are evident in situations such as changing number of vehicle lanes, lack of facilities, excessive use of street parking and the lack of pedestrian flow. As a result of these situations can be observed an important deterioration of sidewalks, pedestrian crossings, squares and parterres.
   In this sense, through the reorganization of the space, its remodeling and the construction of new facilities, the project seeks to promote urban cohesion. The renovation of the public space will not only improve the urban quality of the sector and the connectivity with the neighborhoods nearby and with the rest of the city, but will also encourage the appropriation of this space by neighbors and the general public.
   In order to favor urban cohesion, several specific and general interventions along the street are proposed: the widening of pavements, the construction of bicycle lanes, the implementation of urban furniture, the renovation of lighting fixtures, the reduction of areas of separation to a single lane and the planting of vegetation of a wide chromatic and olfactory range. Thus, these interventions focused on the generation of a public space that integrates the physical diversities of this and the different needs of its users.
   The new sports facilities will also be another measure that will seek to integrate Santander Street with the rest of the city, with the objective of supplying the lack of spaces for the practice of minority sports in Barcelona.
   The reorganization of the space aims to revitalize places such as the Mossen Joan Cortinas square and allow the proper use of the Molinet bridge by pedestrians and bike users.

AB  - Although the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and other global biodiversity hotspots are rapidly urbanizing, there is little information on the potential of metropolitan regions to safeguard biodiversity within their reserves. We sampled bird assemblages in nine protected areas (14.8-1058 ha) of the metropolitan region of Joao Pessoa, Northeast Brazil, to test the hypothesis that larger urban reserves are more effective than smaller ones in protecting the regional species richness, as more habitat and environmental heterogeneity are available for birds. We recorded 126 species belonging to 41 families, including seven endemics and two introduced species. Thraupidae and Tyrannidae were the most representative families with 16 species each. Larger areas clearly protected greater proportion of the regional species richness, but the smaller areas accounted for at least 35.7% of the regional richness. Differences in size and isolation significantly influenced species similarity, but hunting, catching for illegal trade, presence of exotic predators and noise pollution were likely to affect composition as well. The remarkable bird diversity suggests good potential for legal-based, well-planned birdwatching activities in the studied region. The results highlight that urban reserves of any size are valuable for bird conservation in metropolitan regions, though larger ones should be prioritized.

AB  - Aim To examine how parameters of the species-area curve and factors determining bird species richness are affected by seasonality.
   Location One hundred and thirty urban parks of the city of Valencia (Spain) ranging between 0.03 and 18.6 ha.
   Methods Bird censuses were conducted monthly during 1998 and 2004. For each park, 27 variables were recorded as measures of size, structure and isolation. Linear regression was used to test for patterns in species richness relative to independent variables. The results of each season were compared.
   Results Curves corresponding to the breeding period (spring-summer) had significantly higher intercepts, but slopes did not change across seasons. Turnover rates of resident species were dependent on patch size and isolation considering spring, but not autumn, from different years. Additionally, turnover rates in spring were lower in parks in close proximity to others than in isolated ones. In all seasons, the number of bird species showed a strong relationship with park area, which explained c. 60% of the variation in species numbers. Habitat variables and park isolation explained a small amount of the variation in species numbers. The data did not give support to the random placement hypothesis.
   Main conclusions The overall conclusions of this study give little support to the possible influence of seasonality on species-area relationship or on the three main hypotheses explaining it. This lack of influence of seasonality could be explained by the seasonal stability of the bird populations of the parks within the study area as a consequence of different factors, mainly the characteristics of the species pool, similarity in the features of the parks irrespective of their size, and stability of resources and conditions across seasons. The question of whether this lack of influence of seasonality on the species-area relationship occurs in those ecological systems that have a larger seasonal variation than the urban parks of the study area remains unresolved. Closer examination of the seasonal patterns reported in this study is likely to be useful in increasing our understanding of the species-area relationship.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the shrubby tree component in riparian corridors in restoration process and natural remainders in a matrix forestry. We identified the richness, diversity, dispersal and pollination syndromes of the individuals and estimate the floristic similarity. The study was conducted at the producing farm of Pinus spp. wood Santa Alice, located in Rio Negrinho city, Santa Catarina state, Brazil. We adopted the center-quarter method for survey the shrubby tree component in four sample groups: CA (advanced stage of riparian corridors vegetation), CR (riparian corridors in restoration), MA (advanced stage of natural remaining), MI (intermediate stage of natural remaining). We found the highest richness and diversity index in MA and CR. Regarding the number of individuals, the dispersal and pollination syndromes predominant in all sample groups were zoochory and zoophilia. CR and CA had the highest percentage of floristic similarity while MA and MI did not form clusters. The sample group CR has composition, richness and diversity more similar to CA. This indicates that the restoration of riparian zones has conditions to rescue the components and the interactions of an ecological community.

AB  - Life on earth is remarkably diverse. Plants, animals, and microorganisms, in response to local and regional environmental conditions have created distinct adaptations that collectively form the interconnected "web of life." This biological diversity and its associated ecological processes represent the planets "natural capital" that underpins human activities, providing us with the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, the materials that clothe and shelter us, countless medical remedies, and the cathartic psychological relief green spaces provide for us. This biological diversity also helps shape our "sense of place."
   There is a growing awareness that the health of the planets biological diversity will to a large degree, determine our own destiny. There is also a growing sense of urgency that biodiversity requires substantially more protection than has occurred to date (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). The Convention on Biological Diversity (1992), adopted by over 150 countries, provided a strategy for addressing the decline in biodiversity around the world. The 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development identified the centrality of biodiversity and the importance of setting conservation targets. And the IUCNs Countdown 2010 program was established to help monitor progress toward stemming biodiversity loss.
   In terms of urban biodiversity the Curitiba Declaration on Cities and Biodiversity (2007) affirmed the importance of biodiversity within cities, signalling the need "to integrate biodiversity concerns into urban planning and development, with a view to improving the lives of urban residents..." Yet, while enhancing biodiversity within cities is a laudable goal, it is a daunting challenge. The scale and pace of urban growth is responsible for the radical transformation of the spatial configuration and ecological processes of local and regional landscapes around the world (Alberti 2005, Dale et al. 2000, McDonnell et al. 1997 Dramstad et al. 1996, McDonnel and Pickett 1990). Natural areas are fragmented. Indigenous fauna are marginalised and extirpated. Hydrologic cycles are irrevocably altered while impervious surfaces increase. Productive soils, centuries in the making, are contaminated compacted, and/or removed.
   One key challenge in addressing urban biodiversity is overcoming the misunderstanding that biodiversity conservation is an optional field of action, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Few local governments have dedicated resources to establishing planning frameworks and implementation strategies to explicitly address biodiversity. This complacency can he attributed, in part, to the complexity and abstraction as to what constitutes biodiversity. Consequently urban planners, elected officials, the development community, and the public continue to focus on land use, zoning, transportation, and infrastructure in isolation of their ecological consequences.
   Fortunately in North America some local governments have begun to engage the complexities of biodiversity conservation by developing regionally integrated spatial frameworks based in large part on Landscape Ecology's patch-corridor-matrix principles (Forman 1995). Simultaneously, proactive site planning and design practices at the neighbourhood and site scale are including biodiversity conservation as an essential program objective. Collectively these initiatives begin to illustrate bow urban design can conserve and enhance biodiversity across a region.

AB  - Land development contributes to the clearance of large trees that are sometimes offset with many smaller trees as compensatory wildlife habitat. But are many smaller trees a valid biodiversity offset for the loss of a single large tree? To answer this question, we tested predictions underpinned by island biogeography theory. Targeting birds, we investigated size and landscape context effects at 72 trees of three sizes (small, medium, and large) located in four landscape contexts (reserves, pasture, urban parklands, and urban built-up areas). Significant positive relationships occurred between tree basal area and bird abundance and species richness in all landscape contexts. SLOSS (single large or several small) analysis revealed that in modified landscapes, several small and medium trees supported an equivalent number of individuals and species as a single large tree, but the same pattern was weaker in reserves. Extrapolated rarefaction curves revealed that in reserves and urban built-up areas, many small or medium trees accumulated the same number or more species than large trees. However, in pasture and urban parklands, many small or medium trees accumulated fewer species than large trees. Overall, 29% of bird species were recorded only at large trees, highlighting that many smaller trees will not be suitable habitat compensation for all species. Complementary approaches to biodiversity offsets are needed, balancing large tree preservation and revegetation. Response patterns for birds at trees conformed to some biogeographic predictions (species-area relationship), but not others (habitat-isolation relationship), underscoring the need for novel conceptual frameworks for habitat structures in modified landscapes.

AB  - We used aphids (Aphidae) as a representative hemimetabolous host family to investigate patterns of parasitoid (Aphidiine) assemblage size. The aphidiine assemblages from 477 aphid species were used to estimate average assemblage size and the influence of eight ecological and taxonomic variables. Aphids species support an average of 1.7 aphidiine species. Aphid subfamily and invasion status (native or exotic) were the most important determinants of parasitoid richness, explaining 28% of the deviance in aphidiine assemblage size. Aphids within the largest aphid subfamily, the Aphidinae, support larger parasitoid assemblages than those in other subfamilies. Parasitoid diversity was also highest on exotic aphid hosts (within the Aphidinae) and on hosts in developed habitats (agricultural or urban), though the latter effect is weak. Patterns related to aphid food plant architecture were influenced by an interaction with aphid invasion status: parasitoid diversity drops with increasing architectural complexity on exotic aphids, whereas the diversities on native aphid hosts are similar on different plant types. Weak effects were also found for aphid food plant alternation (whether or not aphids switch hosts seasonally) and climate (annual range in temperature); alternating aphids support more parasitoids than non-alternating hosts: and parasitoid assemblage size is lowest in warm climates. Taxonomic isolation of aphids at the generic level showed no significant relationship with parasitoid diversity. Finally, in contrast to parasitoid assemblages on holometabolous hosts, sample size effects were weak for aphids, possibly due to the narrow host ranges of aphidiines.

AB  - 1. Urbanisation and agricultural intensification cause the replacement of natural ecosystems but might also create novel habitats in urban and rural ecosystems promoting some insect communities by providing food and nesting resources.
   2. This study investigated how host natural enemy communities change in urban and rural landscapes and their transitional zone, the urban rural interface, by using trap nests for cavity-nesting Hymenoptera in gardens and rapeseed fields that were either isolated or paired in the urban rural interface.
   3. Host dynamics were important for natural enemy occurrence, species richness and parasitism rates, and landscape effects were evident for natural enemy variables except for the richness of bee natural enemies. The number of parasitised brood cells was at its highest in the urban rural interface, but the highest parasitism rates of bees were observed in isolated gardens. Parasitism rates of bees were negatively affected by host abundance, while parasitism rates of wasps were positively affected.
   4. Higher specialisation and lower connectivity of host natural enemy interactions were found in paired habitats than in isolated habitats. This indicates that paired habitats comprise more specific natural enemies and vulnerable interactions, while isolated habitats comprise more generalist natural enemies, and thus interactions appear more stable.
   5. These results confirm that host dynamics play an essential role in the abundance and richness of natural enemies and drive parasitism. However, high habitat heterogeneity found in the urban rural interface can also have an effect on host natural enemy communities. This highlights that the provisioning of resources in the urban rural interface can benefit insect communities in these areas.

AB  - As the climate changes, green spaces of all types will be increasingly important in maintaining livable and biodiverse communities. A type of green space common to suburban communities in the United States is residential open space. Residential open spaces tend to be small and heavily managed and are frequently undervalued and understudied as ecological amenities. This study uses GIS analysis and spatial statistics to explore the configuration of 1900 residential open spaces in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, a suburban county in the northeastern United States. It examines local characteristics such as open space policy, subdivision features, and socioeconomic status to identify variables that are associated with open space parcel size and connectivity and could be leveraged to foster a more beneficial configuration of metropolitan green space. The analysis finds that open space is moderately fragmented, but is abundant in the county and clustered, which could support functional connectivity. Direct connections also considerably augment the size of open spaces and other types of protected greenspaces. Results highlight that municipal actions like setting open space standards, using open space to protect riparian areas, and taking ownership of open space parcels are associated with beneficial on-the ground open space characteristics.

AB  - This study focuses on the avian ecology and management of a 43.5 ha remnant hind-dune and estuary ecosystem in suburban Wollongong (population 200 000). In total, 62 land-bird species and 24 water-bird species were present between July 1984 and February 1987 (32 months). During area searches (n = 12) in each calendar month, an average of 427 individuals of 31 species was recorded with an average species diversity of 70%. The avian population was characterised by a small number of species with high abundance and vice versa. Five species were migratory. Resident species ranged in abundance from the Eastern Whipbird Psophodes olivaceus (maximum population eight birds) to the New Holland Honeyeater Phylidonyris novaehollandiae (maximum population 200 birds). Numbers of the latter species increased markedly in autumn and winter when banksia and coral trees were rich with nectar. Most terrestrial species were habitat specialists, linked to the various microhabitats for food, nesting or protection. Recommendations to preserve the bird community are as follows: (1) the catchment should be managed to control siltation and contamination of the wetland, rather than dredging the estuary itself, (2) wetland diversity should be maintained by allowing water levels to vary naturally; (3) terrestrial microhabitats should be preserved by maintaining their structural and floristic diversity; (4) refuge areas should be established to minimise the impact of human-related disturbance; (5) a network of corridors should be provided to facilitate movement of birds into the reserve; (6) a buffer zone should be maintained around the reserve to shield the birdlife from suburban disturbance and domestic animals.

AB  - The conservation value of suburban golf courses was assessed in southeast Queensland, Australia, by investigating their capacity to support urban-threatened birds, mammals, reptiles and frogs. Terrestrial vertebrate assemblages were compared between golf courses and nearby eucalypt fragments and with suburban bird assemblages. Biotic diversity varied among golfcourses. While some had conservation value (supporting high densities of regionally threatened vertebrates), most failed to realise that potential, supporting only common urban-adapted species. Golf courses were generally a better refuge for threatened birds and mammals than for threatened reptiles and amphibians. Reasons for the relative absence of threatened herpetofauna are currently unclear but could be attributed to increased sensitivity to isolation, exposure to herbicides or greater disruption of ground-level habitats. While species- specific studies are required to identify the ecological role played by habitats on golf courses and the potential for long-term viability, the results confirm that suburban golf courses can have local conservation value for threatened vertebrates. Given their ubiquity, golf courses present a significant opportunity for urban wildlife conservation. Thus while the golf industry is making genuine attempts to improve its environmental management standards, it is important to ensure those efforts target the needs of regionally threatened species. Legislation may be required to ensure ecological criteria are incorporated in new golf developments. Ongoing research is investigating the effect that golf course design and management practices have on the local diversity of threatened vertebrates. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - AimAvian communities in human-modified landscapes exhibit varying patterns of local colonization and extinction rates, determinants of species occurrence. Our objective was to model these processes to identify habitat features that might enable movements and account for occupancy patterns in habitat matrices between the Guanica and Susua forest reserves. This knowledge is central to conservation design, particularly in ever changing insular landscapes.
   LocationSouth-western Puerto Rico.
   MethodsWe used a multiseason occupancy modelling approach to quantify seasonal estimates of occupancy, and colonization and extinction rates of seven resident avian species surveyed over five seasons from January 2010 to June 2011. We modelled parameters by matrix type, expressions of survey station isolation, quality, amount of forest cover and context (embedded in forest patch).
   ResultsSeasonal occupancy remained stable throughout the study for all species, consistent with seasonally constant colonization and extinction probabilities. Occupancy was mediated by matrix type, higher in reserves and forested matrix than in the urban and agricultural matrices. This pattern is in accord with the forest affinities of all but an open-habitat specialist. Puerto Rican Spindalis (Spindalis portoricensis) exhibited high occupancy in the urban matrix, highlighting the adaptability of some insular species to novel environments. Highest colonization rates occurred when perching structures were at 500m. Survey stations with at least three fruiting tree species and 61% forest cover exhibited lowest seasonal extinction rates.
   Main conclusionsOur work identified habitat features that influenced seasonal probabilities of colonization and extinction in a human-modified landscape. Conservation design decisions are better informed with increased knowledge about interpatch distances to improve matrix permeability, and habitat features that increase persistence or continued use of habitat stepping stones. A focus on dynamic processes is valuable because conservation actions directly influence colonization and extinction rates, and thus, a quantitative means to gauge their benefit.

AB  - In order to integrate urban microclimatic pattern, heat island intensity, land cover and cooling effect of vegetation corridors in a more comprehensive way, both fixed and mobile observations at two types of scale have been made simultaneously in different weather conditions during hot weather in Nanjing, China. Then the air temperature distribution of Nanjing and its impact factor were detected and quantified, and vegetation cooling models were developed in this paper. There was a significant day-to-day variation of urban heat island (UHI), and the average intensity of UHI during the measurement period was 2.0 degrees C. The strong UHI usually occurred around midnight; however, a peak UHI was frequently observed 2-3 h after sunset. During daytime, several isolated hot areas were observed next to cooler ones, indicating a negative UHI. The air temperature distributions of the vegetation corridors at mesoscale in the evening were similar to those at micro-scale at noon. The influence of the Purple Mountain was very obvious with the maximum cooling effect up to 3.0 degrees C/100 m at microscale and 0.4 degrees C/km at mesoscale. This research indicated that the pattern of the UHI in Nanjing is a function of the climatic conditions, the local topography, the effect of the Purple Mountain and the Yangtze River and the urban characteristics such as land uses, vegetation, building density, traffic loads, construction materials and anthropogenic heat sources, which should be taken into account for urban planning and ecologically comfortable residence. The results have further relevance for environmental implications in a subtropical city on the Yangtze River.

AB  - Variation in the size of home range of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) has broad implications for managing populations, agricultural damage, and disease spread and transmission. Size of home range of deer also varies seasonally because plant phenology dictates the vegetation types that are used as foraging or resting sites. Knowledge of the landscape configuration and connectivity that contributes to variation in size of home range of deer for the region is needed to fully understand differences and similarities of deer ecology throughout the Midwest. We developed a research team from four Midwestern states to investigate how size of home range of deer in agro-forested landscapes is influenced by variations in landscape characteristics that provide essential habitat components. We found that for resident female deer, annual size of home range in Illinois (mean = 0.99 km(2)), Michigan (mean = 1.34 km(2)), Nebraska (mean = 1.20 km(2)), and Wisconsin (mean = 1.47 km(2)) did not differ across the region (F (3,175) = 0.42, P = 0.737), but differences between agricultural growing and nongrowing periods were apparent. Variables influencing size of home range included: distance to forests, roads, and urban development from the centroid of deer home range, and percent of crop as well as four landscape pattern indices (contrast-weighted edge density, mean nearest neighbor, area-weighted mean shape index, and patch size coefficient of variation). We also identified differences in model selection for four landscapes created hierarchically to reflect levels of landscape connectivity determined from perceived ability of deer to traverse the landscape. Connectivity of selected forested regions within agro-forested ecosystems across the Midwest plays a greater role in understanding the size of home ranges than traditional definitions of deer habitat conditions and landscape configuration.

AB  - To accommodate an ever-increasing human population, agriculture is rapidly intensifying at the expense of natural habitat, with negative and widely reported effects on biodiversity in general and on wild bee abundance and diversity in particular. Cities are similarly increasing in area, though the impact of urbanisation on wild bees is more equivocal and potentially positive in northern temperate regions. Yet agriculture and urbanisation both lead to the loss and alteration of natural habitat, its fragmentation, a potential reduction in floral availability, and warmer temperatures, factors thought to be drivers of wild bee decline. They have also been shown to be factors to which wild bee populations respond through morphological change. Body size is one such trait that, because of its relation to individual fitness, has received growing attention as a morphological feature that responds to human induced modification in land use. Here, we investigated the change in body size of two sympatric orchid bee species on the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico in response to urbanization and agricultural intensification. By measuring 540 male individuals sampled from overall 24 sites, we found that Euglossa dilemma and Euglossa viridissima were on average smaller in urban and agricultural habitats than in natural ones. We discuss the potential role of reduced availability of resources in driving the observed body size shifts. Agricultural and urban land management in tropical regions might benefit wild bees if it encompassed the planting of flowering herbs and trees to enhance their conservation.

AB  - River areas are undoubtedly among the most valuable territorial areas in Europe, not only in terms of their eco-landscape and use but also, culturally. However, there is currently a sharp reduction in the extension and increase of deterioration of riverbanks around the world. A substantial part of losses and deterioration are associated with the artificialization of the territories, derived mainly from a less than respectful urbanization around these landscapes. Urban and peri-urban riverbanks are landscapes in expansion due to the continuous growth of built-up spaces. Therefore, they should be areas of preferential consideration, especially in territories with a marked tendency to dryness, like the centre of the Iberian Peninsula. This article aims to contribute to our understanding of these spaces through the study of four distinct cases in the centre of the peninsula, in particular: the river Manzanares running through the city of Madrid, the river Tagus in Toledo and running through Talavera de la Reina, and the river Henares in Guadalajara. Three of the four urban water courses analyzed are zones of special interest for waterfowl: they sustain a winter population that varies between 745 and 1529 birds and they provide a home to some globally threatened species. The density of the riparian birds is also very high during winter, these values oscillating between a mean of 141.16 and 240.12 birds/10 ha. It should be noted that the diversity of this group of birds in the four regions studies is also high (H > 2.4 nats). The article also examines the interventions and the urban planning criteria applied to these urban and peri-urban river spaces, inferring the need to reassess urban planning in river areas to ensure it is compatible with their operation, values and possible uses.

AB  - To date, the provision of ecosystem services has largely been estimated based on spatial patterns of land cover alone, using benefit transfer analysis. Although it is increasingly being recognised that the distribution of the human population affects whether a potential service translates into a realised service, this misses key steps in the process and assumes that everyone accesses ecosystem services in the same way. Here we describe a conceptual approach to ecosystem services in terms of movement and flows. We highlight that ecosystem service flows can be broken down into 'nature to people' (the movement of nature towards beneficiaries) and 'people to nature' (the movement of beneficiaries towards nature). The former has been relatively well described. Here, we explore the latter by reviewing research on human migration, animal foraging and landscape connectivity. We assess if and how existing theories might be useful in describing how people seek out ecosystem services. We consider some of the ways in which flows of people to nature can be measured. Such measurements may reveal which movement theories best represent how people seek out and access ecosystem services. Overall, our review aims to improve the future modelling of ecosystem services by more explicitly considering how people access potential services and therefore realise them.

AB  - The biological characteristics of Aedes aegypti (Diptera, Culicidae), which is a vector of dengue and yellow fever, make this organism a good model for studying population structure and the events that may influence it under the effect of human activity. We assessed the genetic variability of five A. aegypti populations using RAPD-PCR technique and six primers. Four populations were from Brazil and one was from the USA. A total of 165 polymorphic DNA loci were generated. Considering the six primers and the five populations, the mean value of inter-population genetic diversity (Gst) was 0.277, which is considered high according to the Wright classification. However, pairwise comparisons of the populations gave variable Gst values ranging from 0.044 to 0.289. This variation followed the population's geographic distance to some extent but was also influenced by human activity. The lowest Gst values were obtained in the comparison of populations from cities with intensive commercial and medical contacts. These mosquito populations were previously classified as insecticide resistant, susceptible, or with decreased susceptibility; this parameter apparently had an effect on the Gst values obtained in the pairwise comparisons.

AB  - Agricultural development may produce highly fragmented landscapes, which can influence population genetic structure for organisms restricted to insularized breeding habitats. Common Nighthawks (Chordeiles minor) in agriculturally dominated landscapes nest on urban gravel rooftop and might be subject to reduced gene flow among isolated urban sites. We conducted ;in analysis of the genetic variability and population genetic structure of Common Nighthawks nesting on rooftops in four towns in southeastern South Dakota, an area that has experienced extreme conversion of native prairie to agriculture. Using sequence data from a 725 bp region of the eytochrome b (cytb) mitochondrial gene sampled from 37 individuals representing a total of 30 different nests collected in summers 2011-2016, we found evidence of a recent population bottleneck and reduced mtDNA variability. The spatial dispersion of the 14 detected haplotypes and the presence of nine haplotypes unique to one of the four sampled towns further suggested a lack of panmixia among these nighthawks. These data are consistent with a hypothesis of habitat fragmentation due to agricultural expansion resulting in population isolation within this species of conservation concern.

AB  - Habitat-dependent song variation could play a role in ecological speciation from the incipient stages until completion of reproductive isolation. The evolutionarily novel urban habitat provides an excellent opportunity to study this role for song in the initial steps of population divergence associated with contrasting habitats close to home. In this study, we show spectral and temporal song divergence at population level in European blackbirds in 3 city-forest pairs. The observed upward spectral shift in frequency for urban songs relative to forest songs is consistent with previous studies on the same and several other species. A reciprocal playback experiment showed that male blackbirds pay attention to the origin of the stimulus and the divergent spectral trait independently of each other, as well as to a combination of both. The fact that urban and forest males responded differentially to the same spectral song features suggests that the song divergence could influence where males with typical urban or forest songs settle and are able to maintain a territory. Our findings show that habitat-dependent song divergence has the potential to affect the responsiveness to signals in the initial stages of population differentiation.

AB  - Urbanization changes bird community structure during the breeding season but little is known about its effects on migrating birds. We examined patterns of habitat use by birds at the local and landscape level during 2002 spring migration at 71 riparian plots along an urban gradient in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. Using linear regression, we examined variation in relative density, species richness, and evenness of four migratory guilds associated with natural land covers and building area at four scales (50, 100, 250, 500 m radial buffers). We also examined the influence of local vegetation using multiple regression models. As building area increased, riparian forests tended to be narrower and have fewer native trees and shrubs. In general, native birds were positively associated with tree cover (within 250500 m of stream) and native vegetation, and negatively with building area (within 250 m); exotic species responded inversely to these measures. Short-distance migrants and permanent residents displayed the weakest responses to landscape and vegetation measures. Neotropical migrants responded strongest to landscape and vegetation measures and were positively correlated with areas of wide riparian forests and less development (>250 m). Resident Neotropical migrants increased with wider riparian forests (>500 m) without buildings, while en-route migrants utilized areas having a wide buffer of tree cover (250500 m) regardless of buildings; both were positively associated with native vegetation composition and mature trees. Consequently, developed areas incorporating high native tree cover are important for conserving Neotropical migrants during stopover. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Roadsides form potential habitats for several grassland species adapted to regular mowing management. We studied the communities of butterflies and day-active moths in 51 sites along the verges of the three road types, i.e., highways, urban roads and rural roads. Despite different traffic densities and widths of the road and verge, the groups were rather similar with regard to soil properties, vegetation structure and mowing intensity. The species richness and total abundance of butterflies (53 species, 5964 individuals) and diurnal moths (46 species, 4626 individuals) were also rather similar in each road type, although a preference for wider verges was observed. Butterfly diversity increased (but not significantly) from the verges of narrow rural roads to wider highways. The highest numbers of meadow species were recorded along highways and the total abundance, especially of diurnal moths, decreased in accordance with the road size. High nectar abundance was the most important factor increasing the numbers of meadow butterflies along road verges, while meadow moths were mostly favoured by shelter provided by tall vegetation. Verges surrounded by cultivated fields were generally related to low numbers of both Lepidoptera groups, whereas adjacent forests increased the total number of all species and favoured several butterflies inhabiting forest edges. The adjacent environment inflicted compositional differences on the Lepidoptera fauna of the three road types. The results indicate that road verges should be considered an important reserve for species dependent on semi-natural grasslands in Finland. A growing interest in accommodating current roadside management for conserving biodiversity is likely to benefit Lepidoptera communities in the verge habitats. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Live bird Markets (LBM) can serve as a paramount source of AIV infections. During routine Avian Influenza surveillance in Pakistan, low-pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H4N6 was isolated first time from Khaki Campbell duck (Anal platyrhynchos) during 2010 and from broiler chicken during 2011 in the live bird markets (LBMs) from the port city of Karachi in Sindh province. Whole genome sequencing revealed introduction of a new reassortant Eurasian avian virus strain. Phylogenetically HA, NA, M, NP and PB2 genes clustered mostly with Russian strains of influenza viruses and PA gene with AI isolates from Netherlands, whereas NS and PB1 genes clustered with a Pakistani isolate of H3N1. Sequence analysis revealed a LP amino acid motif (PEKASR), avian-like receptors, conservation of amino acids at the receptor binding sites and the amino acids known to be associated with sensitivities to antiviral drugs, loss of glycosylation site in NA gene and attainment of unique PDZ domain motif (ESEI) at the C terminal of NS gene. The seroconversion against H4N6 subtype was observed mostly in the bird populations of Sindh and Khyber Pakhtoon Khawa provinces. The isolation divulged the role of LBM where mingling of different bird species provides an excellent environment for dissemination and potential reassortment of AIV. Moreover, various point mutations in these H4N6 isolates and close relationship with Pakistani H3N1 and other Eurasian strains also reflect prevailing diversity among AIVs circulating in the local LBMs. (C)2016 PVJ.

AB  - Variation in species richness and density of native birds in urban parks and greenspaces ("parks") is often substantial. Understanding why differences exist, and whether all migratory guilds are equally affected, is poorly known. We surveyed breeding bird communities in 48 undeveloped forested parks in Portland, Oregon, USA, to determine the contributions of park area, shape, connectivity, landscape composition surrounding parks, and differences in structure/composition of local habitat to variation in richness and density of residents, long-distance migrants, and short-distance/partial migrants. Migratory guilds responded differently to environmental factors. Richness and density of long-distance migrants increased with park area and abundance of small (< 10 cm DBH), mostly native, tree species. Resident richness also increased with the abundance of small trees. However, resident and short-distance/partial migrant richness was independent of park area, and resident density declined with increasing area. Park shape, connectivity, and landscape composition did not influence richness or density of any migratory guilds, possibly because of relatively high tree cover in Portland's landscape. Separate analyses of forest-dependent species of all migratory guilds revealed that area was the primary contributor to variation in density of residents and long-distance migrants, structural habitat features contributed to variation in density of residents but not long-distance migrants, and that density of long-distance migrants declined with elongated park shape. Few forest-dependent species existed in parks below 10 ha, and their minimum area requirements for maintaining populations were estimated to be 30 to 40 ha. Without such parks most long-distance migrants would likely disappear from Portland's landscape.

AB  - Vegetated roofs are hoped to benefit urban wildlife, yet there are few empirical results regarding the conservation potential of such roofs. In this paper, we focus on arthropods on vegetated roofs. We vacuum sampled 17 succulent, meadow or succulent-meadow roofs, in Helsinki, Finland, and used order to species level information together with trait data to describe the communities. We evaluated the importance of biophysical roof characteristics on shaping arthropod assemblages to provide information concerning roof designs that promote rich arthropod fauna. Arthropod communities differed between the three roof types and the influence of roof variables varied between and within arthropod orders. The main local drivers of arthropod abundance across the individually analysed taxa were roof height and vegetation, with mainly positive effects of height (up to 11 m) and litter cover, and mainly negative effects of grass cover. Based on trait data from true bugs, spiders and ants, the roofs consisted mainly of common dispersive species that are generalist feeders and associated with dry open habitats or have wide habitat tolerance. We found one true bug species new to the country and assume that it arrived with imported vegetation. Based on these findings, vegetated roofs of varying height and size benefit common generalists and fauna of open dry habitats, but seem to lack rare native specialists and may introduce non-natives if imported plant material is used. Because the responses to vegetation characteristics are taxon-specific, high diversity of roof vegetation types would benefit arthropod conservation.

AB  - A population of Masai giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi) occurs in Arusha National Park (ANP), which is not part of the regular Tanzanian national wildlife monitoring scheme. Urban development of Arusha city and agricultural expansion have contributed to the increasing isolation of ANP from other protected areas in northern Tanzania. The only published data on the Masai giraffe population of ANP were individual-based data collected in 1979 and 1980. Here, we used individual-based data from 2021 to 2022 to provide an update on the current population size, population sex and age structure, movements and genetic connectivity of giraffes in ANP. We documented a 49% population decline and changes in the age distribution, adult sex ratio, reproductive rate and movement patterns relative to the previous study. Mitochondrial DNA analysis revealed genetic connectivity between ANP and other populations east of the Gregory Rift Escarpments in northern Tanzania and south-eastern Kenya, evidence that Masai giraffe once moved widely across the landscape.

AB  - Fire is a recurrent phenomenon in semiarid seasonal ecosystems. The study of the relationship between fire and climate could provide new approaches for understanding fire dynamics in semiarid regions, which could be useful for strategically managing the loss and recovery of natural resources under threat. Here, we evaluated the patterns of fires occurrence in a semiarid Caatinga-Cerrado ecotone in the Northeast Region of Brazil by characterizing their spatiotemporal dynamics associated with climatic conditions. Using a temporal series of 306 Landsat images, we mapped a burned area database at a fine spatial resolution (30 m) from 1999 to 2017 in the Capivara-Confusoes Mosaic of protected areas and their surroundings. Fire seasonality was analyzed through climatic seasons, distinguishing between the rainy season (RS), early dry season (EDS), middle dry season (MDS) and late dry season (LDS), by analysis of the daily precipitation of ground-based stations in the area. We created yearly, seasonal and recurrence maps of burned areas to assess fire regimes. The results showed that the 48% of the area was burned during the 19-year long period considered. Serra das Confusoes National Park (SCoNP) had 302,644 ha burned, Serra da Capivara National Park (SCaNP) had 2056 ha burned and the ecological corridor had 215,718 ha burned. Most of the burned area was registered during the MDS (36% of the study area), there was almost no burned area in the EDS (< 0.01%), while the LDS (7%) and the RS (4%) had similar dimensions burned. The years that burned the most (2001, 2007, 2010, 2012, 2015) were followed by years with considerably less burned area. We identified a multiple-year process, consisting of a climatological year with above-average precipitation and consequent low burned area, followed by a climatological year with below-average precipitation and resulting in large extensions of burned area (periods: 1999-2001, 2008-2010, 2010-2012). Fire recurrence reached a maximum value of ten, with 47% of the area burned presenting some degree of recurrence. SCaNP presented no fire recurrence, while SCoNP had a maximum recurrence parameter of four. Areas with moderate fire recurrence were near roads, settlements or cities. Some recurrently burned areas presented similar shapes, which were associated with topography limiting the spread of the fires. The patterns that we described here constitute the first step toward understanding the fire regimes of the region to establish directions for improving management strategies and orienting policies in the area.

AB  - Green roofs are unique ecosystems combining two major community assembly filters, namely stress and spatial isolation. As such, they represent an interesting model ecosystem in community ecology. In this study, we characterized the microbiome structure on 19 green roofs and 5 urban parks as a benchmark comparison (i.e. non-isolated, non-stressful habitats). Green roofs were not species depauperate, showing similar alpha-diversity compared to surrounding parks. We also did not find an overrepresentation of bacterial phyla typically recognized as oligotrophs, which calls into question the notion of green roofs as highly stressful habitats for bacteria, and/or the conservatism of nutritional ecophysiology at the phylum level. The geographical position of a roof, or its degree of spatial isolation (assessed through its height and area) were not important predictors of microbiome diversity and structure, suggesting that dispersal limitations impose little constraints on green roof microbiome assembly. Finally, key microbial groups (e.g. archaeal nitrifiers, Actinobacteria) were much less frequent and/or abundant on green roofs, which may have important implications for nutrient cycling and urban biogeochemistry. More work will be required to phenotype the microorganisms overrepresented on green roofs and specifically measure key soil processes in these unique urban ecosystems.

AB  - This paper presents a design strategy as a technique for increasing the ecological relevance of constructed (designed) landscapes. The paper focuses on Perth, Western Australia, a rapidly expanding settler-city located in an internationally recognized biodiversity hotspot. While uniquely endued in plant endemism and species richness, the city's fringes are smoothed over and bulldozed with little regard. Located in the Southwest Australian Floristic Region, the landscape's extreme age and stability, its isolation and Gondwanan botanical heritage, and the ability of its plants to thrive in old, leached stable soils are some of the factors that account for this botanical richness. While scientists continually strive to understand the specific, Perth's inhabitants persistently crave the verdant picturesque. Without an acute and novel approach to modifying current design and development practices, Perth's biodiversity is headed for extinction. The paper is developed in four sections: firstly, it asserts that designed landscape should be treated as potential novel ecosystems, allowing for a more robust cultural and ecological exchange. Secondly, it elaborates on the particularities of site and problems within the locale of Perth, Western Australia and, in doing so, briefly presents some considerations of Perth's OCBIL landscapes. The paper then introduces the Baroque as a potential cultural framework upon which to articulate a considered design strategy. This paper elaborates on how baroque design strategies can structure the creation of resilient and ecologically productive novel ecosystems grounded in a critical and local aesthetic of ecological complexity.

AB  - Aim
   Understanding complex ecological phenomena, such as the determinants of species richness, is best achieved by investigating their properties at different spatial scales. Factors significantly affecting the number of species occurring at one scale may not impact on richness at other scales. While this scale dependence has become increasingly recognized, there still remains a need to elucidate exactly how richness is structured across scales, and which mechanisms are influential for determining this important community property. This study explores how woody plant species richness varies in a fragmented system at multiple scales, and which factors are primarily responsible for these patterns.
   Location
   The study area is located in the Sonoran Desert within the bounds of metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona, which is the locus of the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research (CAP-LTER) site.
   Methods
   Estimates of local and fragment plant species richness were generated from field data collected from 22 sites. Independent variables describing fragment sites were also calculated, including area, habitat heterogeneity, density of individuals, mean elevation, and extent of isolation. Structural equation modelling, multiple regression, and analysis of covariance were used to assess the contribution of independent variables to richness at the fragment and local scales.
   Results
   Fragment species richness was significantly influenced by area, though not isolation, habitat heterogeneity, mean elevation, or density of individuals. Local richness was not significantly related to fragment area, but was positively related to fragment richness, plant density, and elevation.
   Main conclusions
   The fragment species-area effect resulted from larger remnants supporting higher numbers of individuals at comparable densities, increasing richness through either passive sampling of progressively less common species and/or lower extinction rates among larger populations. Without using multi-temporal data it is not possible to disentangle these mechanisms. We found that patterns evident at one scale are not necessarily apparent at other scales, as elevation and density of individuals significantly affected richness at the local scale but not at the fragment scale. These results lend support to the concept that mechanisms influencing the species richness of natural communities may be operable only within certain domains and that relevant scales should be specified.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of landscape on the distribution of Japanese hares Lepus brachyurus Temminck, 1845 hares along a rural-urban gradient. We surveyed the presence of hares in 62 forest patches in the Tama Hills, which spreads from forested mountains to the urban core, and found signs of hares in 23 patches. We evaluated the effects of habitat patch size, connectivity, and land cover of the surrounding area (forest, residential and few agricultural area) by logistic regression. To select the most appropriate spatial scale and time period, we conducted a variable selection for all combinations of buffer size (250-, 500-, 1000- and 2000-m radius), and year (1974, 1984 and 1994). We calculated Akaike weight for the best model to measure the importance of each variable. The model for the best combination of buffer size and year was 500 m in 1994. We conclude that recent landscape determines the occurrence of hares. Forest patch size and percentage of forest cover were important variables in the best model. To protect the wild hare population in suburban areas, it is important to conserve areas of forest that have at least 500 m radius. These areas must be continuously maintained, as hares respond rapidly-to changes in landscape.

AB  - Landscape ecological aesthetics is a relevant conceptual framework for studying landscape multi-functionality. While the relationships between aesthetic and ecological landscape qualities have been explored and debated in landscape research they have been addressed very little in spatially explicit approaches, and never in a dynamic way. However, a set of spatial metrics can be used to characterize the visual and ecological dimensions of landscape and changes in them. In this study, we propose a framework for analyzing covariation between visual and ecological landscape qualities based on spatial metrics measured from land-cover changes. We apply this framework to the urban agglomeration of Besancon (France) and its urban-rural fringes, which have been subject to several forms of change such as urbanization and agricultural transformations. Cross-mapping of visual and ecological variations reveals both their possible convergences and divergences in space. The study area is empirically affected by much more marked convergence (16.5%) than divergence (5.3%). This contribution to landscape ecological aesthetics provides insights for integrated landscape management with an alignment of visual and ecological goals for landscape sustainability.

AB  - Many grassland specialist plant populations in Europe have become restricted to remnant habitats. The performance of these populations depends on both species-specific traits and local and landscape level aspects of habitat quality. Understanding which specific local or landscape level conditions determine the performance of grassland species populations in remnant habitats would help design the restoration of the habitats and to detect the conditions that favour the long-term persistence of grassland species in them. Such information is especially needed in urbanised landscapes, where remnant habitats engulfed by urban land use types may experience increased erosion, higher temperatures and invasion by alien species. This study investigates the population performance determinants of Carex caryophyllea (VU), a grassland specialist, in 43 remnant grasslands in an urban-rural gradient in Finland. The population performance was assessed with metrics of persistence, establishment and reproduction, and related to environmental conditions with generalized additive models and redundancy analysis. The most important positive determinants for the performance of C. caryophyllea populations were disturbance through management or ground erosion, a warm microclimate, large habitat area and high historical connectivity to suitable grassland habitats. Present connectivity to other C. caryophyllea populations had a weak and near-significant positive relationship with population performance. Urbanisation of the surrounding landscape correlated with population performance as well, possibly due to the high historical cover of grasslands in presently urbanised landscapes. The results imply that the most effective restoration method of remnant C. caryophyllea populations would be reinstating disturbance regimes in overgrown habitats with warm microclimates close to suitable habitats and other existing populations, whether urban or rural. This would counteract the species future decline due to possible extinction debts and help the species persist in the study area in the long term.

AB  - Artificial light at night is a pervasive anthropogenic stressor for biodiversity. Many fast-flying insectivorous bat species feed on insects that are attracted to light-emitting ultraviolet radiation (10-400 nm). Several countries are currently focused on replacing mercury vapour lamps, which emit ultraviolet light, with more cost-efficient light-emitting diode (LED) lights, which emit less ultraviolet radiation. This reduction in ultraviolet light may cause declines in insect densities in cities, predatory fast-flying bats, and some edge-foraging and slow-flying bats. Capitalising on a scheme to update streetlights from high ultraviolet mercury vapour to low ultraviolet LED in Sydney, Australia, we measured the activity of individual bat species, the activity of different functional groups and the bat and insect communities, before and after the change in technology. We also surveyed sites with already LED lights, sites with mercury vapour lights and unlit bushland remnants. Species adapted to foraging in cluttered vegetation, and some edge-space foraging species, were more active in unlit bushland sites than in all lit sites and decreased in activity at lit sites after the change to LED lights. The change to LED streetlights caused a decrease in the fast-flying Chalinolobus gouldii but not Miniopterus schreibersii oceanensis, the latter being more influenced by seasonal and environmental variables. Insect biomass was not affected by changing light types, but instead was negatively correlated with the moon's percentage illuminance. Changing streetlights to LEDs could result in a decline in some insectivorous bats in cities. This study confirms that unlit urban bushland remnants are important refuges for high bat diversity, particularly for more clutter-adapted species and some edge-space foraging species. Preventing light penetration into unlit bushland patches and corridors remains essential to protect the urban bat community.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the agents that contribute most to habitat fragmentation and is therefore a threat to biodiversity conservation. Connectivity improvement is the adaptation strategy most often cited to address species conservation in a changing environment.
   Many studies of protection at local and regional level zones usually show separate portions of habitat, defining the protected area, but they do not provide guidance on where and how to act to preserve the habitat quality and connectivity of the populations, on a consistent scale with planning units.
   In this paper, the analysis of fragmentation-connectivity focuses on cereal steppes of the Jarama and Henares rivers (Spain) to study the habitat and connectivity of steppic birds populations into protected areas of the Natura 2000 network, quantifying the effect on this protected area and on the species of interest caused by the massive development of infrastructure and urbanization due to the expansion of Madrid metropolitan area. In this sense, the Great Bustard (Otis tarda) was used as a bioindicator, due to its high demand for habitat quality.
   The proposed methodology only needs to be based on data from wildlife sightings and land use. Once the variables (density, biophysics and urbanization) were defined, it was possible to determine the values of influence, applying them to generate the map of areas of probability of presence and movement of the Great Bustard. This can be used to support conservation plans based on habitat connectivity.

AB  - Tree communities of secondary deciduous oak forests were surveyed in 13 forests (two in residential and 11 in rural areas) in the warm temperate Hokuriku District of Japan to understand the effects of fragmentation, location (residential or rural), and logging history. The rural forest logged most recently, where diameter at breast height was smallest, had a distinct canopy tree (> 12 m) community due to an increase of trees from wind-dispersed seeds. The rural forest with gaps and the two residential forests also had different canopy tree communities from the other rural forests. In contrast, the tree community in the shrub layer (a parts per thousand currency sign6 m) was not influenced by logging history and the existence of gaps but by location only. This was caused by an increase in evergreen trees (consequently causing poor light conditions on the forest floor) and a decrease in trees from wind-dispersed seeds in the residential forests. Among the rural forest patches, no negative effects of forest size and isolation on density of tree individuals were detected for any seed dispersal mode. This may be because many forest patches were arranged at distances of 10-50 m from neighboring patches in rural areas, which enables tree species with low dispersal ability to disperse their seeds to neighboring forests. However, as found in the residential forests, long-term abandonment and extensive fragmentation may gradually reduce tree diversity through loss of tree species with shade intolerance and low seed dispersal ability.

AB  - Pacific chorus frog (Pseudacris regilla) populations have persisted despite urban and rural development throughout the species' range; yet it is possible thatP. regilla, like other anurans with which it historically co-occurred, will become extirpated from cities and suburbs if urbanization intensifies as predicted. An improved understanding of the conditions that enable this species to persist in developed landscapes is needed to identify and conserve suitable habitats. We investigated species-habitat relationships forP. regillain a mixed urban-rural landscape in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, to identify potential criteria for habitat suitability. We conducted repeat auditory surveys of chorusing males at 52 potential breeding wetlands and modeled occupancy at 26 of these sites using local and landscape variables representing competing hypotheses and spatial scales of influence. The models that best explainedP. regillaoccupancy included a combination of terrestrial habitat and connectivity factors and the presence of non-native predators. We found that the proportion of impervious cover within 250 m of a wetland had the strongest negative impact on occupancy. Our findings suggest that availability of terrestrial habitat adjacent to breeding sites is the primary driver of species presence in the developed landscape. Conservation efforts should seek to limit impervious cover to less than 20% within a 250-m buffer around breeding wetlands. Further, restored and created wetlands in urban and rural areas may be more likely to supportP. regillaif they are designed with a seasonal hydroperiod that excludes non-native aquatic predators and are placed in an area of high pond density.

AB  - Context. The Baudin's cockatoo is one of three black cockatoo species endemic to Western Australia and is listed as Endangered by state and federal governments. Although there is a Recovery Plan in place for this species, conservation efforts are hindered by gaps in knowledge regarding the species movement ecology.
   Aims. To identify key foraging and roosting habitat for Baudin's cockatoos and to determine differences in flock movements, including the spatial extent of movement, in Urban, Peri-urban and Forest regions using telemetry data.
   Methods. Wild Baudin's cockatoos that had been injured and undergone rehabilitation were equipped with satellite PTT (platform transmitter terminal) and GPS tags and released back into wild flocks. The study birds, and the flocks into which they integrated, were tracked in the field to collect telemetry and observational data. Satellite data were used to define the types of movement behaviour (resident, ranging, migratory), and GPS data were analysed to determine key foraging and roosting habitat, and to calculate home range area estimates.
   Key results. There was a significant difference in flock movement between the Urban/Peri-urban regions and the Forest region in terms of daily distances moved and distances between roosts, with these parameters being far greater for the Forest region. Additionally, flock sizes were larger in the Forest region compared with the Urban and Peri-urban regions. In Urban and Peri-urban regions, key habitat comprised remnant vegetation in urban green space (nature reserves, parks and private property), and roadside and riparian vegetation, which served as movement corridors in the landscape.
   Conclusions. The research shows that it is important to maintain vegetation connectivity in the landscape. This enables Baudin's cockatoos to utilise key patches of remnant vegetation in their non-breeding wintering grounds in Urban and Peri-urban regions of the Perth Peel Coastal Plain. Further research on the movement ecology of Baudin's cockatoos should focus on habitat suitability modelling, which, in combination with the identified key habitat sites, will benefit the decision-making process in relation to conservation management of this endangered black cockatoo species.
   Implications. This research has benefited the conservation management of Baudin's cockatoos by providing information on key habitat through satellite tracking and outlining the importance of the connective features of remnant vegetation. We advocate for further telemetry studies combined with habitat suitability modelling to preserve the necessary habitat for the persistence of this species in the Western Australian landscape.

AB  - Mounting evidence suggests declines in the abundance and diversity of wild bees. Increasing habitat that provides forage and nesting sites could boost struggling populations, particularly in urban, suburban and agricultural landscapes. The millions of acres beneath aerial electric transmission lines, sometimes referred to as easements or rights-of-way, must be kept free of tall-growing vegetation and hence have the potential to provide suitable habitat for many native species. Prior work has demonstrated that bee communities in easements managed using alternatives to episodic mowing were more diverse than in nearby open areas, however true control sites within the easements were unavailable. In order to compare vegetation management protocols, we conducted a two-year study which enabled us to directly compare transmission line easements in three locations currently undergoing Integrated Vegetation Management-a dynamic form of management involving spot removal and herbicide treatment of unwanted species (treatment) with nearby sites undergoing standard management protocols of yearly or biyearly mowing (control). Results show that treatment sites had significantly higher abundance and species richness than controls. Seasonal differences were pronounced, with the spring fauna most affected by differences in vegetation management. In addition, the older treatment sites house more social bees, more parasitic species and a more even distribution of bees across nesting guilds. Finally, we established that treatment sites had distinct bee communities, further increasing their value as sources for native bee populations in the landscape. Overall, the data clearly show the value of implementing alternative active vegetation management in the land under powerlines to achieve an increase in the abundance and diversity of wild bees.

AB  - The conversion of rural land to residential use is occurring rapidly as the global trend of city expansion continues. The impact of this land use change on riparian biodiversity was investigated by examining ant communities from 12 remnant riparian corridors in northwest Sydney, Australia. Ants were sampled from rural and urban catchments using pitfall traps. Data on vegetation floristics, habitat structure and stream water quality were also collected. No significant differences in ant diversity metrics or assemblage structure were found between urban and rural sites. Similarly, very few environmental variables revealed significant differences between land use types. One exception, however, was the percentage cover of exotic plants, which was related to ant assemblage structure. Small-leaved and broad-leaved privet (Ligustrum spp.) were highly correlated with total weed cover. The results suggest that ants respond mostly to small-scale habitat characteristics, especially those related to the dominance of exotic plants. As all sites had experienced some level of human impact, it is possible that all the sites have already transgressed an ecological threshold due to the earlier catchment land use change from natural to agricultural use. This apparent sensitivity may explain the failure to observe any significant differences between the urban and rural catchments examined in this study. It is recommended that managers looking to protect the integrity of riparian invertebrate communities should focus on addressing local habitat pressures in human-modified catchments.

AB  - ContextAlthough the edge effect is known to be an important factor influencing the recruitment of trees in temperate forests, little is known of its synergistic relationships with landscape and fragment attributes.ObjectivesWe investigated how the edge effect on regeneration of oaks (Quercus spp.) varies with respect to fragment geometry, connectivity and landscape composition.MethodsWe recorded oak sapling density along edge-interior gradients in 29 forest fragments at the periphery of Mexico City and examined the data with Generalized Additive Models.ResultsA nonlinear and landscape-mediated edge effect was supported by data, including the interactions of the edge distance with patch connectivity, shape and size. Saplings were more abundant at a distance of ca. 50m from the edge of small, large and connected patches, but large patches also exhibited reduced recruitment towards the interior of the patch. Conversely, sapling density in simple-shaped or connected patches was lower at the edge, exhibiting linear and concave-down increase trends towards the interior of patches, respectively.ConclusionsBoundary conditions could be interacting with interior forest conditions, making regeneration more frequent at 50m from the edge. Shady and cooler sites in large patches may be inhibiting oak regeneration. The activity of acorn-dispersing animals and oak predators may increase in unconnected patches, thus increasing the likelihood of edge effects. These results provide insights into the restoration of temperate forest patches in heterogeneous fragmented landscapes.

AB  - Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become an effective tool for assessing hydrodynamics in complex environments. This paper reports on a CFD study of navigation-induced flows in a shallow, wave-protected, littoral habitat of the urban Spree River. It was constructed as a rehabilitation structure for aquatic organisms and subject to abundant growth of aquatic and riparian vegetation. This study aims to quantify the hydrodynamics induced by vessel movements and its consequences for water exchange and lateral connectivity between the habitat and the main channel with three representative, natural densities of aquatic plants. The simulations revealed both high efficiency of the rehabilitation structure in reducing hydrodynamic forces in the littoral and a superimposed reduction of hydrodynamic forces, and increase of flushing time with increased plant cover. Higher vegetation density resulted in lower wave propagation and lower connectivity of the rehabilitation structure with the fairway. Thus, natural succession of aquatic vegetation in the shallow habitats leads to increasing isolation and finally to terrestrialization. Maintaining the functionality of the rehabilitation structure as habitat for other aquatic organisms requires either plant removal or preferably adaptive modification, e.g. by successively increasing the openings to the main channel and letting the plants take over the protective function of the technical facilities. The developed CFD model helps to find hydrodynamically optimized solutions and to support decision-making process for maintaining littoral refuges for plants and weak swimming organisms in navigable waterways.

AB  - With the interactions of river discharge and tide, the balances between water and saline in estuaries are helpful for maintaining biodiversity and landscape diversity. However, the delicate balances have been broken in many estuaries especially in some areas where prosperous cities have been developed. Saltwater intrusion causes serious adverse effects on estuary ecosystems in Pearl River estuary (PRE), China. This paper tries to use a wetland network which is a methodology to divert saltwater to explain how to address the adverse effects of saltwater intrusion and aims to mitigate such intrusion. The existing wetland patches and corridors are connected and form a wetland network with structural and functional connectivity. The patches in the wetland network are assigned to attributes that represent storage capacity of wetlands, and the corridors are assigned to attributes that represent water flow of channels. The results demonstrated that the saltwater intrusion length follows a linear relationship with tidal discharge in the southern part of Guangzhou (SPG, a part of PRE). When the upstream discharge changed slightly, saltwater intrusion cannot be effectively mitigated merely by diverting water from river channels to wetland network during spring tides. This paper provides new insight for management of saltwater intrusion in estuaries.

AB  - Landscape connectivity is important for conserving wildlife in spaces shared with humans. Yet, differences in human attitudes and behaviors within movement corridors can lead to spatial variation in the risks humans pose to wildlife. Mapping the spatial pattern of attitudes toward wildlife provides a useful tool for measuring this variation and promoting connectivity. We surveyed ranchers (n = 505) in the High Divide region in eastern Idaho and western Montana (United States) about their attitudes toward grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) - a species that can pose risks to livestock and human safety. We assessed spatial variation in rancher acceptance of grizzly bears by combining survey and spatial predictors. Ranchers surrounded by more conservation easements and wildland-urban interface reported more positive attitudes toward grizzlies. Ranch size, experience with bears, and off-ranch income sources helped to further explain relationships between predictors and ranchers' acceptance of grizzlies. Our predictive map of acceptance provides spatially explicit information for targeted, pre-emptive conflict mitigation and a baseline for examining spatiotemporal changes in human attitudes as grizzly bear populations expand in the region. Integrating human social factors into spatial connectivity planning may better inform how organizations approach landowners and allow for a more strategic, sustainable approach to connectivity and conservation decision-making.

AB  - In this survey study, the networks among poultry farms and related poultry enterprises in two counties in China (Feixi County in Anhui Province and Beizhen city in Liaoning Province) were analysed and evaluated focusing on the connectivity of contacts, movements, and potential pathogen transmission. The Feixi County poultry production network exhibited greater connectivity, which incorporated approximately 94% of the farms interviewed in a major component (a set of connected farms not linked with each other), mainly due to linkages of backyard farms through local produce stores and individual agents, whilst the Beizhen City network was more fragmented owing to independent in-house operations (from breed, raise, to slaughter and process) of a few large companies, with multiple smaller components. A range of factors influencing the contacts/movements among farms (act as bridges) were identified in this study. Ability to predict the pathway with the network characteristics on the basis of the factors, such as entity type and geographic location, is useful for developing risk-based approaches for disease prevention, surveillance, early detection, and effective controlling.

AB  - Many studies have examined how island biogeography affects diversity on the scale of island systems. In this study, we address how diversity varies over very short periods of time on individual islands. To do this, we compile an inventory of the ants living in the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area, Boston, Massachusetts, USA using data from a five-year All Taxa Biodiversity Inventory of the region's arthropods. Consistent with the classical theory of island biogeography, species richness increased with island size, decreased with island isolation, and remained relatively constant over time. Additionally, our inventory finds that almost half of the known Massachusetts ant fauna can be collected in the BHI, and identifies four new species records for Massachusetts, including one new to the United States, Myrmica scabrinodis. We find that the number of species actually active on islands depended greatly on the timescale under consideration. The species that could be detected during any given week of sampling could by no means account for total island species richness, even when correcting for sampling effort. Though we consistently collected the same number of species over any given week of sampling, the identities of those species varied greatly between weeks. This variation does not result from local immigration and extinction of species, nor from seasonally-driven changes in the abundance of individual species, but rather from weekly changes in the distribution and activity of foraging ants. This variation can be upwards of 50% of ant species per week. This suggests that numerous ant species on the BHI share the same physical space at different times. This temporal partitioning could well explain such unexpectedly high ant diversity in an isolated, urban site.

AB  - The overall aim in the development of the Local Ecological Footprinting Tool (LEFT) was to design a web-based tool that could provide quickly obtained quantitative data on ecological risk to assist landowners when making land-use change decisions. The Local Ecological Footprinting Tool works for almost any region in the world and uses freely available satellite imagery, biotic and abiotic data from existing global databases, models and algorithms to deliver a customised report for a selected area within one hour of job submission. Biotic data automatically obtained for a selected landscape includes terrestrial vertebrate and plant species occurrence data, information on their conservation status and remotely sensed vegetation productivity. Abiotic information obtained includes temperature, precipitation, water availability, insolation, topography, elevation, distribution of urban infrastructure and location of wetlands. The tool performs a number of analyses on the biotic and abiotic data to produce maps for the selected area at a 30m resolution depicting land cover type, numbers of globally threatened terrestrial vertebrate and plant species, beta-diversity of terrestrial vertebrates and plants, habitat intactness, wetland habitat connectivity, numbers of migratory species and vegetation resilience. Results are also aggregated to produce a summary map demonstrating areas of high and low ecological risk across the selected area. The Local Ecological Footprinting Tool has been designed to be intuitive to use, requiring no specialised software or user expertise. Input is extremely easy and requires the user to highlight the area of interest on a map or using grid co-ordinates. Output is delivered via the web application and comprises a customised PDF containing the maps and a zip file of geographical information system (GIS) data for the area requested. Users may run an unlimited number of LEFT analyses and download reports free of charge. In addition to the free tool described in this paper, there is also a paid service: individual LEFT analyses can be upgraded for a charge to allow access to the geographically subsetted datasets generated for each report. These data are supplied as a zip file containing raster datasets for the layers in the LEFT analysis in GeoTIFF format. These can be opened and queried in a GIS software package.

AB  - This paper continues the analysis of the management of urban waterways in Greater Melbourne, Australia, commenced with our first paper. We focus first on the increasing emphasis on waterways and their corridors as part of Melbourne's liveability, and then on the future management of waterways and their corridors in the face of the three most pressing future challenges - climate change, population increase, and urban expansion and densification. The long history of the development of parks, gardens and open spaces in Melbourne is reviewed. These open-spaces initially occurred with quite strong linkage to the waterways, enabled by the city's unique institutional arrangements, but were substantially weakened as a result of policy and governance reforms in the 1990s. Melbourne will need to substantially improve the integration of the management of urban waterways and their corridors with the planning, development and management of the city's associated green spaces if it is to achieve the expected community liveability standards in the face of the above three future challenges. Additionally, if waterway management remains with the existing agency (Melbourne Water), the authorising environment and the culture and mindset of this agency will need to change its focus from the current 'city servicing' institutional model to a 'city shaping' model.

AB  - During the COVID-19 outbreak, college students experienced different periods of isolation on campus, which has had an impact on students' mental health. Based on ART theory, this study randomly selected students at Northwest A&F University, Shaanxi, China and distributed questionnaires in order to evaluate the psychological recovery effect of campus environment during the epidemic. The results showed that: (1) There were significant differences in the psychological restoration of four types of campus environments. Blue space had the greatest effect, followed by green space and sports grounds, while grey space had the least. (2) Time of stay had a very significant impact on psychological restoration. Longer time of exposure is not necessarily correlated with a better recovery experience. (3) In the different campus environments, extent is easier to be perceived followed by fascination and compatibility, and the weakest is being away. At the time of stay level, no significant difference was found in the perception of compatibility. Time of stay was negatively correlated with fascination and compatibility. These findings can provide theoretical and practical bases for campus environmental planning and construction following the COVID-19 epidemic.

AB  - There is increasing interest in using functional rather than neutral loci to assess the genetic health of wild populations. We compared growth and survival of urban and rural frog larvae under three temperature regimes, to vary stress levels, and measured genetic diversities at nine microsatellites and at one major histocompatibility complex ( MHC) class II locus. We found no significant differences between urban and rural frogs in larval survivorship, nor in microsatellite and MHC diversities. However, mean larval growth rates were significantly higher ( by 4.5-18.9% according to temperature) in urban compared with rural populations. Microsatellite and MHC diversities were uncorrelated, though pairwise inter-site F(ST) estimates based on the two types of loci were correlated. MHC F(ST) estimates averaged about twice as high as those based on microsatellites. There was no evidence of isolation by distance with either marker. There were no correlations at the population level between any larval fitness attribute (growth rate or survival) and any diversity estimate (microsatellite or MHC). There was, however, a weak correlation at the sibship level between mean growth rate and microsatellite expected heterozygosity. MHC alleles varied among dying larvae and survivors, and in one case between urban and rural sites, with one allele being under-represented in dying larvae and one allele only occurring in the rural sites. Drift was probably the primary cause of genetic population structure at both types of loci. The use of functional loci to assess population genetic health should focus on the roles of specific alleles as well as overall diversity.

AB  - Questions How (de)coupled are native and exotic tree diversities in their relationships with local soil conditions and landscape configurations? Can (de)coupled diversity-environment relationships be used to manage native and exotic species separately to minimize unintended impacts on one another?
   Location The tropical city-state of Singapore, Southeast Asia.
   Methods In two types of novel, exotic-dominated secondary forests regenerating from land abandonment, we surveyed both native and exotic trees >= 5 cm diameter-at-breast height (DBH) in 97 plots and correlated taxonomic and functional diversities to soil fertility (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) and landscape configuration gradients (distance to old-growth forests and patch area).
   Results Native and exotic tree species had unshared or decoupled responses to distance to old-growth forest and soil phosphorus. The taxonomic and functional diversities of native, but not exotic, species declined rapidly with increasing isolation from old-growth forests. Exotic, but not native, species richness increased with soil phosphorus levels. Neither native nor exotic diversities were associated with soil nitrogen, potassium, and patch area.
   Conclusions Native and exotic tree species could be managed separately without unintended impacts on one another because of their decoupled responses to distance from old-growth forest and soil phosphorus. The native-distance-to-old-growth relationship suggests that novel secondary forests adjacent to old-growth forests can accrue native species with minimal intervention, while enhancement plantings of old-growth native species should target more isolated patches. The exotic-phosphorus relationship suggests that restoring soils to historically-low phosphorus levels can help to reduce exotic diversity, without negative impacts on native diversity. Our study highlights the importance of understanding (de)coupled species or species-group responses to identify optimal management solutions with minimal non-target effects.

AB  - Urbanization substantially changes the physicochemical and biological characteristics of streams. The trajectory of negative effect is broadly similar around the world, but the nature and magnitude of ecological responses to urban growth differ among locations. Some heterogeneity in response arises from differences in the level of urban development and attributes of urban water management. However, the heterogeneity also may arise from variation in hydrologic, biological, and physicochemical templates that shaped stream ecosystems before urban development. We present a framework to develop hypotheses that predict how natural watershed and channel attributes in the pre-urban-development state may confer ecological resistance to urbanization. We present 6 testable hypotheses that explore the expression of such attributes under our framework: 1) greater water storage capacity mitigates hydrologic regime shifts, 2) coarse substrates and a balance between erosive forces and sediment supply buffer morphological changes, 3) naturally high ionic concentrations and pH pre-adapt biota to water quality stress, 4) metapopulation connectivity results in retention of species richness, 5) high functional redundancy buffers trophic function from species loss, and 6) landuse history mutes or reverses the expected trajectory of eutrophication. Data from past comparative analyses support these hypotheses, but rigorous testing will require targeted investigations that account for confounding or interacting factors, such as diversity in urban infrastructure attributes. Improved understanding of the susceptibility or resistance of stream ecosystems could substantially strengthen conservation, management, and monitoring efforts in urban streams. We hope that these preliminary, conceptual hypotheses will encourage others to explore these ideas further and generate additional explanations for the heterogeneity observed in urban streams.

AB  - The ability to disperse among patches is central to population dynamics in fragmented landscapes. Although saproxylic (=dead wood dependent) insects live in extremely fragmented forest ecosystems and comprise a significant proportion of the biodiversity therein, few studies have focused on dispersal of members in this group. We quantified the terrestrial movements of Odontotaenius disjunctus Illiger, a common saproxylic beetle in eastern North American forests. Movement behavior of individual beetles was measured in deciduous forest and two common matrix (=unsuitable) habitats (urban lawn and cattle pasture). Probability of emigrating from a forest fragment was assessed at the high-contrast boundary between forest and pasture. Seasonal, diurnal, and sex-biased patterns of O. disjunctus dispersal were determined from captures at drift fences encircling inhabited logs. Movement was 1.6 and 2.7 times faster and 1.1 and 1.5 times more linear in suitable habitat (forest) than in unsuitable matrix (lawn and pasture, respectively). Net displacement in the forest exceeded predictions of a correlated random walk, but net displacement in matrix habitats was less than expected. When confronted with a high-contrast boundary, O. disjunctus was 14 times more likely to move toward the forest than the pasture. The importance of temperature was indicated by its positive relationship with movement rate and increased diurnal and warm season dispersal activity. Reluctance to cross boundaries into open fields and slow movement within open fields suggest a low likelihood of terrestrial O. disjunctus movement among forest fragments.

AB  - There are currently no reports on the isolation and molecular examination of Toxoplasma gondii from bats. Here, we report the isolation and genotypic characterisation of two T. gondii isolates from bats. A total of 369 bats from different municipalities in Sao Paulo state, southeastern Brazil, were captured and euthanised, and collected tissues (heart and pectoral muscle) were processed for each bat or in pools of two or three bats and bioassayed in mice (a total of 283 bioassays). Eleven PCR-RFLP (polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism) markers were used to genotype positive samples: SAG1, SAG2 (5'-3'SAG2 and alt. SAG2), SAG3,BTUB, GRA6, L358, c22-8, c29-2, PK1, CS3 and Apico. The parasite was isolated from two bats from Sao Paulo city: an insectivorous bat, the velvety free-tailed bat Molossus molossus, and a hematophagous bat, the common vampire bat Desmodus rotundus. Isolates were designated TgBatBr1 and TgBatBr2, respectively. The genotype of the isolate from M. molossus (TgBatBr1) has been previously described in an isolate from a capybara from Sao Paulo state, and the genotype from the D. rotundus isolate (TgBatBr2) has already been identified in isolates from cats, chickens, capybaras, sheep, a rodent and a common rabbit from different Brazilian states, suggesting that this may be a common T. gondii lineage circulating in some Brazilian regions. Isolation of T. gondii from a hematophagous species is striking. This study reveals that bats can share the same isolates that are found in domesticated and wild terrestrial animals. This is the first report of the isolation and genotyping of T. gondii in chiropterans. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We employed an island biogeographic approach to determine whether small fragments of the shrub habitats coastal sage scrub and chaparral, isolated by urbanization, are capable of supporting viable populations of native rodent species. The distribution of native rodents in 25 urban habitat fragments was assessed by live-trapping. Over half of the fragments surveyed (13 of 25) did not support populations of native rodents, Fragments supported fewer species than equivalently sized plots in large expanses of unfragmented habitat, and older fragments (fragments that had been isolated for a longer period of time) supported fewer species, Both results implied that local extinctions occurred in the fragments following insularization. Stepwise multiple polychotomous logistic regression was used to determine which biogeographic variables were the best predictors of species number across fragments, The area of shrub habitat in each fragment was the most significant predictor of species diversity; age of a fragment was also significant and was negatively con-elated with species number, but the isolation distance of a fragment had no relationship to species diversity, We found a negative relationship between extinction vulnerability of native rodent species and relative abundance: species that were more abundant in unfragmented habitat persisted in more habitat fragments, Random environmental and demographic fluctuations (island effects) and edge effects associated with fragmentation are proposed as causes of these local extinctions.

In order to determine the environmental occurrence of both varieties of Cryptococcus neoformans in Jordan, pigeon droppings and material under the canopies of eucalyptus trees were collected from four major cities of this country. For the isolation of Cryptococcus neoformans variety gattii from environmental sources, 500 samples of the mixed soil debris, including tree materials, under the eucalyptus trees from cities of Amman, Irbid, Jerash, and Ajlun were collected. Also, 509 samples of pigeon droppings were collected from the same cities for the isolation of Cryptococcus neoformans variety neoformans. After inoculating the samples onto modified Staib agar medium in Petri dishes, a total of 336 melanoid yeast colonies were picked up during screening process. At the end of serial mycological studies, none of these isolates was identified as Cryptococcus neoformans, but all were Cryptococcus species other than C. neoformans. For determining the exact status, more extensive environmental studies need to be done in the future.

AB  - A vegetation survey of road verges along an urban to rural gradient in the Potchefstroom Municipal Area was conducted. Important applications of these studies include understanding of the role of indigenous (native) and exotic species in the overall synanthropisation of vegetation. The present study forms part of a research programme on spontaneous vegetation in urban open spaces in the North-West Province of South Africa. A numerical classification technique (TWINSPAN) was used as a first approximation and the classification was refined using Braun-Blanquet procedures, The result is a phytosociological table from which 13 plant communities and seven sub-communities were recognised. Although some of these communities and subcommunities are similar to previously described vegetation types in natural and disturbed areas, most of them were not described before in South Africa. Two ordination scatter diagrams show the distribution of the plant communities along gradients which were related to the depth of the soil water table, habitat type, trampling, soil compaction and percentage of gravel in the soil surface. Similarities between roadside vegetation in this study and those overseas are discussed, as well as the possible role of road verges as dispersal corridors between natural and disturbed areas.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate the utility of island biogeography theory as a model for understanding and conserving native communities of nonvolant terrestrial vertebrates at prairie dog towns.
   Location: Oklahoma Panhandle, USA.
   Methods: We surveyed mammal, reptile and amphibian communities on 36 black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus ) towns during the summers and falls of 1997 to 1999. We used a Geographic Information System (GIS) to characterize the landscape within 10 km of each town. We used Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Correlation Analysis, and Linear Regression to test for patterns in species richness relative to area and isolation of towns, local habitat characteristics, and characteristics of the adjacent landscape.
   Results: Species richness was not significantly correlated with town size, town isolation, or local habitat characteristics. On the other hand, species richness was significantly correlated with characteristics of the landscape within 10 km of the focal town. In addition, species richness of mammals at prairie dog towns during the summer increased in a northerly direction, while richness of mammals at towns during fall increased to the west.
   Main conclusions. These results, albeit contrary to traditional island biogeography theory, are consistent with an emerging view that communities on relatively small islands are strongly influenced by characteristics of the adjacent landscape (or seascape). We recommend that to the extent possible, networks of reserves for prairie dogs and their associated species should include clusters of large towns (i.e. larger than those studied here), as well as large but isolated towns, and that conservation efforts should include management of the intervening matrix of anthropogenic habitats.

AB  - GIS-based siting procedures are progressively used to select protected areas (PAs) on the basis of a variety of attributes clustered in main environmental groups including climate, hydrogeology, vegetation cover and various criteria and sub-criteria showing changes in the landscape. However, the suitability of a selecting procedure may be restrained by the aggregate analyses involving the weight and relative importance of the criteria. Here, we integrate a multi criteria decision analysis methodology with geographic information system for selecting a protected region for the vulnerable Kaiser's mountain newt, Neurergus kaiseri, endemic to southern Iran. The process of decision making for selection a PA for N. kaiseri structured in a two-stage. Mask maps are prepared using nine exclusionary criteria including stream density, high ridge density, areas with unsuitable terrestrial vegetation cover, unacceptable land use, harsh climate, inappropriate distance to cities and industries, main roads, railroad, and dam reservoirs. These exclusionary criteria provided an overlay map representing areas grossly suitable for allocating PAs. The initial site screening followed by a multi criteria decision analysis based on ten non-exclusionary criteria including conservation integrity, number of newt localities, MaxEnt suitability score, distance to nearest neighbor habitat, genetic diversity, spring density, distance to protected area, extent of selected patch areas, villages density and distance to main roads. Giving weight and rate to the non-exclusionary criteria all nominated PAs received a numerical evaluation. (c) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Urban habitats are generally considered highly invaded by exotic species due to the frequency and extent of disturbance caused by human activities and development. Our previous study had demonstrated that forested wetlands within residential areas are more extensively invaded than wetlands within industrial-commercial areas. In this study, we investigate whether the structure of the forest edge and seed dispersal can explain the differential in the invasion of wetlands surrounded by industrial and residential land use. Our results indicate that edges of industrially bordered wetlands are denser, with vegetation concentrated at the boundary of tree growth, whereas the edges of residentially bordered wetlands are more open and diffuse. This difference influences the number of seeds and species capable of dispersing into the wetland. Less dense edges resulted in a higher number of seeds entering residential wetlands; however, there were no differences in the numbers of exotic seeds or exotic species in the seed rain residential and industrial wetlands. Although seed dispersal could not directly explain differences in the current extent of invasion of these sites, seed dispersal did follow corridor pathways, including ditches and trails that breach the edges and extend through the wetlands. These disturbances act as corridors for seed dispersal into both types wetlands and may play a role in introducing new species to the interior of the wetland, an outcome supported by a higher number of exotic species in the seed banks of residential sites. Our results suggest that both the type of adjoining land use and the provision of access to people on trails in urban wetlands can affect the composition of these communities.

AB  - Biodiversity is vital for the integrity and stability of ecosystems and sustainable development. Karst regions of Southwest China is featured for undulating and broken karst terrain as well as high plant diversity. Land use changes induced by the growing population and expanding human settlement have threatened biodiversity preservation in this region. However, the impact of urban expansion on plant diversity remains unclear here. This study focuses on how expanding countryside landscapes affect the recovery rate of plant diversity and demonstrate how urban expansion affects plant diversity conservation in karst regions of Southwest China. In situ biodiversity investigations and multisource remote sensing images were combined to analyze the role of human settlement evolution in the conservation of plant diversity using descriptive statistics and regression analysis. Unmanned vehicle images, historical aerial photographs, and long-term remote sensing images were used to observe the human settlement pattern changes over 40 yr and found that plant diversity is restored faster in countryside ecosystems than in island ecosystems restricted by water. Forests, however, contribute the most to plant diversity conservation in both ecosystems. While the forest area is stable during urban expansion, massive forest patches play an essential role in plant diversity conservation. Arable lands and grasslands shrank but with a fragmenting trend, which was conducive to preserving plant diversity, whereas increased and regularized large patches of built-up areas were not beneficial to plant diversity. Accordingly, forest protection should be prioritized to coordinate future socioeconomic development and plant diversity conservation in karst and broader regions. Furthermore, large built-up patches should be limited, and the irregularity should be improved during urban expansion. Irregular shaped cultivated land and grassland were suggested to promote biological information exchanges as landscape corridors.

AB  - Obesity and global warming are two major challenges that affect communities' health and quality of life. Providing good walking environments, with appropriate pedestrian infrastructure, green areas and access to commercial retail and transport hubs favour liveable, healthy, and sustainable cities. The Lisbon City Hall has implemented an intervention program in the public space as a strategy to improve environmental quality and mitigate the effects of climate change. The program "A square in each neighbourhood " intends not only to reinforce the economic base of Lisbon, namely tourism, restaurants, commerce, and creative activities but also to promote physical activity and improve the quality of living of all citizens. For studying the impact of the public space quality on the walking environment, Campolide, a typical Lisbon neighbourhood, Portugal, which includes one of the requalified squares, was selected. A two-step methodology based on spatial modelling is proposed. In the first step, the public space quality was evaluated based on a set of 13 urban quality attributes. Attributes, intended for the street level, were collected from open data platforms and complemented with a field survey. Then, through spatial analysis, these attributes were used to build the Pedestrian Environment Quality Indicator and the Priority Intervention Indicator. Using these indicators, walking-friendly streets were mapped and the most critical sites that require priority intervention were identified to prepare for the requalification planning process. The street with the highest quality in the study area according to the dimensions evaluated -connectivity, convenience, comfort, cleanliness, and conviviality -has a great offer of trees, bus stops, commercial establishments, commercial diversity, crossings, paper bins/eco points and esplanades. On the opposite side of the rank, the street with the lowest quality has no trees or green areas, transport stops, benches and tables, or commercial activity. The urban quality indicators constitute a helpful tool for city planners and policymakers when planning sustainable living neighbourhoods.

AB  - I assessed the effects of pedestrians on the distribution of forest bird species in wooded parks in the city of Madrid within and between fragments. Within fragments, increasing levels of pedestrians reduced species richness and overall abundance of individuals within circular plots. The abundance of foraging individuals of four species (Magpies Pica pica, Blackbirds Turdus merula, Starlings Sturnus unicolor, and Woodpigeon Columba palumbus) diminished when pedestrians walked near sampling plots, as well as their breeding densities in relation to increasing disturbance levels. Between fragments, after controlling for fragment size effects, pedestrian rate was negatively related to species richness in two breeding seasons. Species turnover was positively associated to mean pedestrian rate and inter-annual variability in pedestrian rate. At the species level, pedestrian rate negatively affected the probabilities of fragment occupation of 16 species beyond the effects of fragment size and isolation. Locally, the short-term behavioral responses to visitors may reduce the suitability of highly disturbed parks in such a way as to decrease breeding densities and the probabilities of fragment occupation and persistence. The effects of human disturbance in fragmented landscapes should be incorporated into management decisions as another relevant factor that may reduce habitat quality.

AB  - Stormwater basins are commonly employed structures designed to mitigate the negative effects of urban runoff. They are ubiquitous in the urbanized landscape; yet the effect of these basins on anurans has only recently been addressed. Stormwater basins have the potential to influence the breeding distribution of anurans by being sources for some species and sinks for others. Our study aims to determine which species benefit from the existence of stormwater basins, which species are negatively impacted, and what variables are the best predictors of these effects. We monitored thirty-six permanently-ponded basins in southern New Jersey for the presence of anuran larvae and calling males by aural surveys, dip-netting and trapping. We assessed fish presence by interviews, visual encounters, dip-netting, and traps. We divided near shore buffer areas into impervious surface and managed or unmanaged categories for both grass and woody vegetation. Two connectivity metrics, distance to canopied corridor and percent of undeveloped upland were analyzed with ArcGIS. Fish were detected in 92% of the basins. Resistance to fish predation distinguished successful species, those with larvae present, from unsuccessful species, those with calling activity but no larval presence. Connectivity to and availability of terrestrial habitat were significant predictors of the breeding species richness at the basins. Number of calling species increased as access to and amount of terrestrial habitat increased. Therefore, design, management, and placement of permanently-ponded basins can impact anuran communities. Additionally, as wet basins are sources for Rana catesbeiana, where bullfrogs are invasive, basins will likely increase propagule pressure.

AB  - This study numerically investigates the influence of different vegetation types and layouts on microclimate and air quality in residential districts based on the morphology and green layout of Nanjing, China. Simulations were performed using Computational Fluid Dynamics and the microclimate model ENVI-met. Four green indices, i.e., the green cover ratio, the grass and shrub cover ratio, the ecological landscaping plot ratio and the landscaping isolation index, were combined to evaluate thermal and wind fields, as well as air quality in district models. Results show that under the same green cover ratio (i.e., the same quantity of all types of vegetation), the reduction of grass and shrub cover ratio (i.e., the quantity of grass and shrubs), replaced by trees, has an impact, even though small, on thermal comfort, wind speed and air pollution, and increases the leisure space for occupants. When trees are present, a low ecological landscaping plot ratio (which expresses the weight of carbon dioxide absorption and is larger in the presence of trees) is preferable due to a lower blocking effect on wind and pollutant dispersion. In conjunction with a low landscaping plot ratio, a high landscaping isolation index (which means a distributed structure of vegetation) enhances the capability of local cooling and the general thermal comfort, decreasing the average temperature up to about 0.5 degrees C and the average predicted mean vote (PMV) up to about 20% compared with the non-green scenario. This paper shows that the relationship vegetation-microclimate-air quality should be analyzed taking into account not only the total area covered by vegetation but also its layout and degree of aggregation.

AB  - Landscape metrics represent powerful tools for quantifying landscape structure, but uncertainties persist around their interpretation. Urban settings add unique considerations, containing habitat structures driven by the surrounding built-up environment. Understanding urban ecosystems, however, should focus on the habitats rather than the matrix.
   We coupled a multivariate approach with landscape metric analysis to overcome existing shortcomings in interpretation. We then explored relationships between landscape characteristics and modelled ecosystem service provision.
   We used principal component analysis and cluster analysis to isolate the most effective measures of landscape variability and then grouped habitat patches according to their attributes, independent of the surrounding urban form. We compared results to the modelled provision of three ecosystem services. Seven classes resulting from cluster analysis were separated primarily on patch area, and secondarily by measures of shape complexity and inter-patch distance.
   When compared to modelled ecosystem services, larger patches up to 10 ha in size consistently stored more carbon per area and supported more pollinators, while exhibiting a greater risk of soil erosion. Smaller, isolated patches showed the opposite, and patches larger than 10 ha exhibited no additional areal benefit.
   Multivariate landscape metric analysis offers greater confidence and consistency than analysing landscape metrics individually. Independent classification avoids the influence of the urban matrix surrounding habitats of interest, and allows patches to be grouped according to their own attributes. Such a grouping is useful as it may correlate more strongly with the characteristics of landscape structure that directly affect ecosystem function.

AB  - 1. The aim of this study was to test whether experimentally induced destruction and fragmentation of habitat and varying degrees of patch isolation applied to 11 experimental populations of root voles affected space use and fitness parameters in radio-tracked females. It was predicted that the habitat destruction would disrupt the spatiosocial relations between breeding individuals, which, in turn, would cause lowered survival and reproductive success. Different degrees of patch isolation were expected to affect the rate of risky and energetically costly interpatch movements.
   2. The experimental habitat destruction comprised the removal of more than half of the habitat area (meadow vegetation) in each of seven populations that had been established in a large continuous habitat block. This treatment yielded six small, habitat patches arranged in two clusters with long and short interfragment distances, respectively. Measures of individual space use, survival rates (predation and unknown causes) and litter production were contrasted with equivalent measures obtained from four control populations. The control populations had been established in permanently fragmented plots with the same fragment configuration as the post-destruction treatment populations. The effect of different interpatch distance was tested by comparing movement rates, space use and demographic parameters between the two types of patch cluster.
   3. Home ranges were larger in the continuous predestruction populations compared to the permanently fragmented control populations. There was a large decrease in home range area of individual females as a result of habitat destruction, and they became temporally smaller than in the control plots. The degree of overlap only increased on home range core areas. The degree of space sharing between matrilineal related females, a main characteristic of Microtus social organization, was higher in the permanently fragmented populations (controls) than in the treatment populations. This difference was also maintained after habitat destruction. Thus, the basic spatiosocial organization of reproductive females when first established, seems to be very resistant to habitat destruction. There were no effects of habitat destruction on female fitness parameters when tested for either at the cluster or the population level.
   4. There were less between-patch movements when interpatch distances were large than when they were small, irrespective of the fragmentation history of the population. Predation by avian predators, the main mortality cause, was highest in fragment clusters with long interpatch distances, probably because long distance movements between fragments increased the predation risk.
   5. There was a large intrapopulation variation with respect to how severely individuals were affected by the habitat destruction. The farther a female had to relocate her home range because of habitat destruction, the higher was the predation risk. Thus, this study predicts that the most influential aspect of habitat fragmentation on demography may be that causing long interpatch movements.

AB  - Bees of the tribe Euglossini are known as orchid-bees. In general, areas with more vegetation cover have greater abundance and diversity of these bees. This study investigated the effects of forest fragmentation on assemblages of the euglossine bees in the region of Rio Branco municipality, State of Acre, and surrounding areas. Ten forest fragments with varying sizes were selected for the study and were classified as urban or rural. The bees were sampled between December 2005 and August 2006. A total of 3,675 bees in 36 species and 4 genera were collected. In general abundance and richness of bees did not differ statistically between urban and rural fragments. The index of edge in fragments was a predictor of richness and diversity of bees. The connectivity estimated was also an adequate predictor for richness. Fragments with greater similarity in relation to their landscape structure were also more similar in relation to faunal composition.

AB  - Effective conservation planning requires information from well-designed studies across a spectrum of land uses, ranging from wildlands to highly, modified production landscapes and large cities, There is currently, a lack of such information about human settlement, even though this is it major source of land-use change with serious implications for biodiversity. Fewer than 6% of the papers in recent volumes of Conservation Biology described work conducted in urban, suburban, or exurban areas or studies In which human settlement was considered explicitly For a variety of reasons, conservation bets tended to focus oil lands with a relatively, small human presence, often dominated by resource extraction and agriculture. Urbanization is occurring in numerous biodiversity, hotspots worldwide, however, and has been identified as a primary. cause of declines in many, threatened and endangered species. Suburban and exurban growth art, affecting biodiversity, in many,places once thought of as too remote to attract such levels of development, Conservation biologists must address the issue of human settlement to enhance the habitat value of unreserved lands for native species, to increase landscape connectivity, between reserves, and to mitigate adverse influences oil reserves from adjacent lands. Conservation and restoration of native habitats in densely, settled areas also have social and educational value. We therefore suggest a more balanced approach in conservation biology to addressing the effects of human land use through increased attention to areas where people live and work.

AB  - This study revised the spider genus Oxyopes Latreille, 1804 in Taiwan and delineated the species boundaries based on morphological and molecular characters. A total of seven Oxyopes spiders were recognized, including two newly described species, O. hasta sp. nov. and O. taiwanensis sp. nov. Oxyopes fujianicus Song & Zhu 1993 from Yilan County, Nantou County, and Kaohsuing City, and O. striagatus Song 1999 from New Taipei City, Taichung City, Nantou County, and Kaohsiung City were recorded for the first time in Taiwan. An identification key and a distributional map of Taiwanese Oxyopes species were provided. Partial COI sequences were obtained for molecular phylogenetic and species delimitation analyses. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenies, and DNA barcoding gap analysis supported morphologically defined species. However, molecular species delimitation based on Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD), P-ID (Liberal), and generalized mixed Yule coalescent (GMYC) were incongruent in species assignment. The results showed that the interspecific genetic divergence between O. sertatus and O. taiwanensis was relatively low (1.28 +/- 0.43%), and the intraspecific genetic divergence of O. striagatus was relatively high (1.69 +/- 0.35%). Ecological data, additional samples and genetic loci are required to further examine the level of reproductive isolation and patterns of population genetic structure in Taiwanese Oxyopes.

AB  - Termites of the genus Reticulitermes are widespread invaders, particularly in urban habitats. Their cryptic and subterranean lifestyle makes them difficult to detect, and we know little about their colony dynamics over time. In this study we examined the persistence of Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) colonies in the city of Paris over a period of 15 years. The aim was (1) to define the boundaries of colonies sampled within the same four areas over two sampling periods, (2) to determine whether the colonies identified during the first sampling period persisted to the second sampling period, and (3) to compare the results obtained when colonies were delineated using a standard population genetic approach versus a Bayesian clustering method that combined both spatial and genetic information. Herein, colony delineations were inferred from genetic differences at nine microsatellite loci and one mitochondrial locus. Four of the 18 identified colonies did not show significant differences in their genotype distributions between the two sampling periods. While allelic richness was low, making it hard to reliably distinguish colony family type, most colonies appeared to retain the same breeding structure over time. These large and expansive colonies showed an important ability to fuse (39% were mixed-family colonies), contained hundreds of reproductives and displayed evidence of isolation-by-distance, suggesting budding dispersal. These traits, which favor colony persistence over time, present a challenge for pest control efforts, which apply treatment locally. The other colonies showed significant differences, but we cannot exclude the possibility that their genotype distributions simply changed over time.

AB  - The strength and arrangement of movement barriers can impact the connectivity among habitat patches. Anthropogenic barriers (e.g. roads) are a source of habitat fragmentation that can disrupt these resource networks and can have an influence on the spatial genetic structure of populations. Using microsatellite data, we evaluated whether observed genetic structure of moose (Alces alces) populations were associated with human activities (e.g. roads) in the urban habitat of Anchorage and rural habitat on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska. We found evidence of a recent genetic subdivision among moose in Anchorage that corresponds to a major highway and associated infrastructure. This subdivision is most likely due to restrictions in gene flow due to alterations to the highway (e.g. moose-resistant fencing with one-way gates) and a significant increase in traffic volume over the past 30 years; genetic subdivision was not detected on the Kenai Peninsula in an area not bisected by a major highway. This study illustrates that anthropogenic barriers can substructure wildlife populations within a few generations and highlights the value of genetic assessments to determine the effects on connectivity among habitat patches in conjunction with behavioral and ecological data.

The A(H7N2) virus also spread to an attending veterinarian. In response, 500 cats were transferred from these shelters to a temporary quarantine facility for continued monitoring and treatment.
   ObjectivesThe objective of this study was to assess the occupational risk of A(H7N2) exposure among emergency response workers at the feline quarantine facility.
   MethodsAerosol and surface samples were collected from inside and outside the isolation zones of the quarantine facility. Samples were screened for A(H7N2) by quantitative RT-PCR and analyzed in embryonated chicken eggs for infectious virus.
   ResultsH7N2 virus was detected by RT-PCR in 28 of 29 aerosol samples collected in the high-risk isolation (hot) zone with 70.9% on particles with aerodynamic diameters >4m, 27.7% in 1-4m, and 1.4% in <1m. Seventeen of 22 surface samples from the high-risk isolation zone were also H7N2 positive with an average M1 copy number of 1.3x10(3). Passage of aerosol and surface samples in eggs confirmed that infectious virus was present throughout the high-risk zones in the quarantine facility.
   ConclusionsBy measuring particle size, distribution, and infectivity, our study suggests that the A(H7N2) virus had the potential to spread by airborne transmission and/or direct contact with viral-laden fomites. These results warranted continued A(H7N2) surveillance and transmission-based precautions during the treatment and care of infected cats.

AB  - With increasing road encroachment, habitat fragmentation by transport infrastructures has been a serious threat for European biodiversity. Areas with no roads or little traffic ("roadless and low-traffic areas") represent relatively undisturbed natural habitats and functioning ecosystems. They provide many benefits for biodiversity and human societies (e.g., landscape connectivity, barrier against pests and invasions, ecosystem services). Roadless and low-traffic areas, with a lower level of anthropogenic disturbances, are of special relevance in Europe because of their rarity and, in the context of climate change, because of their contribution to higher resilience and buffering capacity within landscape ecosystems. An analysis of European legal instruments illustrates that, although most laws aimed at protecting targets which are inherent to fragmentation, like connectivity, ecosystem processes or integrity, roadless areas are widely neglected as a legal target. A case study in Germany underlines this finding. Although the Natura 2000 network covers a significant proportion of the country (16%), Natura 2000 sites are highly fragmented and most low-traffic areas (75%) lie unprotected outside this network. This proportion is even higher for the old Federal States (western Germany), where only 20% of the low-traffic areas are protected. We propose that the few remaining roadless and low-traffic areas in Europe should be an important focus of conservation efforts; they should be urgently inventoried, included more explicitly in the law and accounted for in transport and urban planning. Considering them as complementary conservation targets would represent a concrete step towards the strengthening and adaptation of the Natura 2000 network to climate change.

AB  - This study examined the genetic diversity of small-spored Alternaria species in the southwest desert of the USA by sampling 552 isolates from different habitats (soil and plant debris) in different locations (urban and an undisturbed desert). To estimate the genetic diversity, Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting analysis was performed for all isolates. Strains representative of the sampled genotypic diversity (n = 125) were further characterized according their sporulation pattern and the capability to produce allergens. Morphological characterization assigned the majority of the strains to the Alternaria alternata and Alternaria tenuissima morpho-groups with only two isolates assigned to the Alternaria arborescens morpho-group. AFLP fingerprinting differentiated the A. arborescens morpho-groups, but could not distinguish between the A. altemata and A. tenuissima morpho-groups. Western blot analysis showed that a large number of allergenic proteins were produced by strains. These proteins were not specific for any morpho-group nor source of isolation. A hierarchical analysis of molecular variance was performed on the AFLP data to quantify molecular variation and partition this variation among sampled locations and habitat. No statistically significant differentiation among locations and habitat was detected indicating a lack of population structure across environments. (C) 2017 British Mycological Society.

AB  - This study documents the distribution of the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile), a well known invader of urban and agricultural ecosystems, in a riparian corridor near San Luis Obispo, California. Sampling of the ant community was done using pitfall traps placed along transects that crossed three vegetation types found at the study site: (1) riparian woodland dominated by coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), and willow (Salix: spp.) (2) Hard chaparral dominated by scrub oak (Q. dumosa) and silk-tassel bush (Garrya sl.) (3) Coastal scrub dominated by black sage (Salvia mellifera), California sagebrush (Artemisia californica), and Yucca (Yucca whipplei). Linepithema humile has become well established throughout the lower reaches of the study site except in the chaparral vegetation. Ten species of native ants were found in the study area, but there was little to no correlation or cooccurrence between L. humile and native ant species. Total species diversity in areas where L. humile occurred was significantly less than in areas where L. humile was absent. These results suggest that invasion by L. humile is restricted by habitat type, and has significant negative impacts on native ant diversity.

AB  - Restingas are lowland sandy ecosystems located between mountain ranges and the sea. For living organisms in this ecosystem, restingas can be seen as habitats formed by islands of vegetation separated by a sandy matrix. These organisms are highly influenced by the environmental conditions and physical characteristics of the landscape, including size, connectivity and environmental heterogeneity. Given the recognized effectiveness of ants as bioindicators, this study uses these organisms as a model to assess how do the physical characteristics of a landscape influence the structures of ant communities. The study was carried out in the Parque das Dunas, Salvador - Bahia, Brazil. Within this park, four categories of vegetation islands (Small, Medium, Large and Continuous) were delimited, where the ant fauna was sampled and the forms of vegetal life were analyzed, using the Raunkiaer analysis. A total of 69 ant species were collected from 31 genera and six subfamilies. We found a positive relationship between ant richness and diversity of plant life forms (Shannon index). In general, there was a significant difference in the composition of ant species between the areas of continuous vegetation and the different vegetation islands. We conclude that there is a bottom up effect mediating the ant community associated with dune vegetation, where the local richness of ant species responds to vegetation heterogeneity.

AB  - Knowledge of habitat use by animals within urban-riparian corridors during the breeding season is important for conservation, yet remains understudied. We examined the bird community along an urban-riparian corridor through metropolitan Boise, Idaho and predicted that occupancy of individual species and species richness would be greater in forested areas than in urbanized areas. We surveyed birds throughout the summers of 2009 and 2010 and quantified the m(2) of each cover-type within 50-m, 100-m, and 200-m buffers surrounding each survey location using satellite imagery. Occupancy modeling revealed that eight of 14 species analyzed were positively associated with riparian forest, and no species avoided forest. Species richness was negatively associated with the amount of paved surface within 100 m of a survey site with richness declining by more than two species for every hectare of paved surface. Most associations with cover-types - especially riparian forest-were at >= 100 m. Therefore, the riparian forest within 100 m of a given site along an urban-riparian corridor should be the most important for maintaining species richness. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB  - We report on the development of 36 novel polymorphic microsatellite markers from the bar-shouldered skink, Ctenotus inornatus. Members in this genus account for up to 20 % of the diverse Australian lizard species. Microsatellite markers were developed to investigate island endemism amongst Kimberley islands taxa. We describe the diversity from 110 adult Ctenotus individuals. Overall, the markers produced between 9 to 40 alleles per locus and observed and expected heterozygosities of 74.6 and 95.7 %, respectively. Due to island endemism, habitat modification by introduced grazing mammals, some urban encroachment and changes in fire regime there has been fragmentation of its range. These microsatellite markers are an important tool for evaluating population genetic information and for prioritising populations for conservation management.

AB  - Wave- and current-protected shallows have been constructed in the heavily modified, urban River Spree to create a littoral habitat with reduced hydrodynamical disturbances by navigation. Five years after construction and an initial planting of various macrophytes, abiotic conditions were measured and the establishment of aquatic and riparian vegetation was assessed. This study aimed to quantify the effective reduction of hydrodynamic disturbances and to assess the rehabilitation of aquatic plants and the improvement of the macrophytes-based ecological status by means of the reference index (RI).
   Wave stress has been successfully reduced and a diverse, abundant community of aquatic and riparian plants developed resembling the vegetation of natural oxbows. Most of the planted species were still present after five years, and in addition, several new species became established. The aquatic plants at the rehabilitated site indicated a "good" ecological status and even the "high" status if planted species were excluded from the RI. In contrast, the control site remained largely unvegetated indicating a "bad" status.
   Abiotic conditions other than wave action confirmed low hydrological connectivity and the ecosystem-engineering capabilities of vegetation. Low oxygen saturation and the accumulation of organic material limit the habitat suitability for other biota. Principally, wave-protected shallows are well suited to improve aquatic macrophytes in urban waterways. They will be rapidly naturally colonized, while planting of macrophytes, especially of species typical for advanced stages of succession should be omitted. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A total of 305 ticks (21 larvae, 243 nymphs, 19 females and 22 males) were collected by flagging of vegetation in suburban woods of Pisarky Park (city of Brno) from July to October 2002. The midgut of each tick was dissected Out and transferred individually into BSK-H medium. After cultivation, all specimens were examined by dark-field microscopy (DFM) for the presence of borreliae. Out of 305 tick samples, 45 were (14.8%) DFM positive. The following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) then revealed 37 (12.1%) samples positive for the presence of Borrelia burgdolferi sensu Into DNA. All 37 samples were further analysed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method. PCR-R-FLP analysis revealed 14 strains of B. afzelii (37.8%), 15 strains of B. garinii (40.5%) and 2 strains of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (5.4%). Four samples (10.8%) showed a mixed population of these genospecies. Two samples produced atypical RFLP pattern which were detected by sequence analysis as B. valaisiana (5.4%). Isolation attempts resulted in 21 spirochaetal strains (including two stains of B. valaisiana). The results show the diversity of B. burgdorferi s.l. in tick population and refer the risk of infection by pathogenic borreliae in Brno.

AB  - The Cape Dwarf Chameleon, Bradypodion pumilum, is threatened by extensive habitat loss and transformation in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. As a result, the species exists as a collection of populations inhabiting an increasingly fragmented landscape within a critically endangered ecosystem. In this study we monitored microsatellite genetic variation in one of these populations of B. pumilum across a three-year period. From the results of a temporary site-vacancy of adult chameleons during the study, we anticipated a significant shift in microsatellite allele frequencies. Using data from eight highly polymorphic loci we detected differences in the allelic composition of chameleons inhabiting the study site between pre- and post-site-vacancy periods (AMOVA R-ST = 0.017; P = 0.019). Results suggest that recolonisation by immigrant chameleons, from an adjacent vegetation fragment connected to the study site by corridors, caused the recorded shifts in allelic frequencies. Pairwise tests of year by year comparisons revealed significant shifts in allelic frequencies between years one and two and between one and three, but not between years two and three. Our findings highlight the susceptibility of small vertebrates to stochastic changes in the allelic composition of populations in a fragmented landscape, and can be useful for the development of biodiversity management in an increasingly fragmented habitat mosaic.

AB  - Given widespread concerns over human-mediated bee declines in abundance and species richness, conservation efforts are increasingly focused on maintaining natural habitats to support bee diversity in otherwise resource-poor environments. However, natural habitat patches can vary in composition, impacting landscape-level heterogeneity and affecting plant-pollinator interactions. Plant-pollinator networks, especially those based on pollen loads, can provide valuable insight into mutualistic relationships, such as revealing the degree of pollination specialization in a community; yet, local and landscape drivers of these network indices remain understudied within urbanizing landscapes. Beyond networks, analyzing pollen collection can reveal key information about species-level pollen preferences, providing plant restoration information for urban ecosystems. Through bee collection, vegetation surveys, and pollen load identification across similar to 350 km of urban habitat, we studied the impact of local and landscape-level management on plant-pollinator networks. We also quantified pollinator preferences for plants within urban grasslands. Bees exhibited higher foraging specialization with increasing habitat heterogeneity and visited fewer flowering species (decreased generality) with increasing semi-natural habitat cover. We also found strong pollinator species-specific flower foraging preferences, particularly for Asteraceae plants. We posit that maintaining native forbs and supporting landscape-level natural habitat cover and heterogeneity can provide pollinators with critical food resources across urbanizing ecosystems.

AB  - Northern yellow bats (Dasypterus intermedius) are tree-roosting bats in the family Vespertilionidae comprised of two subspecies: D. intermedius intermedius and D. intermedius floridanus. The two subspecies are thought to be geographically separated. Due to their cryptic morphology, this hypothesis has never been tested and can benefit from being examined within a molecular framework. In this study, mitochondrial sequence data from 38 D. intermedius and nuclear sequence data from 14 D. intermedius from across their range were used to test the hypothesis that genetically defined groups correspond geographically with the two morphologically defined subspecies. Although high levels of divergence of the mitochondrial sequence (11.6%) suggest genetically distinct clusters sympatric in southern Texas, no genetic structure was recovered with the nuclear marker. Moreover, the mitochondrial sequence data recovered a paraphyletic relationship between the two subspecies of D. intermedius with the Cuban yellow bat (D. insularis), whereas no such paraphyly was recovered from analysis of the nuclear marker. Divergence time based on analyses of mitochondrial sequence for the two subspecies was approximately 5.5 Ma. The patterns observed are hypothesized to be the result of past isolation of lineages and secondary contact that is currently contributing to gene flow.

AB  - The wetlands of 21 countries and territories of the Pacific Islands region are reviewed: American Samoa, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Caledonia, Niue, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Wallis and Futuna. The regions' wetlands are classified into seven systems: coral reefs, seagrass beds, mangrove swamps, riverine, lacustrine, freshwater swamp forests and marshes. The diversity of species in each of these groups is at near global maxima at the west of the region, with decline towards the east with increasing isolation, and decreasing island size and age. The community structure is unique in each country, and many have endemic species with the habitat isolation that epitomises this island region. There remain, however, some serious gaps in basic inventory, particularly in freshwater biodiversity. Threats to wetlands include introduced freshwater species, loss of wetlands adjacent to urban growth, downstream effects of mining and land clearance, and over-use of mangrove, seagrass and coral reef resources by predominant subsistence economies that remain in this region. Only five countries are signatories to the Ramsar convention on wetlands, and this only recently with seven sites. Wetland managers have identified the need for community education, baseline surveys and monitoring, better legislation and policy for wetland management, and improved capacity of local communities to allow the wise use of their wetlands.

AB  - Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common causative agent of cryptococcosis worldwide. Although this fungus has been isolated from a variety of organic substrates, several studies suggest that hollow trees constitute an important natural niche for C. neoformans. A previously surveyed hollow of a living pink shower tree (Cassia grandis) positive for C. neoformans in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was chosen for further investigation. Odontomachus bauri ants (trap-jaw ants) found inside the hollow were collected for evaluation as possible carriers of Cryptococcus spp. Two out of 10 ants were found to carry phenoloxidase-positive colonies identified as C. neoformans molecular types VNI and VNII. The ants may have acted as a mechanical vector of C. neoformans and possibly contributed to the dispersal of the fungi from one substrate to another. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the association of C. neoformans with ants of the genus Odontomachus.

AB  - We reviewed literature describing the potential for freshwater anthropogenic waterbodies to act as refuges from disturbance. We identified research related to the refuge potential of a wide range of waterbodies, using waterbody names as keywords along with 'artificial' and 'freshwater'. Potential freshwater anthropogenic refuges were more often standing than running waters. Agricultural ponds, rural and urban drainage ditches and transport canals were the most diverse for all aquatic taxa, whereas irrigation infrastructure was least diverse. Comparatively little is known about the refuge role of fire dams, urban artificial ponds, golf course lakes, disused industrial ponds and retaining walls. Local-scale attributes associated with high biodiversity were: presence of macrophytes (for animals), absence of fish (for amphibians, invertebrates), natural bed materials and hydroperiod (all biota). Landscape variables associated with high biodiversity were proximity to and connectivity with other waterbodies and to natural terrestrial vegetation. Moderate levels of management intervention were also associated with higher biodiversity. Many knowledge gaps about the function of anthropogenic refuges within landscapes exist and require further research. One of the most important limitations to the provision of refuges for freshwater biodiversity by anthropogenic waterbodies is the lack of recognition of their actual or potential biodiversity value. Anthropogenic waterbodies need to be recognised for their potential to support biodiversity conservation and climate change adaptation for freshwater species, while being managed to prevent the spread of invasive species.

AB  - Birds are considered a good model for indicators of biodiversity response to habitat variations, as they are very sensitive to environmental change. However, continuous observations of habitat alterations from undisturbed landscapes to human-dominated ones, as well as the associated effects on bird biodiversity, are lacking. In this study, New Jiangwan Town in Shanghai, China was selected to illustrate the response of bird species, and thus biodiversity, to habitat loss and fragmentation. land use/land cover (LULC) data and bird records from 2002 to 2013 were collected and analyzed. The results suggested that, due to urban sprawl, the area of wetland and shrub land had dropped by 82.4% and 87.3% by the end of 2013. Four different urbanization stages were identified in terms of the spatio-temporal variations in the landscape. To measure bird biodiversity, species richness and relative abundance were calculated, and they could account for the overall trend in biodiversity but might mask the process of species replacement. As an indicator of biodiversity accounting, the mean species abundance (MSA) of the original species would not include exotic or invasive species in its calculation, and its value decreased from 100% to 76.8% to 52.2% to 24.5% in the four corresponding stages. Finally, suggested by redundant analysis, the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on bird biodiversity differed in various bird communities, and the area and connectivity of wetlands were the most significant variables. Our findings could provide important information to inform bird biodiversity protection and habitat restoration. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Burial sites shaped in accordance with the traditions cherished by the local community are a foundation of cultural identity and valuable components of the cultural landscape. The aim of this research was to assess the implications of cemeteries for the biodiversity of local flora, taking account of cemeteries' size, usage and location. The field research was conducted in the Rortocze region, which is among the less transformed areas of Europe, having a large proportion of natural and semi-natural landscapes. The investigated area covered 1314 km(2) and included 78 cemeteries. We collected 5004 floristic samples, which form the basis of this study. The cemetery flora is rich (523 species, 75 families) and diverse (Marczewski-Steinhaus J-index below 40 %) and displays a high level of naturalness (60-80 % of all species are native). Cluster Analysis and Principal Component Analysis based on extensive species characteristics, such as species number and cover, their origin, life-form and socio-ecological group, indicates that the use or non-use of burial sites is the most important factor shaping local flora. Isolation due to location in a protected area is ranked second in importance, while cemetery size is the least important factor. We discuss the importance of cemeteries for the protection of local biodiversity.

AB  - Effective spatial classification of freshwater biodiversity remains a worldwide conservation challenge. The isolating nature of catchment boundaries over evolutionary timescales makes them potentially important in defining natural units for biodiversity management. We sought to clarify biogeographical relationships amongst drainages within Australia's biodiverse mid-eastern coastal region (Fitzroy, Burnett, and Mary Catchments) where freshwater communities face considerable urban pressure, using a locally endemic riverine specialist, the white-throated snapping turtle, Elseya albagula. Mitochondrial and nuclear microsatellite data sets were employed to investigate past and present influences on population connectivity and to identify units for management. Populations within catchments were largely well connected genetically. However, the Fitzroy Catchment contained a distinct genetic lineage, deeply divergent from a second lineage present across the Burnett and Mary Catchments. The two lineages can be considered evolutionarily significant units that reflect historical isolation of the Fitzroy and recent coalescence of the Burnett-Mary Catchments during lowered Pleistocene sea levels. Congruence with geological evidence and patterns reported for fish and macroinvertebrates supports a shared biogeographical history of a diverse regional biota. This work highlights the need for better spatial classification of freshwater biodiversity at local as well as regional scales, including recognition of potentially cryptic diversity amongst individual river drainages.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London

AB  - Sea Buckthorn population from Ujpest Nature Reserve, the only one assumed to be native in Hungary sustains at the periphery of Budapest city on the sandy substrate deposited by the Danube river. The study aims to characterize the gene stock preserved on this small edaphic habitat by comparing with the genetic material of planted specimens of known origin used in horticultural and gardening practice. Fragment length variations of seven nuclear microsatellite markers were evaluated and a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on sequence variation of an intron from nuclear gene encoding the chalcone synthase enzyme. Gender rate was evaluated by female specific SCAR marker. Microsatellite analysis pointed out the extremely low variation of the natural sea buckthorn population from Ujpest Nature Reserve compared to the cultivated specimens, while the phylogenetic tree revealed that the natural population belongs to the genetic lineage distributed mostly in Western and Middle-Europe, and in Romania, region, which has strong links to the Balkan and the Black Sea. The analysis clearly separated the genetic material of the native Ujpest population from the planted individuals from the vicinity that proved to be of allochthonous origin. The HrX2 SCAR marker revealed the dominance of the males (1:1.42). The study provides support for the autochthonous origin of the Hungarian remnant population being in reproductive isolation that suggest for its long persistence and relict status. Ex situ conservation and nature protection measures are highly recommended to maintain one of the last native sea buckthorn populations of the Pannonian region.

AB  - The study presents results of habitat creation and riparian vegetation recovery in artificial oxbow lakes in urbanized area within the large river valley. The investigation of open water, rush and wet meadows flora and vegetation in three ponds located in the city centre of Opole was conducted in years 2001-2013. Oxbow lakes were constructed as a compensation measure and no vegetation was transplanted into the ponds on purpose. 13-years observation showed that (1) the red-listed species are able to spontaneous reoccurrence after habitat restoration, but they can thrive only in first years of oxbow lakes recolonisation process, (2) there are some restoration constraints, especially in relation to Phragmites australis and Nuphar lutea expansion, but alien species invasions were insignificant and (3) the species number and vegetation cover was constantly increasing during the recolonisation process in recreated oxbow lakes. The dynamic of vegetation was considerable, especially in first 6 years of experiment when the significant increase in diversity and richness of native plant species was observed. After that time, the increasing expansion of P. australis and N. lutea was noted causing the decline of several species and vegetation types. So, restoring just the environmental conditions may be sufficient for a limited period of time only. Strong disturbances, much intense that moderate inundations, imitating disastrous flooding within the valley each 10-13 years are need to maintain the ecological niches for river corridor and riparian species.

AB  - 1. Aquatic ecosystems are degraded by a variety of pressures as a result of the growing human population. Global-scale impacts include homogenization of biological communities, removal of top predators and ecosystem engineers, chemical pollution by excess nutrients and contaminants as well as deteriorating structural diversity, connectivity and process dynamics. There is a pressing societal need to reverse the decline in biodiversity and replace lost ecosystem functioning and services in aquatic ecosystems by enabling natural recovery or by active restoration.
   2. Common concepts and approaches for conservation, recovery and restoration in freshwater and marine ecosystems, aided by recent advances in ecological theory, include decision criteria on priorities for conservation, harnessing natural recovery by cessation of impacts, restoring connectivity and meso-habitat diversity as well as the geomorphological structural template including hydrodynamic processes. Re-oligotrophication at catchment or regional sea-scale benefits from integrating freshwater and marine restoration. Species or assemblages that convey biogenic structure or act as ecosystem engineers and keystone species should be given priority. Top-down control can be reinstated in closed systems.
   3. Differences between freshwater and marine ecosystems include the greater spatial restriction of many species in fresh water, the importance of rooted vegetation and insects in freshwater, and the much greater dispersal and connectivity in marine systems. These differences dictate different approaches, with more scope for active restoration work in fresh water and harnessing natural recovery in marine systems.
   4. Restoration schemes need clearly defined target states. They should generally take a process-oriented and stepwise adaptive management approach judging success against reference or control sites. Societal and political expectations need to be managed and restoration schemes should not promise too much. Even minor rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems can put back some biodiversity and key services. Sometimes 'Ersatz'-ecosystems are better than nothing and the best that can be achieved, especially in urban settings. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Accurate information on, and human interpretation of, urban land cover using satellite-derived sensor imagery is critical given the intricate nature and niches of socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental factors occurring at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Detailed knowledge of urban land and their changing pattern over time periods associated with ecological risk is, however, required for the best use of critical land and its environmental resources. Interest in this topic has increased recently, driven by a surge in the use of open-source computing software, satellite-derived imagery, and improved classification algorithms. Using the machine learning algorithm Random Forest, combined with multi-date Landsat imagery, we classified eight periods of land cover maps with up-to-date spatial and temporal information of urban land between the period of 1972 and 2015 for the mega-urban region of greater Dhaka in Bangladesh. Random Foresta non-parametric ensemble classifier-has shown a quantum increase in satellite-derived image classification accuracy due to its outperformance over traditional approaches, e.g., Maximum Likelihood. Employing Random Forest as an image classification approach for this study with independent cross-validation techniques, we obtained high classification accuracy, user and producer accuracy. Our overall classification accuracy ranges were between 85% and 97% with kappa values between 0.81 and 0.94. The area statistics derived from the thematic land cover map show that the built-up area in the 43-year study period expanded quickly, from 35 km(2) in 1972 to 378 km(2) in 2015, with a net increase rate of approximately 980% and an average annual growth rate of 6%. This growth rate, however, was higher in peripheral areas, with a 2903% increase and an annual expansion rate of 8%, compared to a 460% increase with an annual growth rate of 4% in the core city area (Dhaka City Corporation). This huge urban expansion took place in the north, northwest, and southwest regions of Dhaka, transforming areas that were previously agricultural land, vegetation cover, wetland, and water bodies. The main factors driving the city towards northern corridors include flood-free higher land, the availability of a transportation network, and the agglomeration of manufacturing-based employment centers. The resulting thematic map and spatial information produced from this study therefore serve to facilitate a detailed understanding of urban growth dynamics and land cover change patterns in the mega-urban region of Dhaka, Bangladesh.

AB  - Anthropogenic environmental change is often implicated in the emergence of new zoonoses from wildlife; however, there is little mechanistic understanding of these causal links. Here, we examine the transmission dynamics of an emerging zoonotic paramyxovirus, Hendra virus (HeV), in its endemic host, Australian Pteropus bats (fruit bats or flying foxes). HeV is a biosecurity level 4 (BSL-4) pathogen, with a high case-fatality rate in humans and horses. With models parametrized from field and laboratory data, we explore a set of probable contributory mechanisms that explain the spatial and temporal pattern of HeV emergence; including urban habituation and decreased migration-two widely observed changes in flying fox ecology that result from anthropogenic transformation of bat habitat in Australia. Urban habituation increases the number of flying foxes in contact with human and domestic animal populations, and our models suggest that, in addition, decreased bat migratory behaviour could lead to a decline in population immunity, giving rise to more intense outbreaks after local viral reintroduction. Ten of the 14 known HeV outbreaks occurred near urbanized or sedentary flying fox populations, supporting these predictions. We also demonstrate that by incorporating waning maternal immunity into our models, the peak modelled prevalence coincides with the peak annual spill-over hazard for HeV. These results provide the first detailed mechanistic framework for understanding the sporadic temporal pattern of HeV emergence, and of the urban/peri-urban distribution of HeV outbreaks in horses and people.

AB  - Unsheltered homelessness in the United States forces hundreds of thousands of people to sleep, eat, and live in the public sphere. Urban parks often become temporary homes for individuals facing poverty, substance addiction, mental illness, servitude, and other social concerns. For individuals facing homelessness, these parks are primary sources of stability in often desperate situations. Residing in parks and protected areas, however, raises concerns for the residents in terms of personal health and safety, and raises other concerns for public health, public safety, and environmental impacts. This research considers the relationships between unsheltered homelessness and perspectives of local environmental conditions. Surveys were completed by recreational users (n = 332) of City Creek Canyon, a riparian corridor in Salt Lake City, Utah, to understand visitors' perspectives of the social and environmental impacts of unsheltered homelessness in the area. Results indicate an overall awareness of homelessness in the area, and a simultaneous indication that homelessness does little to affect either recreational behavior or perceived environmental impacts to the water, wildlife, or overall ecological functioning. Implications from this research illuminate that common responses of forced displacement of individuals facing homelessness from parks-by law enforcement, health department, or park management officials-represent not only social justice concerns but also environmental justice concerns for those facing homelessness. Similar to "right to the city" movements, access to environmental resources, in this case a place to live, represents an environmental justice issue for some of the most marginalized members of our communities.

AB  - constitute one of the richest and most endangered groups in Mexico; however, their diversity and threat factors at the regional level remain little known in many parts of the country, including in protected areas. We analyzed amphibian diversity of the Ejido Tierra y Libertad, Municipality of Jiquipilas, Chiapas, Mexico, 40% of which occurs within the La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve (Reserva de la Biosfera La Sepultura, or REBISE). We conducted fieldwork from January 2016 to April 2020, including 980 person-hours of systematic sampling across 11 transects spanning different habitat types. We documented 20 amphibian species, including the first record of the Yellowbelly Mushroomtongue Salamander (Bolitoglossa flaviventris) for the REBISE. Seven of these amphibian species are included in some risk category: three in the NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010 of the Mexican federal government, two in the Red List of Threatened Species of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and two categorized in both. The Common Leaf-litter Frog (Craugastor loki) was the most abundant species, and together with four other anuran species, constituted 82.1% of the total abundance observed. Inter-transect faunal similarity was generally associated with proximity, forest corridor connectivity, and the presence of water. Conserved Semi-Deciduous Forest had the highest alpha diversity, but somewhat surprisingly, urban and some disturbed habitats had the highest species richness. Pasture was the least rich and diverse habitat, however, so we discuss the consequences of ongoing expansion of pastures on amphibian populations. We propose conservation measures intended to promote both amphibian diversity and human health.

AB  - Impervious surfaces in modern cities can be used for revegetation. However, the ecological quality of below-ground ecosystem components and constrained soil space are crucial factors that limit habitat restoration. The long-term development of Bonsai (Penjing) trees has resulted in mature theories and techniques that suggest optimal root-canopy ratios. Considering the similarities with constrained pot landscapes, some "enlightenments", or key findings, derived from Bonsai theory can also be applied to urban special revegetation (USR). In this study, we analyzed the root-shoot correlations of the different styles of Bonsai trees and provide and assessment on the relationships between Bonsai theory and USR. Using an on-site survey and biomass experiment, nine "enlightenments" from Bonsai theory are proposed: positive root-canopy correlation, environmental stress increasing the root-shoot ratio, connectivity of the tree bark "water line", rebalancing after disruption of the root-canopy balance, precise root and canopy design, artificial auxiliary fixation of the root, control of growth, horticultural reshaping skills, and plant diversity. In particular, for the successful establishment of urban rebuilt environments, it is essential to understand the mechanisms of root-canopy correlations. Therefore, we suggest that the four main types of USR (green roofs, vertical greening, container gardening, and street trees) should follow the core principle based on the root-shoot balance to effectively design both the root and canopy.

AB  - The power consumption and connectivity of mobile nodes to the network are two essential issues in smart cities. In this paper, we have proposed a decentralized approach for mobility management of mobile nodes in smart cities. We propose a customized communication protocol compliant with 6LoWPAN along with the scheme that consumes less power regarding previous solutions. The proposed approach organizes static nodes as a tree for efficient routing, automatic addressing, and handling movement of mobile nodes. The proposed approach has a hybrid data transmission capability by proactively choosing multi-hop or single-hop routing to reduce power consumption of mobile nodes. It is evaluated based on different factors. The results show the superiority of the approach compared with the previous works. The promising analytical results manifest the higher performance (about 10% compared to the best scheme) of the proposed approach specifically in reducing the power consumption of mobile nodes.

AB  - Continental Australia and Tasmania cover a wide range of latitudes from tropical regions in the north through the arid and semi-arid core to cool temperate regions further south. Vegetation is equally varied and because of this and the continent's isolation during the Tertiary, floral and faunal diversity and endemism are very high. Europeans arrived 200 years ago and since that time have markedly modified the landscape by clearing and changing the vegetation, predominantly for agricultural and urban development. Both accidental and deliberate introductions of stock, weeds, crops, trees and pasture plants have also caused enormous changes to Australian environments. In the last few years the deleterious effects of some of these changes have been realised, for example the extent of soil degradation. Measures are being taken to rectify problems and techniques are being introduced which benefit both primary producers and other users of the land and also nature conservation. Some of these measures for a more sustainable use of the land are illustrated here for four vegetation types, eucalypt woodland, native forests, grasslands and arid systems. They include adopting native tree species for timber production and native grasses for pasture, retention of native vegetation and paying attention to conservation of invertebrates in Parks and Reserves.

AB  - Sound pressure levels (SPL) in dB are the traditional noise measurement, but dB measures alone limit characterization of the complex urban acoustic environment. The aim of this paper is to apply alpha and beta ecoacoustic indices from soundscape ecology at two contrasting locations corresponding to an urban mixed-use corridor and a deciduous forest. Twenty acoustic indices and mean dB(A) are calculated from 2,798 three-minute recordings taken every 26 min over a 28-day period. Acoustic indices are summarized by case with mean hour-of-day plots and 7- and 28-day time series plots to identify temporal patterns. Correlations to assess index relationships for each case separately and combined are presented. Acoustic indices provide complimentary information beyond SPL measures alone, especially in frequency and temporal domains, useful to identify patterns in the acoustic environment. Correlation between specific multiple indices at individual locations is a promising approach to identification of anthrophonic and biophonic dominated sonotopes. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - In land-scarce cities, high-rise apartment buildings may provide vertical spaces for natural-light home gardening along corridors, rooftops, balconies as well as facades. The vertical space can improve not only urban envi-ronmental sustainability but also food security. Using an experimental approach, we investigated the food production potential of a high-rise public housing apartment building based on different gardening systems, food crops, and sunlight availability. A gardening prototype system for building corridors was shown to increase the unit area yield of corridor gardening by fivefold compared to a commercial trough planter system. Additionally, this commercial trough planter system was mainly for leafy vegetable production, whereas the gardening pro-totype system for corridors is also suitable for climbing crops, such as legumes and cucurbits. Nevertheless, because of the limited space along corridors of the apartment building and the relatively low-light levels on average, corridor gardening was estimated to meet only 0.5 % of the demand for vegetables of the residents living in the apartment building. Rooftop gardening with shallow growing medium (depth < 15 cm) was esti-mated to meet 3 % of demand, and facade gardening 43 %, given the larger space available. Although the vegetable production potential in this study was estimated based on a particular typology of public housing apartment buildings in Singapore, our results showed that vegetable production in public housing apartment buildings is feasible, and home gardening can produce a substantial amount of vegetables for consumption if well deployed. Governments of highly urbanized cities may wish to invest in better home garden designs for high-rise public housing apartment buildings and encourage residents' participation in home gardening, which would increase high-rise greenery coverage and improve urban food system resilience. Future studies should also investigate the environmental sustainability and food safety aspects of home gardening in highly urbanized cities.

AB  - The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the relationship between occurrence of the serotypes of the Cryptococcus neoformans species complex in tree samples and the climatic conditions registered during samplings in four cities of Colombia, between 1992 and 2004, by means of a logistic regression model and lagged Pearson correlations. During 97 collection dates, 8220 samples from different tree species were taken, of which 2.63% were positive: 56.5% yielded serotype B, 24.7% serotype C and 18.8% serotype A isolates. The prevalence of the serotypes varied among the cities. The results suggest that environmental climatic conditions, mainly humidity, temperature, evaporation and solar radiation, can affect the occurrence of the different serotypes in trees in a differential manner. These different climatic tolerances were reflected in the geographic distribution of the serotypes in Colombia. The climatic conditions for 15 days before the sampling date were correlated with positive or negative isolation of the different serotypes.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is particularly severe in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of Texas, where greater than 90% of the native wetland habitat has been replaced by agriculture and urban development. The Brownsville Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas insperata), a rare subspecies of the Common Yellowthroat restricted to this area, is a good model for studying the effects of this extensive fragmentation on avian genetics and ecology. In this study, three hypotheses addressing genetics and habitat fragmentation were tested: (1) the density of Brownsville Yellowthroats is greatest along the Rio Grande rather than away from the river; (2) individuals found on or near the Rio Grande are more closely related than individuals farther away; and (3) a source-sink metapopulation model is the best fit to describe the population dynamics of the subspecies. We used 15 microsatellites to examine the genetic diversity of 128 individuals from Cameron and Hidalgo Counties (Texas) sampled during 2008-2009. The densities of yellowthroats at sites near the Rio Grande were not significantly different from densities at sites farther from the river. Genetic analysis indicated that individuals were as related to each other as would be expected in distant relatives and indicated the presence of a single, admixed population. The results suggest that the Brownsville Common Yellowthroat is able to move freely among isolated habitat patches and that wetlands along the Rio Grande do not act as an exclusive corridor for this species.

AB  - The results of a study on the evolution of the vegetation in a reclaimed area contaminated with dioxin are presented. Phytosociological releves were carried out in 1992-1993 and in 1998 in 25 easily recognizable points. Elaborations on the species number, life forms, chorological types, vertical structure and ecological indicator values were realized.
   The most outstanding results regard the biodiversity, with floristic changes; the ecology, with increase in the ecological diversity, and the structure, with increase in the cover and complexity.
   The increase in the shrub layer is a clear indication of structural evolution. If, on the one hand, the vegetation structure indicates evolution of the system, on the other, the present floristic composition is still the result of the starting conditions. The observed floristic changes arise from autogenic floristic readjustments because there are no allogenic floristic increases. This is due to the isolation of the area which is completely surrounded by human sites, mostly of an urban type. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urbanization results in a suite of harmful effects to streams, including removal or degradation of riparian vegetation. Many stream-restoration programs address this by adding plants, with limited quantitative knowledge about vegetation dynamics already occurring within the stream corridor. This project examined natural plant establishment along an urbanized stream channel in Syracuse, NY. It had three objectives: first, to relate plant establishment along an urban stream gradient to substrate condition; second, to quantify seeds dormant in the soil at those same sites; and third, to indicate what passive revegetation responses might occur to various treatments along a rural-to-urban gradient. Three sites were selected along such a gradient on Onondaga Creek, near Syracuse, NY. Vegetation plots were established at each site to assess plant germination and establishment under substrate conditions designed to mimic restoration interventions. We also conducted a seedbank study using soil cores collected from these sites. Plant communities were dominated by grasses and forbs. Numbers of alien species increased from 34% at more rural sites to 51% at more urban sites. Seedlings of native riparian trees nonetheless germinated at all three sites along the gradient. Recruitment of native riparian trees (especially Populus deltoides [Eastern Cottonwood], Fraxinus pennsylvanica [Green Ash], and Acer negundo [Boxelder]) exceeded non-native and invasive ones. The riparian seedbank showed disproportionate dominance by herbaceous plants (95.5% of individuals) at all locations surveyed, and invasive species were common (about 25% of all germinants). This study shows some potential for natural regeneration of native trees, but also found a significant source of invasive plants in the soil seedbank that could reduce restoration success. Notably, the study recorded the presence of 16 bryophyte taxa, and the common ones were those typically associated with disturbances.

AB  - Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are important agents of meningoencephalitis in humans in the city of Belem. This clinical data suggests that the region may be a highly endemic area for the pathogenic Cryptococcus species within the state of Para (PA), Northern Brazil. Preliminary analysis of 11 environmental samples from the city of Belem showed two positive locations, including a hollow of a kassod tree (Senna siamea) colonized simultaneously by C. gattii molecular type VGII and C. neoformans molecular type VNI, and a birdcage in a commercial aviary positive for C. neoformans, molecular type VNI. This is the first evidence of an environmental occurrence of molecular types VNI and VGII in PA.

AB  - One of the most important changes taking place in drylands worldwide is the increase of the cover and dominance of shrubs in areas formerly devoid of them (shrub encroachment). A large body of research has evaluated the causes and consequences of shrub encroachment for both ecosystem structure and functioning. However, there are virtually no studies evaluating how shrub encroachment affects the ability of ecosystems to maintain multiple functions and services simultaneously (multifunctionality). We aimed to do so by gathering data from ten ecosystem functions linked to the maintenance of primary production and nutrient cycling and storage (organic C, activity of beta-glucosidase, pentoses, hexoses, total N, total available N, amino acids, proteins, available inorganic P, and phosphatase activity), and summarizing them in a multifunctionality index (M). We assessed how climate, species richness, anthropic factors (distance to the nearest town, sandy and asphalted road, and human population in the nearest town at several historical periods) and encroachment by sprouting shrubs impacted both the functions in isolation and M along a regional (ca. 350 km) gradient in Mediterranean grasslands and shrublands dominated by a non-sprouting shrub. Values of M were higher in those grasslands and shrublands containing sprouting shrubs (43 and 62%, respectively). A similar response was found when analyzing the different functions in isolation, as encroachment by sprouting shrubs increased functions by 2-80% compared to unencroached areas. Encroachment was the main driver of changes in M along the regional gradient evaluated, followed by anthropic factors and species richness. Climate had little effects on M in comparison to the other factors studied. Similar responses were observed when evaluating the functions in isolation. Overall, our results showed that M was higher at sites with higher sprouting shrub cover, longer distance to roads and higher perennial plant species richness. Our study is the first documenting that ecosystem multifunctionality in shrublands is enhanced by encroaching shrubs differing in size and leaf attributes. Our findings reinforce the idea that encroachment effects on ecosystem functioning cannot be generalized, and that are largely dependent on the traits of the encroaching shrub relative to those of the species being replaced.

AB  - Urbanization may have a large affect on biodiversity patterns by enhancing biological invasions. Urban habitats harbour high numbers of introduced plant species and may function as starting points for invasions along urban-rural gradients. As information on underlying mechanisms is critical for managing biological invasions, we test the role of rivers as dispersal corridors for primarily wind-dispersed ornamentals. We released tagged fruits of three invasive tree species in the Spree River (Berlin, Germany) and directly observed the fate of the floating samaras. The number of floating samaras declined exponentially with distance from the release point. A quarter floated 1200 m within 3 h. Despite marked differences in fruit morphology, there were no interspecific differences in floating capacity. We showed hydrochory to be an effective dispersal agent in wind-dispersed tree species, extending wind-related transport distances by several times. In this way, rivers are expected to link urban propagule sources with natural habitats downstream. Our results suggest that planting native tree species along river corridors would help prevent invasion risks and contribute to implementing principles of ecological design in urban greenways and generally consider the importance of eradicating wind-dispersed invasive tree species in floodplains in early invasion stages to prevent further water-mediated dispersal.

AB  - This paper presents the first study of the benthic invertebrate assemblages of the upper section of the Paraguay River, a major tributary to the Pantanal wetland in Brazil. Thirty-eight sites were sampled along a 200 km section below the city of Caceres in November 2000. Sixty-nine species and morphospecies were identified, which were dominated by Oligochaeta and Chironomidae. Mean density of benthic invertebrates varied between 72 and 10 354 m(-2) in the meandering sector of the river, 3611-49629 m(-2) in the straight-transitional sectors, 682-5962 m(-2) in the floodplain lakes, and 1704-2208 m(-2) in floodplain channels. Highest densities were attained in sand-gravel sediments dominated by the psammophilous oligochaete Narapa bonettoi. The Shannon diversity index ranged from 0.75 to 2.08 and was highest in floodplain lakes. Statistical analysis (UPGMA and CCA) revealed that benthic assemblages in the floodplain habitats were clearly distinct from the riverine habitats. In the river channel, the habitats were distinguished by grain size while the floodplain habitats were mostly determined by current and silt-clay concentration (floodplain channels) or by organic matter concentration (floodplain lakes). Conservation efforts in the Upper Paraguay area should aim to maintain the flood pulse as a permanent source of spatial and temporal habitat heterogeneity. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Studies on spatial density dependence in parasitism have paid scarce attention to how changes in host density at different hierarchical scales could influence parasitism in an herbivore at a particular scale. Here, we evaluated if rates of parasitism per leaf (by the whole parasitic complex and by dominant species) of the specialist leaf miner Liriomyza commelinae (Diptera: Agromyzidae) respond to variations in host density at the leaf, plant patch and site levels in an urban setting. We used multi-level Bayesian models that incorporate the spatial hierarchy occurring in this system, as well as habitat factors previously found to have an effect on the L.commelinae parasitoid community in an urban context (patch size, patch isolation and urbanization level). According to the fitted model, overall parasitism rates decreased with increasing number of mines per leaf, being independent of host-density variations at patch and site level. Patch structure was found to have a strong effect on parasitism rates per leaf. The analysis of parasitism by parasitoid species separately showed consistent results with the response at community level. These results suggest that parasitism of the parasitoid community here studied would be sensitive to hierarchical cues related to the host at the leaf level and to the host habitat at the patch level.

AB  - Riparian vegetation constitutes a key element for the maintenance of fluvial ecosystems, especially for those that are surrounded by ur" Jan zones. The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition and variation of riparian vegetation in a stretch of the Santa Catarina river, over two cities of the Monterrey Metropolitan Area. For the analysis of the vegetation, sampling transects were established in a section of 15.65 km. The high stratum (shrub and tree plants) was analyzed using a Bray-Curtis ordering model and a dominance-diversity plot. The Jaccard similarity coefficient was used for the low stratum (herbaceous plants). In the high stratum, 16 families belonging to 25 genera and 28 species were recorded. The species with the highest number of individuals were Salix nigra, Leucaena leucocephala, Ricinus communis and Parkinsonia aculeata. The composition of the vegetation has a similarity level of intermediate to high. because the groups vary between 60 % to 71.53 %. In thelow stratum. 25 families. 53 genera and 60 species were recorded with a similarity level of low to intermediate, because the groups vary between 23 to 47 %. The species that were mostly registered in the low stratum were Cyperus involucratus in 7 sites, and Eragrostis mexicana, Heliantus annuus, Melinis repens, Polygonum pensylvanicum and Typha domingensis in six sites each one. The composition of the vegetation is in a secondary successional state, because the species with greater presence are exotic or invasive, such as Leucaena leucocephala and Ricinus communis for the high stratum and Cyperus involucratus, Typha aomingensis and Melinis repens for the low stratum.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Structure of Molecular Evolution of H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses in Vietnam
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - DIVERSITY
KW  - ORIGIN
AB  - Background: Vietnam is one of the countries most affected by outbreaks of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. First identified in Vietnam in poultry in 2001 and in humans in 2004, the virus has since caused 111 cases and 56 deaths in humans. In 2003/2004 H5N1 outbreaks, nearly the entire poultry population of Vietnam was culled. Our earlier study (Wan et al., 2008, PLoS ONE, 3(10): e3462) demonstrated that there have been at least six independent H5N1 introductions into Vietnam and there were nine newly emerged reassortants from 2001 to 2007 in Vietnam. H5N1 viruses in Vietnam cluster distinctly around Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. However, the nature of the relationship between genetic divergence and geographic patterns is still unclear.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we hypothesized that genetic distances between H5N1 viruses in Vietnam are correlated with geographic distances, as the result of distinct population and environment patterns along Vietnam's long north to south longitudinal extent. Based on this hypothesis, we combined spatial statistical methods with genetic analytic techniques and explicitly used geographic space to explore genetic evolution of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses at the sub-national scale in Vietnam. Our dataset consisted of 125 influenza viruses (with whole genome sets) isolated in Vietnam from 2003 to 2007. Our results document the significant effect of space and time on genetic evolution and the rise of two regional centers of genetic mixing by 2007. These findings give insight into processes underlying viral evolution and suggest that genetic differentiation is associated with the distance between concentrations of human and poultry populations around Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.
   Conclusions/Significance: The results show that genetic evolution of H5N1 viruses in Vietnamese domestic poultry is highly correlated with the location and spread of those viruses in geographic space. This correlation varies by scale, time, and gene, though a classic isolation by distance pattern is observed. This study is the first to characterize the geographic structure of influenza viral evolution at the sub-national scale in Vietnam and can shed light on how H5N1 HPAIVs evolve in certain geographic settings.

AB  - Urban parks and road greening are important components of primary gardens, and their plant communities are based on the ecology of different management and operation modes. Urban greening is the link connecting the city segment isolation green space, good road greening can not only achieve the effect of greening, beautification, but also play a role in purifying the air, reducing noise, reducing radiation heat, and protecting the road surface, to people's travel and life to create a safe, pleasant, comfortable, beautiful, and hygienic environment. In this paper, through the Karachi main road and parks greening geo-spatial survey found that it contains 32 tree species, of which 4 species of naked plants, quilt plants 28 species. Road green tree species have a low diameter level and are in their infancy. The tree species of road greening in each district are mainly trees, and the important value of trees is much higher than that of shrubs. The diversity index of green tree species in each district is low, and a few tree species in each district account for more than 50% of all trees. By measuring the light intensity, air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed of different road greening forms, the effects of different road greening forms on small climate, environmental comfort and air flow are analyzed, and the results show that the greening forms of roads with large vertical projection area on the road are the most obvious in reducing light intensity, reducing air temperature, and increasing relative humidity. Trees in the road vertical projection area of large road greening form so that the road environment is in a comfortable situation throughout the day, conducive to human health. Trees in the road above the vertical projection area of the road green form can better reduce the road near the surface temperature, but trees in the road vertical projection area of small road greening.

AB  - Background: Cryptococcosis is a systemic opportunistic mycosis, caused by Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii, which affects mainly the central nervous system of immunocompromised patients; no reports have been made on the isolation of the fungus from the environment of Popayan, Colombia.
   Aims: The main objective of this investigation was to determinate the incidence of C neoformans in the urban perimeter in the City of Popayan, Colombia.
   Methods: A total of 303 samples from droppings of Columba livia and Bubulcus ibis were collected between September 2012 and June 2013. The samples were processed by conventional techniques; identification of colonies was performed by biochemical tests, and molecular patterns were determined by PCR fingerprinting with the primer (GTG)(5) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the gene URA(5).
   Results: A total of 118 (38.94%) samples were positive for Cryptococcus in excreta of C. livia, and 361 strains belonging to Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii were isolated. From the latter, 99.2% corresponded to the molecular pattern VNI and 0.8% to VNII, with an increased occurrence (24.4%) at a temperature of 22.5 degrees C and a humidity of 60.8%. The excreta of B. ibis did not show the presence of the fungus.
   Conclusions: C livia excreta is a key environmental niche for C. neoformans var. grubii, type VNI, supporting growth and reproduction, and serving as a major source of infection for susceptible populations in Popayan. This represents the first report on the isolation of the agent of cryptococcosis from the environment in this region, with a significant prevalence in bird excreta.

AB  - Studies have suggested that the heterogeneity and arrangement of landscape structures are influential to the faunal biodiversity of environments. How does the landscape structure in agricultural landscape arrangements improve the functions of the natural ecosystem? Previous research has uncovered a great amount of information on the relationships between landscape structure and wildlife; however, for landscape designers and planners, such information is site-specific and has limited utilization. Hence, this study aimed to organize and categorize the relationships between environments and biodiversity and transfer this information into design principles in agricultural landscapes. This study attempted to integrate aspects of previous research into a systematic framework. The current study searched literature between 2007 and 2016 from the following journals: Landscape Ecology, Landscape and Urban Planning, and Journal of Applied Ecology. In all, this study collected 58 empirical studies of agricultural environments similar to that of Taiwan and revealed the valuable relationship between wildlife and agricultural environments. The outcomes reviewed from the literature were categorized by semi-natural elements and divided into six sub-categories: forests, hedgerows, grasslands, flowers, water, and heterogeneity of the natural landscape. The landscape attributes that were frequently discussed included patch number, patch area, connectivity, species richness, edge area, distance from semi-natural elements, and complexity. The landscape attributes formed by these elements were organized into a table as a checklist for designers' convenience. The checklist will help landscape planners and designers to create agricultural landscapes with integral ecosystems.

AB  - Hedge density, structure, and function vary with primary production and slope gradient and are subject to other diverse factors. Hedgerows are emerging ecosystems with both above- and belowground components. Functions of hedges can be categorized as provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting ecosystem services; these functions include food production, noncrop food and wood production, firewood production, pollination, pest control, soil conservation and quality improvement, mitigation of water flux and availability, carbon sequestration, landscape connectivity and character maintenance, and contributions to biodiversity. Urban hedges provide a relatively equitable microclimate and critical connections between green spaces and enhance human health and well-being through contact with biodiversity. Soil and water conservation are well researched in tropical hedges but less is known about their contribution to pollination, pest control, and biodiversity. Establishing a minimum hedge width and longer intervals between cutting of temperate hedges would enhance biosecurity and promote carbon sequestration and biodiversity. Hedges have a global role in mitigating biodiversity loss and climate change, which restoration should maximize, notwithstanding regional character.

AB  - Purpose - Functioning as space connectors, path structures in urban parks may rarely present social interaction opportunities, although centralized activity spaces are available. This paper investigated the interrelationships between the visual and physical accessibility attributes of path structure and their impacts on passive social interaction intensity across urban parks in Kuala Lumpur.
   Design/methodology/approach - The concept of social interaction has been studied elsewhere in social cohesion, social affiliation and sense of communication. Still, it has not been studied in the context of urban park design. This study employed mixed methods using an adaptive and unique combination of qualitative and quantitative data collections to analyze urban parks with a bit of visual vegetation barrier. The experiential landscape method was applied to determine visual accessibility by interpreting experiential landscape maps. The space syntax method based on quantitative analysis is considered to measure physical accessibilities and vigorous activities along the designated paths by conducting integration analysis and gate observation. The data were crossed-analyzed using a Geographic Information System (GIS) classification technique, correlation analysis and Microsoft combo-charts to generate the relationship between patterns of activities and their accessibilities.
   Findings - The results suggested that designated paths with higher accessibility attributes, impressively more elevated than other tracks, could influence the intensity of passive social interactions. The findings supported the understanding that activity nodes and active areas adjoining designated routes could make accessibility attribute areas more critical. These findings verify that visually enriching the spaces along the path structure toward activities is a pivotal contributor to urban planners and designers to enhance the paths' local integration (LI) and visual accessibility to predict more passive eye contact among park visitors.
   Research limitations/implications - The proposed interrelationship among variables in this study has limitations because of not considering other qualitative methods and techniques like cognitive maps and interview simultaneously. These techniques could discover why some paths generate more passive eye contact among park users (Mohammadi Tahroodi, 2018).
   Practical implications - Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan 2020 emphasizes Kuala Lumpur's unique image as a tropical garden city via preserving and developing the iconic historical urban parks in the city center (CHKL, 2004, pp. 3-3). The latest Draft Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan 2040 has outlined the strategy to achieve a conducive, good-quality neighborhood that encourages social interaction. The findings could assist urban planners and designers better public parks by considering accessibility and permeability aspects of design. This research endorses the appropriateness of interrelationship between accessibility attributes of path structure and social interaction in urban design research, which local urban designers have not fully considered until now. Evaluating the visual convenience of designated paths and assessing LI of the axial lines constructing each designated route of urban parks during the primary stage could enable urban designers to estimate to what extent the paths are accessible and respond to passive social interaction. Then they could enrich with salient landmarks, views and activity nodes to make them attractive. The considerable number of designated paths connections, specifically while they shape the sides of activity nodes, could increase the connectivity and integration of spaces within the parks. These patterns of positioning the activity nodes make the designated routes more legible and provide ease of movement. As a result, it will give urban park users more information about the activities. Allowing people to use the paths will increase people's presence and, subsequently, passive social interaction. One way is to locate accessible lands that provide social activities at direct visual access paths within urban parks for legibility.
   Social implications - The socially responsive urban design enhances the quality of life and provides life satisfaction, happiness and society's overall health. Being in urban social parks in any passive and active situations has psychological benefits. It facilitates relief and rests from a stressful modern lifestyle that significantly impacts their mental health and well-being. The framework applied in this research integrates the social, spatial and physical aspects of parks design. With this regard, principles and indicators facilitate physically and socially attractive urban parks for Kuala Lumpur city center and applicable to similar contexts elsewhere.
   Originality/value - The concept of social interaction has been studied elsewhere in social cohesion, social affiliation and sense of communication. Still, it has not been studied in the context of urban park design. This study employed mixed methods using an adaptive and unique combination of qualitative and quantitative data collections to analyze urban parks with a bit of visual vegetation barrier.

AB  - Ranunculus ficaria is an invasive plant species in the northeastern United States, especially in urban riparian habitats. Changes in the frequency and intensity of flooding events in these urban riparian corridors create patches of heavy litter and patches of bare ground. Many plant species either cannot penetrate deep litter, or they are susceptible to freezing temperatures and drying conditions on bare ground. This can result in competitive advantages for invasive species that are adapted to these varying conditions. We conducted a field experiment to test the effects of leaf litter depth on R. ficaria biomass, bulbil production, flower production, and seed production under deep (20 cm) litter, intermediate (10 cm) litter, shallow (5 cm) litter, and bare ground along an urban stream in Louisville, Kentucky. Deep litter and lack of litter decreased plant biomass compared with shallow litter. Bulbil production was not significantly different across treatments. Flower and seed production were only reduced in deep litter. Ranunculus ficaria's ability to maintain production across a large range of litter depths may provide a competitive advantage over plant species not adapted to varying litter depths.

AB  - Ligustrum japonicum is a common ornamental tree species in China. However, leaf spot disease has emerged in Rizhao City, Shandong Province of China in recent years. Members of Pseudocercospora are usually known as plant pathogens, mainly causing leaf spots and blights. Species of this genus are distinguished mainly based on morphological differences on the host plants, as well as the molecular data. A new species named Pseudocercospora rizhaoensis on Ligustrum japonicum is introduced herein based on morphology and molecular data of combined ITS, LSU, act, tef1 and rpb2 sequences. Koch's postulates were confirmed by a pathogenicity test, re-isolation and identification.

AB  - Ecological effects of country roads have been largely ignored due to their remoteness and presumed light disturbance. In order to examine the effects of country roads on seed dispersal by rodents, rodent community, seed predation, and dispersal were compared between the roadside and the forest interior (road-seed station distance: less than 10 m, 30-50 m, more than 50 m). A total of 3240 wild apricot (Armeniaca sibirica) seeds were tracked in three 2.0 ha plots in 2014 (a seed-poor year) and 2016 (a seed-rich year), along a lightly disturbed country paved road (21.2 km length, 7.0 m wide, two-way, constructed in 2008) across the forests in the west of Beijing city. The results showed that there were more farmland rodent species, but fewer forest-shrub rodent species near the roadside compared to within the forest interior. During seed dispersal, fewer seeds were harvested, scatter-hoarded or moved toward the road, but seeds were moved longer distances near the roadside than those within the forest interior. Some seeds could be dispersed more than 20 m, but none of them crossed the road. These results suggest that the focal road has changed the rodent community and rodent-mediated seed dispersal dynamics. Compared in seed-poor year (2014), seed harvest and dispersal were reduced, while seed predation increased in seed-rich year (2016), suggesting that the negative effects caused by the road would be more obvious in seed-rich years. Our results imply that ecological-based assessment and management of country roads is also important although they are located in remote areas and have little disturbance in terms of traffic and people.

AB  - Little information is available on the ecology of Aedes aegypti Linnaeus at the southern extreme of its distribution (Buenos Aires, Argentina), particularly on microhabitat suitability. The aim of our study was to identify at a detailed scale, microhabitat factors that correlate with the presence of preimaginal stages of the mosquito. In March 2001, we performed a spatial census of all containers located in a 1 ha patch within a cemetery in Buenos Aires City. On a reference map (1:700) we plotted the position of graves and surrounding corridors, the location of containers, the shade projected by each plant between 10:00 and 16:00 h and vegetation cover. We classified vegetation by height, substrate by composition and shadow by level of exposure to sunlight. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses with nine constructed independent variables, some of them at scales of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 10 m. Of 850 receptacles examined, 101 contained preimaginal stages of Ae. aegypti. Level of exposure to sunlight, type of substratum, vegetation height and distance of containers to vegetation were significantly associated with the presence of breeding sites at the studied scales. Final multivariate models were significant at scales of 2 m (chi(2)((3)) 25.693, p<0.001), and 3m (chi(2)((3)) = 26.440, p < 0.001), and 65.9 and 66.8% of our data were correctly classified, respectively, for each scale. Our results suggest that sites less exposed to sunlight, with taller and closer vegetation, and in shaded and vegetated neighbourhoods were the most favourable microhabitats for Ae. aegypti breeding.

AB  - We completed a floristic inventory of the James River Park System (JRPS), a ca. 223-hectare (550-acre) multi-unit park along the James River in Richmond, Virginia. The JRPS includes land within the riparian zone along a 13-kilometer (8-mile) stretch of the river that bisects the city, providing two million annual visitors with recreational access to the rapids along the "Falls of the James." Although the vegetation within the park system is an important attraction for park-goers, information on the flora of the JRPS and this section of the James River corridor is limited. This study updates partial records of the JRPS flora from ca. 50 years ago with collections that were made over the span of three growing seasons from 2016-2018. A total of 566 species and sub-specific taxa were documented from 336 genera and 115 families, including 63 new botanical records for the locality. Native species comprise 60.4% of the overall species richness, with dominant families including Asteraceae, Poaceae, and Cyperaceae. Non-native invasive species are prevalent throughout the park: 51 species are listed on the Virginia Invasive Plant Species List, 21 of which carry a "high" invasiveness rank. Four state listed rare species were documented within the park, and seven other state-rare "watchlist" species were found. The information presented here is being used to help guide management efforts of the JRPS Invasive Plant Task Force, an organization dedicated to the removal of non-native invasive species, restoration of natural habitats, and preservation of natural communities within the park system.

AB  - Background: Dengue is a common mosquito-borne viral disease epidemic especially in tropical and sub-tropical regions where water sanitation is not substantially controlled. However, dengue epidemics sometimes occur in non-tropical urban cities with substantial water sanitary control. Using a mathematical model, we investigate what conditions can be important for a dengue epidemic to occur in an urban city such as Tokyo, where vectors are active only in summer and there are little number of vectors around hosts.
   Methods: The model, which is a modified Ross-Macdonald model, consists of two sets of host-vector compartments. The two sets correspond to high-risk and low-risk areas, and only hosts can move between them. Assuming that mosquitoes have constant activity for only 90 days, we assess five potential countermeasures: (1) restricted movement between the two areas, (2) insecticide application, (3) use of repellents, (4) vector control, and (5) isolation of the infected.
   Results: The basic reproduction number R-0 and the cumulative number of infected hosts for 90 days are evaluated for each of the five countermeasures. In the cases of Measures 2-5, the cumulative number of the infected for 90 days can be reduced substantially for small R-0 even if R-0 > 1. Although R0 for Measure 1 monotonically decreases with the mobility rates, the cumulative number of the infected for 90 days has a maximum at a moderate mobility rate. If the mobility rate is sufficiently small, the restricted movement effectively increases the number density of vectors in the high-risk area, and the epidemic starts earlier in the high-risk area than in the low-risk one, while the growth of infections is slow.
   Conclusions: Measures 2-5 are more or less effective. However, Measure 1 can have the opposite effect, depending on the mobility rates. The restricted movement results in the formation of a kind of core population, which can promote the epidemic in the entire population.

AB  - Two hundred and ten isolations of West Nile virus (WNV) were obtained from 17 mosquito species in six genera in statewide surveillance conducted in Connecticut from June through October, 1999-2003. Culex pipiens (86), Culex salinarius (32), Culex restuans (26), Culiseta melanura (32), and Aedes vexans (12) were implicated as the most likely vectors of WNV in the region based on virus isolation data. Culex pipiens was abundant from July through September and is likely involved in early season enzootic transmission and late season epizootic amplification of the virus in wild bird populations. Epidemic transmission of WNV to humans in urban locales is probable. The abundance of Cx. restuans in June and July and isolations of WNV in early July suggest that this species may play an important role as an enzootic vector involved in early amplification of WNV virus among wild birds. its involvement as a bridge vector to humans is unlikely. Culex salinarius was the most frequently captured Culex species and was abundant in August and September when virus activity was at its height. Frequent isolations of WNV from this species in September when the majority of human cases were reported in union with its abundance at this time of the year, demonstrated vector competence, and broad feeding habits, make Cx. salinarius a likely bridge vector to humans, horses and other mammals. Multiple isolations WNV from Cs. melanura collected in more rural locales in late August and September, provide supportive evidence to suggest that this predominant avian feeder may play a significant role in epizootic amplification of the virus among wild bird populations in these environs. Aedes vexans was the only species of Aedes or Ochlerotatus from which multiple isolations of WNV were made in more than one year and was among the most frequently trapped and abundant species throughout the season. Since Ae. vexans predominately feeds on mammals it is unlikely to play a significant role in epizootic amplification of WNV, however, because of its abundance and aggressive mammalian and human biting behavior it must receive strong consideration as a bridge vector to humans and horses. The occasional virus isolations obtained from Aedes cinereus (4), Uranotaenia sapphirina (3), Ochlerotatus canadensis (2), Ochlerotatus trivittatus (2), Ochlerotatus sollicitans (2), Ochlerotatus sticticus (2), Psorophora ferox (2), Anopheles punctipennis, Anopheles walkeri, Ochlerotatus cantator, Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus, and Ochlerotatus triseriatus in conjunction with their inefficient vector competency and host feeding preferences indicate that these species likely play a very minor role in either the enzootic maintenance or epizootic transmission of WNV in this region. The principal foci of WNV activity in Connecticut were identified as densely populated (>3,000 people/mi(2)) residential communities in coastal Fairfield and New Haven Counties, and in the case of 2002, similar locales in proximity of the city of Hartford in central Hartford County. In almost all instances we observed a correlation both temporally and spatially between the isolation of WNV from field-collected mosquitoes and subsequent human cases in these locales. In most years the incidence of human cases closely paralleled the number of virus isolations made from mosquitoes with both peaks falling in early September.
   We conclude that the isolation of WNV from field-collected mosquitoes is a sensitive indicator of virus activity that is associated with the risk of human infection that habitually extends from early August through the end of October in Connecticut.

AB  - This study examines the improvement of juvenile fish recruitment by technical rehabilitation measures implemented in two urban waterways in Berlin, Germany: the River Spree and the Teltow Canal. Rehabilitation sites provide new littoral habitats protected from navigation-induced flow and wake wash and are intended to improve habitat quality for juvenile fish and to support urban fish diversity. Both sites and four control sites with common embankments have been sampled monthly by point electric fishing (875 dips in total) from May to September 2009. In total, 6,243 fish were caught representing 12 species. Two of the species, roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis), dominated the fish community, comprising 81.5% and 16.1% of the total catch. Nine species were rare, with relative abundances <1%, which hampered more detailed species-specific analyses. Of the dips 33% contained no fish, causing zero-inflation of the dataset. A hurdle regression model confirmed positive effects of reduced hydraulic disturbances and resulting vegetation cover on juvenile fish occurrence. However, it also showed low oxygen concentrations limiting habitat quality, as observed at the older, densely vegetated rehabilitation site in the River Spree. The general improvement of the juvenile fish assemblage by the rehabilitation measure appeared rather low, as partially vegetated, rectangle trapeze and trapeze profile banks had even higher fish abundance. The study also revealed a need for adaptive maintenance to improve the long-term performance of this type of rehabilitation structure. With the recovery of aquatic vegetation, the technical bank protection should be adaptively removed to retain the connectivity with the main channel for a sufficient oxygen supply for the long-term functionality as a fish habitat.

AB  - Due to the intensified land use in transformed landscapes, grassland biodiversity is often restricted to habitat fragments inadequate for arable use or for urban development. In continental parts of Eurasia, the similar to 600,000 ancient burial mounds (called "kurgans") built by nomadic tribes of the steppes are amongst the most widespread landmarks providing refuge for dry grassland species. In our study by using plant functional groups and functional traits, we aimed at gaining insight into the ecological and evolutionary processes shaping the structure and the composition of assemblages of grassland specialist plant species on kurgans embedded in the agricultural landscapes of East-Hungary. As a comparison, we also studied roadside verges and pristine extensive grasslands in the same region. We found that despite their small size, due to the lack of human disturbances and high microhabitat diversity kurgans can maintain a high species richness and percentage cover of specialists, especially when compared to verges. We revealed that assemblages of specialist plants on kurgans are characterized by traits typical to terrestrial habitat islands such as self-compatibility, large seed mass and tall stature. Kurgans and extensive grasslands were characterized by higher functional diversity (both at the level of single traits and multi-trait based functional dispersion) which is probably due to the higher level of environmental heterogeneity compared to the homogeneous environment in verges.

AB  - This study evaluated the presence and seasonal distribution of polio and other enteroviruses in four wastewater treatment plants in three cities in Italy, using different treatment systems. Detection of enteroviruses was carried out by virus isolation in cell cultures after concentration of water samples collected at both inlet and outlet of the treatment plants, following the methods described in the WHO guidelines. Viral serotypes isolated before and after water treatment were compared. Forty-eight non-polio enteroviruses were isolated from 312 samples collected at the inlet of the four wastewater treatment plants, 35 of which were Coxsackievirus type B (72.9 %) and 13 Echovirus (27.1 %). After treatment, 2 CVB3, 1 CVB5, and 1 Echo 6 were isolated. CVB3 and Echo 6 serotypes were also detected in samples collected at the inlet of the TP, in the same month and year. The high rate of detection of infectious enteroviruses in inlet sewage samples (30.1 %) indicates wide diffusion of these viruses in the populations linked to the collectors. The incomplete removal of infectious viruses following sewage treatment highlights possible risks for public health relate to treated waters discharge into the environment.

AB  - Background: Toxoplasma gondii is found worldwide, but distribution of its genotypes as well as clinical expression of human toxoplasmosis varies across the continents. Several studies in Europe, North America and South America argued for a role of genotypes in the clinical expression of human toxoplasmosis. Genetic data concerning T. gondii isolates from Africa are scarce and not sufficient to investigate the population structure, a fundamental analysis for a better understanding of distribution, circulation, and transmission.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Seropositive animals originating from urban and rural areas in Gabon were analyzed for T. gondii isolation and genotyping. Sixty-eight isolates, including one mixed infection (69 strains), were obtained by bioassay in mice. Genotyping was performed using length polymorphism of 13 microsatellite markers located on 10 different chromosomes. Results were analyzed in terms of population structure by Bayesian statistical modeling, Neighbor-joining trees reconstruction based on genetic distances, F-ST and linkage disequilibrium. A moderate genetic diversity was detected. Three haplogroups and one single genotype clustered 27 genotypes. The majority of strains belonged to one haplogroup corresponding to the worldwide Type III. The remaining strains were distributed into two haplogroups (Africa 1 and 3) and one single genotype. Mouse virulence at isolation was significantly different between haplogroups. Africa 1 haplogroup was the most virulent.
   Conclusion: Africa 1 and 3 haplogroups were proposed as being new major haplogroups of T. gondii circulating in Africa. A possible link with strains circulating in South and Central America is discussed. Analysis of population structure demonstrated a local spread within a rural area and strain circulation between the main cities of the country. This circulation, favored by human activity could lead to genetic exchanges. For the first time, key epidemiological questions were addressed for the West African T. gondii population, using the high discriminatory power of microsatellite markers, thus creating a basis for further epidemiological and clinical investigations.

AB  - Landscape fragmentation due to urban development, transportation infrastructure, and agriculture poses a threat to environmental integrity. There is a need to quantify the level of landscape fragmentation in an ecologically meaningful way for inclusion in planning and decision-making. Effective mesh size (m(eff)) is an ecologically relevant metric that quantifies landscape fragmentation based on the probability that two randomly chosen points in a region are located in the same non-fragmented patch. We investigated variation in meff measured by transportation districts, municipal counties, and six spatial levels of watersheds within the state of California. Four fragmentation geometries were developed by overlaying highways, roads, urbanized areas, agricultural areas, and natural fragmenting features. Two m(eff) calculation methods were compared: one where planning unit boundaries fragment the landscape (CUT), the other allowing for cross-boundary connections (CBC). The CUT procedure always produced lower m(eff) values than CBC, with greater differences occurring in smaller planning units, confirming the bias introduced using boundaries with landscape metrics. Calculated m(eff) values varied from 0 to 20 885 km(2) across 6994 units in California. Roads contributed the most to fragmentation, while agriculture contributed little, as California's agricultural areas are already heavily fragmented by roads. This paper provides a systematic, quantitative, and intuitive method for transportation, land use and environmental planners to analyze cumulative impacts of multiple fragmenting features across a range of spatial scales within a variety of planning units. This approach could be used for analyzing the impact of future land development scenarios, and integrated into regional planning processes. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The loss and fragmentation of the landscape are the main causes of the decline and the extinction of many wildlife species. In this study we test the impact of landscape features on the genetic connectivity of a sedentary bird. Populations of our case study, the grey partridge (Perdix perdix armoricana), occur in central northern France. This is considered as the last bastion of high grey partridge densities in Europe and thus represents a relevant zone for the conservation of P. p. armoricana. Despite a highly man dominated landscape, results from the analysis of 12 microsatellite genotypes suggest the beginning of a genetic structure. This emerging genetic structure can result from the last historical event having occurred in the study area: a massive urbanization since the nineteenth century following the increase of the human density and town surface. Another hypothesis suggests that the weak genetic structure can result from a massive restocking with captive-bred individuals at a more or less recent point in time.

AB  - The Australian backyard mosquito, Aedes notoscriptus, is a highly urbanised pest species that has invaded New Zealand and the USA. Importantly, Ae. notoscriptus has been implicated as a vector of Ross River virus, a common and arthritogenic arbovirus in Australia, and is a laboratory vector of numerous other pathogenic viruses, including West Nile, yellow fever, and Zika viruses. To further explore live viruses harboured by field populations of Ae. notoscriptus and, more specifically, assess the genetic diversity of its virome, we processed 495 pools, comprising a total of 6,674 female Ae. notoscriptus collected across fifteen suburbs in Brisbane, Australia, between January 2018 and May 2019. Nine virus isolates were recovered and characterised by metagenomic sequencing and phylogenetics. The principal viral family represented was Flaviviridae. Known viruses belonging to the genera Flavivirus, Orbivirus, Mesonivirus, and Nelorpivirus were identified together with two novel virus species, including a divergent Thogoto-like orthomyxovirus and an insect-specific flavivirus. Among these, we recovered three Stratford virus (STRV) isolates and an isolate of Wongorr virus (WGRV), which for these viral species is unprecedented for the geographical area of Brisbane. Thus, the documented geographical distribution of STRV and WGRV, both known for their respective medical and veterinary importance, has now been expanded to include this major urban centre. Phylogenies of the remaining five viruses, namely, Casuarina, Ngewotan, the novel Thogoto-like virus, and two new flavivirus species, suggested they are insect-specific viruses. None of these viruses have been previously associated with Ae. notoscriptus or been reported in Brisbane. These findings exemplify the rich genetic diversity and viral abundance within the Ae. notoscriptus virome and further highlight this species as a vector of concern with the potential to transmit viruses impacting human or animal health. Considering it is a common pest and vector in residential areas and is expanding its global distribution, ongoing surveillance, and ecological study of Ae. notoscriptus, together with mapping of its virome and phenotypic characterisation of isolated viruses, is clearly warranted. Immanently, these initiatives are essential for future understanding of both the mosquito virome and the evolution of individual viral species.

AB  - The increasing development of urban infrastructure has led to the significant loss of natural wetlands and their ecosystem services. Many novel urban development projects currently attempt to incorporate environmental sustainability, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and community engagement into the intricate challenges we all face in an era of climate change. This paper aims to communicate several key findings on design elements that can be adopted or incorporated in the design of created wetlands as infrastructural elements. Three major design elementsmicrotopography, hydrologic connectivity, and planting diversityare presented, and their relations to restoring ecosystem services of urban wetlands, in particular water and habitat quality, are discussed. These design elements can be easily adopted or incorporated in the planning, designing, and construction stages of urban development. The success of urban infrastructure projects may require both better communication among stakeholders and a great deal of community engagement. The Rain Project, a floating wetland project on an urban college campus, demonstrates the role of interdisciplinary collaboration and community engagement as a model for sustainable stormwater management, a critical part of today's urban development. Further efforts should be made to advance the science of designing urban wetlands and its communication to transform cultural attitudes toward sustainable urban development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most heat-related deaths occur in cities, and future trends in global climate change and urbanization may amplify this trend. Understanding how neighborhoods affect heat mortality fills an important gap between studies of individual susceptibility to heat and broadly comparative studies of temperature-mortality relationships in cities.
   OBJECTIVES: We estimated neighborhood effects of population characteristics and built and natural environments on deaths due to heat exposure in Maricopa County, Arizona (2000-2008).
   METHODS: We used 2000 U.S. Census data and remotely sensed vegetation and land surface temperature to construct indicators of neighborhood vulnerability and a geographic information system to map vulnerability and residential addresses of persons who died from heat exposure in 2,081 census block groups. Binary logistic regression and spatial analysis were used to associate deaths with neighborhoods.
   RESULTS: Neighborhood scores on three factors-socioeconomic vulnerability, elderly/isolation, and unvegetated area-varied widely throughout the study area. The preferred model (based on fit and parsimony) for predicting the odds of one or more deaths from heat exposure within a census block group included the first two factors and surface temperature in residential neighborhoods, holding population size constant. Spatial analysis identified clusters of neighborhoods with the highest heat vulnerability scores. A large proportion of deaths occurred among people, including homeless persons, who lived in the inner cores of the largest cities and along an industrial corridor.
   CONCLUSIONS: Place-based indicators of vulnerability complement analyses of person-level heat risk factors. Surface temperature might be used in Maricopa County to identify the most heat-vulnerable neighborhoods, but more attention to the socioecological complexities of climate adaptation is needed.

AB  - We examined the influence of point and nonpoint source contamination on microplastic (MP) levels in water, macroinvertebrates, and trout in a small, cold-water stream in western Wisconsin, U.S.A. We collected samples along an urbanization gradient centered around a 6-mile corridor that receives numerous MP inputs from stormwater outfalls and a wastewater plant. We digested samples using a wet peroxide oxidation method. Particles filtered from digestates were stained with Nile Red dye, then viewed using fluorescence microscopy. We quantified fluorescing MPs using ImageJ software. MP concentrations in water increased significantly from upstream to downstream reaches and appeared to influence organism MP levels. Macroinvertebrates and trout collected upstream of the city had significantly lower MP levels than macroinvertebrates and trout collected within the city, and for trout, downstream of the city. MP particle lengths were significantly longer in macroinvertebrates compared to water and trout, perhaps indicating preferential accumulation of longer particles from the water column.

AB  - Conservation organizations and public agencies are interested in identifying and prioritizing areas for conservation action, often acquisition or easements. Typically, this requires the use of uncertain data and vaguely defined decision criteria. I developed a decision support system to address these uncertainty issues and assist in evaluating conservation opportunities for the endangered California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) in Santa Barbara, California. Functionally defined planning units were used to aggregate data on land suitability, land cover change, salamander presence, and movement risk along potential linkages between breeding ponds. I used a fuzzy-logic-based inference engine to evaluate the planning units and rank the relative suitability of interpond linkages for conservation action. The sensitivity of the rankings was considered with respect to uncertainty in salamander occurrence data and the relationship between land-cover-change threats and site suitability. All linkages were substantially degraded, but five areas were consistently identified with high relative suitability for conservation action despite differences in assumptions and uncertainty in biological data. The combination of functionally defined planning units and a fuzzy-logic-based decision support system provides a general framework for considering the suitability of sites for conservation action.

AB  - Forest fragmentation constitutes one of the main consequences of land cover change worldwide. Through this process gaps in habitat coverage are created and the ability of populations in the remaining fragments to maintain themselves is put in doubt. Hence, two options need to be considered: conserving the remaining forest fragments, and restoring habitat in some deforested patches with the aim of reestablishing the connections among the fragments. We established a mathematical index (SIR) that describes the suitability of individual habitat patches for restoration within a landscape. The index considers classes of distances among fragments and categories of habitat quality in the areas surrounding the fragments to assess habitat quality in terms of probability of dispersal and survival of propagules (especially seeds and cutting). In the present study, we created detailed maps depicting SIR values for two periods (1988 and 2011) for Sorocaba region (Sao Paulo State, Brazil). We derived land cover maps from satellite images for the two years of our study, and then surveyed the transition of land cover categories and landscape metrics between years. A model for the SIR was created using a map of distance classes among fragments and also a map of habitat quality established according to each land cover category. For both 1988 and 2011, pasture was the predominant land cover category. The main land cover transitions were from pasture to urban (10.6%) and from pasture to forest fragments (13.4%). Although the land cover class "wood sites" increased, the data of SIR revealed that the areas of habitat categorized as excellent and good both decreased, while habitat classes categorized as poor and very poor increased. Our model has the potential to be applied to other regions where the forest is fragmented. Hence, local policy makers will be able to use this model to determine local patches of high value for conservation and also the most ideal locations for restoration projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Habitat connectivity is important for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem processes yet globally is highly restricted by anthropogenic actions. Anthropogenic barriers are common in aquatic ecosystems; however, the effects of smallscale barriers such as floodgates have received relatively little study. Here we assess fish communities in ten tributaries over the spring-summer season of the lower Fraser River (British Columbia, Canada), five with floodgates and five reference sites without barriers, located primarily in agricultural land use areas. While the Fraser River supports the largest salmon runs in Canada, the lower Fraser river-floodplain ecosystem has numerous dikes and floodgates to protect valuable agricultural and urban developments. Floodgate presence was associated with reduced dissolved oxygen concentrations, threefold greater abundance of invasive fish species, and decreased abundances of five native fish species, including two salmon species. These findings provide evidence that floodgates decrease suitable habitat for native fishes, and become hotspots for non-native species. Given climate change, sea-level rise, and aging flood protection infrastructure, there is an opportunity to incorporate biodiversity considerations into further development or restoration of this infrastructure.

AB  - We investigated the roles of habitat fragmentation and the invasion of an exotic species on the structure of ground-foraging ant communities in 40 scrub habitat fragments in coastal southern California. In particular, we asked: how do fragment age, fragment size, amount of urban edge, percentage of native vegetation, degree of isolation, and the relative abundance of an exotic species, the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) affect native ants? Within these fragments, Argentine ants were more abundant near developed edges and in areas dominated by exotic vegetation. The number of native ground-foraging ant species at any point declined from an average of >7 to <2 species in the presence of the Argentine ant. Among fragments, a stepwise multiple regression revealed that the abundance of Argentine ants, the size of the fragment, and the number of years since it was isolated from larger continuous areas of scrub habitat best predict the number of remaining native ant species. The Argentine ant was found in every fragment surveyed as well as around the edges of larger unfragmented areas. Fragments had fewer native ant species than similar-sized plots within large unfragmented areas, and fragments with Argentine ant-free refugia had more native ant species than those without refugia. The relative vulnerability of native ants to habitat fragmentation and the subsequent presence of Argentine ants vary among species. The most sensitive species include army ants (Neivamyrmex spp.) and harvester ants (genera Messor and Pogonomyrmex), both of which are important to ecosystem-level processes. Our surveys suggest that the Argentine ant is widespread in fragmented coastal scrub habitats in southern California and strongly affects native ant communities.

AB  - I review the existing literature on habitat fragmentation and its effects on avian populations in coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitat in coastal southern California. Included in this review is a consideration of the effect of fragmentation on nest predators, brood parasites, food availability, and habitat structure and quality. Fragmentation and the creation of edge are extensive in this region. The primary contemporary fragmenting land-use is residential development. In comparison to forested landscapes in the East and Midwest, fragmentation in this region seems to cause more isolation in bird populations. Local extinctions in isolated habitat fragments are common among some species of the shrub habitat avifauna and colonizations are relatively rare. This difference may be due to more limited dispersal ability in the year-round residents that are characteristic of this region as compared to the long-distance migrants in the East and Midwest. Perhaps due to the semi-arid nature of the region, fragmentation may be accompanied by more habitat degradation than in mesic regions, which could contribute to the lack of successful colonization. In contrast to studies in the East and Midwest, the only demographic study of avian edge effects in this system indicates that nest predation and brood parasitism do not increase near anthropogenically-induced edges. In isolated habitat fragments mammalian mesopredators appear to undergo "mesopredator release" in the absence of coyotes (Canis latrans). In habitat fragments the availability of potential arthropod prey is positively related to fragment size and negatively related to fragment age, but does not appear to be a function of distance to edge. In large habitat blocks, however, the abundance of a number of arthropod taxa is lower near edges. A particularly striking edge effect is the invasion of non-native Argentine ants along urban edges. The effect of Argentine ants on native ants is severe but their effect on arthropods that are more important as avian prey is less clear.

AB  - Ecosystems across the United States are changing in complex and surprising ways. Ongoing demand for critical ecosystem services requires an understanding of the populations and communities in these ecosystems in the future. This paper represents a synthesis effort of the U.S. National Science Foundation-funded Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network addressing the core research area of "populations and communities." The objective of this effort was to show the importance of long-term data collection and experiments for addressing the hardest questions in scientific ecology that have significant implications for environmental policy and management. Each LTER site developed at least one compelling case study about what their site could look like in 50-100 yr as human and environmental drivers influencing specific ecosystems change. As the case studies were prepared, five themes emerged, and the studies were grouped into papers in this LTER Futures Special Feature addressing state change, connectivity, resilience, time lags, and cascading effects. This paper addresses the "connectivity" theme and has examples from the Phoenix (urban), Niwot Ridge (alpine tundra), McMurdo Dry Valleys (polar desert), Plum Island (coastal), Santa Barbara Coastal (coastal), and Jornada (arid grassland and shrubland) sites. Connectivity has multiple dimensions, ranging from multi-scalar interactions in space to complex interactions over time that govern the transport of materials and the distribution and movement of organisms. The case studies presented here range widely, showing how land-use legacies interact with climate to alter the structure and function of arid ecosystems and flows of resources and organisms in Antarctic polar desert, alpine, urban, and coastal marine ecosystems. Long-term ecological research demonstrates that connectivity can, in some circumstances, sustain valuable ecosystem functions, such as the persistence of foundation species and their associated biodiversity or, it can be an agent of state change, as when it increases wind and water erosion. Increased connectivity due to warming can also lead to species range expansions or contractions and the introduction of undesirable species. Continued long-term studies are essential for addressing the complexities of connectivity. The diversity of ecosystems within the LTER network is a strong platform for these studies.

AB  - The factors responsible for the patterns of niche differentiation and narrow endemism have rarely been investigated in annual Mediterranean plants. This topic was addressed here by performing comparative studies on realized niches, regional occupancy, global biogeographical distribution and seed traits of a set of Arenaria (Caryophyllaceae) species inhabiting southern Provence (SE France), focusing in particular on Arenaria provincialis, a narrow endemic restricted to the hills and modest calcareous mountains around the city of Marseille. Field studies were carried out from 2008 to 2009 at 624 sites in the limestone mountains where Arenaria species are likely to occur. The Arenaria species occurring in southern Provence vary greatly in their patterns of regional occupancy and their biogeographical distribution. Multivariate analysis of the realized niche showed that they have some similar limiting environmental factors in common, but they do not all occupy the same habitats. Studies on the fruits and seeds showed that the endemic A. provincialis has a larger seed than its congeners and a capsule that remains closed and falls from the plant at maturity. This well-differentiated diaspore specific to A. provincialis may be responsible for the limited dispersal capacity of this species. Phylogenetic analyses showed that A. provincialis is not closely related to the other taxa inhabiting southern Provence, but rather to Arenaria occurring in highland areas in the south of France. The restricted pattern of distribution of A. provincialis is probably due to the past isolation event from which it originated and to its limited dispersal capacity, rather than resulting from its ecological niche range.

AB  - Eared doves (Zenaida auriculata), which are common in urban, rural and wild areas in many regions of Brazil, are frequently prey for domestic cats. Therefore Toxoplasma gondii isolates obtained from doves may reflect greater environmental diversity than those from other hosts. The aim of the present study was to evaluate T. gondii seroprevalence, isolate and genotype strains from Z. auriculata. Serum and tissue samples were collected from 206 doves for use in the modified agglutination test (MAT) and mouse bioassay. The prevalence of T. gondii antibodies in the doves was 22.3% (46/206), with titers ranging from 16 to 4096, and T. gondii strains were isolated from 12 of these doves. Five genotypes were detected by means of PCR-RFLP, including ToxoDB genotypes #1, #6, #17 and #65, and one genotype that had not previously been described (ToxoDB#182). This was the first report on isolation of T. gondii from Z. auriculata. This study confirmed the genetic diversity of T. gondii isolates and the existence of clonal type II (ToxoDB genotype #1) in Brazil.

AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) was first isolated in California during July 2003 from a pool of Culex tarsalis collected near El Centro, Imperial County. WNV transmission then increased and spread in Imperial and Coachella Valleys, where it was tracked by isolation from pools of Cx. tarsalis, seroconversions in sentinel chickens, and seroprevalence in free-ranging birds. WNV then dispersed to the city of Riverside, Riverside County, and to the Whittier Dam area of Los Angeles County, where it was detected in dead birds and pools of Cx. pipiens quinquefasciatus. By October, WNV was detected in dead birds collected from riparian corridors in Los Angeles, west to Long Beach, and through inland valleys south from Riverside to San Diego County. WNV was reported concurrently from Arizona in mid-August, and from Baja, Mexico, in mid-November. Possible mechanisms for virus introduction, amplification, and dispersal are discussed.

AB  - Highly urbanized areas constantly need new surfaces for building of commercial, residential or infrastructure objects. Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, is a large regional centre with a population of 2 000 000 dwellers, covering a territory of 3500 km(2). The territory of Belgrade is intersected by 187 streams, with watersheds mostly rural in higher parts, urbanized and highly urbanized in lower parts. Torrential floods that once occurred rarely during pre-development period have now become more frequent and destructive due to the transformation of the watershed from rural to urban land uses. Authorities of Belgrade defined a strategy for erosion control and protection from torrential floods, based on the restoration of "blue-green" corridors (residuals of open streams and fragments of forest vegetation). The restoration of "blue-green" corridors helps the establishment of new recreational areas, the preservation of biodiversity and the mitigation of effects of climate change.

AB  - Conserved remnants of indigenous vegetation patches and corridors are regarded as important components of the built environment for the survival of birds. Field research was conducted at Boknes and Cannon Rocks in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa to study habitat use, movement, and dispersal of two Red-necked SpurfowlPternistis afersubpopulations during 2004-2007. Surveys included trapping, marking, releasing, and censusing spurfowl by traversing the study area on a regular basis, as well as fixed point observations. The density of Red-necked Spurfowl varied from 0.66-1 spurfowl ha(-1). The sex ratio for female to male was 1:1.28. The average home range for adult males was 6.3 ha. The results suggest that supplementary feeding does not change the population structure or dispersion, nor does it improve productivity or density. The most determining factor influencing spurfowl populations was the presence of indigenous vegetation patches and continuous corridors of coastal vegetation allowing populational interchange and outright dispersal. Conservation measures are suggested to promote the survival of Red-necked Spurfowl in coastal town biotopes. This includes the removal of free ranging chickensGallus gallus domesticus, which could harbour contagious disease, reduced use of hazardous substances, such as insecticides and herbicides in gardens, and the conservation of well-positioned green patches and corridors.

AB  - Urbanisation is increasing globally and is considered to be a main driver of environmental change. Urbanisation-related factors include reduced habitat size and increased spatial isolation of the remaining habitats. As a consequence, the dynamics of plant and animal populations may change, which in turn might influence the quality and quantity of plant resources. Thus, urbanisation has the potential to disturb plant-animal interactions such as herbivory or galling. In the urban-rural setting of Basel (Switzerland), we aimed to assess whether the degree of urbanisation and forest size influence plant-galling infestation rates and leaf damage by mining and chewing arthropods on three tree species (sycamore, beech, and ash). We recorded species-specific responses to the degree of urbanisation and forest size. Gall infestation rate on sycamore leaves was affected by urbanisation but not by forest size. In contrast, gall infestation rates of beech gall midges responded sensitively to increasing urbanisation and decreasing forest size. The total leaf area damage caused by mining and chewing arthropods on sycamore was influenced by urbanisation and increased with increasing forest size. Leaf area damage by miners in beech tended to be affected by the degree of urbanisation, but not in ash. Urbanisation and forest size have the potential to alter herbivorous insect abundances. However, the effects depend on tree species and herbivore guild.

AB  - Most economic valuation studies of species derive from stated preferences methods. These methods fail to take into account biodiversity values that the general public is not (made) informed about or has no experience with. Hence, production function (PF) and replacement cost (RC) approaches to valuation may be preferable in situations where species perform key life support functions in ecosystems, such as seed dispersal, pollination, or pest regulation. We conduct an RC analysis of the seed dispersal service performed by the Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius) in the Stockholm National Urban Park, Sweden. The park holds one of the largest populations of giant oaks in Europe, and the oak (Quercus robur and Quercus petrea) represents a keystone species in the hemiboreal forests. The primary objective was to estimate the number of seed-dispersed oak trees that resulted from jays and to determine the costs of replacing this service though human means. Results show that depending upon seeding or planting technique chosen, the RC per pair of jays in the park is SEK 35,000 (USD 4900) and SEK 160,000 (USD 22,500), respectively. Based on the park's aggregated oak forest-area, average RC for natural oak forest regeneration by jays is SEK 15,000 (USD 2100) to SEK 67,000 (USD 9400) per hectare, respectively. These estimates help motivating investments in management strategies that secure critical breeding and foraging habitats of jays, including coniferous forests and jay movement corridors. The analysis also illustrates the need for detailed ecological-economic knowledge in a PF or RC analysis. The continuous temporal and spatial oak dispersal service provided by jays holds several benefits compared to a man-made replacement of this service. PF and RC approaches are particularly motivated in cases of known functional ecological relationships, and critically important in estimating management measures where mobile link organisms and keystone species form key mutual relationships that generate high biodiversity benefits. In relation to obtained results, we discuss insights for conducting valuation studies on particular species. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The establishment of protected areas is one of the most common environmental policy tools which can effectively contribute to landscape protection, biodiversity conservation, and ecosystem services provision. In this sense, the Brazilian Law on Native Vegetation Protection establishes the legal reserves, mandatory protected spaces within private rural lands, which seek to maintain and restore ecological functions and promote biodiversity conservation. This paper aims to present an approach that attempted to locate potential protected spaces, in the form of legal reserves, in the East Zone of Ribeirao Preto - a recharge zone of the Guarani Aquifer System. We made use of seven criteria to create five possible scenarios with varying priorities for native vegetation protection or restoration. Then, we used eight landscape metrics, as well as the level of compliance with the law, to discuss the viability of each scenario in terms of ecological thresholds and landscape indicators. We found only one scenario (the broader perspective on recovering the natural vegetation corridors) capable of meeting the ecological and legal requirements. We conclude that using less data-demanding methods, such as the one applied in this research, could be useful in assisting decision-making regarding the selection of areas for conservation or restoration.

AB  - Acanthamoeba are abundant in a wide range of environments, and some species are responsible for cutaneous infections, keratitis, and granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE). The conventional detection and isolation of amoeba from clinical and environmental samples involves sampling and culture on non-nutrient Agar medium. Although efficient, this system requires several transfers in order to eliminate contaminants, and is not appropriate for the isolation of individual amoeba from samples with a biodiverse community. In this study we propose an alternative method for the isolation of monocystic clones of Acanthamoeba. The propose method involves sampling, enrichment, encystment induction, and direct cysts micromanipulation and culture on Agar plates.

AB  - Background Efficient and safe movement is fundamental for wild birds to thrive in their environments. For arboreal forest animals, especially birds, canopy cover has a large impact on birds' daily movements and is a crucial component of conservation strategies seeking to retain avian population in disturbed or urban habitats. Methods We translocated woodland bird species utilizing different forest strata during two non-breeding seasons in Gainesville, FL, USA. We used linear model and generalized linear model to examine the effects of canopy cover and species identity on homing success and speed. Results Among our study species of Tufted Titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), Carolina Chickadee (Poecile carolinensis), and Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), we found that Carolina Chickadees and Tufted Titmice were more likely to return than Northern Cardinals. Among birds that successfully returned, homing speed is significantly affected by forest canopy cover and species identity (titmice had higher homing speed than cardinals). Birds return much faster in landscape with higher canopy cover. Conclusions This study presented evidence of species identity's effect on homing success and speed in common feeder bird species in Southeast US and provided further evidence that bird movements in the suburban land cover are constrained by low canopy cover.

AB  - Setophaga townsendi is a species of wood warbler (family Parulidae) in northwestern North America that has geographic structure in the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes: while interior populations have differentiated mitonuclear ancestry from the sister species S. occidentalis, coastal populations have a mix of inland and S. occidentalis mitonuclear ancestries. This coastal to inland transition in genomic ancestry raises the possibility of similar geographic structure in phenotypic traits, especially those involved in mate choice. Using qualitative and multivariate approaches, we investigated whether there is a sharp transition between coastal and inland populations in both song and in nuclear DNA. We find there is a shallow geographic cline in Type I song but not in Type II song. Nuclear DNA shows a gradient between coast and inland. There is little correlation between variation in song and the isolation-by-distance pattern in the nuclear DNA. Learned songbird song is shaped by both genetic and cultural processes. There has been a debate on whether song learning promotes or slows down population differentiation. By comparing the within-species variation in song and genetic structures, we can expand our understanding of the dynamic interplay between mating signals and population differentiation.
   Lay Summary center dot Song and nuclear genomic data were collected across the entire range of Setophaga townsendi, a species known to have differences in genomic ancestry between coastal and inland populations. center dot Type I song-song thought to be used in courtship-shows greater geographic gradient than Type II song-song thought to be used in male-male competition. center dot Overall nuclear genomic variation follows an isolation-by-distance pattern between coastal and inland populations. center dot Despite geographic gradient in Type I song, some variants are shared over broad geographic distances.

AB  - Dengue is a growing public health problem in tropical and subtropical cities. It is transmitted by mosquitoes, and the main strategy for epidemic prevention and control is insecticide fumigation. Effective management is, however, proving elusive. People's day-to-day movement about the city is believed to be an important factor in the epidemiological dynamics. We use a simple model to examine the fundamental roles of broad demographic and spatial structures in epidemic initiation, growth and control. We show that the key factors are local dilution, characterised by the vector-host ratio, and spatial connectivity, characterised by the extent of habitually variable movement patterns. Epidemic risk in the population is driven by the demographic groups that frequent the areas with the highest vector-host ratio, even if they only spend some of their time there. Synchronisation of epidemic trajectories in different demographic groups is governed by the vector-host ratios to which they are exposed and the strength of connectivity. Strategies for epidemic prevention and management may be made more effective if they take into account the fluctuating landscape of transmission intensity associated with spatial heterogeneity in the vector-host ratio and people's day-to-day movement patterns.

AB  - Plant breeding is directly linked to the development of crops that can effectively adapt to challenging conditions such as soil nutrient depletion, water pollution, drought, and anthropogenic climate change. These conditions are extremely relevant in developing countries already burdened with population growth and unchecked urban expansion, especially in the tropical global southern hemisphere. Engineering new crops thus has potential to enhance food security, prevent hunger, and spur sustainable agricultural growth. A major tool for the improvement of plant varieties in this context could be the manipulation of homologous recombination and genome haploidization during meiosis. The isolation or the design of mutations in key meiotic genes may facilitate DNA recombination and transmission of important genes quickly and efficiently. Genome haploidization through centromeric histone mutants could be an option to create new crosses rapidly. This review covers technical approaches to engineer key meiotic genes in tropical crops as a blueprint for future work and examples of tropical crops in which such strategies could be applied are given.

AB  - The text analyzes the landscape relations defined over an approach to the study area in the urban perimeter axis situated between Colonia Valentina Sur and Balsa Las Perlas. The space was approached in detail because of its characteristics and the dynamic in the transformation of the agriculture production system and the natural coastal ecosystem to urban uses. Satellite images CBERS - 2B were analyzed and processed with ENVI and restitutions of the ex Enterprise HIDRONOR SE. A non supervised classification ISODATA was made, adopting the MUC classes and field data. Four metrics of landscape were stated in different scales as measure of the relation of different components that form complexity.
   The results allow us to establish that special processes of different scales merge in a synchronic way and favour the invasion conditions of exotic species that heighten the structural heterogeneity of the ecosystem. The abandon of productive lands and windbreaker curtains, the control of flows incurred by the presses up Limay and the refunction of the lands for Real Estate speculation configure the space conditions of the formation of new vegetation patches and functional types of the coastal and urban perimeter neo ecosystem. The distribution of ruderal and arvense vegetation, the invasions that domain the most of the shrub stratum and the coastal woods and secondary in abandon farms, express a measure of the connectivity established by the nets of water fluxes. The geometry of fluvial geoforms and the irrigation system favoured the invasions directed by Populus nigra and Salix alba. The indexes of complexity of landscape explain the diversity and dominant covertures. The patches distributions that increase the global diversity of the system correspond to abrupt gradients of wood pastureland, depending on how surface and irregular geometries are distributed.

AB  - Nothing is known of the genetic diversity of Toxoplasma gondii circulating in wildlife in Mexico. In the present study, a mouse virulent T. gondii strain was isolated from the heart of a wild puma (Fells concolor). The puma was found roaming in outskirt of Durango City, Mexico and tranquilized for moving to a zoo. The puma died during translocation and a necropsy examination was performed. The puma had an antibody titer for T. gondii of 200 by the modified agglutination test. Its heart and brain tissue were bioassayed into 2 outbred Swiss Webster (SW) and 1 gamma interferon gene knockout (KO) mouse. The KO mouse and the 2 SW mice that became infected after inoculation with homogenate of puma heart died of acute toxoplasmosis 12,19 and 20 days p.i. respectively and tachyzoites were found in lungs of all 3 mice. None of the 4 SW and 1 KO mouse inoculated with digest of the puma brain became infected with T. gondii. Tachyzoites from the lungs of mice were propagated in cell cultures. Tachyzoites from cell culture were inoculated into 5 SW; the mice died or had to be killed 14 days p.i. and a cat fed tissues of these mice shed T. gondii oocysts. Results of mortality and infectivity of tachyzoites and oocysts in SW mice indicated that the puma T. gondii strain (designated TgPumaMe1) was virulent for outbred mice. DNA isolated from culture-derived tachyzoites was characterized using 11 PCR-RFLP markers (SAG1, 5'- and 3'-SAG2, alt.SAG2, SAG3, STUB, GRA6, c22-8, c29-2, L358, PK1 and Apico) revealed a new genotype (ToxoDB PCR-RFLP #222). Isolation of atypical genotype T. gondii from wild puma indicates that mouse virulent strains are circulating in wildlife in Mexico. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Host-parasite association among 58 flea species parasitizing 40 mammal species in the Great Basin Desert of the western United States was investigated. Increased flea species richness was correlated with larger geographic ranges and stable locomotion of hosts. Hosts from habitats of moderately low productivity (sage and grass) and of Peromyscus maniculatus size, 10-33 g, had the highest flea species richness. Larger hosts had fewer flea species, but fleas were more prevalent. Increased host species richness correlated with flea species eye size. Mammals clustered into 3 major and 1 minor ecological groups, and fleas clustered into 2 major groups among rodents, and 6 minor groups, forming 12 host-parasite biocenoses. Factors producing biocenoses were shared but-rows of mice and rats; food chains of hares, rabbits, squirrels, and their predators; keystone mammals: Lagurus curtatus, Neotoma lepida, Ochotona princeps, and Spermophilus townsendii; keystone fleas: Megabothris abantis, and Meringis hubbardi; or host isolation, Neotoma cinerea with Oropsylla montana, Sore-v vagrans with Corrodopsylla curvata, and Tadarida brasiliensis with Sternopsylla distincta. Although host relatedness accounted for flea prevalence, host sociality explained the presence or absence of mammal-flea relationships.

AB  - Stormwater retention ponds in urbanizing catchments are constructed to collect and treat runoff from impervious surfaces. Amphibians often inhabit retention ponds, which may partly offset the loss of natural wetlands resulting from urbanization. We investigated the use of retention ponds by frogs in a rapidly-urbanizing region of south-eastern Australia to (1) determine the habitat attributes associated with individual species, and (2) recommend specific wetland design criteria to enhance populations of frog species in the region and in other urbanizing areas throughout their distribution. We detected nine species of frogs during calling surveys at 30 retention pond sites in Greater Melbourne, 2008-2010. There were contrasting differences in habitat associations among five species for which we produced regression models of abundance or occurrence. The mean abundance of Crinia signifera increased with site area, whereas Limnodynastes dumerilii was associated with smaller sites. The occurrence of L. dumerilii was positively associated with waterbody shore depth, whereas L. peronii and L. tasmaniensis were associated with shallow shores. Two species were positively associated with time since construction or since dredging of a site, whereas the occurrence of L. dumerilii decreased with site age. Aquatic vegetation at a site was important for the occurrence of L. peronii and Litoria ewingii. There was evidence for a positive effect of aquatic connectivity on the occurrence of Limnodynastes peronii, which emphasizes the importance of riparian corridors in urban settings. These results highlight the contrasting differences in habitat associations among species in the region. We recommend that retention ponds in our region and elsewhere be constructed or enhanced to include specific habitat attributes that were found to be associated with different amphibian species. We recommend long-term monitoring at sites to determine whether retention ponds augment existing frog populations or contribute to declines.

AB  - The coastal lowlands of the Western Cape (CLWC) form part of the fynbos biome, an area renowned for its high levels of plant diversity and endemism. The vegetation of the CLWC has been severely reduced and fragmented, and is currently impacted on by agricultural, pastoral, coastal resort and urban development, as well as alien plant spread. Furthermore, most of the vegetation communities are under-represented within existing protected areas. In response to this urgent need for increased conservation efforts, an initiative to establish a UNESCO-MAB biosphere reserve in the area has been launched. The aim of this project was to use biological criteria to identify areas that could potentially contain the core areas and buffer zones of a biosphere reserve. A reserve selection algorithm was chosen which provides a flexible tool for selecting representative areas for protection. The algorithm is a step-wise heuristic, which has rules for including mandatory polygons, forcing adjacency, including desirable (e.g. Red Data Book plant species) and excluding undesirable features (e.g. bisection by major roads). Farm boundaries (cadastral units) were used as selection units, resulting in a total of 1717 parcels. The selection process was conducted three times with target areas set at 10%, 25% and 50% of the original extent of each vegetation type within the study area. Areas of 62 834 ha, 121 199 ha and 242 397 ha, respectively, or 36% 49% and 76% of the available land in the study area being selected. It is recommended that the area identified as the 50% target area be considered the future site of core areas and buffer zones for the proposed biosphere reserve. The algorithm successfully maintained a high degree of connectivity between selected areas. This is important considering the high levels of plant beta diversity associated with edaphic gradients. Rather than presenting a definitive reserve system, this study provides a tool allowing biological criteria to be included explicitly within the negotiation process. As the biosphere reserve is assembled, priorities can be re-assessed.

AB  - The objective of this study was to identify influence factors on injury severity of traffic accidents and discuss the differences in urban functional zones in Beijing. A total of 3982 sets of accident data in Beijing were analyzed from the perspective of whole city and different urban functional zones. From the aspects of accident attribute, occurrence time, infrastructure, management status, and environmental condition, the influence factors set of injury severity of traffic accidents in Beijing are set up in this paper, which include 17 influence factors. Based on Pearson's chi-squared test, factors are preselected. On the basis of binary logistic regression analysis, the impact of the value of influence factors on injury severity of traffic accidents is calibrated. Based on classification and regression tree analysis, the impact of influence factors is analyzed. Through Pearson's chi-squared test and binary logistic regression analysis, it is found that there are similarities and differences among different urban functional zones. There are two common influence factors, including accident type and cross-section position, and six personalized influence factors, including lighting conditions, visibility, signal control, road physical isolation facility, occurrence period and road type, and the other nine weak influence factors. The results of binary logistic regression analysis and classification and regression tree analysis are basically the same. The factors that should be paid attention to in different urban functional zones and the value of the factors that need special attention are determined by synthesizing two methods.

AB  - The riparian forest is one of the most diverse environments of the La Plata River plains. It is represented by patches of humid forests, which are a valuable source of ecosystem services and have recreational and educational potential. However, the riparian forest has undergone constant modification, worsened by private real-estate developments and a lack of government regulation. Among the reserves that protect the riparian forest, the Municipal Ecological Reserve of Avellaneda is the closest to the southern limit of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. Although there are around 300 species of wild fauna and flora informally registered in the area, there are only a few studies published about its biodiversity. In this work, the diversity of thirteen native and exotic ferns in the core area (Eco area) of the reserve is characterized, the origin of the species is also evaluated and comparisons are made with other nearby protected areas. The Eco area of the Reserve plays an important role as part of the urban reserve corridor of the La Plata River plains and constitutes a refuge for both native and exotic ruderal species. The present work represents the basis for future studies about the population dynamics and the colonization strategies of the ferns.

AB  - The biodiversity hotspot of New Caledonia hosts high levels of endemism (74% of flora) that is threatened increasingly by climate change, habitat reduction, and invasive species. The fruit-eating red-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer) is currently invading the main island of the archipelago, and its recent dispersal out of urbanized habitats raises questions about its potential to disperse noxious plant seeds along urban corridors and beyond. Indeed, the red-vented bulbul is considered a vector of several introduced plant species in its alien range including Miconia calvescens, Lantana camara, and Schinus terebinthifolius. We conducted a quantitative assessment of the bulbul's fruits consumption by analyzing the gut contents of shot birds. We estimated gut passage times for four species of fruit found in gut contents (S.terebinthifolius, Myrtastrum rufopunctatum, Passiflora suberosa, and Ficus prolixa) and tested the effects of bird digestion on seed germination rates for two species. Finally, we monitored the movements of individual VHF radio-tagged red-vented bulbuls. All of the consumed fruit species we identified here have red fleshy diaspore, including fruit of the shrub M.rufopunctatum that occurred frequently (9.6%) in bulbul gut samples. Median gut passage times were short (15-41min), corresponding to short-distance seed transportation (77-92m). The effect of gut passage was positive for the germination of the invasive S.terebinthifolius and negative for the endemic M.rufopunctatum, suggesting a potential bias in the contribution to the dispersal toward alien species. This study provides the first integrated assessment of mechanisms involved in the seed dispersal effectiveness of this high-concern invasive bird species that is expected to face similar plant communities in most of its alien range in tropical islands. More generally, our results enhance knowledge of synergies between non-native frugivores and plant species dispersal.

AB  - A total of 104 fecal specimens from 30 mammals, 12 birds, and 3 reptiles at the Phoenix Zoological Gardens, Miyazaki City, Japan, were examined for the presence of Campylobacter species. All che animals examined were healthy with no fecal abnormality. Twenty-three (22.1%) thermophilic campylobacters, (9 C. jejuni, 11 C. hyointestinalis, 2 C. coli, and 1 C. lari), were isolated from 11 animals (7 mammals and 4 birds). C. jejuni and C. hyointestinalis were the predominant species isolated from these zoo animals and C. hyointestinalis was isolated frequently from simians. As selective media influence the numbers and species of campylobacters isolated, the agar medium was not supplemented with cephalothin. Campylobacters were isolated most frequently when a combination of enrichment culture and selective agar plating was performed at 42 degrees C. For the epidemiological study, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) method was used as a tool to detect the heterogeneity of amplified DNAs of Campylobacter spp. isolated from zoo animals. The two arbitrary primers used in this study enabled even closely related strains of the same Campylobacter spp. to be differentiated. RAPD analysis revealed considerable diversity among the strains, suggesting that the transmission of Campylobacter spp. among animals in a defined area occurred through different mechanisms. Examination of the genotypic diversity among the multiple clones from the same host also revealed differences between clones. These results demonstrate that campylobacter populations in zoo animals are highly divergent. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In July 2019, a novel viral strain (JH2019C603) was isolated from sentinel cattle in Jinghong City, in the subtropical region of Yunnan Province, China. The virus replicated and caused cytopathological effects in both Aedes albopictus (C6/36) and Baby Hamster Syrian Kidney (BHK-21) cells. Agarose gel electrophoresis analysis revealed a viral genome comprised of 10 segments of double-stranded RNA, with a 1-2-2-1-1-1-1-1 migration pattern. Complete genome sequences of the JH2019C603 virus were determined through full-length cDNA amplification. Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid (aa) sequences of RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (Pol), Major subcore (T2) and Major core-surface (T13) showed that JH2019C603 clustered with Yonaguni orbivirus (YONOV) from Japan, with aa identities relative to YONOV of 97.7% (Pol), 99.0% (T2) and 98.5% (T13). However, phylogenetic analysis based on the aa sequences of the outer capsid protein one and two (OC1 and OC2) showed that JH2019C603 formed an independent branch in the phylogenetic tree, and its aa identity with YONOV was only 55.4% (OC1) and 80.8% (OC2), respectively. Compared with the prototype of YONOV, a notable sequence deletion was observed in the 3 ' non-coding region of NS1, with the NS1 of JH2019C603 encoded within segment 7 (Seg-7), in contrast to YONOV, which contains NS1 in Seg-6. These results indicate that JH2019C603 belongs to the YONOV lineage and might be a novel serotype or a highly variant strain of YONOV. These findings will facilitate the identification of new isolates and clarify their geographical distribution, epidemiology, genetic diversity and possible disease associations.

AB  - Long-term ecological monitoring provides valuable and objective scientific information to inform management and decision-making. In this article, we analyze 22 years of herpetofauna monitoring data from the Point Loma Ecological Conservation Area (PLECA), an insular urban reserve near San Diego, CA. Our analysis showed that counts of individuals for one of the four most common terrestrial vertebrates declined, whereas counts for other common species increased or remained stable. Two species exhibited declines in adult body length, whereas biomass pooled over the five most common species increased over time and was associated with higher wet season precipitation. Although the habitat and vegetation at PLECA have remained protected and intact, we suspect that changes in arthropod communities may be driving changes in the abundance, growth, and development of insectivorous lizards. This study underscores the value of long-term monitoring for establishing quantitative baselines to assess biological changes that would otherwise go undetected.

AB  - Here, we describe for the first time the prevalence and genetic properties of Bartonella organisms in wild rodents in Japan. We captured 685 wild rodents throughout Japan (in 12 prefectures) and successfully isolated Bartonella organisms from 176 of the 685 rodents (isolation rate, 25.7%). Those Bartonella isolates were all obtained from the rodents captured in suburban areas (rate, 51.8%), but no organism was isolated from the animals captured in city areas. Sequence analysis of rpoB and gltA revealed that the Bartonella isolates obtained were classified into eight genetic groups, comprising isolates closely related to B. grahamii (A-I group), B. tribocorum and B. elizabethae (B-J group), B. tribocorum and B. rattimassiliensis (C-K group), B. rattimassiliensis (D-L group), B. phoceensis (F-N group), B. taylorii (G-O group), and probably two additional novel Bartonella species groups (E-M and H-P). B. grahamii, which is one of the potential causative agents of human neuroretinitis, was found to be predominant in Japanese rodents. In terms of the relationships between these Bartonella genetic groups and their rodent species, (i) the A-I, E-M, and H-P groups appear to be associated with Apodemus speciosus and Apodemus argenteus; (ii) the C-K, D-L, and F-N groups are likely implicated in Rattus rattus; (iii) the B-J group seems to be involved in Apodemus mice and R. rattus; and (iv) the G-O group is probably associated with A. speciosus and Clethrionomys voles. Furthermore, dual infections with two different genetic groups of bartonellae were found in A. speciosus and R. rattus. These findings suggest that the rodent in Japan might serve as a reservoir of zoonotic Bartonella infection.

AB  - Although it is generally accepted that wetlands in drylands are subject to higher fire frequencies than wetlands in humid regions, little is known about how wetlands in varied hydrogeomorphic settings mediate runoff and material fluxes in the post-fire catchment landscape. This paper evaluates the intermediary role of wetlands in water and sediment dispersal through a wet season that followed the March 2015 wildfire in the Silvermine River catchment, Cape Town. Field and laboratory analyses of the development and dynamics of soil water repellency were conducted across terrestrial hillslope, river riparian zone and hillslope seepage wetland sites. The latter two sites had significantly lower soil water repellency than the terrestrial site immediately preceding the first large rainfall event, and soil moisture emerged as a significant predictor of soil water repellency, consistent with previous research. Remote sensing analysis of post-fire vegetation recovery revealed that the first emergence of new vegetation occurred within wetlands and other moisture-rich areas across the catchment, likely associated with intact rhizome networks of the predominant sprouting vegetation in these areas. This post-fire green flush could have served to enhance post-fire infiltration due to macropore flow along rhizome networks, and to reduce early wet season runoff and erosion due to the rapid establishment of rainfall-intercepting leaf and stem structures. Longitudinal investigations of post-fire river channel and bed sediment characteristics detected a transition in bed composition from gravel to sand through hillslope-channel coupling and channel bank erosion, and effective conveyance of sand through the catchment to a constructed wetland at the catchment outlet. Suspended sediment sampling upstream, within and downstream of this wetland suggested a relative sediment trap efficiency of similar to 87 to 99%, supporting previous observations of post construction aggradation at the head of the wetland, with serious implications for long term wetland maintenance and management. Insights from field and remote sensing studies were used to develop a conceptual geospatial model of the role of wetlands in varied hydrogeomorphic settings in post-fire catchment sediment (dis)connectivity. Hillslope seepage wetlands located across the burned region of the catchment were shown to play an important role in hillslope surface sediment trapping and erosion control, contrary to common assumptions, and sediment connectivity modelling is recommended as a tool for further research aimed at understanding the intermediary role of wetlands in drylands in material fluxes in post-fire landscapes.

AB  - The City of Enid (City) is located in Northwest Oklahoma and services a population of over 50,000 residents. The City of Enid water supply infrastructure relies completely on an existing groundwater supply. Like many municipalities, aging public works infrastructure and increasing customer demands require continuous infrastructure maintenance, improvement, and expansion.
   The City of Enid proactively initiated a surface water supply program to supplement the existing ground water supply in order to meet increasing demands and diversity its water portfolio. In 2015, the City of Enid authorized Garver, LLC and Freese and Nichols, Inc. to perform a raw water transmission study and hydraulic analysis to deliver raw water from Kaw Lake to Enid's proposed water treatment plant, approximately sixty-eight (68) miles away.
   This paper will focus on the major analysis methods and lessons learned during the corridor study of the raw water transmission pipeline. The study includes data gathering from several public and private agencies. Preliminary corridor alternatives were produced on the basis of minimizing known potential environmental and archeological impacts, potential impact to landowners, constructability concerns, topographic characteristics that negatively impact hydraulic profile, and maximizing permanent easement access. The preliminary corridors were broken up by length into geographical classifications that represent specific construction challenges. A corridor evaluation matrix was developed utilizing geographical, environmental, maintenance, and installation characteristics to classify sections of the corridor as a means of comparing the alternatives. Hydraulic models of the recommended corridor were developed based on Kaw Lake water level data, contour data obtained, and previously developed flow requirements. These models were used to determine pumping alternatives, and potential pipeline sizing. A pipeline optimization analysis was performed to compare the capital cost of various pipeline sizes to the annual pumping (power) costs over a twenty-five (25) year span. Cost estimating was included in the study based on corridor characteristics linked with data obtained on recent market trends.

AB  - The conversion of natural areas to human-dominated land uses results in loss, degradation, and fragmentation of wildlife habitat which often lead to species endangerment and local extinction. The risk of endangerment may be particularly acute for species that exist as metapopulations in which viability of the species is contingent upon dispersal of individuals among local sub-populations. This paper uses an optimization framework to investigate the problem of conserving metapopulations residing in areas at the urban-rural fringe. We compare the optimal allocation of preservation to outcomes of four other policy alternatives including the reserve-site-selection option that fully preserves habitat patches while allowing full development of the intervening dispersal matrix. In general, the optimal allocation includes some amount of preservation in both habitat patches and dispersal matrix, with the level of protection typically greater in habitat patches. The reserve-site-selection conservation option is optimal in only a few cases. Heterogeneity in terms of land use and landscape structure adds complexity to the optimal solution such that no one policy works well across all land units and in situations where the landscape structure is skewed, full protection of some land units and full development of others becomes more common.

AB  - Although the loss of species is often attributed to reductions in habitat area, heterogeneity and connectivity, species specific traits and taxonomic relatedness can be important in explaining which species groups may be most impacted by the fragmentation process. In this study, using urban grassland fragments within the Front Range of northern Colorado, USA, we quantified the degree to which grasshopper species numbers declined with reductions in habitat area. We then examined the degree to which subfamily grouping (Gomphocerinae, Melanoplinae, Oedipodinae) and variation in life history characteristics (body size, dispersal ability, feeding preference and juvenile emergence time) explained which grasshopper species groups might be most impacted by reductions in habitat size. Our results showed a strong species-area relationship for grasshoppers across the urban fragments. Grasshoppers in different subfamily groupings were found to respond differentially, with the Melanoplinae being least affected by reductions in habitat area, while the other subfamilies responded similarly and lost species at a higher rate. Species with different feeding strategies were also found to respond differentially, with forbivorous species being least affected by the reductions in habitat area, while the graminivorous and herbivorous (mixed-feeders) responded similarly and lost species at a higher rate. As Melanoplinae tend to be forb feeders, this may partially explain why the subfamily was not as affected by the fragmentation process as the Gomphocerinae and Oedipodinae (who tend to be grass and mixed-feeders, respectively). Species that differed in body size and dispersal ability did not display differential responses to reductions in habitat area.

AB  - Food webs in riparian corridors are increasingly viewed as embedded in complex riverine landscapes characterized by an amalgam of aquatic, semi-aquatic, and terrestrial habitats. However, the influence of riverine landscape pattern on trophic dynamics of riparian consumers remains largely unknown. We used naturally abundant stable isotope ratios (N-15) to compare trophic structure of ants (Formica subsericea) among riparian patch types (crop, grass/herbaceous, gravel bar, lawn, mudflat, shrub, swamp, and woody vegetation) at 12 riverine landscapes distributed along an urban-rural landscape gradient of the Scioto River, Ohio, USA. We expected that the diet of F. subsericea, a common generalist consumer, would reflect local prey availability and thus differences in trophic dynamics among patch types. Mean ant N-15 was higher in crop patches than in any other patch type, and was lowest in grass/herbaceous, lawn, shrub, and woody vegetation patches, suggesting that patch type was associated with trophic position of F. subsericea. We also found that the range of N-15, and thus trophic breadth, was significantly different by patch type, with woody vegetation exhibiting the greatest spread. Variability in canopy, tree and shrub cover, and the degree of urban development was positively correlated with N-15 range (R-2=0.78), pointing to the role of habitat structure in mediating trophic breadth of riparian ants. These findings provide evidence that riverine landscape pattern can strongly influence trophic dynamics of riparian arthropods. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Fragmentation has negative effects on ecosystems and can cause loss of habitats, increase of edges and isolation. Forests in northern Italy have strongly declined, because of the development of urban land, infrastructures and crops. In suburban areas forest patches often perform a variety of functions. This study used scenarios integrating both ecological and social principles to improve landscape multifunctionality in a suburban area of Northern Italy, with a special focus on the role of woody patches. We evaluated how improving some functions of woody patches (suitability for forest species, mitigation for road impact and recreation) can help creating a multifunctional landscape. We combined the scenario visualisation through GIS, the maximization of functions based on ecological principles, and the use of fuzzy logic. The scenarios obtained show that improving existing woods can help to maximize multiple functions. The scenario improving recreation is the most suitable to increase biodiversity, and it can also help to mitigate road impact. The scenario approach can help decision-makers during the planning process, because it is user-friendly. Comparing multiple scenarios can allow assessing if managing the landscape for one function may also accomplish other function(s).

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the potential contribution of car-borne flora to species dispersal in a suburban area in Flanders (Belgium). Therefore, motor vehicle-borne flora was evaluated monthly for a random sample of 20 cars between October 1988 and September 1989. At the end of the experiment 33 car-borne plant species, with a total of 690 seedlings were identified from mud, attached to these vehicles. There was considerable temporal variation in the mud mass attached to the vehicles and therefore also the size and composition of the vehicle-borne flora varied during the year. Because mud retention on cars is a crucial factor in seed dispersal., the number of emerging seedlings is negatively correlated with precipitation in the week preceding the sampling. The flora dispersed by vehicles consists mostly of species with small, light seeds and a persistent seed bank. Usually, they are pioneer species of nitrogen-rich habitats. The nature of the vehicle dispersed flora was compared with the local flora of road verges and differed significantly from this in, e.g., seed length, seed weight, ecological groups, Ellenberg indicator values for nitrogen supply, potential. dispersal strategies and rarity. A larger resemblance with the flora of the zone immediately adjacent to the carriageway was found. We only found a low similarity to other motor vehicle-borne floras.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is causing many victims worldwide and has generated a serious economic crisis. Substantial changes have occurred in the food and ornamental production chains. The aim of the present review has been to summarize some of the main effects that the pandemic is having on horticulture and on the new habits of people. Infections and quarantine measures have prevented the regular flow of certain goods and of connected services. Cases of shortages and/or surpluses, a lack of the availability of labor, and a reduction in demand for some food products and flowers have occurred. New food production approaches have emerged and a reconnection between farmers and consumers has been spreading, thereby facilitating product distribution. Moreover, during the forced isolation, people have had to face periods of stress. The benefits that can be derived from leisure activities related to flowers and ornamental plants, and from access to nature and urban green spaces are increasingly being recognized as relevant. The seriousness of the pandemic will inevitably lead to lasting changes. Therefore, the vulnerability of the pre-COVID-19 distribution chains should be considered and a new food production chain should be drawn up, to increase the resilience of such systems.

AB  - Parallel to the economical benefits brought by the oil industry in Mexico, there have been some negative environmental effects due to emission of pollutants to the atmosphere. Salamanca, a city located inside one of the most important industrial corridors of the country, has been frequently affected by elevated concentrations of sulfur dioxide and particle matter. However, little is known about volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which in this study are analyzed along with criteria pollutants and meteorological parameters during February-March 2003 at urban, suburban and rural sites. Although sulfur dioxide average levels were similar to 0.017 ppm, a high concentration event (similar to 0.600 ppm), attributable to emissions from the oil refinery and the thermoelectric power plant, was observed at the urban site at night time. The VOCs concentration varied from 170 +/- 50 ppbC (rural) to 699 +/- 212 (urban) and were constituted by 40% alkanes, 13% aromatics, 11% olefins and 11% of halogenated. The most abundant species were propane (167 +/- 40 ppbC), n-butane (91 +/- 23 ppbC), toluene (51 +/- 10 ppbC) and i-pentane (44 +/- 7 ppbC), that are related to combustion processes. Freon-114, methyl bromide and 1,2-dichloroethane which are likely emitted by application of pesticides, soil fumigation and fabrication of chemicals, showed high concentrations (48 +/- 10, 50 +/- 10 and 32 +/- 6 ppbC respectively) in the rural sites, highlighting the importance of control measurements implementation for these species, as they represent a potential hazard for public health. Moreover, these halocarbons showed similar ratios regardless the monitoring site, suggesting same source. Modeling results indicated that meteorological conditions generally transport air masses to the northeast rural areas where the highest concentrations of ozone were calculated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - 1. The Amazon basin hosts the Earth's highest diversity of freshwater fish. Fish species have adapted to the basin's size and seasonal dynamics by displaying a broad range of migratory behaviour, but they are under increasing threats; however, no study to date has assessed threats and conservation of Amazonian migratory fishes.
   2. Here, the available knowledge on the diversity of migratory behaviour in Amazonian fishes is synthesized, including the geographical scales at which they occur, their drivers and timing, and life stage at which they are performed.
   3. Migratory fishes are integral components of Amazonian society. They contribute about 93% (range 77-99%) of the fisheries landings in the basin, amounting to -US$436 million annually.
   4. These valuable fish populations are mainly threatened by growing trends of overexploitation, deforestation, climate change, and hydroelectric dam development. Most Amazonian migratory fish have key ecological roles as apex predators, ecological engineers, or seed-dispersal species. Reducing their population sizes could induce cascading effects with implications for ecosystem stability and associated services.
   5. Conserving Amazonian migratory fishes requires a broad portfolio of research, management, and conservation actions, within an ecosystem-based management framework at the basin scale. This would require trans-frontier coordination and recognition of the crucial importance of freshwater ecosystems and their connectivity.
   6. Existing areas where fishing is allowed could be coupled with a chain of freshwater protected areas. Management of commercial and subsistence species also needs fisheries activities to be monitored in the Amazonian cities and in the floodplain communities to allow assessments of the status of target species, and the identification of management units or stocks. Ensuring that existing and future fisheries management rules are effective implies the voluntary participation of fishers, which can be achieved by increasing the effectiveness and coverage of adaptive community-based management schemes.

AB  - In this study, we investigated whether river restoration was successful in re-establishing groundwater-surface water interactions in a degraded urban stream. Restoration measures included morphological changes to the river bed, such as the installation of gravel islands and spur dykes, as well as the planting of site-specific riparian vegetation. Standard distributed temperature sensing (DTS) and novel active and passive DTS approaches were employed to study groundwater-surface water interactions in two reference streams and an experimental reach of an urban stream before and after its restoration. Radon-222 analyses were utilized to validate the losing stream conditions of the urban stream in the experimental reach. Our results indicated that river restoration at the study site was indeed successful in increasing groundwater-surface water interactions. Increased surface water downwelling occurred locally at the tip of a gravel island created during river restoration. Hence, the installation of in-stream structures increased the vertical connectivity and thus groundwater-surface water interactions. With the methods presented in this publication, it would be possible to routinely investigate the success of river restorations in re-establishing vertical connectivity, thereby gaining insight into the effectiveness of specific restoration measures. This, in turn, would enable the optimization of future river restoration projects, rendering them more cost-effective and successful.

AB  - Nairobi National Park (NNP) is unable to incorporate the spatial and temporal dynamics of many migratory mammals that rely on the area as a dry season refuge because of its small size. During the wet season, wildlife must be able to migrate to the south into the Kitengela dispersal area. This area is privately owned and rapidly undergoing land-use change, which affects the structure and function of the dispersal corridors, jeopardising the ecological sustainability of the park. Private landholders in Kitengela incur most of the costs of keeping the dispersal areas open, but do not receive any compensation or revenue from benefits derived from tourism in the park. Here we present an analysis of the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for Nairobi and Kitengela residents for a new land management scheme in the dispersal area, in which local pastoralists leave their land open to wildlife and, by not engaging in fencing, land subdivision or poaching activities, receive monetary compensation for the incremental costs derived from use of their properties as a wildlife dispersal area. The results suggest that the aggregated financial support of urban residents might represent around $1.2 million per year for 5 years. This amount exceeds the economic losses caused by wildlife in the dispersal area, and different financial schemes of fund investment and the prioritisation of conservation regions could be implemented to ensure payments and keep the dispersal corridors open in perpetuity.

AB  - In most urban and agricultural landscapes, remnants of native vegetation are surrounded by an inhospitable matrix. Although vagile species come and go, many reptiles, amphibians and small mammals are effectively stranded and declining towards local extinction. In the same landscapes, other areas where these species are absent are improving in habitat quality, both through natural regeneration and active restoration efforts. So, for many species in many domesticated landscapes, there are too many individuals in some patches of decreasing quality and no individuals in patches of increasing quality. One solution to this situation is to move animals from those areas where there are plenty to suitable areas where there are none. These targeted translocations apply lessons learned from revegetation to dispersal-limited animals to in-fill distributional ranges, increase population size and improve both demographic and genetic connectivity, pushing nonequilibrial metapopulations away from extinction via an imposed mass effect. In contrast to conventional reintroduction schemes expensive, reactive interventions involving highly-trained specialists and captive-raised endangered species these inexpensive, proactive, community-driven initiatives aim to avert future declines by keeping common species common. Having introduced the wildlife restoration vision, we use two scenarios to illustrate the benefits of the approach to species, ecosystem function, ecological understanding, restoration practise and public engagement. As well as adhering to best-practise reintroduction techniques to ensure animal welfare is not compromised and avoid detrimental effects to source populations or release sites, we emphasize community participation, data quality and long-term accessibility as paramount to maximize learning opportunities.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the most influential land use changes globally and continues to affect wetland ecosystems and their biota. Freshwater turtles, which rely on both terrestrial and aquatic habitats to complete their life cycles, are one of the most endangered vertebrate groups, with approximately 60% of species threatened. Although habitat alteration caused by urbanization is recognized as one of the main threats to freshwater turtles, there is a paucity of studies quantifying the effects of terrestrial habitat change on turtle populations.
   The aim of this study was to determine how terrestrial land use change, associated with urbanization, influences the viability of freshwater turtle populations. Thirty-three wetlands were sampled for the southwestern snake-necked turtle (Chelodina colliei Gray, 1856) (Chelidae) between October 2016 and February 2017 within a region of continuing urban intensification. Land use and habitat types were classified at the aquatic-terrestrial interface and within a 300-m band around each wetland. Generalized linear mixed models were used to identify the land use variables that best explained the relative abundance of C. colliei.
   Turtle abundance and population structure varied widely among wetlands. The percentage of residential land use, and the presence and accessibility of fringing native vegetation, was positively associated with the relative abundance of C. colliei. The association with residential land use may be an artefact of historical land use, whereas the association with native vegetation is probably because adjacent vegetation provides connectivity with suitable nesting sites, and thus facilitates increased recruitment.
   This study shows how the modification of terrestrial habitat around wetlands may directly influence the population viability of freshwater turtles. Protection and restoration of native vegetation fringing urban wetlands is crucial to support the viability of remnant freshwater turtle populations.

AB  - A survey was done of the environments and substrata occupied by Loxosceles intermedia Mello-Leitao, 1934 and Loxosceles laeta (Nicolet, 1849) (Araneae: Sicariidae) in urban woods and anthropic constructions in Curitiba. In total, 2,099 trees, 364 decaying logs as well as stones and roots, built-up areas, and wasteland in six urban parks and 60 residences were inspected. In total, 1,775 m(2) of vegetation was inspected, but spiders and their vestiges were collected only in and around buildings in urban parks and residences. L. intemedia was more common than L. laeta and occurred both indoors and outdoors, whereas L. laeta was more common indoors in wooden houses. The two species did not occur in the same microhabitats, although both preferred paper, wood, and construction materials. Spiders collected in urban parks were heavier than those collected in residences, although only males collected in urban parks were larger than those from residences. The lack of vestiges indicative of a previous occupation in the urban parks suggested that both species occupied primarily the anthropic environment where they found numerous substrata that offered thermal isolation and suitable conditions for web fixation, ecdysis, and reproduction.

AB  - The importance and protection of mangrove ecosystems has been recognized in Brazilian Federal law since 1965. Being protected in law, however, has not always guaranteed their protection in practice. Mangroves are found in coastal and estuarine locations, which are prime real estate for the growth of cities, ports and other economic activities important for Brazilian development. In this mini-review we introduce what mangroves are and why they are so important. We give a brief overview of the microbial diversity found in mangrove sediments and then focus on diversity studies from Brazilian mangroves. We highlight the breadth and depth of knowledge about mangrove microbial communities gained from studying Brazilian mangroves. We report on the exciting findings of molecular microbial ecology methods that have been very successfully applied to study bacterial communities. We note that there have been fewer studies that focus on fungal communities and that fungal diversity studies deserve more attention. The review ends with a look at how a combination of new molecular biology methods and isolation studies are being developed to monitor and conserve mangrove ecosystems and their associated microbial communities. These recent studies are having a global impact and we hope they will help to protect and re-establish mangrove ecosystems.

AB  - Since its initial identification in ticks in 2010, Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) has been described in cattle, rodents, and primates. To better understand the diversity, evolution, and transmission of JMTV, we sampled 215 ticks, 104 cattle bloods, 216 bats, and 119 rodents in Wenzhou city, Zhejiang Province, China as well as 240 bats from Guizhou and Henan Provinces. JMTV was identified in 107 ticks (from two species), 54 bats (eleven species), 8 rodents (three species), and 10 cattle, with prevalence levels of 49.8, 11.8, 6.7, and 9.6 per cent, respectively, suggesting that bats may be a natural reservoir of JMTV. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that all the newly identified JMTVs were closely related to each other and to previously described viruses. Additionally, all tick and mammalian JMTV sampled in Wenzhou shared a consistent genomic structure, suggesting that the virus can cocirculate between ticks and mammals without observable variation in genome organization. All JMTVs sampled globally could be divided into two phylogenetic groups, Mantel tests suggested that geographic isolation, rather than host species, may be the main driver of JMTV diversity. However, the exact geographical origin of JMTV was difficult to determine, suggesting that this virus has a complex evolutionary history.

AB  - Recent studies using vegetation plots have demonstrated that habitat type is a good predictor of the level of plant invasion, expressed as the proportion of alien to all species. At local scale, habitat types explain the level of invasion much better than alien propagule pressure. Moreover, it has been shown that patterns of habitat invasion are consistent among European regions with contrasting climates, biogeography, history and socioeconomic background. Here we use these findings as a basis for mapping the level of plant invasion in Europe.
   European Union and some adjacent countries.
   We used 52,480 vegetation plots from Catalonia (NE Spain), Czech Republic and Great Britain to quantify the levels of invasion by neophytes (alien plant species introduced after ad 1500) in 33 habitat types. Then we estimated the proportion of each of these habitat types in CORINE land-cover classes and calculated the level of invasion for each class. We projected the levels of invasion on the CORINE land-cover map of Europe, extrapolating Catalonian data to the Mediterranean bioregion, Czech data to the Continental bioregion, British data to the British Isles and combined Czech-British data to the Atlantic and Boreal bioregions.
   The highest levels of invasion were predicted for agricultural, urban and industrial land-cover classes, low levels for natural and semi-natural grasslands and most woodlands, and the lowest levels for sclerophyllous vegetation, heathlands and peatlands. The resulting map of the level of invasion reflected the distribution of these land-cover classes across Europe.
   High level of invasion is predicted in lowland areas of the temperate zone of western and central Europe and low level in the boreal zone and mountain regions across the continent. Low level of invasion is also predicted in the Mediterranean region except its coastline, river corridors and areas with irrigated agricultural land.

AB  - Angola's forests are abundant and highly productive with enormous potential to support local needs and exportation. The forests are well distributed across the country, but the existing road network is generally poor and, in some cases, inappropriate. Based on our previous work examining deforestation patterns and the modeling of primary tree attributes of vegetation types, we proposed forest management zones (MZ) for future planning in Huambo province in Angola. Herein, that same framework is applied for the detection of the existing road network in Huambo and the proposal of alternative routes inside the MZ. We used analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and geographic information systems (GIS) to optimize connectivity among the existing forest plantations and their distance to the closest major cities within the province. We developed road suitability maps based on AHP and GIS to ensure safer driving conditions and contribute to the forest planner's access to the current plantations. According to the suitability map created, 59.51% of the total area is suitable for road development and is counted in classes 4 and 5 in automatic classification. Parameters such as geology, slope, distance from roads to the railway, soil types, elevation, flow accumulation, and aspect were used. We provide a completed assessment of the state of existing roads and evaluate the safety of the observed road sections based on the AHP method. The calculated weights of the factors were all consistent with the model used (consistency ratio was 0.09 < 0.1). Finally, we proposed the best alternative routes to the existing cities, MZ in miombo woodlands, and forest plantations inside the province. Our findings indicated that flow accumulation, soil type, and geology were the most significant factors impacting road construction. Overall, our framework is an important starting point for further research activities towards developing a spatial decision support system (SDSS) for planning road networks in Angola.

AB  - PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Tropical plant communities in fragmented forests are likely to experience an extinction debt, i.e., the habitat cannot support as many species as are present due to reduced habitat size and connectivity. There are few estimates of the number of species that represent extinction debt, and the number of extinctions over time has rarely been recorded. We recorded population sizes to assess threats and extinctions in gingers (sensu Zingiberales) in fragmented rainforest in Singapore, ca. 200 yr after fragmentation began.
   METHODS: We surveyed extant diversity and population sizes of gingers and used the results to estimate species survival. We critically assessed historic specimens to estimate initial extinctions and extinctions realized in present habitats.
   KEY RESULTS: We recorded 23 species, including five species previously presumed nationally extinct and four species omitted from the national checklist. The revised extinction rate is much lower than previously reported (12 vs. 37%). Most gingers have very small populations or miniscule ranges, implying that extinction debt has not been paid off.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ginger diversity remains high, but the number of species at immediate risk of extinction outnumber recorded extinctions. Although tropical forest fragments remain arks of plant diversity for a long time, extinction debt may be prevalent in all plant groups in Singapore. Slow relaxation of extinction debt should be explicitly identified as a conservation challenge and opportunity. For conserving plant diversity in tropical fragments, relaxation must be reversed through restoration of degraded landscapes and, where feasible, targeted ex situ conservation and planting.

AB  - Leaf spot and dieback were observed on box elder (Acer negundo) grown in a nursery in Tai'an city, Shandong Province, China, in 2019, with a disease incidence of 86%. The incidences of Exserohilum rostratum isolation were 75% from the shoots and 66.6% from the leaves of field-infected plants. Isolates were identified at the species level on the basis of morphological characteristics and through phylogenetic analysis of concatenated partial sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and cam, gapdh, tef1, rpb2, tub2, and his genes from the Exserohilum isolates. The effects of temperature on the mycelial growth of the Exserohilum rostratum isolates were also characterized. In greenhouse tests, seedlings inoculated with the pathogen exhibited systemic symptoms similar to those observed in the field. In pathogenicity experiments on shoots, wounded seedlings were observed to be blighted, suggesting that leaf spot and dieback may develop into more severe blight or dieback when high winds, sudden temperature decreases, or insect infestations occur. To our knowledge, this is the first report of dieback and leaf spot caused by E. rostratum on a species of A. negundo.

AB  - Inland pine barrens offer the rarest type of shrubland habitat in the northeastern United States and may contribute disproportionately to the regional diversity and conservation of shrubland birds. Testing local habitat specialization and estimating survey effort is needed to inform management of pine barrens for this rapidly declining avian group. We evaluated shrubland bird habitat associations in a heavily urbanized pine barrens of the northeastern United States, and used occupancy-detection sampling and analysis to estimate the number of sample points and surveys for point-based monitoring of shrubland birds in pine barrens. Although forest area was significantly greater than shrubland area, 8 of 11 reliably modeled species showed evidence of association for shrubland, and are thus potentially useful as indicators of pine barrens shrubland quality and management to avert succession. From the analysis of survey effort. we suggest two design options for point-based monitoring of shrubland birds in pine barrens: (1) include enough points to cover at least similar to 3% of the study area and survey each point >= 5 times preferably during 05:00-08:00 hr. or (2) reduce the point sample, to no less than about 2% of study area, and increase the survey replication to >= 10 surveys. Three surveys, as suggested by shrubland bird experts for anthropogenic early-successional habitats (e.g., utility corridors) and by others as a general rule, may require too many sample points to feasibly monitor shrubland birds in pine barrens.

AB  - We applied a river habitat quality (RHQ) assessment method to the Hai River Basin (HRB); an important economic centre in China; to obtain baseline information for water quality improvement; river rehabilitation; and watershed management. The results of the assessment showed that the river habitat in the HRB is seriously degraded. Specifically; 42.41% of the sites; accounting for a river length of 3.31 x 10(4) km; were designated poor and bad. Habitat in the plain areas is seriously deteriorated; and nearly 50% of the sites; accounting for a river length of 1.65 x 10(4) km; had either poor or bad habitats. River habitat degradation was attributable to the limited width of the riparian zone (5 m); lower coverage of riparian vegetation (40%); artificial land use patterns (public and industrial land); frequent occurrence of farming on the river banks and high volumes of solid waste (nearly 10 m(3)); single flow channels; and rare aquatic plants (1 category). At the regional scale; intensive artificial land use types caused by urbanization had a significant impact on the RHQ in the HRB. RHQ was significantly and negatively correlated with farmland (r = 1.000; p < 0.01) and urban land (r = 0.998; p < 0.05); and was significantly and positively correlated with grassland and woodland (r = 1.000; p < 0.01). Intensive artificial land use; created through urbanization processes; has led to a loss of the riparian zone and its native vegetation; and has disrupted the lateral connectivity of the rivers. The degradation of the already essentially black rivers is exacerbated by poor longitudinal connectivity (index of connectivity is 2.08-16.56); caused by reservoirs and sluices. For river habitat rehabilitation to be successful; land use patterns need to be changed and reservoirs and sluices will have to be regulated.

AB  - The Turkey Creek watershed in Johnson and Wyandotte Counties in the Kansas City, Kansas area has long been plagued with recurring flooding. Major flood control projects on this waterway include an early 1900's diversion of the creek at its confluence with the Kansas River through the construction of a tunnel.
   Providing a relatively flat corridor in an area of rolling hills, the Turkey Creek floodplain in the southwest region of Kansas City has been a target of transportation related development since the 1800's. The stream corridor includes a rail, highway and interstate system. Many changes have occurred to the stream system over time that have resulted in environmental degradation. These changes include floodplain filling, channel straightening, concrete lining, channel enclosures, filling in of on-stream lakes, and disruptions due to numerous road and utility crossings.
   Based on a U.S. House of Representatives resolution adopted February 2000, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Reconnaissance Study was authorized to evaluate the federal interest in solutions to recurring flood damages, environmental degradation and related water and land resource needs and opportunities. An expedited Reconnaissance Study was completed in July 2001. It recommended a number of different strategies to restore this urban stream and reduce flood damages. The environmental strategies included methods to stop stream downcutting, removing blockages to fish passage, retrofitting basins and swales for water quality benefits, acquiring remaining areas of open space, removing channel linings, reconnecting the floodplain and channel, emphasizing stormwater storage and infiltration systems over stormwater and floodwater conveyance systems, and implementing public information/awareness campaigns. The environmental strategies were complimented by flood damage reduction strategies that emphasized detention, relocations, flood proofing, and flood warning systems, in addition to structural flood protection.
   A Project Management Plan was prepared and the sponsors signed an agreement to proceed in June 2002. Local agencies are focused on developing a basin-wide multi-jurisdictional approach in this approximately 90% urbanized watershed. Baseline information is currently being prepared for an expected summer 2003 Feasibility Scoping Meeting. The Feasibility Study will identify a multi-purpose plan for flood damage reduction and environmental enhancement in the Turkey Creek watershed considering both existing and future conditions. The project integrates biological and water quality data prepared for a use attainability analysis with engineering principles and hydrologic and hydraulic models to develop an urban stream restoration plan to return wildlife to and increase public appreciation of the Turkey Creek corridor.

AB  - Wildland and wilderness refer to areas of land which have been subject to little or no modification by human activity. These areas are important due to their role as wildlife habitats, the contributions they make to air and water quality and for human recreation. However, the intermingling of wildland and homes also increases the risk to life and property through wildfires. Management of this risk requires current and detailed knowledge of the spatial extent of wildland. What constitutes wildland vegetation is often difficult to define and may be influenced by both the horizontal continuity and vertical structure. We present a method to map wildland vegetation based on a combination of a vertically stratified cover threshold and spatial morphology.. To test its practical application, the method was applied to airborne lidar data collected prior to a major wildfire that occurred in Australia in 2009. Distance between the lidar defined wildland extent and homes impacted by the fire was assessed and compared to previously published data using manual delineation of wildland extent. Results showed that the proportion of homes destroyed at the wildland boundary was greater than reported in previous fires and that there was an exponential decline in the proportion of homes destroyed as a function of distances to wildland. Although the method is objective the extent of wildland depends on the parameters which define thresholds of cover and lateral extent and connectivity. This highlights the need for a clear definition of wildland that can be used to determine extent using objective methods such as those described, whether this is in the context of quantifying wildfire vulnerability or other related applications such as ecological assessment and monitoring.

AB  - Human developments have detrimental effects on wildlife populations globally with carnivores being particularly sensitive. The bobcat (Lynx rufus) is often considered an adaptable mesocarnivore that occurs throughout varied landcover types within its wide distribution and may be less susceptible to the negative effects of development. Our objectives were to investigate the landscape occupancy dynamics of bobcats in a highly developed and densely populated region of the northeastern United States to evaluate the sensitivity of bobcat occurrence to natural and anthropogenic landscape features. We established a large-scale camera trapping survey throughout Rhode Island, USA, sampling from 2018 to 2020. Using dynamic occupancy models, we found initial site occupancy was positively influenced by the amount of forested wetland habitat, while increasing road density and shrub cover negatively influenced the probability of site colonization. Surprisingly, we found no hypothesized variables to influence site-level extirpation probability, or any seasonal effects on dynamic parameters. Lastly, we found that forest cover and road density negatively influenced the probability of detection. The probability of occupancy was high, >0.8, throughout much of the study area (49%), but we also found relatively high site transients, with the probability a site would change occurrence status from season to season at approximate to 0.27 in the majority of the study area (70%). Our results show that although bobcats can persist in human-dominated landscapes, they require contiguous natural areas to do so. Future expansion of road infrastructure may reduce habitat connectivity and increase road mortalities, thus jeopardizing the population.

AB  - 1. There is a growing concern that artificial light might affect local insect populations and disrupt their dispersal across the landscape. In this study, we investigated experimentally the effect of artificial light on flying insects in the field, with an emphasis on aquatic insects. We asked whether lights prevented the ability of insects to disperse across the landscape, a process that is crucial in colonising restored habitats.
   2. We set up six, c. 3.5m high downward facing high-pressure sodium streetlights along a permanently connected oxbow in the Spree River of eastern Germany. We collected insects using 12 flight intercept traps, each with trays at three different heights (0.5, 1.5 and 2.5m), placed at distances 0, 3, 40 and 75m from the lights and 5, 8 and 80m from water. The number of emerging aquatic insects in the study area was measured with six emergence traps. We emptied the traps 22 times between June and September 2010; the lights were on for 11 of these nights and off for the other 11.
   3. In total, we caught almost 27 times as many insects at traps 0m from the lights when the lights were on than when they were off. Most insects caught when the lights were on were aquatic, with Diptera being the most common order. Furthermore, the proportion of aquatic insects caught at traps 0, 3 and 40m from the lights when they were on was significantly higher than when they were off. On lit nights, more aquatic insects were captured per hour and m(2) (area in which flying insects were intercepted) at traps 0m from the lights than emerged from per square metre per hour from the Spree River.
   4. Our results suggest that adult aquatic insects can be negatively affected by artificial light and that city planners should take this into account when designing lighting systems along rivers.

AB  - Byrsonima coccolobifolia is a tropical plant from the Malpighiaceae family, distributed in the neotropical savanna fields and pollinated by bees known as "collecting-oil bees". In this study, conducted in a Cerrado area located on a farm in the city of Silvania, GO, the following hypothesis was tested: the greater the isolation degree of a plant, the lower its fruit production due to access difficulties for pollinators. Using a linear regression analysis, it was possible to relate the fruiting rate with the degree of isolation of each B. coccolobifolia individual and consequently it was found that the isolation had no influence on the pollination rate, an unexpected event that can be explained by the distance amongst individuals not being large enough to limit the movement of pollinators, or because cross-pollination was not the predominant form of reproduction, since the rate of cross-pollination was similar to self-pollination. It was also found that the proportion of fruits produced was lower than expected, a factor which may also have influenced the results.

AB  - Global recognition of the need for more liveable and "complete" streets has allowed for increased funding to bicycle and pedestrian projects. That said, many streets in urban neighbourhoods remain unsafe. This study hypothesises that some of these issues related to safety issues are tied to multi-lane, one-way streets, which exist primarily in urban business districts and historic neighbourhoods, often occupied by poor and minority residents. There has been little research in this area to test how one-way street configurations relate to collisions, crime and community. To examine this, we use three principal strategies: (1) a cross-sectional citywide evaluation using descriptive and inferential statistics on all collisions occurring within a five-year period in a midsized city; (2) a focused assessment of traffic collision data, crime data, counts of trees, housing valuation data, foreclosure and vacant and abandoned structures on a 13-block street segment with both one-and two-way streets and (3) a qualitative broken windows assessment, using photography to evaluate signs of visual distress on one-way versus twoway segments. Our results show a higher incidence of collisions and injuries on multi-lane streets than on their two-way counterparts - for motorists, bikes and pedestrians. Our photographic assessment suggests that these street typologies contribute to degradation and erosion of community. Our results show that neighbourhoods with one-way multi-lane streets experience greater abandonment, lower housing values and slower increases in property values. This research supports expanded thinking about one-to two-way street conversion as a method to improve safety, connectivity, community and sustainability.

AB  - Remote sensing of urban land surface temperatures (LST) has been conducted based largely on pixel-by-pixel correlation with land use and land cover (LULC) types. Few studies have examined the spatial variations of LST within land use zoning polygons, in spite of its significance on the knowledge of environmental implications or planning practices. This study aimed to analyze the spatial patterns of LSTs and to explore factors contributing to the LST variations in the city of Indianapolis. Four Terra's ASTER images, representing distinct seasons, were used in conjunction with other types of spatial data for the analysis. The potential factors were grouped into the categories of LULC composition, biophysical conditions, intensity of human activities, and landscape pattern. Statistical analyses were conducted to determine the relative importance of each group of the variables. Moreover, the spatia variations of LST were examined at both the residential and general zoning levels, so that the environmental effect of urban planning on LST may be assessed. By analyzing the mean and standard deviation values of normalized LSTs, the seasonal dynamics of LST were finally studied. Results show that the biophysical variables were most significant in explaining the spatial variations of LST. At both zoning levels, LST possessed a weaker relationship with the LULC compositions than with the biophysical variables. Principal component analysis further indicates that the cumulative variance was always larger in residential zoning, implying that the factors contributing to the LST variations in general zoning might be more complex than those for the residential zoning. An interesting finding of this study was in the relationship between LST and the landscape metrics of zoning polygons. It suggests that smaller residential zoning polygons were associated with larger temperature variations, and that the more complex in shape a residential zoning category was, the more intrapolygon variation of LST tended to be. These correlations, however, did not exist in the nonresidential zoning categories. The spatial pattern of LST in Indianapolis may be characterized as concentric in the central part of the city, a hot ring along the Highway 465, and several hot corridors along the radial highways outward to the countryside. The seasonal fluctuation of LST was weak in the central part, but increased towards the countryside. Due to the amount of anthropogenic heat, land use zones with less human activities were found to have a strong seasonal variability, whereas the zones with intensive human activities fluctuated less in LST.

AB  - Molecular biology techniques allow for increasingly more thorough identification and understanding of functionality of microorganisms consortia involved in wastewater treatment or waste degradation processes. In this work, the bacterial community of activated sludge from the wastewater treatment plant in Zgierz (Poland) was identified. As a result, a somewhat limited database of microorganisms living in Polish wastewater treatment plants was supplemented with new data. The composition of bacterial community was identified with molecular biology techniques in two main stages: (1) isolation of genomic DNA, (2) DNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis of the isolated sequences. The analyses revealed that the most abundant phylum was Proteobacteria with Betaproteobacteria present in highest numbers. Composition of the activated sludge was relatively low in Chloroflexi class bacteria. It is in alignment with macroscopic observations indicating good settlement properties of the activated sludge from the wastewater treatment plant in Zgierz. It was determined that aerobic (redox) conditions in the activated sludge chamber did not influence the composition of bacterial community. They might only cause increase in the contribution of aerobic bacteria in the aerated (oxygenated) part of the chamber or the anaerobic organisms in its anaerobic (deoxygenated) section.

AB  - Prevalence of influenza A virus (IAV) infections in northern-breeding waterfowl has previously been reported to reach an annual peak during late summer or autumn; however, little is known about IAV infection dynamics in waterfowl populations persisting at high-latitude regions such as Alaska, during winter. We captured mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) throughout the non-breeding season (August-April) of 2012-2015 in Fairbanks and Anchorage, the two largest cities in Alaska, to assess patterns of IAV infection and antibody production using molecular methods and a standard serologic assay. In addition, we used virus isolation, genetic sequencing, and a virus microneutralization assay to characterize viral subtypes and to evaluate the immune response of mallards captured on multiple occasions through time. We captured 923 mallards during three successive sampling years: Fairbanks in 2012/13 and 2013/14, and Anchorage in 2014/15. Prevalence varied by age, season, and year/site with high and relatively stable estimates throughout the non-breeding season. Infected birds were detected in all locations/seasons except early-winter in Fairbanks during 2013/14. IAVs with 17 combinations of hemagglutinin (H1-5, H7-9, H11, H12) and neuraminidase (N1-6, N8, N9) subtypes were isolated. Antibodies to IAVs were detected throughout autumn and winter for all sampling locations and years, however, seroprevalence was higher among adults and varied among years. Mallards exhibited individual heterogeneity with regard to immune response, providing instances of both seroconversion and seroreversion to detected viral subtypes. The probability that an individual transitioned from one serostatus to another varied by age, with juvenile mallards having higher rates of seroconversion and seroreversion than adults. Our study provides evidence that a diversity

AB  - Most large reserves in Brazil do not hold viable populations of jaguars to guarantee the species' long-term survival. Corridors linking populations have been identified as a potential tool to avoid negative effects of isolation, increasing population viability. Here, we performed a Brazil-wide evaluation of potential large scale corridors connecting protected jaguar populations. Six variables (human population size, dam reservoir size, number of dams, roads, railways and cities) expected to negatively impact jaguar movement were analyzed across 180 potential corridors connecting 298 protected jaguar areas. We established overall disturbance scores for the corridors using a principal components analysis and compared them among the Brazilian biomes. We further investigated which variables separated biomes using a canonical variates analysis. The Atlantic Forest and the semi-arid Caatinga have the most impacted potential corridors, whereas the Amazon and Pantanal still have the best potential corridors. Corridor quality in the Cerrado grasslands was intermediate. All variables but human population size and corridor length contributed significantly to differences in corridor variables among biomes. Our conclusions suggest that we need to plan the implementation of large scale corridors in the Amazon, Pantanal and particularly the Cerrado soon, while potential corridors might still be economically viable. In the much more impacted Atlantic Forest and Caatinga, the need for conservation actions is strongest, but logistical difficulties and costs may turn implementation of corridors unfeasible.

AB  - Coffee endophytes have been studied for almost 74 years, and several studies have demonstrated coffee-endophytic fungi with antibacterial and antifungal potential for human and plant pathogens. In this study, we isolated and identified a total of 235 strains of endophytic fungi from coffee leaf tissues collected in four coffee plantations in Pu'er city, Yunnan province, China. Molecular identification was carried out using maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS1-5.8S rDNA-ITS2) sequences, while the colonization rate and the isolation frequency were also calculated. Two pathogenic fungi (Alternaria alternata and Penicillium digitatum) and two pathogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas syringae and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica) were used for screening the antagonistic activities of 61 strains of coffee-endophytic fungi by a dual-culture test assay while maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis confirmed their natural classification. This is the first study of coffee-leaf-endophytic fungal diversity in China, and the results revealed that coffee-endophytic fungi from this study belong to the Ascomycota, distributed among two classes, 10 orders, and 17 families. Concurrently, endophytic fungi isolates distributed in Arthrinium, Biscogniauxia, Daldinia, Diaporthe, and Nigrospora showed strong antagonistic activities against the pathogens. For the pathogens Alternaria alternata and Pseudomonas syringae, Nigrospora XCE-7 showed the best inhibitory effects with inhibition rates of 71.76% and 61.11%, respectively. For the pathogen Penicillium digitatum, Daldinia ME-9 showed the best inhibitory effect with a 74.67% inhibition rate, while Biscogniauxia PTE-7 and Daldinia T5E-1-3 showed the best inhibitory effect with a rate of 60.42% against the pathogen Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica. Overall, our study shows the diversity of coffee endophytes in four coffee-growing areas in Pu'er city, Yunnan province, China, and their potential use as biological control agents against two fungal and two bacterial pathogens.

AB  - Highly specialised biota occurring at hydrothermally active vents on the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge (nMAR: from south of Iceland to the Equator) have been the subject of numerous research projects over the 36-year period since these habitats were first discovered in the region. When hydrothermal activity ceases, biota endemic to hydrothermally active habitats are lost, and a new biota colonise these sites. Little is known about the biota colonising hydrothermally inactive sulphide habitats on the nMAR, although these sites may be the target of deep-sea mining within the next decade. In this review, we seek to clarify the current knowledge of biological communities colonising hydrothermally active habitats and inactive sulphide habitats on the nMAR. To achieve this, we (1) used a systematic review process to update the species list of benthic invertebrates associated with hydrothermally active habitats, (2) conducted a regional biogeographic analysis of hydrothermally active vent fields on the nMAR, (3) undertook a comprehensive literature review to provide a descriptive account of biological communities, and (4) identified key knowledge gaps in the current understanding of nMAR hydrothermally active and inactive ecosystems. Our updated species list increases the number of benthic invertebrates recorded from hydrothermally active habitats on the nMAR to 158 taxa. Our regional biogeographic analysis separates nMAR hydrothermal vent fields into distinct clusters based on depth/latitude and chimney composition. Vent fields close to the Azores (Menez Gwen, Lucky Strike, Rainbow) formed a separate cluster from those at greater depths south of the Azores (Broken Spur, TAG, Snake Pit, Logatchev, and Ashadze-1). Moytirra, located north of the Azores, clustered separately, as did Lost City with its unique carbonate chimneys. We present detailed information on the biological communities at hydrothermally active and inactive habitats in this region, and discuss the information available on the diversity, ecosystem function, trophic relationships, connectivity, temporal variability, and resilience and recovery of these communities. Many knowledge gaps still exist, with detailed information needed on all aspects of the biological communities at hydrothermally active habitats and inactive sulphide habitats on the nMAR to understand and predict impacts from natural and human-induced disturbances in the region.

T2  - CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Pickled cowpea (Vigna unguiculata [Linn.] Walp) is a popular fermented vegetable in China that is made by spontaneous fermentation. Prior to this study, little was known about its microbial community. Eighteen pickled cowpea samples were collected in Enshi City, China, in 2018. The bacterial diversity within these samples was evaluated using a combination of high-throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq platform) targeting the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene sequence and culture-dependent methods. A total of 456,318 high-quality 16S rRNA gene sequence reads were obtained, and these reads were clustered into 19,712 OTUs with 97.0% similarity. The core bacterial phyla were Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes; the core bacterial genera were Levilactobacillus, Lactiplantibacillus, Companilactobacillus, Pediococcus, Lactobacillus, Weissella, and Pseudomonas. Using the spread-plating method, 39 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains were isolated and identified based on the nearly complete 16S rRNA gene sequence. Of these, 37 were identified as Lactiplantibacillus plantarum group, while the other two were classified as Limosilactobacillus fermentum and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus. These results indicate a high relative abundance of LAB in traditional pickled cowpea, especially Lactobacillaceae species, which likely contribute to fermentation. This study would provide information on the LAB population of Pickled cowpea and indicated that the Pickled cowpea could be a good source for isolation of lactic acid bacteria.

AB  - Development of the Hamlet of Baker Lake (Qamani'tuaq) in the central Canadian Arctic during the 1950s was typical of the local urbanization that has occurred in Arctic regions during the latter half of the 20th century. The effects of urbanization on bird populations were examined by comparing populations before and after 1950, comparing populations in anthropogenic ecosystems with natural ones, and recording the presence or absence of exotic species usually associated with human dwellings and settlements. Of a total 60 local species, 21 had not been reported prior to 1950. Most of these were waterfowl, shorebirds, and gulls, all species that benefited from the presence of sewage lagoons and a refuse dump, or were associated with building sites (American robin). Semipalmated plovers were associated with gravel pits and gravel roadsides, whereas semipalmated sandpipers, Lapland longspurs, homed larks, Savannah sparrows, and white-crowned sparrows were most abundant in town. Vagrants from south of the tree line have been reported from the study site. It is hypothesized that climatic amelioration in association with the development of urban ecosystems may have encouraged migration overshoots in these species. These vagrants may be the early colonizers that eventually result in breeding range extensions, as has been observed in several waterfowl species, American robins, and white-throated sparrows. Twelve apparent species losses have occurred since 1950, but these are likely due to general scarcity or lack of observers rather than reduced abundance. No exotic "city" species, such as rock doves, European starlings, or house sparrows, have been recorded in Baker Lake. It is not anticipated that these species would become established or survive at Baker Lake in the near future, because of its isolation and severe winters.

AB  - Exploring the impacts of landscape pattern on ecosystem services (ESs) and their trade-offs could provide a new way to improve ESs without largely altering land use types. Using the City Belt along the Yellow River in Ningixa (CBYN) as a case study, we quantified five critical ESs (one provision service of crop production, three regulating services of carbon sequestration, nutrient retention and sand fixation, and one cultural service of recreational opportunity) in 1989-2019 through CASA model, InVEST model and empirical equations. Then we calculated landscape pattern metrics at landscape and class level through Fragstats 4.3 across multiple scales and quantified their impacts on each ES and ES trade-offs through random forest analysis, self-organizing mapping analysis and multivariable regression tree. The results suggested that 3 km is more suitable for analyzing the impacts of landscape pattern on ESs in the CBYN. The nonlinear relations between landscape pattern metrics and each ES were fitted with adjusted R2 ranging from 0.26 to 0.51, indicating the significant but limited impacts of landscape pattern on ESs. Specially, landscape-level metrics of CONTAG, SHDI and FRACMN have higher impacts on ESs than class-level ones. Significant synergies existed among agricultural production, carbon sequestration and nutrient retention, except in mountain region with higher or lower fragmentation. Sand fixation has synergy relations with the former three ESs, which would be altered in situations with higher or lower diversity. Our results provide a new direction for land use management to achieve high-quality development without largely altering existing land use situation.

AB  - In this paper we review current approaches and recent advances in research on climate impacts and adaptation in South Africa. South Africa has a well-developed earth system science research program that underpins the climate change scenarios developed for the southern African region. Established research on the biophysical impacts of climate change on key sectors (water, agriculture, and biodiversity) integrates the climate change scenarios but further research is needed in a number of areas, such as the climate impacts on cities and the built environment. National government has developed a National Climate Change Response White Paper, but this has yet to translate into policy that mainstreams adaptation in everyday practice and longer-term planning in all spheres and levels of government. A national process to scope long-term adaptation scenarios is underway, focusing on cross-sectoral linkages in adaptation responses at a national level. Adaptation responses are emerging in certain sectors. Some notable city-scale and project-based adaptation responses have been implemented, but institutional challenges persist. In addition, a number of knowledge gaps remain in relation to the biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change. A particular need is to develop South Africa's capacity to undertake integrated assessments of climate change that can support climate-resilient development planning. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Cryptococcus neoformans acts as a major etiology of human infections in immunocompromised, cancer and transplant patients. The present study was conducted to detect the occurrence and antifungal resistance of C. neoformans in domestic and feral pigeons in and around Kolkata, a metropolitan city in India with considerable size of pigeon population. Weathered droppings of domestic and feral pigeons (n=917) were collected from different pet bird shelters, different buildings and other places. Isolation and identification of C. neoformans was performed based on cultural, biochemical properties. Antifungal sensitivity of the confirmed isolates were performed according to standard CLSI protocols with seven antifungals and caspofungin. A total of 153(16.68%) samples were found positive for Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans. All the isolates possessed CNLAC1 outer gene in PCR. Antifungal sensitivity revealed marked resistance to amphotericin-B (33.33%), fluconazole (20.91%), flucytosine (11.11%) and ketoconazole (8.49%). This is of great concern as the study area (Kolkata) is a densely populated city and the birds are in close proximity to the people.

AB  - The greatest number of reptiles having melanism (the number of specimens and species) have been recorded in the Caucasus in populations of five Darevskia species: Darevskia alpina, D. brauneri, D. lindholmi, D. pontica and D. rudis. The occurrence of melanistic specimens in reptiles can be explained by the influence of geochemical anomalies, thermoregulatory adaptation, isolation, and occurence in the periphery of their range. Melanism of D. lindholmi appears to depend on geochemical factors. The melanistic specimens of D. rudis, D. pontica and D. brauneri were found in a city on the northeastern boundary of their range. D. alpina was recorded in the mountains on the eastern periphery of the range.

AB  - Studies report the occurrence of Leishmania (Leishmania) hertigi in northern states of Brazil. In the present investigation, we describe the isolation of L. (L.) hertigi from a porcupine (Coendou sp.) found in Brasilia, Federal District, center-west region of Brazil. During a study on canine visceral leishmaniasis conducted in the city of Brasilia, Federal District, a porcupine was found dead on a public road. The animal was identified and fragments of intact skin and spleen were collected for isolation of parasite in the culture. This report of the occurrence of L. hertigi in another part of Brazil may help establish the distribution of this parasite in the country. Further studies are needed to better understand the role of L. hertigi in the pathology and pathogenesis of leishmaniasis and its survival in mammals and possible vectors.

AB  - Many reports have documented that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the influents of municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) correlates with the actual epidemic situation in a given city. However, few data have been reported thus far on measurements upstream of WWTPs, i.e. throughout the sewer network. In this study, the monitoring of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Prague wastewater was carried out at selected locations of the Prague sewer network from August 2020 through May 2021. Various locations such as residential areas of various sizes, hospitals, city center areas, student dormitories, transportation hubs (airport, bus terminal), and commercial areas were monitored together with four of the main Prague sewers. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was determined by reverse transcription - multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-mqPCR) after the precipitation of nucleic acids with PEG 8,000 and RNA isolation with TRIzolTM Reagent. The number of copies of the gene encoding SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N1) per liter of wastewater was compared with the number of officially registered COVID-19 cases in Prague. Although the data obtained by sampling wastewater from the major Prague sewers were more consistent than those obtained from the small sewers, the correlation between wastewater-based and clinical-testing data was also good for the residential areas with more than 7,000 registered inhabitants. It was shown that monitoring SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater sampled from small sewers could identify isolated occurrences of COVID-19-positive cases in local neighborhoods. This can be very valuable while tracking COVID-19 hotspots within large cities.

AB  - During 1995-2000, mosquitoes were collected from sites throughout Rhode Island and tested for the presence of arboviruses. Mosquito trapping was done weekly from June to October with CO2-baited light traps. In all, 186,537 mosquitoes belonging to 7 different genera were collected, of which Coquillettidia perturbans was most abundant. A total of 6,434 pools were processed for arbovirus isolation, from which 193 arboviral isolations were made. These included 109 Highlands J, 71 eastern equine encephalomyelitis, 1 California encephalitis serogroup, 2 Jamestown Canyon, 3 Cache Valley, and 9 Flanders viruses. Our isolations of Flanders virus represent the 1st reported occurrence of this virus in Rhode Island. After the 1999 sudden occurrence of the West Nile virus (WN) in the New York City area, a dead-bird surveillance program was started to test for this virus. Although no isolations of WN were made from mosquitoes, 87 virus isolations were made from a total of 330 wild birds tested. All the WN-infected birds were either American crows or blue jays. Isolation of WN from dead birds marked the 1st documented appearance of this virus in Rhode Island. Significant interannual variation of arbovirus activity in Rhode Island prompted us to examine if climate-associated factors such as rainfall and temperature correlate with virus activity. Total rainfall amounts from May to June were higher than normal in 1996 and 1998. These years showed significantly higher arbovirus activity. Deviations from normal temperature showed low correlation with arbovirus activity during the 6-year study period. Therefore, precipitation appeared to be more important than temperature in predicting arbovirus activity in Rhode Island.

AB  - What remains of the nuclear age is not only radioactive waste, but also communities, geographies and geologies. In the city of Carlsbad, New Mexico, a group of local actors has been attempting to make their geological formation, the Salado Formation, eligible and desirable for the disposal of the country's high-level radioactive waste. Carlsbad already hosts the world's only operational deep geological repository, named the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). The facility receives regular shipments of low and medium level military radioactive waste to be confined from the biosphere for the next 10,000 years. The city of Carlsbad "stays with the trouble" in that it has to deal with the remains of the nuclear age. Taking this group of local actors as the object of its analysis, the article makes two contributions. Firstly, through an ethnographic inquiry, it offers a symmetrical and complementary account to existing studies on the siting of risky technoscientific projects that mainly focus on opposition movements and often neglect actions undertaken by those who support such projects. Secondly, it describes how those actors conceive their becoming as dependent on their ability to remain "nuclear" through the continued disposal of radioactive waste in the depths of the Salado Formation. The article concludes by drawing attention to the anticipation of "slow violences" that may result of the end of nuclear life, without excluding those generated by the persistent, undesirable, toxic and harmful encounters with radioactivity.

AB  - Land transformation reduces biodiversity and regional sustainability, with land price being an indicator of the opportunity cost to a landowner of resisting land conversion. However, reliable spatially explicit databases of current land prices are generally lacking in developing countries. We used tools from data science to scrape 1,487 georeferenced land prices in southern Kenya from the internet. Prices were higher for land near cities and in areas of high agricultural productivity, but also around the Maasai Mara National Reserve. Predicted land prices ranged from US$662 to US$4,618,805 per acre. Land speculation associated with expanding urbanization increases the opportunity and acquisition costs of maintaining conservation buffer zones, corridors, and dispersal areas. However, high land values are also found adjacent to a world-famous tourist destination. Profit-driven turnover of ownership, subdivision, and transformation of land is occurring at a rapid pace in southern Kenya, to the detriment of savanna biodiversity and the sustainability of the pastoral social-ecological system.

AB  - Large populations of free-roaming cats (FRCs) generate ongoing concerns for welfare of both individual animals and populations, for human public health, for viability of native wildlife populations, and for local ecological damage. Managing FRC populations is a complex task, without universal agreement on best practices. Previous analyses that use simulation modeling tools to evaluate alternative management methods have focused on relative efficacy of removal (or trap-return, TR), typically involving euthanasia, and sterilization (or trap-neuter-return, TNR) in demographically isolated populations. We used a stochastic demographic simulation approach to evaluate removal, permanent sterilization, and two postulated methods of temporary contraception for FRC population management. Our models include demographic connectivity to neighboring untreated cat populations through natural dispersal in a metapopulation context across urban and rural landscapes, and also feature abandonment of owned animals. Within population type, a given implementation rate of the TR strategy results in the most rapid rate of population decline and (when populations are isolated) the highest probability of population elimination, followed in order of decreasing efficacy by equivalent rates of implementation of TNR and temporary contraception. Even low levels of demographic connectivity significantly reduce the effectiveness of any management intervention, and continued abandonment is similarly problematic. This is the first demographic simulation analysis to consider the use of temporary contraception and account for the realities of FRC dispersal and owned cat abandonment.

We surveyed 15 locations in both urban and peri-urban habitats (n = 30). Boundaries of our survey areas coincided with those of National Park Service (NPS) areas in central Virginia. Over a 14-month period, we used five trap-types to document species in three guilds. A total of 9 and 15 species were documented at urban and peri-urban locations, respectively. Top predators Canis latrans (Coyote) and Felis rufus (Bobcat) were undetected at urban sites, while mesopredators were consistently more abundant. The absence of four small prey species and reduced abundances of the most common native generalist, Peromyscus leucopus (White-footed Mouse), were also associated with urban locations. Multivariate analyses of relative abundance data indicated significantly dissimilar mammal communities in urban and peri-urban locations. Shrub cover was highest in peri-urban locations, while grass cover was highest in urban sitesa pattern that was only marginally significant due to greater variability among these sites. The exotic grass Microstegium vimineum (Japanese Stiltgrass) was present at several urban sites and contributed to the complex relationship between percent grass cover and the small-mammal assemblages that we surveyed. Our results suggest that disturbances that reduce the recruitment of shrubs and other native plants and promote the spread of invasive grasses may have severe consequences for small-mammal communities. In addition, culturally preserved areas within both survey sites (i.e., battlefields planted with fescue grasses) were inhospitable to most small-mammal species and wildlife in general. In many NPS areas, there is great opportunity for development of adaptive management strategies that integrate ongoing NPS efforts to control invasive plant species with the enhancement of wildlife habitat in both culturally and naturally preserved areas. There is an urgent need for the conservation of native habitat in NPS areas and non-park sites threatened by urbanization. The primary focus of these efforts should include the control of exotic species and mesopredators, facilitation of native shrub recruitment, and, in many of these areas, the ecological restoration of historic sites. NPS lands in urbanized areas offer unique conditions for wildlife management and abundant opportunities for conserving native communities.

AB  - Many authors have concluded that habitat loss has a greater influence on biodiversity than habitat fragmentation per se. Yet, several animal species have been shown to be reluctant to move across inhospitable landscape matrices, a phenomenon that would be expected to exacerbate fragmentation effects. In this study, we tested the ability of a forest songbird (Ovenbird, Seiurus aurocapilla) to move across two contrasting landscapes whose matrix (intensively managed forest) would be expected to be relatively permeable compared to agricultural or urban matrices. We hypothesized that males would be less likely to return to their territory in a landscape dominated by forest generally unsuitable for breeding (spruce plantations) than in another dominated by potential breeding habitat (deciduous forest). The probability of resighting translocated males (n = 48) on their territory was significantly lower in the plantation landscape and this relationship was consistent over two successive years. Neither translocation time nor body mass, time of capture, or structural size were significant predictors of probability of resighting. Although this species is sufficiently vagile to return quickly to its territory (e.g. one male returning in less than 2 h), these results indicate that even a forested matrix may impose a resistance to the movements of a forest bird species when its structure or composition differs from that of breeding habitat. Matrix resistance to movements potentially restricts the ability of individuals to detect and colonize suitable habitat fragments. Less vagile species would be even more affected and, therefore, we submit that a more inclusive perspective on effects of landscape change is warranted. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - WORLD ANIMAL REVIEW

AB  - This article explores the relationships between cattle ranching, landuse, deforestation, rural employment and biodiversity. If outlines a series of principles to initiate the transformation of the present system of cattle ranching into something more sustainable, less incompatible with biological diversity and more appropriate for human welfare. Although the analyses and the numbers are based on the Colombian case, they are typical of the situation in the Latin American tropics. The case of Colombia is perhaps extreme in all aspects and therefore particularly instructive. The enormous biological diversity, at risk from production systems, which are blamed for causing a concentration of landownership, inequalities, migration from the countryside to the cities, rural poverty and environmental degradation, demands imaginative and viable technological answers at all levels of production. But, in addition, in a country devastated by violence, the strategy for the environmental rehabilitation of cattle ranching must coincide with social reform. The article demonstrates, with examples, the application of each one of the principles for the transformation of the current cattle ranching system: abundant biomass and energy, diversity of plant species, intercropping, hedges, living fences and biological corridors, efficient use of manure, diversity of habitats, reduction in the use of pesticides and other toxic compounds and appropriate prairie management.
   These principles, and the examples outlined in the article, are applicable on any scale and in any environmental, social and cultural context, as long as the methodology is identified to incorporate the biological variables and economic parameters in an appropriate technological model.

AB  - Invasive mammalian carnivores contribute disproportionately to declines in global biodiversity. In California, nonnative red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) have significantly impacted endangered ground-nesting birds and native canids. These foxes derive primarily from captive-reared animals associated with the fur-farming industry. Over the past five decades, the cumulative area occupied by nonnative red fox increased to cover much of central and southern California. We used a landscape-genetic approach involving mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and 13 microsatellites of 402 nonnative red foxes removed in predator control programs to investigate source populations, contemporary connectivity, and metapopulation dynamics. Both markers indicated high population structuring consistent with origins from multiple introductions and low subsequent gene flow. Landscape-genetic modeling indicated that population connectivity was especially low among coastal sampling sites surrounded by mountainous wildlands but somewhat higher through topographically flat, urban and agricultural landscapes. The genetic composition of populations tended to be stable for multiple generations, indicating a degree of demographic resilience to predator removal programs. However, in two sites where intensive predator control reduced fox abundance, we observed increases in immigration, suggesting potential for recolonization to counter eradication attempts. These findings, along with continued genetic monitoring, can help guide localized management of foxes by identifying points of introductions and routes of spread and evaluating the relative importance of reproduction and immigration in maintaining populations. More generally, the study illustrates the utility of a landscape-genetic approach for understanding invasion dynamics and metapopulation structure of one of the world's most destructive invasive mammals, the red fox.

AB  - Hybridization drives the evolutionary trajectory of many species or local populations, and assessing the geographic extent and genetic impact of interspecific gene flow may provide invaluable clues to understand population divergence or the adaptive relevance of admixture. In North America, hares (Lepus spp.) are key species for ecosystem dynamics and their evolutionary history may have been affected by hybridization. Here we reconstructed the speciation history of the three most widespread hares in North America - the snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), the white-tailed jackrabbit (L. townsendii) and the black-tailed jackrabbit (L. californicus) - by analysing sequence variation at eight nuclear markers and one mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) locus (6240 bp; 94 specimens). A multilocus-multispecies coalescent-based phylogeny suggests that L. americanus diverged similar to 2.7 Ma and that L. californicus and L. townsendii split more recently (similar to 1.2 Ma). Within L. americanus, a deep history of cryptic divergence (similar to 2.0 Ma) was inferred, which coincides with major speciation events in other North American species. While the isolation-with-migration model suggested that nuclear gene flow was generally rare or absent among species or major genetic groups, coalescent simulations of mtDNA divergence revealed historical mtDNA introgression from L. californicus into the Pacific Northwest populations of L. americanus. This finding marks a history of past reticulation between these species, which may have affected other parts of the genome and influence the adaptive potential of hares during climate change.

AB  - Land-use change threatens biodiversity and ecosystem function worldwide. These changes have impacts on weather patterns, carbon storage, biodiversity, and other ecosystem services from regional to local scales. Only 8 percent of tropical forests are formally recognized as conservation areas, however globally, there is a network of sites that are protected because they are sacred and as a result act as shadow' conservation for biodiversity. Unlike other types of protected sites (e.g., national parks), these sites are seats of religious ritual that anchor a community's cultural identity, while also conserving biological diversity and other ecosystem services. We studied the extent and status of sacred forests in northern Ethiopia, which are threatened because of their small size (similar to 5ha) and isolation, increasing their exposure to edge effects and human pressures. Using historical and modern imagery, we found that over the last 50yr, sacred forests have increased in area, but decreased in crown closure. We also found that forest ecological status, via ground-level investigation, had high mean human disturbance (e.g., trails, plantations, exotic planting; 37%); and that forests close to markets (e.g., cities) increased in area due to planting of Eucalyptus (exotic), indicating a potential threat to their persistence and value as shelters of the church.

AB  - In the Transylvanian region, the Aries Valley stretches along the course of the Aries River, ending as tributary of Mure River. As well as these areas of great biodiversity value, the Aries Valley (drainage area of 2,540 km(2)) also crosses the region where local people set their villages and towns and use the surrounding areas as grasslands for grazing, mowing and fields for agriculture. The grassland types are present in patches, those used for hay production are scattered among agricultural fields and human settlements.
   Evidence from statistical analysis of the vegetation cover of a riparian area of Aries River Valley indicates that in the inventorying plots with low species diversity, there is a dominance of one or two species with individuals unequally distributed within and between plots. The layer 1-5 m is dominated by alien invasive species: Fallopia japonica, Helianthus tuberosus, Impatiens glanduligera, the studied area of Aries River Valley becoming a source for these alien species to invade the surrounding grasslands and agricultural fields. Especially Fallopia japonica individuals form compact patches invading the pastures and agricultural fields and the local farmers cannot use the land any more for fulfilling their own needs. The invasive species replace the native species from the grasslands and make the agricultural field inappropriate for crops cultivation. The river acts as a migration corridor for the alien species helping them to spread by seeds or fragments and invade new places, especially during spring and/or autumn floods, and a contamination source for the surrounding grasslands and agricultural fields.

AB  - Effective conservation planning requires an understanding of species-habitat relationships across a diverse array of taxa, yet many studies typically focus on conspicuous fauna. Using systematic acoustic surveys, we examine the response of insectivorous bat species to urbanization and quantify species-habitat relationships to classify species in terms of their tolerance or sensitivity. Surveys were conducted in Sydney. Australia, during spring-summer of 2008 in 29 defined 25 km(2) landscapes, across various land uses. We quantified bat-habitat relationships using local and landscape scale variables. We recorded 17 taxa across the urban gradient, with substantial variation in the tolerance and sensitivity of each species. The density of houses, landscape geology, the amount of bushland (ha) exclusively on fertile geologies and moth biomass were the most frequent predictors of individual activity, explaining more than 60% of variation in activity for some species. Importantly, the area of bushland on poorer soils was not a good predictor, highlighting the need for caution when interpreting results of large scale studies which do not account for variations in habitat productivity. Species-specific differences existed, although the majority of the assemblage was considered to be urban-sensitive. Many of these sensitive species were most active in fertile suburban habitats, with an average of 12-28% bushland cover within 5 km. Our study demonstrates the necessity to elucidate species-specific habitat relationships, and suggests bats would benefit from the conservation of productive suburban bushland remnants and riparian habitats, while improving connectivity to these areas via the maintenance of tree cover across the matrix.

AB  - Natural disasters can be mitigated or even anticipated if we have appropriate means, in terms of communications and data sharing models, to collect relevant data in advance or during disaster occurrences, which can be used for supporting disaster prevention and recovery processes. This work proposes a framework that encourages people to collect and share data about disaster, especially flood in Ho Chi Minh City, via on-site established multihop wireless access networks configured by the sharing of internet connectivity in users' mobile devices. For connectivity sharing, on-the-fly establishment of multihop wireless access network (OEMAN) scheme is thoroughly analyzed and improved to resolve its inherent issue on traffic load imbalance due to its tree-based structure. More specifically, we propose a linear program for overload-aware routing optimization considering wireless interference. Evaluations implemented in Matlab show that the overload-aware routing improves load balancing among available virtual access points in OEMAN. By avoiding nodes with heavy load in the network, our solution improves network throughput compared to overload-unaware routing protocols.

AB  - Presence-only models can aid conservation and management of threatened, elusive species. A MaxEnt model has been developed for the great capricorn beetle (Cerambyx cerdo L., 1758) in south-western Poland and the variables identified best explaining the species' occurrence on a large scale. Once successfully validated, the model was used to (a) illustrate the expected location of the species' habitats in the region and in existing Natura 2000 sites (SACs) in S-W Poland and (b) assess the efficacy of the regional network of national protected areas (NPAs) versus Natura 2000 (SACs). Overall, information was gathered on 1025 localities of C. cerdo L., 1758 in Lower Silesia. All the records came from the pedunculate oak Quercus robur L., 1753. The occurrence of the great capricorn beetle in the study region is limited mainly to its eastern part, with a marked concentration in the valleys of the rivers Odra, Barycz and Bystrzyca. The kernel density estimation analysis also showed the high concentration of occupied trees in the north-western part of the region, clearly isolated from the above-mentioned main populations. Although a considerable part of the localities in the study region (74.2%) occurred within protected areas (PAs), their contribution to the species' conservation varied between the PAs groups. Natura 2000 SACs are the most important PAs, covering more than 30% of the predicted area of suitable habitats in the region and more than 45% of optimal habitats. In total, 384 localities of C. cerdo L., 1758 were found within the cities, most of them (n = 356) in the city of Wroclaw. Forty three percent (43%) of the urban localities of the species (n = 165) in the study region are protected within the regional network of protected areas (OPAs), while those unprotected are mainly concentrated in the city of Wroclaw (n = 207). Wroclaw also includes 17.1% of the area of suitable habitats and 29% optimal habitats of the species in the region outside the protected area network. To preserve C. cerdo L., 1758, forest corridors should be created or restored to bridge the otherwise impermeable gaps revealed by the authors' model and grant protection to the still largely unprotected area of the Lower Silesian territory. The species conservation programme in the region requires the cooperation of various authorities, not only those dealing with nature conservation, but also local governments, state forest management and flood protection authorities.

AB  - The design of structures in industrial buildings is complex due to the diversity and nature of the processes involved according to the destination with presence of systems and equipment that generate vibrations. In order to achieve a suitable technical solution, the designer must possess adequate knowledge of every aspect related both to the equipment or machine and to the characteristics of the structure the equipment will be linked to so as to mitigate vibration problems.
   This paper addresses the issues related to a building which supports a crusher and screen equipment in a cement plant facilities in the city of Olavarria, Province of Buenos Aires. The building is a reinforced concrete structure composed of slabs and spatial frames laying on a concrete slab foundation.
   Computer simulation models were calibrated and used to determine and analyze the structure dynamic properties and the structural response under service load. Design criteria are established in order to achieve a proper structural behavior, as well as recommendations related to the use of vibration isolation, obtained from the analysis results.

AB  - The aerobic denitrifying phosphate accumulating bacteria (ADPB) use NO3- as an electron acceptor and remove nitrate by denitrification and concomitant uptake of excessive phosphorus in aerobic conditions. Activated sludge was collected from the A(2)O aerobic biological pool of the sewage treatment plant at Hezuo Town, Chengdu City. The candidate ADPB strains were obtained by cultivation in the enriched denitrification media, followed by repeated isolation and purification on bromothymol blue (BTB) solid plates. The obtained candidates were further screened for ADPB strains by phosphorus uptake experiment, nitrate reduction test, metachromatic granules staining, and poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) staining. The 16 sedimentation ribosome deoxyribonucleic acid (16 S rDNA) molecular technique was used to determine their taxonomy. Further, the denitrification and dephosphorization capacities of ADPB strains were ascertained through their growth characteristics in nitrogen-phosphorus-rich liquid media. The results revealed a total of 25 ADPB strains screened from the activated sludge of the A(2)O aerobic biological pool of the sewage treatment plant at Hezuo Town. These strains belonged to two classes, four orders, and five genera. Among them, the strain SW18NP2 was a potentially new species in the Acinetobacter genus, while the strain SW18NP24 was a potential new species in the Pseudomonas genus at the time of their characterization. The Acinetobacter was the dominant genus. The obtained ADPB strains demonstrated a rich diversity. The ADPB strains had significant variations in denitrification and dephosphorization capacities. Twenty-three strains exhibited a total phosphorus removal rate of above 50%, and 19 strains exhibited a total nitrogen removal rate of above 50%. The strain SW18NP2 showed the best denitrifying phosphorus removal (DPR) capacity, with a dephosphorization rate of 82.32% and a denitrification rate of 73.73%. The ADPB in the A(2)O aerobic biological pool of the sewage treatment plant at Hezuo Town demonstrated a rich diversity and a strong DPR capacity.

AB  - To be effective in promoting the conservation of migratory wildlife, recipients of payment for ecosystem services (PES) most be willing to accept payment along the entire migratory corridor. This paper investigates spatial variation in willingness to accept. (WTA) payments made by the Wildlife Conservation Lease Program in the Athi-Kaputiei plains of Kenya. The program, designed as an incentive to keep land open for wildlife and livestock, offers land owners 10 US$ per ha per year, irrespective of location. We model the relation between WTA and distances to roads, towns and rivers, annual precipitation arid slope and display the predicted spatial variation in WTA. The results reveal significant spatial variation in willingness to accept payments for availing land for conservation, with higher WTA concentrated away from roads and also in the Southeast of the plains. The results further suggest that wildlife movement will be blocked due to low WTA in the proximity of towns and tarmacked roads. We conclude that an effective strategy to keep the land open for migratory wildlife should consider spatial variation in WTA payment for land lease. It is suggested to consider stratifying the lease rates geographically to reflect the underlying spatial variation in WTA. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rapid urban expansion is a major contributor to environmental change in many parts of the world. This study investigated land cover changes that occurred between 1988 and 2010 in the Calgary-Edmonton corridor in Alberta, a region that has undergone considerable recent urban expansion. We used satellite imagery to develop land cover maps for four different snapshots in time between 1988 and 2010 and used these maps to investigate two principal questions related to urban expansion: (1) How did urban expansion affect other land cover types? and (2) How did urban expansion affect the availability of high-quality agricultural land in the region? Our results show that 60 % of new urban and peri-urban growth between 1988 and 2010 occurred on agricultural land. Nevertheless, total agricultural land increased in the region because of the greater clearing of natural vegetation for agriculture away from the urban core. Urban expansion predominantly occurred on soils that were highly suitable for farming, while new agricultural expansion occurred on soils of poorer quality. As a result, the average soil quality of land used for agriculture has declined in the Calgary-Edmonton corridor, confirming other studies of the food security implications of urbanization.

AB  - Ecological theory predicts that specialist insect herbivores are more likely to locate and colonize host plants growing in relatively sparse or pure stands compared to host plants growing amongst diverse non-host vegetation. We tested the hypothesis that increasing the apparency and accessibility of milkweed (Asclepias spp.) host plants in small polyculture gardens would boost their colonization by the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), an iconic native species of conservation concern. We established replicated gardens containing the identical mix of milkweeds, flowering nectar sources, and non-host ornamental grasses but arranged in three different spatial configurations that were monitored for monarch colonization over two successive growing seasons. Monarch eggs and larvae were 2.5-4 times more abundant in gardens having milkweeds evenly spaced in a 1m corridor around the perimeter, surrounding the nectar plants and grasses, than in gardens in which milkweeds were surrounded by or intermixed with the other plants. Predator populations were similar in all garden designs. In a corollary open-field experiment, female monarchs laid significantly more eggs on milkweed plants that were fully accessible than on milkweeds surrounded by non-host grasses of equal height. In addition, we monitored monarch usage of 22 citizen-planted gardens containing milkweed and nectar plants in relation to their botanical composition, layout, and surrounding hardscape. Multivariate analysis explained 71% of the variation, with significantly more eggs and larvae found in gardens having milkweeds spatially isolated as opposed to closely intermixed with non-host plants, and in gardens having 100m north/south access unimpeded by structures. Numerous programs encourage citizens to establish gardens with milkweed and nectar plants to help offset habitat loss across the monarch's breeding range. Our findings suggest guidelines for garden design that can help make the urban sector's contributions to monarch habitat restoration more rewarding for participants, and of greater potential value to monarch recovery.

AB  - Aims: To evaluate the diversity of Pseudomonads and antibiotic resistance profiles of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a hospital wastewater treatment plant (HWTP) located in Rio de Janeiro city, Brazil. Due its intrinsic multidrug resistance and its ability to colonize several environments, we selected Ps. aeruginosa isolates as indicator of antimicrobial resistance frequency.
   Methods and Results: Twenty-seven Ps. aeruginosa strains isolated from five stages of HWTP identified by rrs 16S rDNA sequencing were submitted against 12 antimicrobials through disc diffusion method. Among these isolates, 62.9% showed aztreonam resistance, followed by ticarcillin/clavulanic acid (33.3%) and cefepime (22.2%). Of these isolates, 22.2% were classified as multidrug-resistant (MDR >= 3 classes). Five 16S rRNA gene libraries of Pseudomonas genus were constructed, one for each stages of the plant, yielding 93 sequences clustered in 41 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). Each treatment step showed unique OTU's composition, suggesting changes in Pseudomonas spp. communities during the process. Several Pseudomonas species involved in biodegradation and bioremediation of xenobiotics were detected suggesting a positive impact in the wastewater treatment.
   Conclusions: Our strategy using metagenomics associated with the isolation of Ps. aeruginosa strains as bio-indicator allowed us to assess their antimicrobial susceptibility, the viability and diversity of Pseudomonas species in the hospital wastewater.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: The presence of MDR bacteria from treated effluents alerts for the need to improve these systems to avoid the spreading of resistance genes in aquatic ecosystems. This has special relevance in Brazil, where a significant portion of the population has no access to treated water.

AB  - The genetic diversity and relationship amongst the bacterial populations were determined in fresh salad samples (Tabbouleh, Fattoush, Hummus, Mutabbel and Caesar) collected from various restaurants located in five different areas (west, north, south, east and center) in Riyadh (the capital city of Saudi Arabia). Isolated colonies found were identified via molecular methods. Total number of identified isolates in the vegetable salads Tabbouleh, Fattoush, Mutabbel, Hummus and Caesar were 24, 20, 18, 16 and 12, respectively. Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus cereus and Enterobacter aerogenes were recorded in the five types of vegetable salads. Escherichia coli,Klebsiella sp., Kluyvera clyocrescens and Kluyvera ascorbata were recorded in all types of vegetable salads except Caesar. Vegetable salads collected from all sites were contaminated with E. colt, Enterobacter sp. and Enterobacter aerogenes. Elevated level of contamination with E. coli was recorded in the samples collected from the north and east areas, while high level of contamination with Enterobacter aerogenes was recorded in the samples collected from central area. Estimation of bacterial genetic relationships was determined using DNA sequencing, phylogenetic tree and bioinformatic techniques. The 36 isolates were arranged in one main cluster including 34 bacterial species and two bacterial species Pseudomonas and Bacillus cereus were out groups with similarity index range of 0.008-0.063 and 0.008-0.125, respectively, to the main group. This cluster was subdivided into two subgroups: subgroup A included Acinetobacter sp. and Stenotrophomonas sp.; subgroup B included 32 bacterial species. Subgroup B contains one major subgroup C comprising 31 bacterial species with similarity index range of 0.061-0.019 to Hafnia alvei. Subgroup C was subdivided into subgroup D including 15 bacterial species and subgroup E including 16 bacterial species. The inter-specific analysis of the sequences showed that most bacterial species exhibit a homogeneous sequence indicating a low level of polymorphism, which is congruent with the reduced variability found in these bacterial species from other salad sources. The identification of intra-specific variation suggests that DNA sequencing had a potential to aid in quick identification and classification of bacterial isolates in salads. The reproducibility generated by this technique may lead to the development of specific molecular markers for characterization of these microbes.

AB  - An outbreak of psittacosis related to a bird park occurred in Matsue City, Shimane Prefecture, Japan, during winter 2001. Seventeen cases of psittacosis (12 visitors, three staff, and two student interns) were confirmed. A cohort Study was conducted among the park staff and students to determine the risk factors for the development of acute serologically confirmed psittacosis (SCP) infection. Being 'bird staff' had ail increased risk of SCP infection (RR 3 center dot 96, 95% CI 1 center dot 48-10 center dot 58). Entering the staff building, where ill birds were maintained without proper isolation, was also associated with an increased risk of SCP infection (RR 3 center dot 61, 95%, CI 1 center dot 03-12 center dot 6). Isolation of ill birds and quarantine measures were found to be insufficient. Dehumidifiers and a high-pressure water spray under a closed ventilation environment may have raised the concentration of Chlamydophila psittaci in the hothouses. Bird park staff and visitors Should be educated about psittacosis.

AB  - The landscape of rural America is changing. Wildlife habitats are being converted to agricultural uses, corridors (linear patches that differ from their surroundings) are removed to expand fields, and urban development spreads across farms, forests, and prairies. The result is a fragmented landscape with fewer, smaller, less-connected patches of wildlife habitat and increasingly-degraded water quality that stresses aquatic ecosystems. The landscape's capacity to sustain a diversity of plant, animal, and aquatic species is declining at an decelerating rate. The loss of biodiversity has become a national concern. Land use planners are increasingly advocating the use of conservation corridors, including riparian buffers, windbreaks/shelterbelts, filter strips, field borders, and grassed waterways to improve water quality and wildlife habitat Since many of the ecological functions of conservation corridors operate more efficiently at scales larger than an individual corridor, planning at the watershed scale offers the best opportunity to optimize these functions.

AB  - A total of 662 samples (winter period: 469; summer period: 193 specimens) of female mosquitoes of the genus Culex, Aedes and Anopheles were collected during the period March 2000-April 2001 from the locality of Vysoke Myto (Eastern Bohemia, Czech Republic). They were examined by dark field microscopy for the presence of spirochetes. The motile spirochetes were observed in 4.2% of all species of investigated mosquitoes. One spirochetal strain out of the 8 isolation attempts (BRZ14) was obtained (cultivation rate was 12.5%) and the spirochetal strain was then successfully cultivated and identified using PCR for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., and subsequently with the RFLP as genomospecies Borrelia afzelii. This strain was derived from overwintering Cidex (Culex) pipiens biotype molestus female mosquitoe. This is apparently one of the sporadic cases of the occurrence of pathogenic borreliae in haematophagous arthropods, other than Ixodes ricinus complex ticks.

AB  - This study aimed to identify and evaluate the decay capability of fungi that occur naturally in eucalyptus plantations of three cities in Espirito Santo state, Brazil. Hence, discs from deteriorated stumps were collected and samples isolatied to obtain pure fungal cultures. An experiment using Petri dishes with malt-agar medium and eucalyptus sapwood was performed in order to test the decay of each isolate. The experiment was evaluated by mass loss every four weeks during a total of 20 weeks. Fungi with decay capability were selected and identified via extraction of genomic DNA. Seven isolates were identified: Penicillium implicatum, Resinicium confertum, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Cladosporium sp., Penicillium sp., Trichoderma citrinoviride and Acremonium sp. Isolation and identification of fungi from eucalyptus stumps provided naturally occurring decay fungi that inhabit the eucalyptus plantations that were adapted for this study.

AB  - Although floodplain restoration may improve stream-riparian connectivity and increase channel stability through cross-vane installation, stream bank regrading, and buffer revegetation, the impact of these geomorphic alterations on denitrification across the aquatic-terrestrial interface is poorly understood. Seasonal denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) was compared in stream-riparian ecotones of four streams with varying hydrologic connection, riparian vegetation composition, and agricultural influence. Riparian and stream DEA was generally higher in sites adjacent to agricultural fields due to proximity to nitrate source. Mean DEA was higher in the dormant season (riparian: 928 +/- 116 ng N g(-1) dry mass [DM] h(-1), stream: 108 +/- 149 ng N g(-1) DM h(-1)) than in the growing season (riparian: 355 +/- 55 ng N g(-1) DM h(-1), stream: 45 +/- 40 ng N g(-1) DM h(-1)) and was influenced by antecedent precipitation, soil texture, and landscape characteristics (land use, vegetation type, topography) in multivariate models. Hot spots of denitrification occurred at the confluence of fine soil textures with high organic matter and moisture, often at low-lying areas of the landscape. At the restored site, we observed enhanced denitrification in the reconnected floodplain but decreased stream denitrification capacity in pools. Across all sites, streams had lower DEA than riparian zones, stressing the importance of restoration approaches designed to conserve riparian areas and maintain hydrologic connectivity. Easily obtainable data including precipitation, adjacent land use, vegetation, and stream and floodplain geomorphology reasonably predicted denitrification potential compared with more complex models, showing potential for application in water resources and nitrogen management.

AB  - The growing wildland-urban interface is a frontier of human-wildlife conflict worldwide. Where natural and developed areas meet, there is potential for negative interactions between humans and wild animals, including wildlife-vehicle collisions. Understanding the environmental and anthropogenic factors leading to these collisions can inform transportation and habitat planning, with an objective of reducing animal mortality and human costs. We investigated spatial, temporal, and species-specific patterns of roadkill on Interstate-280 (I-280) in California, USA, and examined the effects of land cover, fencing, lighting, and traffic. The highway is situated just south of San Francisco, dividing a large wildlife refuge to the west from dense residential areas to the east, and therefore presents a major barrier to wildlife movement. Areas with a higher percentage of developed land east of I-280 and areas with more open space on the west side of I-280 were associated with an increase in overall roadkill, suggesting that hard boundaries at the wildland-urban interface may be zones of high risk for dispersing animals. This pattern was especially strong for raccoons (Procyon lotor) and black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus). The presence of lighting correlated with increased roadkill with the exception of coyote (Canis latrans). Contrary to our expectations, we found weak evidence that fencing increases roadkill, perhaps because animals become trapped on roadways or because fencing is not sufficient to block access to the road by wildlife. Finally, we found strong evidence for roadkill seasonality, correlated with differences in movement and dispersal across life-history stages. We highlight the value of citizen-science datasets for monitoring human-wildlife conflict and suggest potential mitigation measures to reduce the negative effects of wildlife-vehicle collisions for people and wildlife.

AB  - Forest fragmentation of anthropogenic origin is one of the results promoted by the disorderly process of the land use and land cover, especially in intensively cultivated landscapes. In this context, this study aimed to define priority areas to facilitate connectivity among forest fragments, seeking forest recovery actions in the Pardo River Basin, SP, using the multicriteria approach (Weighted Linear Combination). The Participator Technique was used to define the criteria and the weights of the factors. The factors considered important to the objective of this study were the following: proximity between the fragments with greater nuclear areas, proximity to forest cover, proximity of the river system, distance to urban centers, slope, erodibility of soil. Whereas the variables that influence the selection of priority areas for forest restoration in the Pardo River Basin, SP contribute with different weights in the final decision process, a hierarchy according to the importance of each factor to the fitness area was established. The major factor was proximity among fragments of the largest nuclear area (0.3713), followed by proximity to forest cover (0.1911), proximity to the river system (0.1516), distance to urban centers (.1168), slope (0.0840) and erodibility (0.0854). The result was a map of priority areas, with five classes of priority. The priority areas occurred in order to promote the first union of forest patches with greater nuclear area, and from this union, the successive expansion of these regions of very high priority tending to very low. The methodology was adequate to the mapping of priority areas for restoration in watersheds. Fragments with bigger nuclear areas, connected with small fragments where they are predominant in the landscape, promoting the formation of larger fragments from the formation of forest corridors and recompositon of vegetation.

AB  - Recently, landscapes have undergone changes, and these changes in the size and isolation of woodland patches have negatively impacted biodiversity in mountain landscapes of rapidly developing urban regions in South Korea. However, little information is available on the extent of these changes in the mountain areas. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the changes and spatial characteristics of woodlands in a mountain landscape to provide information for biodiversity conservation planning. The results indicated that this landscape underwent significant and fundamental changes between 2002 and 2012 due to activities including new road construction, and residential and commercial developments. Large woodland patches (over 5 ha in size) were particularly vulnerable to disappearance and shrinkage because of urbanization. The selected landscape ecological metrics revealed a decrease in patch size between 5 ha and 9.9 ha (n=7) and over 10 ha (n=2). The area-weighted mean patch shape index (AWMPSI) decreased from 3.86 in 2002 to 3.30 in 2012. The mean nearest-neighbor distance (MND) increased from 70.4 m in 2002 to 75.9 m in 2012. Shannon Diversity Index (SHDI) of land cover decreased from 1.31 in 2002 to 1.22 in 2012. SHDI of woodland type also decreased from 0.24 in 2002 to 0.20 in 2012. The results of landscape ecological indices suggest that the woodlands were becoming smaller, simpler, and more isolated and homogenous. These spatial changes of the woodlands probably had adverse effects on biodiversity. For more information of landscape ecological conditions, a more comprehensive analysis based on more landscape ecological metrics is needed in future study.

AB  - Fragmentation, degradation and loss of natural habitats are now recognised as major threats to wildlife conservation and mobile pastoralism in East African savannas. These processes are driven primarily by land tenure and policy, increasing human population, expansion of settlements and agricultural farms, road networks, urban development and fencing. To understand and characterise the forces driving habitat fragmentation, we analyse how biophysical (soils, slope, rainfall, rivers) and human-created (roads, towns, parks, quarries) features influence where people choose to fence the land in the Athi-Kaputiei ecosystem of Kenya. We also explore the consequences of land fragmentation through fencing on the abundance and distribution of wildlife and livestock populations. We show that fences are most highly concentrated along the major roads and around the major urban centres. Movements of migratory wildebeest and zebra between the Nairobi National Park and the pastoral Kitengela Plains adjoining the park on the south are getting increasingly impeded by increasing concentration of fences. Populations of wildebeest and other herbivores have collapsed to a small fraction of their former abundance largely owing to destruction of their habitats and obstruction of their movements between the park and the pastoral lands by fences and other land use developments. Conserving the key seasonal wildlife dispersal areas in the Athi-Kaputiei Plains is critical to ensuring the future viability of several key wildlife species in Nairobi National Park. Several initiatives, including a conservation land lease program has been launched, but their spatial coverage and funding levels would need to be greatly expanded to secure sufficient open spaces for both wildlife and livestock.

AB  - Roadside plantings along urban and rural road corridors are designed to create visual effects as well as to provide functional benefits such as shading, screening or routing. Considering their potential for daily public use, roads and road corridors, as significant visual impact centers, can attract people's attention and affect their points of view. Poplar species, which grow rapidly and easily along road corridors and can adapt to different ecological conditions swiftly, are used widely in both urban and rural landscapes in Turkey. The main objective of this study was to determine the visual structures dependent on the mad-plant relationships of the poplar compositions that play an important role in shaping the roadside landscapes. For this purpose, compositions of poplar trees in selected urban and rural road corridors throughout Turkey were photographed and visual analysis techniques (VATS) were applied to determine visual preferences. Participants (n= 35) were shown 30 photographs, selected from the nearly 1000 taken, of road corridor poplar plantings and their evaluations were recorded in a questionnaire. In this survey, the people were requested to evaluate their appreciation levels towards the plantings as well as to express their other visual preferences and to assess visual quality. In addition, the association of all these evaluations with the demographic characteristics of the participants were determined. A correlation analysis was then performed to identify the relationships among all the visual assessments and a cluster analysis was conducted according to the visual status of the photographs in order to determine their groups. In the results of the study, the poplar trees, either individually or in the form of compositions, were reported to have a significant visual diversity. Moreover, the cluster analysis found the resulting three groups to be associated with leaf density, seasonal conditions and the trees as individuals or in groups. The seasonal variation factor in particular was shown to be visually effective in the poplar compositions. It was determined that visual perception of the poplar plantations differed in accordance with the demographic differences. This work established that poplar plantations as single trees or in groups and their proximity to the road altered visual preferences, and consequently, some suggestions were made concerning the use of poplars in roadside landscape planning.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Wildlife is exposed to environmental disturbances. Some are limited to a short period and pass by, others are of a permanent nature. Often these two kinds of disturbances occur simultaneously. This makes it difficult to disentangle the specific behavioural response to each disturbance. As species may respond to different disturbances in different ways, it is important to know the species-specific and disturbance-specific responses to develop effective species conservation action. We investigated the behavioural responses of European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) in Berlin to temporary disturbance (in the form of an open-air music festival) and permanent disturbance (in the form of habitat fragmentation). We show that a music festival is a major stressor that strongly influences all investigated behaviours. Urban hedgehogs in a highly fragmented area showed subtle behavioural changes compared to those in low-fragmented areas, suggesting that fragmentation was a moderate challenge which they could cope with. Thus, the temporary disturbance by a music festival had a more serious impact on hedgehog behaviour than permanent disturbance caused by fragmentation. Moreover, we show that males responded stronger to the transient disturbance and females responded stronger to habitat fragmentation.
   Anthropogenic activities can result in both transient and permanent changes in the environment. We studied spatial and temporal behavioural responses of European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) to a transient (open-air music festival) and a permanent (highly fragmented area) disturbance in the city of Berlin, Germany. Activity, foraging and movement patterns were observed in two distinct areas in 2016 and 2017 using a "Before & After" and "Control & Impact" study design. Confronted with a music festival, hedgehogs substantially changed their movement behaviour and nesting patterns and decreased the rhythmic synchronization (DFC) of their activity patterns with the environment. These findings suggest that a music festival is a substantial stressor influencing the trade-off between foraging and risk avoidance. Hedgehogs in a highly fragmented area used larger home ranges and moved faster than in low-fragmented and low-disturbed areas. They also showed behaviours and high DFCs similar to individuals in low-fragmented, low disturbed environment, suggesting that fragmentation posed a moderate challenge which they could accommodate. The acute but transient disturbance of a music festival, therefore, had more substantial and severe behavioural effects than the permanent disturbance through fragmentation. Our results are relevant for the welfare and conservation measure of urban wildlife and highlight the importance of allowing wildlife to avoid urban music festivals by facilitating avoidance behaviours.

AB  - In the last 50-60 years, agricultural intensification and later urban development have threatened the rare and valuable gully landscape formed on marine clay. We studied landscape changes in eastern Akershus county in south-east Norway, which has one of the world's largest concentrations of marine gullies. Interpretation of aerial photos showed that about 25% of the gully area has been lost. Only 39.5% of the remaining area is original gullies, and 60.5% of the area has been affected by landscape change. The largest loss of gully area was between 1955 and 1991, mainly through land levelling and transformation to intensively managed agricultural landscape. The most densely populated areas also lost gullies to residential areas and industry. Gullies support high plant and animal diversity, and future management should be based on landscape ecological principles. Gully fragments should also be preserved to maintain connectivity between the many different habitats belonging to the gullies.

AB  - Multivariate analyses and correlations revealed strong relations between watershed and riparian-corridor land cover, and reach-scale habitat versus fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages in 38 warmwater streams in eastern Wisconsin. Watersheds were dominated by agricultural use, and ranged in size from 9 to 71 km(2). Watershed land cover was summarized from satellite-derived data for the area outside a 30-m buffer. Riparian land cover was interpreted from digital orthophotos within 10-, 10- to 20-, and 20- to 30-m buffers. Reach-scale habitat, fish, and macroinvertebrates were collected in 1998 and biotic indices calculated. Correlations between land cover, habitat, and stream-quality indicators revealed significant relations at the watershed, riparian-corridor, and reach scales. At the watershed scale, fish diversity, intolerant fish and EPT species increased, and Hilsenhoff biotic index (HBI) decreased as percent forest increased. At the riparian-corridor scale, EPT species decreased and HBI increased as riparian vegetation became more fragmented. For the reach, EPT species decreased with embeddedness. Multivariate analyses further indicated that riparian (percent agriculture, grassland, urban and forest, and fragmentation of vegetation), watershed (percent forest) and reach-scale characteristics (embeddedness) were the most important variables influencing fish (IBI, density, diversity, number, and percent tolerant and insectivorous species) and macroinvertebrate (HBI and EPT) communities.

AB  - Two different actinomycete strains (XAS585 and XAS588), producing antifungal substances, were isolated from the marine mud of coast and offshore Zhuhai city, Guangdong province, China. On the basis of micro-morphology, physiological and chemotaxonomic characterization and phylogenetic similarity of 16S rDNA gene sequences, the strains XAS585 and XAS588 were identified as Streptomyces roseobiolascens XAS585 and Streptomyces roseofulvus XAS588, respectively. Antifungal profiles of the ethyl acetate extracts of the two strains fermented broth (FBE) were evaluated against the test phytopathogenic fungi; the results showed that the FBE of S. roseobiolascens XAS585 exhibited strong antifungal activity against mycelia growth of all test fungi at 150 mu g/ml, while the FBE of S. roseobiolascens XAS588 also exhibited strong antifungal activity, except Sclerotinia scleroitiorum, Valsa mali and Cercospora sorghi at 150 mu g/ml. In addition, the FBE of both strains at 100 mu g/ml showed inhibitory effect against the condina germination of Alternaria alternate, Exserlhilum turcicum and Bipolaris sorokiniana. This study showed that the two marine-derived Streptomyces may provide potent sources for antifungal metabolites.

AB  - Suaeda species are annual halophytes growing in soils with high salinity and high concentration of irons where non-halophytes are unable to thrive. It might be expected that the endophytic fungi of Suaeda species might help their host to resist the environmental stress. Endophytic fungal communities associated with stems and leaves of healthy S. microphylla and S. corniculata plants were determined from June to October in 2009. The plants were growing in alkaline land in Songyuan City, Jilin Province in China. Endophytic fungal composition varied between the two plants, however Alternaria spp. and Phoma spp. colonized both plant species. The fungal diversity and colonization rate were highest in September. Different fungal species inhabited different tissues and a few species were overlapping between stems and leaves. Although species of Phoma chrysanthemicola were isolated from both stem and leaves in September, the isolation frequency in stems was significantly higher than in leaves. Pigmented dematiaceous endophytic fungi were particularly common in the halophytes and they may play an important ecological role for survival and stress resistance of the plant species.

AB  - The Loa River is the only perennial artery that crosses the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. It plays an important role in the ecological and economic development of the most water-stressed region, revealing the impact of the mining industry, which exacerbate regional water shortages for many organisms and ecological processes. Despite this, the river system has remained understudied. To our knowledge, this study provides the first effort to attempt to compare the microbial communities at spatial scale along the Loa River, as well as investigate the physicochemical factors that could modulate this important biological component that still remains largely unexplored. The analysis of the spatial bacterial distribution and their interconnections in the water column and sediment samples from eight sites located in three sections along the river catchment (upper, middle and lower) was conducted using 16S rRNA gene-based Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Among a total of 543 ASVs identified at the family level, over 40.5% were cosmopolitan in the river and distributed within a preference pattern by the sediment substrate with 162 unique ASVs, while only 87 were specific to the column water. Bacterial diversity gradually decreased from the headwaters, where the upper section had the largest number of unique families. Distinct groupings of bacterial communities often associated with anthropogenic disturbance, including Burkholderiaceae and Flavobacteriaceae families were predominant in the less-impacted upstream section. Members of the Arcobacteraceae and Marinomonadaceae were prominent in the agriculturally and mining-impacted middle sector while Rhodobacteraceae and Coxiellaceae were most abundant families in downstream sites. Such shifts in the community structure were also related to the influence of salinity, chlorophyll, dissolved oxygen and redox potential. Network analyses corroborated the strong connectivity and modular structure of bacterial communities across this desert river, shedding light on taxonomic relatedness of co-occurring species and highlighting the need for planning the integral conservation of this basin.

AB  - Seed rain has ecological consequences on plant community structure. This study was conducted in the Monte Austral Neuquino nearby the town of Picun Leufu, Province of Neuquen. Argentina, within an area of 15 km x 15 km (39 degrees 20 32'S; 69 degrees 19 30' W). Studies were conducted at two sites, distant 1.5 km from one another. Vegetation is distributed on the soil surface us vegetation patches. Four superficial locations may be found in the soil of these patches: location 1, small dune accumulated under the lee; location 2, found at the edge of the small dune, and below the major grass canopies and tallest shrubs; location 3, located at the edge of the vegetation patch, and location 4 which includes the uncovered corridors among vegetation patches. Seed rain was measured by collecting seeds from traps located in the four study locations. Our working hypotheses were that (1) seeds of the study species arrive to all locations of the vegetation patches and the nude corridors among patches, and (2) the magnitude of the seed rain depends on time of the year. Larrea divaricata showed the greatest values in the corridors among vegetation patches and in the periphery of such patches. A similar pattern was found for S. neaei although this species dispersed seeds further from the mother plant. Atriplex lampa distributed seeds homogeneously in all four locations. Elymus erianthus only contributed 1 seed to the seed rain. Larrea, divaricata showed a greater, proportion of its total seed rain between December and March in all locations. Seed rain in A. lampa was almost permanent throughout the year while in S. neaei was concentrated in December and January, although it showed some seed rain until April.

AB  - 1. A comparison was made between a variety of alien and endemic plant species from 272 aquatic and riparian habitats in Portuguese Mediterranean-type streams in reference condition - i.e. near-natural river corridors - and non-reference condition. The objective was to detect differences in relative proportion and cover between these species groups. The differences in endemic and alien flora from siliceous and calcareous river types were also analysed. Environmental and human disturbance factors were related with the richness and cover of both species groups.
   2. A total of 568 species were found, of which 44 were alien and 28 were endemic. Alien species were present at 91 % of the surveyed locations, and were consistently more widespread at non-reference sites than at reference ones for both river types, with calcareous sites having a higher invasibility. Endemic species occurred at 45% of the sampling sites and displayed a significantly lower richness and cover than their alien counterparts.
   3. Alien richness and cover were positively related to direct human disturbance within the river systems, and with floodplain uses such as urban occupation, intensive agriculture, and nutrient inputs. Endemic species also respond to anthropogenic variables, rather than to climatic and geographical ones, with richness and cover increasing as human impacts on fluvial systems and related floodplains decrease.
   4. Comprehensive control of alien invasive species and the protection of endemic plant populations will require attempts at monitoring ecological river integrity, and the achievement of 'good ecological status' - one of the goals of the European Union's Water Framework Directive. Portuguese riparian areas must be managed in such a way as to protect the relatively few preserved riparian habitats by lowering the direct and indirect pressures in fluvial corridors and thus preventing future alien plant invasions.

AB  - Multiple-species habitat conservation plans (MSHCPs) are designed to eliminate project-by-project review and minimize species-by-species conflicts; but these onetime, short-term processes invariably compress the divergent expectations of interest groups into an exercise driven by economic, amenity, and aesthetic values rather than scientific values. Participants may define an MSHCP as an exchange of habitat preserves for federal permits to take populations of endangered animals and plants, but the outcome is typically driven by overarching arguments over land development and suburban sprawl. Existing land uses also constrain the size, shape, and linkages among wildlife habitats, leading to a divergence of MSHCPs from the scientific preserve selection and design literature. Problems created by constraints to preserve configuration (e.g., land costs, fragmentation, pre-existing amounts of edge, lack of connectivity) must be resolved by long-term, post facto management. To date, estimates of preserve persistence have not been used in MSHCPs. Rather than focus on map-based exercises of preserve elements, it may be more productive to set goals for the persistence of species (states) and ecosystems (processes) within the preserves-accepting that preserve configurations and arrays will be defined by the landscape and politics of suburban areas and that long-term management will provide the primary means of maintaining biodiversity along the wildland/urban interlace.

AB  - Young watermelon fruit was peeled and pickled for fermentation to produce a unique fermented food named xi-gua-mian (fermented watermelon) in Taiwan. In this study, we investigated the LAB microflora in xi-gua-mian. A total of 176 LAB isolates were identified; 118 cultures were isolated from the xi-gua-mian sample collected from three different farmers markets and 58 from six young watermelon fruit samples. These isolates were characterized phenotypically and then divided into seven groups (A to G) by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA and other genotypic analysis. Lactobacillus plantarum was the most abundant LAB found in xi-gua-mian samples collected in southern Taiwan, Tainan City and Pediococcus pentosaceus was the most abundant LAB in northern Taiwan, Taoyuan County. We found that LAB stains are similar in samples collected in the same geographic region but significant variations were observed between samples collected among different regions. On the other hand, a greater LAB diversity was observed in the young watermelon fruit samples. In addition, 10 Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis showed inhibitory activity against the indicator strain L. sakei subsp. sakei JCM 1157(T). This is the first report describing the distribution and varieties of LAB existing in the xi-gua-mian and the young watermelon fruits.

AB  - wide variety of topographical and environmental elements have been shown or proposed to influence the movement decisions of dispersing animals. Most real landscapes have topographical elements such as hills, valleys and urban developments, which can all act to modify a species' perceptual range and directly influence movement behaviour. If a visual-based perceptual ability enables a dispersing individual to locate suitable habitat patches at a distance, then it is to be expected that topographical features would act to modify the overall success of this strategy. However, the majority of individual-based Spatially Explicit Population Models (SEPM) employ only two-dimensional landscapes.
   To investigate the effects of topographical elevation on dispersal patterns, a three-dimensional visual-based perceptual range algorithm was added to the dispersal rules of an individual-based SEPM. To explore the possible influences of a behavioural-based response to topography, an algorithm modelling valley-seeking behaviour was also developed. The performance of both algorithms was compared with that of a two-dimensional visual-based perceptual range algorithm. The overall consequences of dispersal under each algorithm were measured by recording population sizes in a target wood in the centre of a modelled, real landscape.
   The size of the population in the target wood, modelled using both of the three-dimensional algorithms, exhibited sensitivity to the direction of dispersal in interaction with perceptual range, which differed from that predicted by the two-dimensional approach. Population size was dependant on the spatial configuration of habitat patches and on the topography of the landscape, both of which could guide dispersers either towards or away from the target patch depending on the particular combinations of dispersal directions and perceptual ranges selected. Topography was found to have a greater effect on dispersal at shorter perceptual ranges, and thresholds in the results for all three algorithms suggested the existence of species and landscape dependant optimal perceptual ranges. It is recommended that both topography and topographical-based dispersal-altering algorithms, commensurate with the studied species' behaviour, be incorporated into the movement rule-base of dispersal simulation models. The modelling of topography and its effects on movement in patchy landscapes are seen as essential ingredients in future landscape planning. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In a patchy landscape in The Netherlands, with fragmented forest habitat for the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus), 51 woodlots of different area and isolation were selected. For six months, a mark-recapture method was used to measure presence, absence, and related population parameters. In April the bank vole was not captured in five woodlots. The number of unoccupied woodlots fell to zero in September near the end of the reproductive season and rose again in October.
   Regression analysis showed that the habitat quality of the woodlots is related to the number of captures and numbers of individuals of both sexes, thus influencing the chance of local extinction. The area of the nearest woodlot also influences the numbers of males and females. As the distance to a permanently inhabited forest increases, the number of females decreases and both sexes fluctuate strongly. The results are discussed in relation to the metapopulation concept.

AB  - In the summer of 2015, an intense cyanobacterial bloom producing geosmin/2-methylisoborneol (MIB) occurred in the Roxo freshwater reservoir in Alentejo, Portugal. The drinking water supplied from the Roxo water treatment plant (WTP) exhibited an unpleasant odor/taste and a significant cyanobacteria density was detected in the finished water at the exit of the WTP. Cyanobacteria were not evaluated downstream of the WTP, namely, at the city reservoir. The aim of this work was to isolate and characterize viable cyanobacteria present in finished water (exit of the WTP and city reservoir) that withstand conventional water treatment. Treated water samples collected at both sites were inoculated in Z8 culture medium to provide the conditions for putative cyanobacterial growth. After 30 days, filamentous cyanobacteria were observed in cultures inoculated with samples from the exit point of the WTP. Viable trichomes were isolated and identified as Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii by morphometric and molecular analysis. None of the isolates were cylindrospermopsin/microcystin producers, as confirmed by ELISA and amplification of corresponding genes (PS/PKS and mcyA-cd/mcyAB/mcyB). ELISA results were positive for saxitoxin, but saxitoxin and derivatives were not detected by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (LC-FLD), nor were their related genes (sxtA/sxtA4/sxtB/sxtM/sxtPer/sxtI). To our knowledge, this is the first report on the establishment of cultures of C. raciborskii that resisted water treatment processes.

AB  - Carcasses from 346 raptors found between August 2001 and December 2004 were tested for West Nile virus (WNV) using virus isolation and immunohistochemistry; 40 were positive for WNV by one or both methods. Of these 40 birds, 35 had histologic lesions compatible with WNV infection, one had lesions possibly attributable to WNV, and four bad no histologic evidence of WNV. The most common histologic lesions associated with WNV infection were myocardial inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis; skeletal muscle degeneration, inflammation, and fibrosis; and lymphoplasmacytic encephalitis. Other lesions included hepatitis, lymphoid depletion in spleen and bursa, splenic and hepatic hemosiderosis, pancreatitis, and ganglioneuritis. Gross lesions included calvarial and leptomeningeal hemorrhage, myocardial pallor, and splenomegaly. Red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) (10/56), sharp-shinned hawks, (Accipiter striatus)8/40), and Cooper's hawks (Accipiter cooperii) (10/103) were most commonly affected. Also affected were red-shouldered hawks (Buteo lineatus) (2/43), an osprey (Pandion haliaetus) (1/5), barred owls (Strix varia) (4/27), a great homed owl (Bubo virginianus) (1/18), and eastern screech owls (Megascops asio) (4/42). Although birds were examined throughout the year, positive cases occurred only during the summer and late fall (June-December). Yearly WNV mortality rates ranged from 7-15% over the four years of the study. This study indicates trends in infection rates of WNV in raptorial species over a significant time period and supports the available information regarding pathology of WNV infection in Strigiformes and Falconiformes. Although many species tested were positive for WNV infection, severity of lesions varied among species.

AB  - Urbanization is among the most important and globally rapidly increasing anthropogenic processes and is known to drive rapid evolution. Habitats in urbanized areas typically consist of small, fragmented and isolated patches, which are expected to select for a better locomotor performance, along with its underlying morphological traits. This, in turn, is expected to cause differentiation in selection regimes, as populations with different frequency distributions for a given trait will span different parts of the species' fitness function. Yet, very few studies considered differentiation in phenotypic traits associated with patterns in habitat fragmentation and isolation along urbanization gradients, and none considered differentiation in sexual selection regimes. We investigated differentiation in flight performance and flight-related traits and sexual selection on these traits across replicated urban and rural populations of the scrambling damselfly Coenagrion puella. To disentangle direct and indirect paths going from phenotypic traits over performance to mating success, we applied a path analysis approach. We report for the first time direct evidence for the expected better locomotor performance in urban compared to rural populations. This matches a scenario of spatial sorting, whereby only the individuals with the best locomotor abilities colonize the isolated urban populations. The covariation patterns and causal relationships among the phenotypic traits, performance and mating success strongly depended on the urbanization level. Notably, we detected sexual selection for a higher flight endurance only in urban populations, indicating that the higher flight performance of urban males was reinforced by sexual selection. Taken together, our results provide a unique proof of the interplay between sexual selection and adaptation to human-altered environments.

AB  - This paper focuses on the evolution of Greenway planning and implementation in China, and provides a historical context to the Greenway concept. It was found that:
   (1) Although the concept of Greenway was an adaptation from the Western World, the Chinese have a history of more than 2000 years of Greenway planning and implementation. Chinese Greenways have been called various names and were planned for various reasons.
   (2) The long history of Greenway planning and implementation in China was mainly a "top-down" approach, which, while very effective under a centralized administrative system, often lacked a scientific basis and significant public participation.
   (3) The functions of the Greenways were mainly protection and productive, with little concern for human uses such recreational uses of cycling and hiking.
   Greenways in China are discussed chronologically and in three categories:
   (1) Riparian Greenways run along rivers, streams and water channels. The history of these Greenways dates more than 2000 years, since a time when trees were grown along canals and city moats. They have in modern times evolved into a network of drainage channels.
   (2) Greenways along transportation corridors. These Greenways run parallel to state and provincial highways, railroads, country roads and urban streets and evolved from tree plantings along highways. Used exclusively by emperors, the green corridor networks have been systematically planned and constructed at a national scale and directly organized by the central government.
   (3) Greenways along farmland for wind protection. These plantings evolved from individual segments of windbreak rows to a network of protective windbreaks and the large, regional scale "Green Great Wall" project running along the northern edge of China.
   As Greenways have evolved in China, they reflect changes in ideology, utilization and scale; from protection of production or beautification to ecological and multiple uses, and from small-scale fragments to a systematic regional and national network. The occurrence of disasters, the involvement of state leaders and the influence of science played an important role in the evolution of Greenways in China.
   The paper also argues that:
   the traditional top-down approach in Greenway planning and implement should be integrated with scientifically based methods;
   recreational uses should be considered and integrated into existing and planned Greenways; the recently invoked "city beautiful", or cosmetic approach to Greenway planning and implementation should be stopped; and
   Greenways should be planned as an critical strategic element of ecological infrastructure at both the regional and urban scale during current rapid and extensive urbanization occurring in China. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conservation subdivision is a design concept used by landscape architects and other built environment professionals to conserve wildlife habitat within growing communities. The idea is by Clustering homes together to maximize open space. one can conserve urban biodiversity. It is a popular concept used by many planners and landscape architects and is used in many municipalities as an alternative to conventional urban development. In this review paper, we systematically review Randall Arendt's book, Conservation Design for Subdivisions: A Practical Guide to Creating Open Space Networks, which has championed the conservation design concept. Through this review and our experiences with how the conservation design concept has been applied, we provide suggestions that will (1) maximize the potential of conservation subdivisions to conserve wildlife and their habitats, and (2) promote positive wildlife experiences for residents of conservation subdivisions. We found several recommended design elements that could negatively impact wildlife but of significance, we found that most guidelines and effort in conservation subdivisions are placed on the design phase: construction and post-construction phases are neglected. We discuss the social and ecological elements that warrant consideration during the construction and post-construction phases and how they are necessary in order to conserve functional wildlife habitat within a conservation subdivision.

AB  - Conservation of habitat patches and the related environment benefits both the focal species and human wellbeing. Many indices use the dispersal range to identify habitat patches with conservation priorities. However, there lacks approaches to identify environmental variables with conservation priorities (noted as target variables) in those identified patches. Therefore, this paper proposes an approach to identify environmental variables with conservation priorities in habitat patches using perception range and introduces the related assumption. It is assumed the agents select habitats based on their prior preference and perceived information in their perception ranges, which avoids the omniscient assumption of agents. Based on such assumptions, the proposed approach identifies the target variables by approximating how animals identify their habitats. It highlights the use of perception range and identifies target variables using the maximum information gain. The variables that contribute the largest reduction of uncertainty are regarded as the target variables in the habitat patches. Taking the Common Moorhen (Gallinula chloropus) living in Tianjin, China as the case, different scenarios with 100 m, 250 m and 500 m perception ranges are designed to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The proposed approach identifies the normalized vegetation index, rather than the distance to water surface, is the target variable in 42.3%, 58.9% and 72.1% habitat patches with given perception ranges. Adjustments are made on areas within the given perception range of each patch. More grid cells that has increased suitability index can be found in scenarios given 250 m perception range, which indicates the conservation area is not always the large the better. Optimizations are expected on both a better approximation method and a more thorough hypothesis of using perception range.

AB  - Invasive species are a growing concern with increasing global connectivity. Feral pigeons (Columba livia) are widespread and invasive, thus their effective control is of keen international interest. The COVID-19 pandemic has offered an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the impact of a nation-wide Circuit Breaker (restricted human activities) in Singapore on first, the abundance of the feral pigeons and three urban commensals-the Javan myna (Acridotheres javanicus), common myna (A. tristis), and house crow (Corvus splendens) in different food source types; and second, the activity budgets of feral pigeons. A significant and progressive decline in feral pigeon abundance was observed in open food centres and feeding hotspots after the Circuit Breaker was implemented. While the house crow and common myna were less affected, the Javan myna abundance increased moderately at refuse collection centres during the Circuit Breaker and decreased significantly in green spaces after the Circuit Breaker. Changes in food abundance could also predict changes in feral pigeon abundance and its effect was greatest in feeding hotspots. A greater proportion of feral pigeons was observed foraging and moving with a smaller proportion seen resting with probable consequences on their reproductive capacity. Our study also cautions against drawing inferences on biological responses due to similar social restrictions without careful consideration of other ecological factors, like average flock size and time of the day, which also affected the proportion of pigeons foraging on natural versus anthropogenic food. In summary, our results advocate a food limitation approach to control the feral pigeon populations.

AB  - Tree-dwelling mammals are potentially highly vulnerable to discontinuities in habitat created by roads. We used population modeling to assess the viability of a metapopulation of Australia's largest gliding marsupial, the greater glider (Petauroides volans), occurring in forest remnants in the fastest-urbanizing region of Australia, where habitat is dissected by major roads. Crossing structures for arboreal mammals (consisting of a land bridge with wooden poles for gliding and adjacent rope canopy bridges) have been installed over an arterial road that separates two of these remnants (one large, one small). It is currently unknown whether this species will use the crossing structures, but available tree height and spacing do not allow a glide crossing, and fences with metal flashing prevent access to the road by terrestrial and arboreal mammals. Our modeling reveals that even a relatively low rate of dispersal facilitated by these structures would substantially reduce the probability of extinction of the smaller subpopulation. This rate of dispersal is plausible given the small distance involved (about 55 m). The inclusion of wildfire as a catastrophe in our model suggests that these two remnants may encounter an undesirable level of extinction risk. This can be reduced to an acceptable level by including inter-patch movement via dispersal among other forest remnants. However, this requires connection to a very large remnant 8 km away, through a set of remnants that straddle two motorways. These motorways create discontinuities in forest cover that are beyond the gliding ability of this species. Crossing structures will be required to enable inter-patch movement. A priority for future research should be whether the greater glider will use road-crossing structures. Loss of habitat and habitat connections is continuing in this landscape and is likely to have dire consequences for wildlife if land managers are unable to retain appropriate habitat cover with corridors and install effective wildlife road-crossing structures where large roads intersect wildlife habitat.

AB  - Exemplars of Thaumastocoris peregrinus (Hemiptera: Thaumastocoridae), insect pest of the genus Eucalyptus, were found dead in the Eucalyptus grandis plantation in the city of Realeza, the southwest region of the state of Parana, Brazil, with white mycelial growth on the surface of the body. Isolation procedures were performed (in Potato-Dextrose-Agar culture) and identification of the pathogen, whereas the ratio between the microorganism and the insect has been established by Koch's postulate. The fungus through standard procedures, was identified as Beauveria bassiana. In the laboratory testing pathogenicity were performed and caused mortality confirmed in 72.2% of the insects at the concentration of 1.0 x 10(8) conidia. mL-1 after six days inoculation. Studies on the selection of isolates should be performed and justified by the growing demand of the forest sector in search of control strategies for this insect pest. Thus, was verified that Beauveria bassiana naturally infects Thaumastocoris peregrinus, occurring spontaneously in the Parana state.

AB  - Gaps in forest cover, created by agriculture, forestry, and other anthropogenic activities, are assumed to impede the movements of many forest songbirds. Little is known, however, about the reluctance of different species of birds to cross habitat gaps. We studied this by inducing birds in the post-fledging period to cross gaps of varying widths and to choose between routes through woodland or across open areas by attracting them to a recording of mobbing calls by Chickadees (Parus atricapillus). In 278 experiments conducted in boreal forest and agricultural landscapes near Quebec city, 157 birds or flocks of birds of five species were attracted. Overall, birds were twice as likely to travel through 50 m of woodland than through 50 m in the open to reach the recording. When given a choice of traveling through woodland or across a gap, the majority of respondents preferred woodland routes, even when they were three times longer than shortcuts in the open. However, species differed greatly in their response to gaps. Our results show that woodland links significantly facilitate movements of birds across fragmented landscapes.

AB  - Author summary
   Native to Southeast Asia, breeding populations of Aedes albopictus were first discovered in Harris County, Texas, in 1985, and as of 2017, seasonal populations of this species have been reported in more than 40 states and the District of Columbia. Aedes albopictus breed readily in natural or man-made environment where stagnant water can accumulate such as gutters, flowerpots, discarded tires, and tree holes. This mosquito species has been implicated in outbreaks of chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses and is a competent vector of many arboviruses including West Nile, eastern equine encephalitis, yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, and Japanese encephalitis. Aedes albopictus is regarded as an opportunistic mosquito feeding on a variety of domestic and wild mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians; however, a preference for human blood meals has been noted in blood meal analysis of field-collected mosquitoes and in laboratory investigations. We studied vector-host interactions of Ae. albopictus in Virginia, United States using molecular methods and identified ten mammalian, three reptilian, and two avian species as blood hosts of this mosquito species. Our study clarifies the host associations of Ae. albopictus and highlights concerns about the potential role of this mosquito species in transmission of emerging and reemerging arboviruses.
   Background
   As an invasive mosquito species in the United States, Aedes albopictus is a potential vector of arboviruses including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, and may also be involved in occasional transmission of other arboviruses such as West Nile, Saint Louis encephalitis, eastern equine encephalitis, and La Crosse viruses. Aedes albopictus feeds on a wide variety of vertebrate hosts, wild and domestic, as well as humans.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   In order to investigate blood feeding patterns of Ae. albopictus, engorged specimens were collected from a variety of habitat types using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention light traps, Biogents Sentinel 2 traps, and modified Reiter gravid traps in southeast Virginia. Sources of blood meals were determined by the analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences amplified in PCR assays. Our aims were to quantify degrees of Ae. albopictus interactions with vertebrate hosts as sources of blood meals, investigate arboviral infection status, assess the influence of key socioecological conditions on spatial variability in blood feeding, and investigate temporal differences in blood feeding by season. Analysis of 961 engorged specimens of Ae. albopictus sampled between 2017-2019 indicated that 96%, 4%, and less than 1% obtained blood meals from mammalian, reptilian, and avian hosts, respectively. Domestic cats were the most frequently identified (50.5%) hosts followed by Virginia opossums (17.1%), white-tailed deer (12.2%), and humans (7.3%), together representing 87.1% of all identified blood hosts. We found spatial patterns in blood feeding linked to socioecological conditions and seasonal shifts in Ae. albopictus blood feeding with implications for understanding human biting and disease risk. In Suffolk Virginia in areas of lower human development, the likelihood of human blood feeding increased as median household income increased and human blood feeding was more likely early in the season (May-June) compared to later (July-October). Screening of the head and thorax of engorged Ae. albopictus mosquitoes by cell culture and RT-PCR resulted in a single isolate of Potosi virus.
   Conclusion and significance
   Understanding mosquito-host interactions in nature is vital for evaluating vectorial capacity of mosquitoes. These interactions with competent reservoir hosts support transmission, maintenance, and amplification of zoonotic agents of human diseases. Results of our study in conjunction with abundance in urban/suburban settings, virus isolation from field-collected mosquitoes, and vector competence of Ae. albopictus, highlight the potential involvement of this species in the transmission of a number of arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika to humans. Limited interaction with avian hosts suggests that Ae. albopictus is unlikely to serve as a bridge vector of arboviruses such as West Nile and eastern equine encephalitis in the study region, but that possibility cannot be entirely ruled out.

AB  - Cassava is the sixth largest crop production and expression of the planet, being behind only soybeans, wheat, rice, corn and potatoes, is very important in human and animal feed and industry. The Brazil is the second largest producer in the world and this culture is the second highest expression of national economic. The Northeast region is one of the main cassava producers in Brazil, being the production use little or no technology, which has contributed to the increased intensity of diseases. The cassava root rot has been reported as a major cause of yield loss. Therefore, the objective of this study was to perform the first survey of fungi associated with cassava root rot in Pernambuco. Were collected plant materials with symptoms and / or signs of disease in four cities that are among the top producers in the Pernambuco state: Jupi, Jucati, Sao Joao and Caetes. We selected five properties in each municipality and the samples were collected in five areas with a history of disease in each property. The frequency of fungus isolation was performed by plating method, and isolation until pure culture for identification. The most prevalent were tested for pathogenicity in cassava cultivar branquinha. We found a high diversity of fungus associated with cassava root rot in Pernambuco. Fusarium solani was prevalence fungus associated with cassava root rot from all areas of Jupi, Jucati and Sao Joao and Scytalidium lignicola from areas of Caetes. The most prevalent isolates Fusarium solani (CFF109) and Scytalidium lignicola (CFF408) showed a high severity in cassava cultivar Branquinha.

AB  - Sukarno-Hatta street corridor is forecasted to be one of Malang City business corridors. However, the condition of its pedestrian facilities is not suitable for pedestrian. The rapid activities along the Sukarno-Hatta street corridor are not in accordance with the services of its pedestrian facilities; so, it is necessary to plan a walkable street corridor that accommodates pedestrian perceptions. Several descriptive and quantitative analysis methods used in this research are support activity analysis, the pattern of pedestrian movement, importance performance analysis and walkability tool index by U.S. Department and Human Services. Based on walkability analysis, the level of walkability of Sukarno-Hatta street corridor is 52.49%, which means the walkability level is medium. The improvements of pedestrian way based on pedestrian perception are: improvement and addition of pedestrian ways that are not continuous, planting plants that can reduce air pollution, availability of crossings, the addition of shade trees, traffic management to reduce vehicle congestion and parking designs.

AB  - Mammalian carnivores have suffered the biggest range contraction among all biodiversity and are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation. Therefore, we identified priority areas for the conservation of mammalian carnivores, while accounting for species-specific requirements for connectivity and expected agricultural and urban expansion. While prioritizing for carnivores only, we were also able to test their effectiveness as surrogates for 23,110 species of amphibians, birds, mammals and reptiles and 867 terrestrial ecoregions. We then assessed the risks to carnivore conservation within each country that makes a contribution to global carnivore conservation. We found that land use change will potentially lead to important range losses, particularly amongst already threatened carnivore species. In addition, the 17% of land targeted for protection under the Aichi Target 11 was found to be inadequate to conserve carnivores under expected land use change. Our results also highlight that land use change will decrease the effectiveness of carnivores to protect other threatened species, especially threatened amphibians. In addition, the risk of human-carnivore conflict is potentially high in countries where we identified spatial priorities for their conservation. As meeting the global biodiversity target will be inadequate for carnivore protection, innovative interventions are needed to conserve carnivores outside protected areas to compliment any proposed expansion of the protected area network.

AB  - Natural habitats on private lands are potentially important components of national biodiversity conservation strategies, yet they are being rapidly lost to development. Conservation easements and other means of protecting these habitats have expanded in use and will be most effective if they target private lands of highest biodiversity value and risk of loss. We developed a Biodiversity Conservation Priority Index (BCPI) based on ecological value and risk of habitat loss for remaining areas of natural vegetation cover (NVC) in the northwestern United States and addressed two questions: (1) Which remaining NVC on private lands is the highest priority for biodiversity conservation based on ecological value and risk of development? And (2) are conservation easements in NVC placed preferentially in locations of high biodiversity conservation priority? Drawing on the concept of ecological integrity, we integrated five metrics of ecological structure, function, and composition to quantify ecological value of NVC. These included net primary productivity, species richness, ecosystem type representation, imperiled species range rarity, and connectivity among "Greater Wildland Ecosystems." Risk of habitat loss was derived from analysis of biophysical and sociodemographic predictors of NVC loss. Ecological value and risk of loss were combined into the BCPI. We then analyzed spatial patterns of BCPI to identify the NVC highest in biodiversity conservation priority and examined the relationship between BCPI and conservation easement status. We found that BCPI varied spatially across the study area and was highest in western and southern portions of the study area. High BCPI was associated with suburban and rural development, roads, urban proximity, valley bottom landforms, and low intensity of current development. Existing conservation easements were distributed more towards lower BCPI values than unprotected NVC at both the study area and region scales. The BCPI can be used to better inform land use decision making at local, regional, and potentially national scales in order to better achieve biodiversity goals.

AB  - Different samples for the isolation of cyanobacteria were collected from University garden soil patches, fresh water samples from Tigra dam near Gwalior city. Samples collected were subjected to purification and isolation of cyanobacteria in specific media (BG11) under light condition. After 15 to 20 days of incubation they were able to grow in provided BG11 media with blue green appearance in flasks. Microscopy of the samples revealed that most of the isolates obtained and purified were filamentous with several types of movements. Biochemical characterization such as catalase, oxidase and urease tests was performed in which they were observed weakly positive for urease test while negative for oxidase and catalase test. Chlorophyll and carotenoid estimation was done along with antibacterial activity of cyanobacterial extract. Molecular characterization of the isolates was carried out with the extraction of DNA from each purified cyanobacterial strain. The universal and cyanobacterial specific 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced. The sequences were deposited to NCBI and phylogenetic tree was constructed to observe the relatedness among cyanobacterial isolates. After sequencing, isolates were identified as Nostoc sp., Limnothrix sp. from freshwater samples while Phormidium sp. was obtained abundantly from soil samples. Three distinct OTUs were obtained after phylogenetic tree construction showed their evolutionary relatedness. The antibacterial assay of cyanobacterial extract showed their therapeutic potential in the study.

AB  - The beginnings of the Cittaslow movement date back to 1998 Italian towns became a model for other European towns, and subsequently for others, around the world. This is how an international movement came into being, founded on the idea of improvement of the quality of life of residents, savouring "slow", healthy lifestyle, drawing on the tradition and history and respecting the natural and cultural environment of small towns. Green areas play a huge role in creating the image of Cittaslow towns. They constitute the so-called "green urban corridors" or " green spots" and have cultural, educational and social significance, including recreation and spa functions. They are not only a complement to architecture, but can play a superior role in the structure of cities. The aim of the work is to analyze the state of parks, squares and green areas management in the Cittaslow towns in region of Warmia and Mazury (Poland). There are 20 environmentally, spatially, economically and demographically diverse towns in the region of Warmia and Mazury that acceded to the association. The international network includes towns with a population under 50 thousand. An analysis of the source materials involved gathering and interpretation of information obtained from monographic and cartographic documentation, both current and archival, from websites of Cittaslow towns and mentions in the media. Apart from a monographic study, the authors carried out a landscape and spatial analysis, pre-project studies and made original designs for selected urban parks and greens in Cittaslow towns. All the Cittaslow towns in the Province of Warmia and Mazury under analysis have high potential in terms of using greenery areas with the social and cultural function. Parks and squares are perfect places for integration of communities and for conducting educational and cultural activities. However, diversity regarding land development and programme offer is observed (utility programme). In some towns, greenery areas cover only space with planned (not always in accordance with the art of gardening) plant compositions. However, parks and squares should be planned not only with their visual aspect in mind, but emphasis should be placed on their utility side (active use). Therefore, the article points to the directions of development of new places, as well the possibility of adding socio-cultural functions to existing greenery areas.

AB  - Stream microhabitats are strongly influenced by adjacent terrestrial land use and other anthropogenic disturbances. Therefore, sensitive stream fauna can be highly imperiled. We investigated relative susceptibility of stream-associated salamanders to riparian land use by studying species-specific responses that influence community assembly. The Piedmont and Blue Ridge ecoregions of the southeastern United States have high aquatic biodiversity, centuries of land use, and increasingly extensive urbanization. We surveyed low-order streams in these regions for salamanders across four riparian land uses (forests, agricultural, residential, and urban) and assessed 15 habitat variables at each sampling site. We found that forested streams were more diverse compared to streams affected by riparian land uses. Our study showed two distinct assemblages of salamanders in response to riparian land use: forest-dependent, large-bodied, long-lived species sensitive to riparian land uses (disturbance avoiders) and cosmopolitan, small-bodied, short-lived species that are relatively resistant to impacts of riparian land uses (disturbance tolerants). These assemblages varied in composition between the ecoregions, with Blue Ridge harboring more land-use-intolerant species. Results indicated that multiple habitat features of the riparian zone (canopy cover, canopy height, leaf litter cover), and stream geomorphology (bank complexity, streambed heterogeneity, sedimentation) are dramatically altered by riparian land uses, and influence the assemblage structure of salamanders. Riparian buffers in both ecoregions are largely unprotected (70% in Blue Ridge, 96% in Piedmont) and are possibly threatened with anthropocentric land uses. Results suggested that conservation of stream salamander communities should be strengthened with protection and restoration of riparian forests, connectivity among riparian forests, and soil-conservation practices.

AB  - Vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) has been reported from many parts of the world including Asian countries. Hence, main objective of study was to evaluate the possible occurrence of VRSA in hospitals of Lahore city and to ensure the effectiveness of various substitute therapeutic options. A total of 150 samples of pus/wounds were collected from three hospitals of the city and VRSA were isolated and confirmed through recommended method of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Out of 51(49.04%) methicillin resistant S.aureus (MRSA) isolates, 5 (9.8%) were found resistant to vancomycin. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Linezolid (LZD), Moxifloxacin (MFX) and Clindamycin (CD) were calculated against VRSA isolates by broth microdilution test. All 5 (100%) isolates were susceptible to Linezolid and Clindamycin, while 4 (80%) were susceptible to Moxifloxacin. Ethanolic extracts of Turmeric, Mint, Coriander, Garlic, Kalonji, Cinnamon and Cloves illustrate average MIC values of 140.8 mu g/ml, 563.2 mu g/ml, 486.4 mu g/ml, 614.41 mu g/ml, 409.6 mu g/ml, 281.6 mu g/ml and 64 mu g/ml, respectively against 5 VRSA strains. Concentration dependent increase in growth inhibition zones of ethanolic plant extract was recorded by agar well diffusion test. This study was helpful to find out the effective antibiotic against VRSA. Plant extracts encompass antistaphylococcal activity and this finding demands necessity of further exploration of potential found in these natural herb.

AB  - Yeasts of the Cryptococcus genus are distributed in nature associated to animal and vegetal organic residues. Occasionally, species other than C. neoformans may be responsible for infectious diseases in human and animals. This study aims to determine the occurrence of Cryptococcus species in the atmosphere and bird droppings in the city of Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil, and to evaluate three virulence factors: capsule formation, growth at 37 degrees C and melanin production. We analyzed 86 environmental samples (54 droppings and 32 air). Of the 41 strains isolated, 15 were C. neoformans var. neoformans (12 droppings and 3 air), 15 C. albidus (12 droppings and 3 air), 9 C. laurentii (7 droppings and 2 air) and 2 C. uniguttulatus (from droppings). Capsules were produced by 93.3% of C. neoformans var. neoformans, 66.7% of C. albidus, 88.9% of C. laurentii and 50% (1/2) of C. uniguttulatus. All, strains of C. neoformans, 20% of C. albidus and 44.4% of C. laurentii were able to grow at 37 degrees C. The melanin production on DOPA agar was verified in C. neoformans (93.3%), C. albidus (26.7%) and C. laurentii (66.7%). We concluded that different Cryptococcus species coexist in the same ecological niche and they are able to produce virulence factors. (C) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Channel evolution models (CEMs) are used to structure the interpretation of observed channel morphology to support long-term restoration of these systems. However, channels reflect the variety of their watersheds' climatological, ecological and physiographic contexts, and so no single CEM can be truly global'. Unrecognised differences between the assumptions and the reality of evolutionary trajectories of particular streams can subsequently lead to restoration actions that neither fully achieve their intended objectives nor successfully self-maintain even limited improvements. Despite the daunting variety of biophysical settings, however, urbanisation imposes distinctive, homogenising influences on virtually all watercourses, suggesting that even a relatively small set of evolutionary pathways can embrace much of the diversity of critical watershed drivers on urban channels. CEMs describing single-thread channel response to incision are most common in the published literature, but not every urban disturbance yields this classic sequence, initiated by excess transport capacity followed by incision, bank erosion, widening and ultimately a lowered re-equilibrated channel. A comprehensive urban CEM must also include responses under less common (but locally ubiquitous) conditions, such as excess sediment relative to transport capacity (the inverse' of the classic CEM), imposed constraints on vertical and/or lateral adjustment, and multi-thread channels or those influenced by instream or riparian vegetation. An urban CEM also requires a hierarchical framework that acknowledges fundamental differences in the process drivers within any given watershed, because a single observation of channel form can rarely pinpoint the context or evolutionary trajectory of every stream. We present a geomorphic framework for diagnosing and predicting the evolution of urban streams, potentially guiding the selection of restoration targets that are achievable within an urban context and sustainable without ongoing maintenance.

AB  - The study sought to investigate the process of built-up expansion and the probability of built-up expansion in the English Bazar Block of West Bengal, India, using multitemporal Landsat satellite images and an integrated machine learning algorithm and fuzzy logic model. The land use and land cover (LULC) classification were prepared using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for 2001, 2011, and 2021. The landscape fragmentation technique using the landscape fragmentation tool (extension for ArcGIS software) and frequency approach were proposed to model the process of built-up expansion. To create the built-up expansion probability model, the dominance, diversity, and connectivity index of the built-up areas for each year were created and then integrated with fuzzy logic. The results showed that, during 2001-2021, the built-up areas increased by 21.67%, while vegetation and water bodies decreased by 9.28 and 4.63%, respectively. The accuracy of the LULC maps for 2001, 2011, and 2021 was 90.05, 93.67, and 96.24%, respectively. According to the built-up expansion model, 9.62% of the new built-up areas was created in recent decades. The built-up expansion probability model predicted that 21.46% of regions would be converted into built-up areas. This study will assist decision-makers in proposing management strategies for systematic urban growth that do not damage the environment.

AB  - Nonpoint source pollution entering rivers will pollute water quality, degrading the health of aquatic ecosystems. However, owing to the lack of quantitative research on the effects of nonpoint source pollution on the structure of aquatic food webs, there is a lack of quantitative basis for river management. Nonpoint source pollution is not only difficult to control effectively, but also the success rate of water ecological restoration projects is low. With the increasing proportion of nonpoint source pollution in water environmental problems, it is urgent to quantitatively assess and predict the impact of nonpoint source pollution on the structure of food webs. Therefore, this thesis presents a method for quantitatively assessing and predicting the impact of nonpoint source pollution on the structure of food webs through using fuzzy clustering to screen the typical points of the impact of nonpoint source pollution, then using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and partial least squares regression analysis to comprehensively filtrate the driving factors affect food web that results in nonpoint source pollution, and then determining the impact of each driving factor on the structure of food webs. Finally, the change trend of food web structure is predicted. The results show that (1) the driving factors that the nonpoint source pollution that affects the food web structure is NH3-N and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The increase in NH3-N and COD promotes the growth of phytoplankton, causing the change of the primary productivity of the ecosystem, and ultimately changes the entire food web structure; (2) NH3-N and COD affect the stability, maturity, connectivity and complexity of the aquatic food web structure. The increase of NH3-N increases the connectivity and maturity of the food web structure but reduces complexity and stability; the increase of COD increases the connection of the food web structure, while reducing the other three indicators; (3) in some areas with good water quality, aquatic species diversity is high, the relationship of interspecies dietary is complex, food web structure level index is high and the structure of food web is stable. The food web structure in the rainy season will be better than that in the dry season. In some areas with severe water pollution and poor food web structure, the ability of the food web to resist external interference is weak. The food web structure in the rainy season will be worse than that in the dry season owing to rainfall into the river. The methods and conclusions in this treatise can provide a reliable and quantitative scientific basis for river ecosystem management and ecosystem restoration and can improve the success rate of ecological restoration projects.

AB  - Roads threaten animal species through habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, and direct mortality. It is crucial to understand how species respond to linear infrastructure for effective conservation of animal communities in fragmented landscapes. We assessed relationships between amphibian abundance and roads/ railways and habitat fragmentation. We examined whether the combined effects of habitat loss and roads or railways (accessible habitat) was a better predictor of amphibian abundance than (1) the total amount of habitat surrounding ponds, (2) distance to a highway or railway, or (3) surrounding road cover. Aquatic surveys for amphibian larvae were conducted at 30 freshwater ponds over the breeding season in a mixed peri-urban/ agricultural landscape in Hungary. Landscape variables were quantified within a 1000-m radius surrounding ponds and habitat variables were measured at the local (pond) scale. The larvae of seven amphibian species were detected. There were strong relationships between the abundance of amphibian larvae and the distance to a highway and the proportion of road cover within 1000 m of ponds. Relationships with accessible habitat and total habitat amount were uncertain, while there were no clear relationships with a major railway. Larval abundance increased with pond size, but there were mixed relationships with the presence of fish. Our results suggest that road effects were having a stronger impact on amphibian abundance than the combined effects of roads and habitat amount in the study area. Highways appeared to be negatively impacting amphibian communities within a wide road-effect zone up to 1 km from ponds. However, our results were obtained from a single-season snap-shot study and multi-season surveys are likely required to reduce uncertainty in the model predictions. Our analysis suggests that road mitigation projects for amphibians should create large ponds in areas with no highways and low road density, and with connectivity to surrounding habitats.

AB  - Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), is the most destructive pest of potato in many countries of the world. It first invaded China from Kazakhstan in 1990s and now is a major pest of potato in many areas of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang). The objective of this study was to determine the effect of temperature on the spread of Colorado potato beetle in China after its invasion. Cold temperature in winter (December) and high temperature in summer (July) were analyzed in accordance with the absence and presence of Colorado potato beetle in Xinjiang. The boundary between the absence and presence of Colorado potato beetle in Xinjiang nearly coincided with the -8 degrees C isotherm of monthly mean minimum temperature in winter. The stress of the low temperature in winter for Colorado potato beetle basically disappeared in the southeastern Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province of China, suggesting that the Hexi Corridor is the best channel to prevent any long-distance invasions of Colorado potato beetle into the Central Plains region. However, in Turpan City in northeastern Xinjiang, the extremely hot weather in the summer prevents the local colonization of Colorado potato beetle. Furthermore, according to our monitoring, high temperature in summer also limited Colorado potato beetle to diffuse eastward through Turpan. Results of this study suggest that it is essential to strengthen inspection and quarantine measures to prevent any artificial transmissions of Colorado potato beetle spreading eastward and thus to ensure the sustainable production of potato and other Solanaceae crops in northwest regions of China.

AB  - Deforestation and fragmentation are two of the main factors responsible for climate change. The construction of large enterprises such as hydropower plants can modify landscape dynamics, boosting the urban centers and other economic land uses. We evaluated the landscape around Governador Bento Munhoz da Rocha Netto Hydropower Plant, Parana, Brazil, aiming to identify the land use dynamics since its construction in 1980. Satellite images of the years 1976, 1984 and 2016 were obtained and landscape and patch metrics of composition, shape, core area, connectivity and isolation were calculated. The deforestation conversion profile was also evaluated. Our results showed a reduction of forest areas by 18.9%, with great replacement of forest stands. A large increase of small forest remnants was noted, indicating a high degree of landscape fragmentation and an expressive reduction of the core area. The deforestation profile revealed that the transformation rates were low, indicating gradual conversions. On the other hand, conversions of natural areas occurred in almost half the area in the initial years - which comprise the period after hydropower plant construction. Changes in the landscape may be related to the hydroelectric plant construction. However, the local economic cycle that happened naturally may have driven the forest fragmentation.

AB  - Bacillus thuringiensis is a spore-forming bacterium showing the unusual ability to produce endogenous crystals during sporulation that are toxic for some pest insects. This work was performed to study the composition, ecological distribution and insecticidal activity of isolates of this entomopathogenic bacterium from the Spanish territory. Using a standard isolation method, B. thuringiensis was isolated from 115 out of 493 soil samples collected in the Iberian Peninsula and the Canary and Balearic Archipelagos. The percentages of samples with B. thuringiensis were 31.7, 27.6 and 18.5 and the B. thuringiensis index 0.065, 0.067 and 0.11 for the Iberian Peninsula, Canary and Balearic Archipelagos, respectively. The prairies were shown to be the worst source of B. thuringiensis while forests, urban and agricultural habitats showed similar percentages. Strain classification based on H-antigen agglutination showed a great diversity among the Spanish isolates, which were distributed among 24 subspecies, including three new ones andaluciensis, asturiensis and palmanyolensis. We differentiated 65 different protein profiles of spore-crystal mixtures by sulfate-polyacrylamide get electrophoresis and we selected 109 isolates representative of these profiles to evaluate their insecticidal activity against insects from the Orders Orthoptera, Dictyoptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Diptera. We found variable percentages of isolates active against Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, one isolate highly active against mosquito larvae and for the first time, three isolates active against cockroaches and locusts.

AB  - The horse chestnut leaf-miner (Cameraria ohridella Deschka & Dimi, Lepidoptera, Gracillariidae) is an invasive pest causing extensive damage to leaves of the horse-chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L.) in Europe. In Lithuania, C.ohridella invaded in 2002 causing wilting, browning and premature fall of A.hippocastanum leaves. The aim was to get a better understanding of possible linkages between foliar fungal communities and leaf-miner damage in A.hippocastanum. Leaves of A.hippocastanum, differentially damaged by C.ohridella, were collected in 10 sites in Lithuania. The fungal communities were described through DNA isolation and amplification using an ITS rRNA marker and Ion Torrent-sequencing. Clustering of 214,897 high-quality sequences resulted in 1017 non-singleton fungal taxa, among which Aureobasidium pullulans (28.2% of all fungal sequences), Endoconidioma populi (27.7%), Phoma fungicola (11.3%), Cladosporium ramotenellum (7.6%) and Cryptococcus sp.2185_4 (5.0%) were most common. Correspondence analysis showed that fungal communities from heavily and slightly damaged leaves were largely intermingled, showing that in both types of samples fungal communities were similar. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that the phyllosphere of A.hippocastanum is inhabited by a high diversity of fungal species, the majority of which constitute generalist endophytes, epiphytes and saprotrophic fungi. The occurrence of common phyllosphere fungi was unrelated to the degree of damage by C.ohridella.

AB  - The western population of the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1987 due to extensive population declines. Declines have been linked to site conversion of native pine (Pinus spp.) forests for urban development, agriculture, and commercial forest management. We conducted surveys to detect tortoise burrows on corporate timberlands in southern Mississippi and southwestern Alabama during summer 1994. We surveyed 2,759 0.5-ha strip transects on soil types of 9 different suitability categories for gopher tortoises. We found 460 active and 264 abandoned burrows on the 1,380 ha surveyed. Edaphic and vegetative conditions, such as sandy soils and total and midstory canopy coverage, influenced gopher tortoise occurrence. Logistic regression analyses revealed that active burrow occurrence was related positively to deep, sandy soils and related negatively to total canopy closure and fine loam soils with limited sand content. Abandoned burrow occurrence was related positively to increasing midstory canopy closure and selected soil types. Sandy soils and open overstory canopy that created favorable burrowing, nesting, and foraging conditions were important influences in active burrow occurrence. Vegetation management techniques, such as prescribed fire, midstory control, and intermediate forest stand thinning, are recommended on gopher tortoise conservation areas and connective corridor habitats on commercial timberlands. We theorize that restoration of longleaf pine (P. palustris) forests on sandy ridges can produce desirable core habitats and dispersal corridors for gopher tortoises in landscapes dominated by intensively managed pine plantations.

AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that is transmitted by the female Aedes species. The number of dengue fever cases has increased in many geographic regions including Indonesia and one of them occurred in Bareng Tenes, Malang City, East Java Province. The objective of this research was to identify the potency of B. thuringeinsis isolates from Bareng Tenes, Malang, as the biological agent to control third instar Ae. aegypti larvae and to identify the potential B. thuringiensis isolates based on 16S rDNA sequence. B. thuringiensis was isolated from water and soil from 12 sites in the Bareng Tenes area. Bacterial isolation was performed using B. thuringiensis selective media. Several isolates had similar phenotypic characters with B. thuringiensis used to toxicity test against third instar Ae. aegypti larvae. The LC50-96h value was determined using probit regression. The most effective isolate was identified based on the 16S rDNA sequence, then aligned to the reference isolate using the BLAST program. A phylogeny tree was constructed using the Maximum Likelihood method. This study showed that among 22 isolates of B. thuringiensis, only BA02b, BS04a, and BA03a isolates have similar phenotypic characters with B. thuringiensis. Based on the toxicity test of B. thuringiensis against the third instar of Ae. aegypti larvae, it was indicated that BA02b and BA03a isolates were the potential agents to control Ae. aegypti larvae. BA02b isolate was the most effective B. thuringiensis (LC50-96h = 2,75 x 10(7) cell/mL). Based on 16S rDNA sequence, BA02b was identified as Bacillus thuringiensis var. Israelensis BGSC4Q2 (99 % similarities).

AB  - Salmonella infections in Antarctic wildlife were first reported in 1970 and in a search for evidence linking isolations with exposure to human activities, a comparison was made of serovars reported from marine fauna in the Antarctic region from 1982-2004 with those from marine mammals in the Northern hemisphere. This revealed that 10 (83%) Salmonella enterica serovars isolated from Antarctic penguins and seals were classifiable in high-frequency (HF) quotients for serovars prevalent in humans and domesticated animals. In Australia. 16 (90%) HF serovars were isolated from marine birds and mammals compared with 12 (86%) HF serovars reported from marine mammals in the Northern hemisphere. In Western Australia, HF serovars from marine species were also recorded in humans, livestock, mussels, effluents and island populations of wildlife in urban coastal areas. Low-frequency S. enterica serovars were rarely detected in humans and not detected in seagulls or marine species. The isolation of S. Enteritidis phage type 4 (PT4), PT8 and PT23 strains from Adelie penguins and a diversity of HF serovars reported from marine fauna in the Antarctic region and coastal areas of Australia, signal the possibility of transient serovars and endemic Salmonella strains recycling back to humans from southern latitudes in marine foodstuffs and feed ingredients.

AB  - Recent withdrawal of the US. military from the Republic of Panama has exposed 64,000 ha of lowland forest in the former Canal Zone to possible development. The forests form a 16-km-wide strip reaching 65 km from the Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean and function as the water supply for the canal and as home to one of the world's richest terrestrial biotas. We present an overview of the distribution of bird diversity in the forests of the canal area based on 10 years of inventories. A total of 498 terrestrial species has been recorded, of which 177 occur only in lowland forests. More species reside in Caribbean- than in Pacific-slope forests and in the largest forest tracts. The Panamanian government, recognizing the importance of the forests for protection of biodiversity and for proper functioning of the canal, has created two national parks and a national monument in the canal area. One large park, Soberania National Park, currently contains 92% of the region's forest-dwelling species. Two large tracts on the Caribbean coast, the Achiote Road forest and the Fort Sherman forest, are not designated as national parks but are recognized as important forest areas. Those two forests harbor species found nowhere else in the canal corridor Extensive fragmentation, disconnection of forested corridors between foothills and lowlands, and anthropogenic degradation of forests near towns have altered regional bird-community dynamics. Some dynamics occur on large spatial scales, such as the poorly understood movements of elevational and transisthmian migrants. Long-term maintenance of bird species diversity in the canal area will require preservation of the large forest tracts and reestablishment of a forested connection from the canal corridor lowlands to the Chagres lowlands and foothills in the east. Such conservation activities will be challenging to execute given the region's growing human population and desires for a stronger national economy. We recommend protection of remaining forests and active enforcement of protection laws to reduce hunting and further intrusions.

AB  - The common asparagus beetle, Crioceris asparagi (Linnaeus) and the twelve-spotted asparagus beetle, Crioceris duodecimpunctata (Linnaeus) are introduced Palearctic leaf beetles that feed exclusively on asparagus. The introduction history of these species in North America is reviewed and their dispersal to and distribution in the Maritime Provinces of Canada are described. Both species were first reported in Canada in 1899 in asparagus production areas in Queenston, Ontario, and other parts of the Niagara Peninsula where they caused serious crop damage. However, we discovered that both species were already found around Quebec City 22 years earlier. Populations now established in the Maritime Provinces of Canada probably originated from southwestern Ontario where most commercial asparagus production in Canada began and now occurs. Crioceris asparagi and C. duodecimpunctata spread steadily throughout eastern Canada by adult flight dispersal abetted by wind, by the dissemination of seeds by birds, and by commercial movement of root crowns and spears of asparagus. Asparagus escaped from cultivation, growing along transportation corridors (such as railway tracks, power utility right-of-ways and roads) and in vacant lands, which facilitated the spread and establishment of C. asparagi and C. duodecimpunctata throughout North America. Now, both these adventive pest species occur wherever asparagus is grown. Both C. asparagi and C duodecimpunctata are confirmed to occur in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, but not Newfoundland and Labrador. However, C duodecimpunctata is newly recorded from Prince Edward Island. These introduced beetles are not regulated by Canada or by the U.S.A., and they are readily controlled at economically acceptable damage thresholds.

AB  - A rare plant species of the Orchidaceae family, Dendrobium officinale is considered among the top ten Chinese medicinal herbs for its polysaccharide. Since 2021, when the dieback disease of D. officinale was first reported in Yueqing City, Zhejiang Province, China, Fusarium isolates (number = 152) were obtained from 70 plants in commercial greenhouses. The disease incidence ranged from 40% to 60% in the surveyed areas. Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) coupled with morphological characterization revealed that the collected isolates belonged to five species (sp.), viz., Fusarium concentricum, F. fujikuroi, F. nirenbergiae, F. curvatum, and F. stilboides, with isolation frequencies of 34.6%, 22.3%, 18.4%, 13.8%, and 10.5%, respectively. Notably, at least two Fusarium species were simultaneously isolated and identified from the infected plants. Finally, the pathogenicity test results demonstrated that such species were responsible for the dieback disease of D. officinale. However, F. concentricum and F. fujikuroi were more invasive compared to the other species in this study. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study was the first report of F. concentricum, F. curvatum, F. fujikuroi, F. nirenbergiae, and F. stilboides causing the dieback disease of D. officinale in China and worldwide. This work provides valuable data about the diversity and pathogenicity of Fusarium populations, which will help in formulating effective strategies and policies for better control of the dieback disease.

AB  - The use of the concept of greenway can be identified in Portugal throughout the 20th century as a planning and design tool. Several examples, such as the 'Improvement Plans for Lisbon' by Ressano Garcia (1901), the continuum naturale concept [Cabral, F.C., 1980. O Continuum Naturale e a Conservacao da Natureza. Conservacao da Natureza. Servico de Estudos do Ambiente, Lisbon; Andresen, T., 2001. Francisco Caldeira Cabral. Landscape Design Trust, Surrey, UK, 213 pp.], the Green Plan for Lisbon [Telles, G.R., et al., 1997. Plano Verde de Lisboa. Ed. Colibri, Lisboa, 197 pp.], deal with the subjects of implementing vegetation corridors, pedestrian networks and landscape quality. These examples establish Portuguese planning and design tradition within the international greenway movement first identified by Fabos [Fabos, J.Gy., 1991. From Park to Greenways into the 21st Century. In: Proceedings from Selected Educational Sessions, ASLA Annual Meeting, Kansas City, Missouri]. Though several projects have been developed at the planning level, there is a need to analyze the applicability of such a concept at the regional, municipal and local level. We must consider the characteristics of Portugal's cultural landscape, recognition by other professions dealing with planning and involvement by politicians. By analyzing five case studies, this paper shows the significance of the greenway as a planning and design strategy, which coincides, with the current objectives of political and planning authorities at the municipal level. It also proves that it is possible to reconcile political objectives and urban development while safeguarding landscape quality and providing new opportunities for public recreation and education. Greenway planning and design is now undoubtedly a subject of growing significance in Portugal. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The sparsity of long-term reliable climatic records hampers our understanding of human-environment interactions in the semi-arid Hexi Corridor, NW China. Here, we present a late-Holocene pollen record from a small alpine lake, Tian'E, in the western Qilian Mountains. The chronology is provided by nine accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) C-14 dates from terrestrial plant remains. The ratios of Artemisia and Amaranthaceae (A/C) are used to reconstruct the history of regional humidity: An unstable climate occurred during 1530-1270 BC; there were three relatively wet periods, at 1270 BC-AD 400, AD 1200-1350, and AD 1600-present; and there were two dry periods, from AD 400 to 1200 and from AD 1350 to 1600. Comparison with tree-ring data indicates that continuous droughts were responsible for the abandonment of several archaeological sites and ancient cities in the region, including the major city of Dunhuang, which was abandoned in AD 1372 and AD 1524 for nearly 200 years.

AB  - Introduction: Fungi of the genus Cryptococcus are cosmopolitan and may be agents of opportunistic mycoses in immunocompromised and sometimes immunocompetent individuals. Cryptococcus species are frequently isolated from trees and bird excreta in the environment and infection occurs by inhalation of propagules dispersed in the air. The aim was to investigate Cryptococcus species in bird excreta and tree hollows located in a university hospital area and in an academic area of a university campus.
   Methodology: A total of 40 samples of bird excreta and 41 samples of tree hollows were collected. The identification of the isolates was done by classical methodology and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
   Results: Twenty (62.5%) isolates of Cryptococcus were found in bird excreta and 12 (37.5%) in tree hollows. C. laurentii (currently Papiliotrema laurentii) was the most frequent species in both samples, being found in 5 samples of excreta and in 8 tree hollows. The diversity of species found in excreta (C. laurentii, C. albidus [currently Naganishia albida], C. liquefaciens [currently N. liquefaciens], C. friedmanii [currently N. friedmannii] and others) was higher than in tree hollows (C. laurentii, C. flavescens [currently Papiliotrema flavescens], and other yeasts).
   Conclusion: Many Cryptococcus species were isolated from excreta and tree hollows, and this fact is important for understanding the environmental epidemiology of those emerging pathogens for public health, as a way to implement surveillance actions and control of cryptococcosis.

AB  - Hospitalized persons with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) are placed in airborne isolation to prevent nosocomial infection, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). There is significant evidence that clinicians overuse this resource due to an abundance of caution when confronted with a patient with possible PTB. Many researchers have developed predictive tools based on clinical and radiographic data to assist clinicians in deciding which patients to place in respiratory isolation. We assessed the isolation practices for an urban hospital serving a large immigrant population and then retrospectively applied seven previously derived prediction models of isolation of PTB to our population.
   Our current clinical practice results in 76% of patients with PTB being placed in isolation on admission. However, 208 patients without PTB were placed in isolation unnecessarily for a total of 584 days. Four models had sensitivities greater than 90%, and two models had sensitivities of 100%. The use of these models would have potentially saved more than 150 days of patient isolation per year.

AB  - Myrtus plant has a variety of therapeutic properties. Regarding the abundance of the Myrtus plant grown around the city of lzeh, North East of Khuzestan province of Iran and its various therapeutic effects which have been used widely in the traditional medicine. The isolation of the main chemical components in the crude extracts obtained from the leaves of the myrtus shrub by maceration and Soxhlet extraction methods in various polar and non-polar solvents was carried out. The isolation and identification of the chemical components of the essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation from the leaves of Myrtus plant was done by using the advanced gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique. Maceration of the crushed leaves in toluene and Soxhlet extraction of the crushed leaves in toluene resulted in an oily material. TLC and column chromatography resulted in the separation of two fractions with R-f = 0.47 and 0.78. On the basis of various spectra (H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, UV-Visible, IR and MS), the fraction with R-f = 0.47 was identified as linalool (I) and the fraction with R-f = 0.78 was identified as 1,8-cineol (II). On the basis of the results obtained from GC-MS analysis of the volatile oil, it was concluded that the essential oil is consisted of four major components (alpha-pinene, 1,8-cincol, linalool and alpha-terpineol) totally 92.3%, one minor component (linalyl acetate 1.1%) and 23 other components with small amounts.

AB  - In Brazil, most urban sewage is discharged without treatment into rivers. This is the situation for the Rio das Velhas, which receives in its upper course the sewage of the state capital of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, with more than 2.4 million inhabitants. Our study focuses on the effects of basin urbanization on aquatic biodiversity and water quality in the Rio das Velhas. We use the assemblage structure and taxonomic composition of fishes and benthic macro invertebrates as biological indicators of water quality. Effects of Belo Horizonte's discharge included changes in water quality and declines in fish and benthos richness and diversity. However, the absence of dams in the Rio das Velhas main course, associated with connectivity with the Rio Sao Francisco system and tributaries in excellent condition, increase its rehabilitation potential.

AB  - 1. Invertebrates inhabiting marine and freshwater ecosystems make important contributions to global biodiversity and provide significant services that have cascading effects across ecosystems. However, this group is grossly under-represented in assessments of conservation status and often neglected in targeted aquatic conservation efforts.
   2. In global assessments of 7857 freshwater invertebrates and 2864 marine invertebrates, 30-34% were considered Data Deficient highlighting the paucity of information for making such assessments. Of the invertebrate groups that could be assessed, those with poor dispersal abilities and high local endemism, such as many gastropods, crayfish and mussels, are the most threatened.
   3. Springs and subterranean hydrological systems support the highest proportions of threatened freshwater species, while in marine environments coral reefs, lagoons and anchialine systems are particularly vulnerable.
   4. Key agents of biodiversity decline in aquatic ecosystems are water pollution, overexploitation and harvesting, habitat degradation and destruction, alien invasive species, and climate change. Effects of dams and water management along with pollution from urban, agricultural and forestry sources are the main threats in freshwater ecosystems, whereas a broad range of factors have impacts on marine invertebrates, including biological resource use.
   5. Significant impediments facing conservation of aquatic invertebrates are limited knowledge of their diversity, the need for broadscale actions to account for connectivity within and across ecosystems, lack of political will and investment, and the prospect that conditions may get worse before they improve, possibly not in time to save some already highly imperilled invertebrate species from extinction.

AB  - Urban land use strongly affects pollinators and plant pollination due to fragmentation and isolation of natural plant populations. On the other hand, urban land use can potentially be beneficial to pollinators through the presence of urban gardens and parks which are usually designed to ensure abundant flowering. However, little is known about the effects of urban land use on bees and the pollination services they provide. In an urban-pen-urban gradient around Leuven, Belgium we studied flower visitation rates to, and seed set of Trifolium repens (white clover) in public lawns. T. repens is an obligatory outcrossing plant and is therefore sensitive to reductions in pollinator services. We related our results to both local and regional variables using Boosted Regression Trees. The two variables that best explained the variability in visitation rates and seed set were the amount of green areas (gardens, parks, grasslands) in the surroundings and the abundance of T. repens in the lawns. Surprisingly, an increasing amount of green areas in the surroundings had a negative effect on both flower visitation rates to, and seed set of T. repens. Flower visitation rates by bumblebees responded positively to urban land use resulting in higher visitation rates and increased seed set in the more urban sites. This may point either to increased abundance of bumblebees in more urban sites or to a concentration effect of bumblebees in our urban study sites due to a lack of alternative forage resources. Responses will likely differ for other bee and plant species, but this shows that at least for T. repens, pollination is not compromised by urban land use.

AB  - Human activities are major drivers of water quality degradation, especially in densely populated cities. The water quality of the Ona River in Nigeria was studied by collecting and analyzing water and macrozoobenthic samples from 12 sites along the flow of the river. The biological water quality of the river was determined using its faunal composition, biodiversity indices, functional feeding guilds, and autotrophy to heterotrophy index. With the exception of sulphate, all the water parameters analyzed had higher values during the dry season than in the wet season, and most of them showed significant differences in their seasonal variations (p < 0.05). Water parameters including electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, phosphate and nitrate were above the recommended limits for aquatic life. Margalef diversity, Shannon-Wiener diversity as well as Pielou's evenness indices, all indicated a polluted freshwater system. The occurrence and high abundance of stress-tolerant animals like Chironomus and Tubifex species further established that the Ona River was polluted. The Ona River's low taxa richness (20 taxa) indicates that it was moderately impacted, whereas the absence of the stress-sensitive Ephemeroptera-Plecoptaera-Trichoptera taxa indicates that it was severely impacted. Only two functional feeding guilds (scrapers and collector-gatherers) were present in the Ona River, and the autotrophy to heterotrophy index indicates that it was an autotrophic system, which is typical of impacted freshwater systems. To halt the river's further deterioration and enhance its biological water quality, necessary measures are recommended, such as appropriate waste management practices and restoration of the river's corridor for riparian forestation.

AB  - Changes in the hydrological regime of Sahelian Rivers are considered based upon the example of the Middle Niger River and its exceptional flood in 2010 near the city of Niamey. It is shown that rainfall in 2010 was only average with respect to the long term record, with neither the monthly rainfall distribution in terms of the amount of rainfall nor the distribution of rainy events changing significantly in the last few decades. Particularly, no increase in the number of extreme rainfall events is observed.
   In spite of this, the Niger River's right bank tributaries have shown a sharp increase in runoff since the 1970s, which is still ongoing, and has resulted in a modification of the Niger River's regime from a single hydrograph to a two flood hydrograph, the local flood, occurring during the rainy season being the more pronounced one. This modification is likely due to an increase of bare soils and crusted soil areas as a consequence of human pressure, resulting mostly from the spatial extension of crop areas and the shortening of fallow periods. Changes in connectivity of the river networks on both banks of the Niger such as endorheism bursting events also caused an increase in the contributing basin area.

AB  - Relatively few farmers today actively maintain crop biodiversity, but for most of the history of agriculture this was the norm. Archaeobotanical analyses can reveal the processes that led to the evolution of crop biodiversity throughout the Holocene, an issue of critical importance in an era of climate change and agrobiodiversity loss. Indigenous eastern North Americans domesticated several annual seed crops, called the Eastern Agricultural Complex, beginning c.1800BC. Using population morphometrics, this paper reports new evidence for the evolution of a domesticated sub-species of one of these crops, erect knotweed (Polyongum erectum L.), and its subsequent diversification under cultivation. Morphometric analyses were conducted on archaeological erect knotweed populations spanning its ancient cultivated range, and these were directly dated to c.1-1350AD, anchoring the evolution of this crop in both time and space. Domesticated erect knotweed first appears c.1AD in the Middle Ohio Valley. A diachronic series of populations from western Illinois shows that this species was domesticated again c.150-1000AD. This study shows how agricultural knowledge and material were maintained and shared (or not) by communities during an important era in eastern North America's history: when small communities were aggregating to form the earliest urban center at Cahokia, in the American Bottom floodplain. A distinctive landrace was developed by farmers in the American Bottom which is significantly different from cultivated populations in other regions. Subsequent Mississippian assemblages (c.1000-1350AD) indicate divergent agricultural communities of practice, and possibly the eventual feralization of erect knotweed. Archaeobotanical studies have a vast untapped potential to reveal interaction between communities, or their isolation, and to investigate the evolution of crops after initial domestication.

AB  - The present work reports the survey of fungi on crops of economic importance in the region of Uberlandia, Alto Paranaiba and some cities of Goias, by the analysis of reports generated by Laboratorio de Micologia e Protecao de Plantas (LAMIP), Universidade Federal de Uberlandia, on samples of seeds or plant parts, from the year 2001 to 2008. The reports analyzed were classified by crop and, subsequently, notes were taken on the pathogens that were reported, on the type of analysis performed and on the amount of reports analyzed per crop. Two thousand four hundred ninety eigtht reports on samples of cotton, brachiaria, coffee, bean, maize and soybean were analyzed. Thirty six genera of fungi were found, and Deuteromycetes was the main cause of diseases, counting 82% of all occurrences. The main causal agent was Fusarium sp., which was responsible for 956 occurrences (18%), followed by Cladosporium sp. (682 occurrences, 13%) and Cercospora sp. (502 occurrences, 9%). Among the crops studied, soybean presented the largest amount of reports, 2071 (82% of all reports), followed by maize (127 reports, 5%), and bean (125 reports, 5%). Among the methods performed in LAMIP, the seed sanity test is the most required (1235 tests), followed by visual analysis (988 analysis) and, last, the isolation (275 isolations).

AB  - Many wildlife populations are either naturally, or as a result of human land use, patchily distributed in space. The degree of fragmentation-specifically the remaining patch sizes and habitat configuration-is an important part of population dynamics. Demographic stochasticity is also likely to play an important role in patchy habitats that host small local populations. We develop a simulation model to evaluate the significance of demographic stochasticity and the role fragmentation plays in the determination of population dynamics and the risk of extinction of populations on habitat patches. Our model is formulated as a Markov-chain stochastic process on a finite, spatially explicit array of patches in which probability of successful dispersal is a function of interpatch distance. Unlike past work, we explicitly model local population dynamics and examine how these scale up to the entire population. As a test case, we apply the model to the American pika (Ochotona princeps) population living on the ore dumps in the ghost mining town of Bodie, California. This population has been studied nearly continuously for over four decades and has been of conservation concern as the southern half of the population declined precipitously beginning in 1989. Our model suggests that both the specific configuration of habitat and landscape heterogeneity are necessary and sufficient predictors of the eventual extinction of the southern constellation of patches. This example has important implications, as it suggests that fragmentation alone can lead to regional extinctions within metapopulations.

AB  - California statewide West Nile virus (WNV) minimum infection rates in Culex thriambus Dyar mosquitoes are high; however, few specimens are submitted and tested each year, as their distribution seems limited to larval habitats along riparian systems. To evaluate the role of Cx. thriambus in the amplification, maintenance, and overwintering of WNV in Lake County, CA, the bionomics and vector potential of the species was investigated during 2014 and 2015. Culex thriambus was the most abundant mosquito species, with 1,153 adults and 7,624 immatures collected by vacuum aspiration and dip sampling, respectively, at the primary study site. Detection of WNV in four mosquito pools during September through November coincided with peak seasonality. Females entered and maintained a reproductive diapause during winter under field and seminatural conditions. Diapause was initiated in the majority of Cx. thriambus females by October and was terminated by 30 March. Some parous females (7.1%) and those in host-seeking arrest (7.1%) were collected throughout the winter period. An accrual of 679.51 degree-days (degrees D) was necessary for diapause termination under seminatural conditions. Culex thriambus females fed on 16 different avian species during spring and summer, and no mammalian feeds were detected. West Nile viral RNA was detected in four of 42 Cx. thriambus pools tested during June through November and infection rates ranged from 3.53-28.15/1,000 tested. In summary, WNV transmission may be increased along riparian corridors throughout California where Cx. thriambus mosquitoes remain relatively abundant.

AB  - In Ireland the profile of golf has increased significantly over the last decade. Today golf course superintendents are aware of the need to manage their golf courses in an environmentally friendly manner, to improve existing habitats, plant indigenous trees to increase biodiversity and create wildlife reservoirs. Four parkland golf courses comprising two rural (Gowran Park, "K Club") and two urban/(Elm Park, and Rockmount) were selected to determine the range, selection, management and use of native Irish trees on Irish golf courses in 2005. The courses were selected on the basis of their age, location and land area. A system was developed to grade native material based on the number of insects that different trees support, thus valuing the potential of a particular tree species on its ability to increase biodiversity. Using this method, a table was developed to classify the biodiversity potential of the existing trees on each of the four golf courses. The results show that native Irish tree species such as Quercus, Salix and Betula support more than two hundred insect species while Fraxinus, Sorbus and Taxus support between ten and sixty nine. It was also found that the cultivation of native trees on Irish golf courses was low, with non-native material accounting for most of the tree species found in each of the golf courses thereby limiting the potential to enhance biodiversity. The haphazard nature of the plantings and the lack of connectivity between tree stands indicated little planning of new planting schemes. It is recommended that native trees with local provenance be planted on Irish golf courses to increase biological diversity to create an environment where land use and habitat work harmoniously.

AB  - Ecosystem functioning is positively linked to biodiversity on land and in the sea. In high-diversity systems (e.g. coral reefs), species coexist by sharing resources and providing similar functions at different temporal or spatial scales. How species combine to deliver the ecological function they provide is pivotal for maintaining the structure, functioning and resilience of some ecosystems, but the significance of this is rarely examined in low-diversity systems such as estuaries. We tested whether an ecological function is shaped by biodiversity in a low-diversity ecosystem by measuring the consumption of carrion by estuarine scavengers. Carrion (e.g. decaying animal flesh) is opportunistically fed on by a large number of species across numerous ecosystems. Estuaries were chosen as the model system because carrion consumption is a pivotal ecological function in coastal seascapes, and estuaries are thought to support diverse scavenger assemblages, which are modified by changes in water quality and the urbanization of estuarine shorelines. We used baited underwater video arrays to record scavengers and measure the rate at which carrion was consumed by fish in 39 estuaries across 1,000 km of coastline in eastern Australia. Carrion consumption was positively correlated with the abundance of only one species, yellowfin bream Acanthopagrus australis, which consumed 58% of all deployed carrion. The consumption of carrion by yellowfin bream was greatest in urban estuaries with moderately hardened shorelines (20%-60%) and relatively large subtidal rock bars (>0.1 km(2)). Our findings demonstrate that an ecological function can be maintained across estuarine seascapes despite both limited redundancy (i.e. dominated by one species) and complementarity (i.e. there is no spatial context where the function is delivered significantly when yellowfin bream are not present) in the functional traits of animal assemblages. The continued functioning of estuaries, and other low-diversity ecosystems, might therefore not be tightly linked to biodiversity, and we suggest that the preservation of functionally dominant species that maintain functions in these systems could help to improve conservation outcomes for coastal seascapes.

AB  - Good urban riverfronts have both ecological and social benefits in urban planning and development. With rapid increase of urban stream rehabilitation projects in developing countries, the concept of Public Accessibility of Riverfront (PAR) has become a highlight in evaluating river ecosystem improvement. In this study the Comprehensive Index of Public Accessibility of Riverfront (CIPAR) that consists of 4 sub-indexes and 12 indicators is designed for assessing the conditions of PAR. The index system is novel for its combined consideration of riverfront accessibilities and benefits. These four sub-indexes measure (1) spatial accessibility reflecting riverfront openness and main transportation convenience, (2) visual accessibility reflecting visual field openness, (3) corridor continuity reflecting riverfront vegetation condition, water-oriented settings, and spatial continuity, and (4) amenity reflecting comfortable experience of riverfront environment and diversity of riverfront activities. Based on the questionnaire and field data collected during March 1-15, 2011, 24 reaches of the Suzhou Creek and its distributaries were assessed with CIPAR, and the urban riverfront after rehabilitation was quantified. The result showed that most of the reaches of Suzhou Creek still suffered a poor-fair PAR condition, and that among the four sub-indexes, visual accessibility got the lowest score with an average score of 0.7. The unsatisfactory PAR condition along the Suzhou Creek mainly resulted from the failure in synchronizing the planning and management of riverfront land uses and river channels in previous phase of the rehabilitation project. This case study supports the use of CIPAR to assess the effectiveness of riverfront rehabilitation project. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Here, we report the first confirmed autochthonous tick-borne encephalitis case diagnosed in Moscow in 2016 and describe the detection of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in ticks and small mammals in a Moscow park.
   The paper includes data from two patients who were bitten by TBEV-infected ticks in Moscow city; one of these cases led to the development of the meningeal form of TBE. Both TBEV-infected ticks attacked patients in the same area. We collected ticks and trapped small mammals in this area in 2017. All samples were screened for the presence of pathogens causing tick-borne diseases by PCR. The TBEV-positive ticks and small mammals' tissue samples were subjected to virus isolation. The sequencing of the complete polyprotein gene of the positive samples was performed.
   A total of 227 questing ticks were collected. TBEV was detected in five specimens of Ixodes ricinus. We trapped 44 small mammals, mainly bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and pygmy field mice (Apodemus uralensis). Two samples of brain tissue from bank voles yielded a positive signal in RT-PCR for TBEV. We obtained six virus isolates from the ticks and brain tissue of a bank vole. Complete genome sequencing showed that the obtained isolates belong to the European subtype and have low diversity with sequence identities as high as 99.9%. GPS tracking showed that the maximum distance between the exact locations where the TBEV-positive ticks were collected was 185 m. We assume that the forest park had been free of TBEV and that the virus was recently introduced.

AB  - Medically important arboviruses such as dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) are primarily transmitted by the globally distributed mosquito Aedes aegypti. Increasing evidence suggests that the transmission of some viruses can be influenced by mosquito-specific and mosquito-borne viruses. Advancements in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and bioinformatics have expanded our knowledge on the richness of viruses harbored by mosquitoes. HTS was used to characterize the presence of virus sequences in wild-caught adult Ae.aegypti from Tocantins (TO) state, Brazil. Samples of mosquitoes were collected in four cities of Tocantins state and submitted to RNA isolation, followed by sequencing at an Illumina HiSeq platform. Our results showed initially by Krona the presence of 3% of the sequenced reads belonging to the viral database. After further analysis, the virus sequences were found to have homology to two viral families found in insects Phenuiviridae and Metaviridae. Three possible viral strains including putative new viruses were detected and named Phasi Charoen-like phasivirus isolate To-1 (PCLV To-1), Aedes aegypti To virus 1 (AAToV1), and Aedes aegypti To virus 2 (AAToV2). The results presented in this work contribute to the growing knowledge about the diversity of viruses in mosquitoes and might be useful for future studies on the interaction between insect-specific viruses and arboviruses.

AB  - Rapid urbanisation and food system transformation in Africa have been accompanied by growing food insecurity, reduced dietary diversity, and an epidemic of non-communicable disease. While the contribution of wild and indigenous foods (WIF) to the quality of rural household diets has been the subject of longstanding attention, research on their consumption and role among urban households is more recent. This paper provides a case study of the consumption of WIF in the urban corridor of northern Namibia with close ties to the surrounding rural agricultural areas. The research methodology involved a representative household food security survey of 851 urban households using tablets and ODK Collect. The key methods for data analysis included descriptive statistics and ordinal logistic regression. The main findings of the analysis included the fact that WIFs are consumed by most households, but with markedly different frequencies. Frequent consumers of WIF are most likely to be female-centred households, in the lowest income quintiles, and with the highest lived poverty. Frequent consumption is not related to food security, but is higher in households with low dietary diversity. Infrequent or occasional consumers tend to be higher-income households with low lived poverty and higher levels of food security. We conclude that frequent consumers use WIF to diversify their diets and that occasional consumers eat WIF more for reasons of cultural preference and taste than necessity. Recommendations for future research include the nature of the supply chains that bring WIF to urban consumers, intra-household consumption of WIF, and in-depth interviews about the reasons for household consumption of WIF and preferences for certain types of wild food.

AB  - The spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) has gained much attention worldwide, while the contribution of vertical gene transfer (VGT) and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is still elusive. Here, we improved an emerging high-throughput single-cell-based technology, emulsion, paired isolation, and concatenation polymerase chain reaction (epicPCR), by lengthening the sequence of ARG in the fused ARG-16S rRNA fragments to cover the variance of both ARG and its hosts. The improved epicPCR was applied to track the hosts of a widely detected ARG, sul1 gene, in five urban wastewater treatment plants (UWTPs) during two seasons. The sul1 host bacteria were highly diverse and mostly classified as Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Clear seasonal divergence of alpha-diversity and interaction networks were present in the host community. The consensus phylogenetic trees of the sul1 gene and their host demonstrated incorrespondence on the whole and regularity on abundant groups, suggesting the important role of both HGT and VGT, respectively. The relative importance of these two ways was further measured; HGT (54%) generally played an equal or even more important role as VGT (46%) in UWTPs. The application of the improved epicPCR technology provides a feasible approach to quantify the relative contributions of VGT and HGT in environmental dissemination of ARGs.

AB  - Anopheles darlingi is the primary malaria vector in Latin America, and is especially important in Amazonian Brazil. Historically, control efforts have been focused on indoor house spraying using a variety of insecticides, but since the mid-1990s there has been a shift to patient treatment and focal insecticide fogging. Anopheles darlingi was believed to have been significantly reduced in a gold-mining community, Peixoto de Azevedo (in Mato Grosso State), in the early 1990s by insecticide use during a severe malaria epidemic. In contrast, although An. darlingi was eradicated from some districts of the city of Belem (the capital of Para State) in 1968 to reduce malaria, populations around the water protection area in the eastern district were treated only briefly. To investigate the population structure of An. darlingi including evidence for a population bottleneck in Peixoto, we analyzed eight microsatellite loci of 256 individuals from seven locations in Brazil: three in Amapa State, three in Para State, and one in Mato Grosso State. Allelic diversity and mean expected heterozygosity were high for all populations (mean number alleles/locus and H-E were 13.5 and 0.834, respectively) and did not differ significantly between locations. Significant heterozygote deficits were associated with linkage disequilibrium, most likely due to either the Wahlund effect or selection. We found no evidence for a population bottleneck in Peixoto, possibly because the reduction was not extreme enough to be detected. Overall estimates of long-term N-e varied from 92.4 individuals under the linkage disequilibrium model to infinity under the heterozygote excess model. Fixation indices and analysis of molecular variance demonstrated significant differentiation between locations north and south of the Amazon River, suggesting a degree of genetic isolation between them, attributed to isolation by distance.

AB  - The occurrence of Cryptococcus neoformansvar. neoformans and other yeast-like fungi of clinical interest in decaying wood inside tree trunk hollows, bark and other plant materials is reported. The var. neoformans was isolated from 3 of 45 (6.6%) wood and one of 390 Eucalyptusbark samples. Two of the positive wood samples came from a tree trunk hollow of Butea monosperma (Family: Papilionaceae) growing in Roshan Ara Garden, Old Delhi whereas the third was from a trunk hollow of Tamarindus indica(Family: Papilionaceae) growing outside of Talkatora Garden, New Delhi. The solitary positive Eucalyptus bark sample originated from Amritsar. The isolations of var. neoformans from decaying wood inside trunk hollows of B. monospermaand T. indica constitute the first record of the natural occurrence of this pathogen in association with these trees. The observation reinforces the recent evidence for decaying wood inside trunk hollows of some trees to be a new natural habitat of the variety neoformans. Besides, in consonance with their essentially saprobic character, a number of other yeast-like fungi were sporadically isolated. This includes, Cryptoccus laurentii Cryptococcus albidus Candida lusitaniae C. guilliermondii C. krusei C. tropicalis C. zeylanoides Trichosporon cutaneum Rhodotorula mucilaginosa R. glutinis Geotrichum capitatum G. klebahnii and Sporobolomyces salmonicolor. Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattiiwas not found in any of the 702 samples of plant materials, including the bark and detritus of Eucalyptus camaldulensis and E. tereticornis trees. A more extensive environmental survey, covering divergent climatic regions, is warranted to identify the natural reservoirs of var. gattii in India.

AB  - Rapid changes in agricultural landscape structure and composition affect many different farmland biotas, including carnivores, which are a key element of ecosystem stability, yet little is known about their distribution and habitat use. In this study, we evaluated how habitat characteristics on two different spatial scales (local and landscape scale) affected the forest-edge utilization by small and medium-sized carnivores in fragmented central European farmland. Based on an indirect method for detecting carnivores (scent stations), we sampled 212 forest fragments of different sizes (1-7864 ha) during April to May from 2006 to 2009. Our results indicate that carnivore utilization of forest-edge habitats was driven by landscape rather than local characteristics even though the overall extent of explained variation was small. The most important factors that determined response of the carnivore community were the area of farmland and that of urban land on a landscape scale. The corridor connectivity between small forest fragments and other spatial elements played a crucial role in the occurrence of red fox. Our results suggest that comprehensive studies on multi-species carnivore assemblage using scent station might be useful in evaluating species-specific response to habitat characteristics, especially if large numbers of stations visited by carnivores are available.

From 1999 to 2007 we investigated morphological variation in large samples of live Cooper's Hawks (A. cooperii) nesting in four study areas: coniferous woodland around Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, isolated deciduous woodlands in short-grass prairies of northwestern North Dakota, towns and rural deciduous woodlands along the border of North Dakota and Minnesota, and urban and rural mixed deciduous and coniferous landscapes of Wisconsin. These sites span 2660 km across the northern part of the species' breeding range. We measured body mass (i.e., size), wing chord, tail length, tarsus diameter, hallux length, and culmen length of breeding adults, finding significant and clinal variation in body mass (or size). The smallest and most similar-sized birds occurred in British Columbia and western North Dakota, larger birds along the border between North Dakota and Minnesota, and the largest birds in Wisconsin. Several other characters varied significantly when mass was used as a covariate. Variation by study site in mean indices of sexual size dimorphism was negligible and not significant. We speculate that the morphological differences we found, in part, are the result of geographic isolation, where diets, migratory behavior, and structural characteristics of nesting habitats vary across landscape types.

AB  - With the widespread use of the Internet of Things (IoT), use cases in IoT have been considered for solving social problems in various fields such as agriculture, welfare, disaster prevention, and transportation infrastructure. Additionally, crop damage caused by animals is a common occurrence all over the world. An example of such damage is the damage to agricultural crops and threat to elderly people owing to animals in Hakusan city, Ishikawa prefecture, where the Hakusan campus of the authors' university is located. Presently, measures against damage caused by animals are being implemented by installing animal traps and cages; however, it is necessary to patrol the conditions of capture, thereby increasing human effort. To solve this problem, the authors considered a wildlife monitoring system to remotely manage a cage by using a sensor or camera with Internet connectivity. Assuming that a large number of IoT devices would be used in such a system, the authors visualize a high network load problem. Therefore, the authors aim to reduce the load on the IoT network. In this paper, the part of the wildlife-monitoring system that is concerned the evaluation and consideration of network using MQTT is described.

AB  - Simple Summary Red deer, roe deer and wild boar movements and crossings of the two highways in Lithuania were modeled. Validity of obtained models was tested by comparing the pathway predictions to the real roadkill and roadkill cluster locations in 2002-2009 (at the time the models were created) and in 2010-2017 (testing the prognostic value of these models). Across both periods and on both highways, the roe deer roadkill locations were significantly closer to the model-predicted pathways than to randomly selected points. The prediction of roadkill locations was also good for wild boar. The roe deer roadkill clusters and multi-species clusters were significantly better represented by the model than by random distribution. Thus, habitat suitability-based models of ungulate movement are recommended as an additional tool for planning wildlife-vehicle collision mitigation measures. Roads do not only have a detrimental effect on nature (fragmenting habitats, isolating populations and threatening biodiversity), but the increasing numbers of wildlife-vehicle collisions are also a direct threat to humans and property. Therefore, mitigation measures should be placed with respect to animal distribution and movements across the roads. We simulated red deer, roe deer and wild boar movements in Lithuania, focusing on the two main highways A1 and A2. Using regional habitat suitability and linkage models, we calculated movement pathways and the most probable crossing zones in 2009. The prognostic value of these models was tested by comparing the pathway predictions to the real roadkill and roadkill cluster locations in 2002-2009 and 2010-2017. Across both periods and on both highways, the roe deer roadkill locations were significantly closer to the model-predicted pathways than to randomly selected points. The prediction of roadkill locations was also good for wild boar. The roe deer roadkill clusters and multi-species clusters were significantly better represented by the model than by random distribution. On both highways, the biggest differences in distance from the predicted locations were near big cities. We recommended wildlife movement models as an additional tool for planning wildlife-vehicle collision mitigation measures and we advise measures for increasing their predicting power.

T2  - SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EFFICIENT BUILDING DESIGN: MATERIALS AND HVAC EQUIPMENT TECHNOLOGIES
LA  - English
CP  - 2nd International Conference on Efficient Building Design - Materials and HVAC Equipment Technologies
AB  - An increase in population and limited land availability in modern cities means that concrete and steel frame high-rise buildings are being constructed more than ever. These buildings are technologically advanced, offering occupants comfortable environments, which is achieved by the use of building services installations. Mechanical rooms form part of these services and with multi-storey buildings they are inevitably located on intermediate floors, close to occupied areas. Noise and vibration generated from equipment and other installations in these rooms is emitted to surrounding spaces in the form of airborne and structure borne noise. Installing the correct type of vibration isolation can eliminate structure borne noise from machinery that is transmitted as impact sound and reduce the vibration to acceptable limits. To overcome the air borne noise, floating systems can be implemented, which are based on creating an air gap with a resilient surface. These floating systems are very effective in eliminating air borne noise by acting as barriers, which can be installed on walls, floors and ceilings in any room that requires acoustical treatment. Since MEP equipment and installations differ in size and shape and have their own operating characteristics, acoustical treatment and vibration isolation requires a technical and specialized approach. To achieve higher performance levels each piece of equipment will need individual attention besides investigating the whole installation. A general strategy together with key points for implementing acoustic insulation for mechanical spaces are evaluated in this paper.

AB  - Breeding birds in forest ecosystems are generally diverse, habitat selective, and easily sampled. Because they must integrate environmental variables over space and time, local populations of forest birds (like other animal and plant taxa) may provide meaningful signals of local forest health or degradation. We evaluated 949 breeding bird surveys in areas ranging from degraded urban/suburban forest remnants to relatively pristine old growth forests in the western Laurentian Great Lakes region of North America. The "human footprint'' across this landscape was represented by a one-dimensional numeric gradient derived from land cover variables, forest fragmentation metrics, and publicly available data on housing density and transportation corridors. We used an iterative, maximum likelihood approach to quantify species-specific responses to this human disturbance gradient. Many species showed significant directional responses, consistent with known life history attributes. Other species were most commonly detected at intermediate levels of anthropogenic disturbance, yielding unimodal responses. Relationships between the "human footprint'' and occurrences of 38 bird species were illustrated by general Gaussian functions that represented both unidirectional and unimodal patterns. These biotic response (BR) functions were combined into a bird-based index of ecological condition (IEC) ranging from 0 (maximally degraded) to 10 (minimally degraded). We described a successful application of the IEC method at the Wild Rivers Legacy Forest (WRLF), a >260 km(2) conservation landscape in northeastern Wisconsin, USA, managed primarily under a working forest conservation easement established in 2006. In general, areas within the WRLF yielded high IEC values (7.0-9.0), but nearby forest areas not under the conservation easement were characterized by significantly lower IEC values based on breeding bird assemblages.

AB  - We report on the development of 14 novel polymorphic microsatellite markers from the western ring-tail possum (Pseudocheirus occidentalis), a "threatened'' (Vulnerable) arboreal marsupial, endemic to the biodiversity hotspot region of south-west of Western Australia. The markers were developed to obtain population genetic data to quantify any changes which may be associated with increasing geographical fragmentation. We describe the diversity among 66 unrelated (adult) P. occidentalis individuals. Overall, the markers produced between three to eight alleles per locus and observed and expected heterozygosities of 59% and 69%, respectively. Due to predation by introduced foxes, urban encroachment changes in fire regime and the resultant levels of fragmentation in its range, these microsatellite markers are an important tool for evaluating population genetic information and for prioritising populations for conservation management.

AB  - A cohort of more than 500 children from Panama City, Panama was studied prospectively over five years for acquisition of antibody to Toxoplasma gondii. The direct agglutination test showed that 72 of 571 children seroconverted between one and six years of age, for a cumulative incidence of 12.6%. Children were examined by pediatricians quarterly,and illnesses that had occurred in the interval and their activities were noted on questionnaires. Thirty-eight variables were examined for their role as risk factors for seroconversion. There was a higher correlation between children's seroconversion and contact with dogs than with cats. Combinations of significant predictors without dogs explained only 67% of the seroconversions, but the same factors with dogs explained 90%. On the other hand, ingestion of raw or rare meat or eggs appeared to play no role in transmission. Cats were examined and 110 (45.6%) of 241 had Toxoplasma antibody on the first bleeding. Only two (0.5%) of 383 cat fecal specimens, when tested in mice, resulted in seroconversion. Ten (1.1%) of 924 soil samples resulted in seroconversion in mice that had been injected. Antibody to Toxoplasma was found in 52 (23.3%) of 226 rats (Rattus norvegicus) and two (0.035%) of 571 mice (Mus musculus). Two hundred sixteen birds of 16 different species were bled. Antibody to Toxoplasma was found in 13.4% of these birds, mostly in grackles, blue-gray tanagers, and doves. The rate of isolation of Toxoplasma was low: one of 23 in rats and three of 201 in birds. High relative risks (RRs) of transmission to children were predicted by contact histories with nursing dogs (RR = 5.8), weaned dogs (RR = 4.7), many flies (RR 3.6), 6-12-month-old dogs (RR = 3.4), weaned cats (RR = 3.0), 6-12-month-old cats (RR = 2.7), nursing cats (RR = 2.5), much garbage (RR = 2.4), and many roaches (RR = 2.2). The high statistical correlation of dog contact with seroconversion in children suggests the possibility that dogs, by eating and rolling in cat feces, are instrumental in mechanically transmitting Toxoplasma infection. In addition, flies, and to a lesser extent, cockroaches, may have practically important roles in transmission.

AB  - In 2005 and 2006, Ixodes ricinus ticks were collected on two slag (waste rock) heaps from coal mines in the Ostrava area (North Moravia/Silesia, Czech Republic), Oskar (site A) and Emma (site B), partially covered by vegetation including trees, and at a control forest site near Hlucin (site C). The mean numbers of I. ricinus nymphs and imagoes flagged per person-hour were high: 35.3 nymphs and 12.7 imagoes, at site A, 23.3 and 26.0, respectively, at site B, and 25.4 and 16.8, respectively, at control site C. Using dark-field microscopy, 100 nymphs and 100 imagoes (50 females and 50 males) from each site were examined for borreliae. The mean prevalence rates of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in nymphs and imagoes were 10.0 % and 12.0 %, respectively, at site A, 10.0 % and 24.0 %, respectively, at site B, and 13.0 % and 17.0 %, respectively, at site C. Differences in the prevalence of borreliae in nymphal and adult ticks from the slag heaps and control site were insignificant, but adult ticks from site B compared to site A contained borreliae significantly more frequently. The mean numbers of nymphs and imagoes infected with borreliae flagged per person-hour were 3.3 and 1.2, respectively at site A, 1.5 and 2.9, respectively, at site B, and 3.1 and 2.6, respectively, at site C. Isolation experiments for borreliae were carried out only in 16 ticks containing higher numbers of borreliae, with eight of these being culture-positive. The cultured borreliae were identified by PCR-RFLP as B. garinii (3 isolates: two from site B, one from site C), B. afzelii (4 isolates: one from site A, three from site B) and B. burgdorferi s.s. (one isolate from site A). Surprisingly, the results suggest that slag heaps, when covered by woody vegetation and frequented by humans, could theoretically pose roughly the same LB transmission risk to humans as common forest biotopes.

AB  - 1. Nature conservation and restoration traditionally focus on protecting individual sites. In parts of the world where the natural landscape has been severely altered for agricultural or urban use, individual patches are too small and isolated to ensure effective nature protection. Spatial processes, such as metapopulation dynamics, are disrupted and natural linkages in the landscape, such as water flows, are severed by modifications in the landscape and hydrology.
   2. We propose the identification of Operational Landscape Units (OLUs), which are defined as combinations of landscape patches with their hydrogeological and biotic connections, as a tool to facilitate wetland restoration in catchments with a high degree of fragmentation and strongly altered hydrology. The combined consideration of biotic (i.e. dispersal, transports of organisms) and hydrological connections (flooding events, groundwater flowpaths) is a new approach.
   3. We developed criteria for the delineation of OLUs in regional wetland restoration initiatives. The key elements for delineation are definition of the restoration objectives, identification of spatial landscape mechanisms and information on historic and present land uses and hydrologic management.
   4. As a case study, we delineated an OLU by applying these criteria in a restoration initiative for a large agricultural area that used to be a floodplain until the early 1950s in N.E. Twente, The Netherlands. The OLU encompassed not only the floodplain area to be restored but also a relatively remote nature reserve upstream as well as the stream connecting both areas. By restoring the historic water regime, flooding events would become a regular feature in the two areas and organisms including seeds would flow from the nature reserve to the restored floodplain.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Discussions of the proposed Operational Landscape Units with stakeholders (water authorities, nature conservation agencies, farmers) resulted in shared insights which will lead to modifications of the original management plan for the area. We believe the OLU approach will make natural resource managers aware of the importance of spatial processes and connectivity in landscapes and.. if properly applied, will lead to more natural and more successful restoration projects.

AB  - Hybrid zones are particularly valuable for understanding the evolution of partial reproductive isolation between differentiated populations. An increasing number of hybrid zones have been inferred to move over time, but in most such cases zone movement has not been tested with long-term genomic data. The hybrid zone between Townsend's Warblers (Setophaga townsendi) and Hermit Warblers (S. occidentalis) in the Washington Cascades was previously inferred to be moving from northern S. townsendi southwards towards S. occidentalis, based on plumage and behavioural patterns as well as a 2000-km genetic wake of hermit mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in coastal Townsend's Warblers. We directly tested whether hybrid zone position has changed over 2-3 decades by tracking plumage, mtDNA and nuclear genomic variation across the hybrid zone over two sampling periods (1987-94 and 2015-16). Surprisingly, there was no significant movement in genomic or plumage cline centres between the two time periods. Plumage cline widths were narrower than expected by neutral diffusion, consistent with a 'tension zone' model, in which selection against hybrids is balanced by movement of parental forms into the zone. Our results indicate that this hybrid zone is either stable in its location or moving at a rate that is not detectable over 2-3 decades. Despite considerable gene flow, the stable clines in multiple phenotypic and genotypic characters over decades suggest evolutionary stability of this young pair of sister species, allowing divergence to continue. We propose a novel biogeographic scenario to explain these patterns: rather than the hybrid zone having moved thousands of kilometres to its current position, inland Townsend's met coastal Hermit Warbler populations along a broad front of the British Columbia and Alaska coast and hybridization led to replacement of the Hermit Warbler plumage with Townsend's Warbler plumage patterns along this coastline. Hence, hybrid zones along British Columbia and Alaska moved only a short distance from the inland to the coast, whereas the Hermit Warbler phenotype appears stable in Washington and further south. This case provides an example of the complex biogeographic processes that have led to the distribution of current phenotypes within and among closely related species.

AB  - The catchments in the western Rift Valley escarpment of northern Ethiopia are highly responsive in terms of hydro-geomorphic changes. With deforestation, dense gully and scar networks had developed by the 1980s on the escarpment between the towns of Alamata and Korem, transporting huge amounts of runoff and sediment down to the fertile and densely populated Raya Valley. To reverse this problem, catchment-scale rehabilitation activities were initiated in the mid-1980s. In this study, we examine the major hydro-geomorphic response of streams after catchment rehabilitation. Scar networks in 20 adjacent catchments were mapped on Google Earth imagery of 2005, and their density was explained in terms of its corresponding Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and slope gradient. Soil and water conservation measures and vegetation recovery have reduced discharge and sediment flow which in turn resulted in various hydro-geomorphic changes. In a multiple regression analysis, scar density was negatively related with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and positively with average gradient of very steep slopes (r(2)=053, p<001, n=20). The size and amount of sediment supply to streams decreased, and various channel adjustments occurred. Notably, previously braided streams have changed to single thread streams, lateral bars have been stabilized and stream channels are narrowing and incising. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Fuel management for wildfire protection is becoming increasingly common in the wildland-urban interface and may have conservation implications for species with restricted distributions and limited dispersal abilities. To evaluate the impact of forest fuel management on the damselfly Argia vivida at the northern margin of its range, we examined terrestrial movements and habitat associations using Capture-Mark-Recapture and point count techniques. We found that habitats away from the springs were particularly important for A. vivida females. Most damselflies travelled at least 50 m between capture and recapture and patches of cleared forest up to this size did not pose a barrier to movement. Although A. vivida typically roosts in trees at night, cleared fuel treatment areas were preferred over unmodified or thinned forest as daytime basking and foraging sites. Preferred sites were also characterized by heterogeneous canopy closure, i.e., a clearing adjacent to unmodified forest with a closed canopy. We speculate that this behaviour derives from the species' thermoregulation requirements; the use of sunspots for thermal basking during the day and the use of forest cover at night to slow the radiant loss of heat. Our findings demonstrate the scale of movements that define available habitat and the importance of both daytime and night time habitat requirements in considering terrestrial foraging and movement corridors. Consequently, conservation efforts for this species in fuel management areas should focus on maintaining unmodified stands of dense trees in association with cleared patches of appropriate dimension, rather than a uniformly thinned forest.

AB  - Aims The Arbutus Greenway is a former railway corridor and current greenspace spanning 9 km in Metro Vancouver, BC. The objective of this study was to quantify variability in metal concentrations along the greenway and assess barrier effectiveness on reducing atmospheric deposition of metals from nearby roads. Methods At 5 sites along the greenway, soils and vegetation were sampled; metal concentrations were determined by ICP-OES. Results We found high variability in naturally occurring soil metal concentrations. We were able to associate the values with site history as a railway transportation corridor. In addition, we found higher concentrations of total soil metals in areas without a barrier separating the greenway from the heavily trafficked roads, indicating that atmospheric deposition of metals from roadways is occurring. The use of barriers seemed to be effective in reducing atmospheric deposition of metals in our study. Conclusions These findings support our conclusion that a thorough and comprehensive assessment of potential greenspaces prior to the planning phase, and continued monitoring during use, will be important to maintain public health.

AB  - Birds of the Jacarepagua lowlands, Municipality of Rio de Janeiro, State of Rio de Janeiro The coastal Jacarepagua lowlands are situated in the western municipality of Rio de Janeiro, with a lagunar system including the most important coastal lagoons of the region. Originally, the region was covered by restinga scrub located in sand soils with several marshes and swamps areas. The intensive urban occupation, principally since the 1970's, has fragmented the natural landscapes in the region. Isolation has been the destiny of the local restinga vegetation, while lagoons have been polluted and diminished by deposition of sediment and detritus. Since May 2004 we have studied the birds of the Jacarepagua lowlands. Several visits have been made to the municipal parks Chico Mendes, Bosque da Barra, Prainha and Marapendi. A bibliographical revision also was made searching by published ornithological studies in the region. A total of 176 species has been recently recorded for us in the field, corresponding to 63,5% of the 277 bird species known to the region. Thirty five species were never before reported for the Jacarepagua lowlands, although some species are common in the region, as Pale-breasted Thrush Turdus leucomelas and the invaders Picazuro Pigeon Patagioenas picazuro and Chestnut-capped Blackbird Chrysomus ruficapillus. Important bird species are the winter visitants Black-backed Tanager Tangara peruviana (a probably threatened species in the state of Rio de Janeiro), Ruby-crowned Tanager Tachyphonus coronatus, and Creamy-bellied Thrush Turdus amaurochalinus. The first record of Picui Ground-Dove Columbina picui in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro was made in the Chico Mendes Municipal Park. Our study has shown a significative and inevitable reduction of the local bird diversity in the last decades due to increasing human occupation and the isolation of the natural environments in the region

AB  - Soil characteristics of four distinct urban riparian plant communities were studied along a drainage ditch in Tempe, AZ. Our objective was to test if plant communities occurred in similar soil chemical conditions in an urban riparian area. We quantified reduction oxidation (redox) potential, pH, electrical conductivity, phosphorus, reduced iron and soil texture. Our results indicate that the four communities sampled occur in differing chemical conditions. Redox potentials in cattail and bulrush dominated communities ranged from -240 to -303 mV while levels of ferrous iron ranged from 17.0 to 38.5 mg kg-1. This indicates that soils of a highly anaerobic nature occur in these two communities. Redox potentials in knotgrass and Johnson grass communities were significantly (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) higher, ranging from +194 to +244 mV. Reduced iron was not found in these communities, indicating the more aerobic nature of these stands. Both cattail and bulrush communities were found in significantly finer soil textures than the knotgrass and Johnson grass communities. In addition to occupying the stream margins, the more aerobic conditions in knotgrass and Johnson grass communities may result from increased water interflow through the soils of these communities. Data of this type are important so that managers can set realistic goals for re-establishment of vegetation in riparian areas that have been impacted by urban and suburban development.

AB  - Background Global increases in human activity threaten connectivity of animal habitat and populations. Protection and restoration of wildlife habitat and movement corridors require robust models to forecast the effects of human activity on movement behaviour, resource selection, and connectivity. Recent research suggests that animal resource selection and responses to human activity depend on their behavioural movement state, with increased tolerance for human activity in fast states of movement. Yet, few studies have incorporated state-dependent movement behaviour into analyses of Merriam connectivity, that is individual-based metrics of connectivity that incorporate landscape structure and movement behaviour. Methods We assessed the cumulative effects of anthropogenic development on multiple movement processes including movement behaviour, resource selection, and Merriam connectivity. We simulated movement paths using hidden Markov movement models and step selection functions to estimate habitat use and connectivity for three landscape scenarios: reference conditions with no anthropogenic development, current conditions, and future conditions with a simulated expansion of towns and recreational trails. Our analysis used 20 years of grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) and gray wolf (Canis lupus) movement data collected in and around Banff National Park, Canada. Results Carnivores increased their speed of travel near towns and areas of high trail and road density, presumably to avoid encounters with people. They exhibited stronger avoidance of anthropogenic development when foraging and resting compared to travelling and during the day compared to night. Wolves exhibited stronger avoidance of anthropogenic development than grizzly bears. Current development reduced the amount of high-quality habitat between two mountain towns by more than 35%. Habitat degradation constrained movement routes around towns and was most pronounced for foraging and resting behaviour. Current anthropogenic development reduced connectivity from reference conditions an average of 85%. Habitat quality and connectivity further declined under a future development scenario. Conclusions Our results highlight the cumulative effects of anthropogenic development on carnivore movement behaviour, habitat use, and connectivity. Our strong behaviour-specific responses to human activity suggest that conservation initiatives should consider how proposed developments and restoration actions would affect where animals travel and how they use the landscape.

AB  - In a survey to determine the presence of Phytophthora ramorum in Serbia, ornamentals from garden centers, nurseries, and private and public gardens, as well as imported plant material, were inspected. In total, 577 plant, soil, and potting media samples were tested using various detection methods: lateral flow diagnostic test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, conventional polymerase chain reaction, and isolation, followed by identification based on growth characteristics in culture and morphological features. P. ramorum was not detected in any of the 162 soil or potting media tested by the baiting method. P. ramorum was detected in 12 Rhododendron samples from one private garden in Zemun (City of Belgrade District) exhibiting symptoms of leaf necrosis and blight and petiole necrosis, and in three samples of Pieris spp. from one garden center exhibiting symptoms of leaf necrosis. Eight Phytophthora isolates were obtained from the positive Rhododendron plants and three isolates from Pieris plants, and all were identified as P. ramorum on the basis of their uniform morphological and growth characteristics. P. ramorum conformation was also made by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer regions for a single isolate taken from one infected rhododendron and one pieris plant. Serbian isolates were determined as A1 mating type, due to formation of a few typical sexual structures when crossed with the A2 mating type of P. cinnamomi and P. cryptogea. Pathogenicity test on non-wounded detached leaves of 19 popular ornamentals, as well as the most frequently imported ones, revealed that 10 host species were susceptible, including Robinia pseudoacacia, which is widely distributed in Serbia. During this study, Cotoneaster horizontalis and C. dammeri were determined to be new experimental hosts of P ramorum. This article provides evidence of P. ramorum introduction into Serbia. Although P. ramorum has not been detected in Serbian production nurseries, its presence outdoors might cause severe damages on susceptible common urban plants in public green and natural ecosystems.

AB  - Currently there are no studies on the microbial karst niche in South Africa. Most of the studies on these environments focus on archaeology and animals that occur in caves. However, there are several caves that are threatened by urban development of the surrounding areas. The Bakwena Cave is such a threatened cave with extensive urban development of the surrounding grassland biome it is located in. The cave is located in dolomite and the entrance is a sink-hole. This cave serves as a permanent roost for a large population of Natal clinging bats Miniopterus natalensis. The ecosystem of the cave is driven by the deposition of guano by the bats, as there is no deep penetration of plant debris from the outside. To identify the fungal component of the microbial ecosystem, we sampled guano, soil, and sediment from various areas within the cave over a period of one year. All isolations were performed on low-nutrient medium to restrict the colony growth and to ensure that all culturable fungi were obtained. These isolates were barcoded using the ITS1 gene region to identify them and to establish a baseline of fungi occurring in South African caves. The majority of isolates associated were Aspergillus and Penicillium species identified in previous studies from cave environments. Some opportunistic pathogens were identified that could have an impact as more people visit the cave due to its close proximity to housing developments. However, currently the cave fits a model that indicates it has a low level of human disturbance. Our study is the first on the cave fungal component in South Africa and provides a baseline that can advise developers and environmental impact assessments on fungal species found in caves.

AB  - Fungal spore incidence inside Gandhi Gyan library of Wardha city was recorded by exposing potato dextrose agar and Czapek Dox agar culture media petri plates for 10 minutes and then incubated at 28 +/- 1 degrees for 4-5 days. The plates were regularly examined. Number of fungal colonies was recorded from the library for 6 months in the year 2011. Among the various species encountered Aspergillus niger, Asparagus fumigatus were the predominant fungi in the library. Investigations using the petri plate exposure culture plate method helped in determining the occurrence of fungal species in the air inside the selected library, which also causes allergic diseases to human beings working therein. The fungi were also isolated from highly damaged, old and unreadable books. The cellulolytic activity and damage of library materials by some common airborne fungi were studied. The present investigation dealt with the isolation of fungal species from indoor environment of library, identification of cellulose-degrading fungal species from library books and evaluation of cellulolytic capabilities, based on loss in weight of newspaper and book paper discs.

AB  - Whilst there are a number of mapping methods available for determining important areas for conservation within protected areas, there are few tools available for assessing the ecological value of landscapes that are 'beyond the reserves'. A systematic tool for determining the ecological value of landscapes outside of protected areas could be relevant to any development that results in a parcel of land being transformed from its 'natural' state to an alternative state (e.g., industrial, agricultural). Specifically what is needed is a method to determine which landscapes beyond protected areas are important for the ecological processes that they support and the threatened and vulnerable species that they contain. This paper presents the results of a project to develop a method for mapping ecologically important landscapes beyond protected areas; a Local Ecological Footprinting Tool (LEFT). The method uses existing globally available web-based databases and models to provide an ecological score based on :five key ecological features (biodiversity, vulnerability, fragmentation, connectivity and resilience) for every 300 m parcel within a given region. The end product is a map indicating ecological value across the landscape. We demonstrate the potential of this method through its application to three study regions in Canada, Algeria and the Russian Federation. The primary audience of this tool are those practitioners involved in planning the location of any landscape scale industrial/business or urban (e.g., new town) facility outside of protected areas. It provides a pre-planning tool, for use before undertaking a more costly field-based environmental impact assessment, and quickly highlights areas of high ecological value to avoid in the location of facilities.

AB  - Within the southeastern region of Queensland, Australia, native forest cover (bushland) has been greatly reduced and fragmented, and clearing is still occurring. Many of the region's bird species are being increasingly restricted to isolated habitat remnants. However, little is known about the habitat value of these remnants and whether their value is influenced by their degree of connection. We investigated bird use of riparian corridors in pastoral and urban surroundings and riparian linear remnants within an urban context. We compared the avifauna of these remnants with dryland and riparian sites within continuous bushland. We also assessed their use by previously derived response-guilds of birds to bushland clearing. We counted 3567 individuals of 102 bird species. Riparian bushland supported more species and had greater bird abundances than dryland bushland. Corridors and linear remnants supported densities of many bushland-dependent species similar to those in bushland; this varied with species' patterns of large-scale migration and residency. Bushland-dependent winter migrants used both corridors and linear remnants extensively. Bushland-dependent residents were most abundant in continuous bushland and least abundant in linear remnants, possibly reflecting the constraints of central place foraging. Effects of isolation were only evident in resident bushland-dependent species. Local habitat variables were significantly associated with variation in abundance of some types of birds within corridors and linear remnants; however, the differences in bird abundances attributable to spatial characteristics were greater than those attributable to habitat characteristics. The effects of bushland fragmentation and isolation were mediated by the extent to which species are dependent upon bushland and their patterns of large-scale migration or residency. Local habitat, and possibly more importantly altitude, may influence site use by winter migrants and generalist species.

AB  - Countries around the world have resorted to issuing stay-at-home orders to slow viral transmission since the COVID-19 pandemic. During the lockdown, access to public park plays a central role in the public health of surrounding communities. However, we know little about how such an unprecedented policy may exacerbate the preexisting unequal access to green space (i.e., green space justice). To address this research void, we used difference-in-difference models to examine socioeconomic disparities, urban-rural disparities, and mobility disparities in terms of public park access in the United States. Our national analysis using the weekly mobile phone movement data robustly suggests the following three key findings during COVID-19: (1) The elderly, non-college-educated people, poor people, and blacks are less likely to visit public parks frequently, while unemployed people appear to be the opposite. (2) Compared to rural areas, populations in urban neighborhoods appear to visit public parks more frequently and they generally go to larger parks to minimize the risk of infection. (3) Populations in neighborhoods with higher private vehicle ownership or those with a higher density of transit stops would more frequently visit and travel a longer distance to public parks during the stay-at-home order. Our results imply that conventional inequality in green space access may still exist and even become worse during COVID-19, which could negatively impact people's health during isolation. We suggest that special attention should be paid to park-poor neighborhoods during the pandemic and in the post-pandemic recovery phase.

AB  - Road-stream crossings represent a significant source of habitat fragmentation for global aquatic ecosystems, yet integrative conservation planning frameworks are lacking for most regions. We describe a connectivity conservation planning framework that draws on recent advances in the fields of surveying, modelling, and optimizing removal of crossings that block aquatic organism passage. We demonstrate this framework with a case study involving 1200 crossings surveyed in Florida, USA in which barrier severity was quantified on a continuous scale from 0 (complete barrier) to 1 (no barrier). Using field surveys, we built a boosted regression tree (BRT) model that linked barrier severity to 44 landscape variables representing natural (e.g., stream size) and anthropogenic (e.g., land use) stream conditions. We used a recently developed optimization routine to conduct two scenarios, including (1) surveyed crossings only and (2) surveyed crossings plus crossings modelled at 5545 unsurveyed locations. The BRT model explained 54% of variation in barrier severity scores and showed that the most severe barriers occurred on small, high-elevation streams draining urban and agricultural catchments. Estimates of connectivity gains following remediation were 5.3-times lower when unsurveyed locations were included in the optimization, suggesting inclusion of unsurveyed sites is critical for conservation planning. Results from this framework can be used over short (e.g., planning immediate barrier mitigation) and long (e.g., planning future field surveys) time horizons to benefit aquatic connectivity conservation. The survey protocol and modelling methods used here, combined with global datasets on stream conditions, can be applied to benefit connectivity planning in other regions.

AB  - Leishmaniases are parasitic diseases transmitted to mammalian hosts by sand fly vectors (Diptera: Psychodidae). Despite the increasing occurrence of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis cases in urban centers, their transmission still occur primarily in wild environments and may be associated with professional activities and recreation, such as ecotourism. The Reserva Particular do Patrimo A nio Natural Santua A rio do Carac E a (RPPNSC) is one of the largest ecotourism attractions in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, and comprises an area of environmental preservation with 11,233 hectares presenting a transitional vegetation between Cerrado and Atlantic Forest. The present study describes the abundance of small mammals in RPPNSC, the isolation and identification of Leishmania in five wild animals. Small mammals were bimonthly trapped along 6 trails within the RPPNSC with 10 Tomahawk traps each. Two trails were located in peridomiciliary areas near tourist lodging facilities, and four trails were located at sites visited by tourists in forest areas. The most prevalent species were Akodon cursor, Cerradomys subflavus and Oligoryzomys nigripes. Six isolates of Leishmania were obtained from these animals and identified as Leishmania braziliensis through HSP70-PCR RFLP method. Leishmania spp. DNA was detected by kDNA-PCR method and isolated by biphasic culture. Studies point to some of the captured species as potential wild reservoirs of Leishmania, suggesting they may be involved in the transmission cycle in these wild environments.

AB  - The fragmentation of forests is a consequence of human activities that intensively change the natural landscapes. In Brazil, there is a long-standing legal framework for native vegetation protection, called Forest Code. The last update is from 2012. The revisions incorporated in this restructured code (Law No. 12,651/12) encompassed new rules, rights and obligations for adequate land use management of productive systems and for environmental conservation and protection. An example of a protective measure was the creation of a Legal Reserve inside the rural properties and Areas of Permanent Protection around the watercourses. This study explored the effects of implementing the new code on the spatial and temporal evolution of forest cover fragmentation since the legal changes were set up. In that context, the area, perimeter and shape (circularity index) of forest fragments, as well as the buffer strips along watercourses, were assessed from 2010 to 2016 within the municipality of Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo state, Brazil. The assessment resorted to remote sensing techniques and visual inspection of orbital images. It was clear from the results that forest patches became more abundant but smaller, more dispersed and elongated, and that this route to fragmentation was hinged on a chaotic expansion of urban and agricultural areas. Important edge effects were anticipated from these results. The area numbers revealed that Ribeirao Preto was 7.95% covered with forest fragments in 2010, while this percentage rose to 8.03% in 2013 and reached 8.35% in 2016. Most of this increase occurred within a 30-meter wide buffer along the watercourses. This was a positive outcome. However, the numbers also revealed that forested areas smaller than 51 hectares increased from 71% in 2010 to 73% in 2016. The conclusions were that implementation of Law No. 12,651/12 is leading to an increase of forestland, but not yet promoting sustainability, namely through improved connectivity among fragments for reduction of edge effects and provision ecosystem services.

AB  - Urban gravel pit lake ecosystems are particularly susceptible to flooding and anthropogenic nutrient loading, and are therefore likely to be significantly affected by the future projections of precipitation extremes. Six shallow ex-gravel pit lakes at Attenborough Nature Reserve, (Nottinghamshire, U.K.), three connected to the nutrient-rich River Erewash and three isolated from it, were monitored from 2005-2008 (including the highest and 6th lowest rainfall years of a 40-year record). We aimed to compare lake ecological response to hydrological extremes and to see whether river-connected gravel pits responded differently to those fed mainly by groundwater. Our results showed that flood conditions in the river-connected lakes reduced the maximum phytoplankton biomass achieved and favoured smaller taxa (cryptophytes, Scenedesmus spp. and small centric diatoms). Consequently dissolved nitrate (NO3-N) and silica (SiO2) maxima were higher during flood years because of the reduced capacity for algal uptake, but dissolved and particulate phosphorus (P) concentrations were lower because increased flushing rates led to more effective removal of sediment-released P from the lake systems. Lakes isolated from the River Erewash responded less clearly to increased rainfall, except for a delay in the timing of the phytoplankton maximum, and a pronounced rise in SiO2 concentrations after drought conditions. Spatial comparisons also showed that nutrient pollution in the River Erewash and in storm drains feeding into one of the 'isolated' lakes (Beeston Pond) led to the existence of a turbid lake ecosystem state through the increased supply of dissolved NO3-N. The other isolated lakes had lower phytoplankton biomass and extensive aquatic plant coverage, but significantly greater proportions of bloom-forming cyanobacteria (Anabaena, Aphanizomenon), because of greater water retention times. Our results show that ex-gravel pit lakes connected to rivers may be more susceptible to ecological disruption from future flooding events and are heavily influenced by river water quality, but may be less susceptible to potentially toxic cyanobacteria blooms which may be favoured in lakes isolated from rivers with long water retention times. Artificial manipulation of urban lake hydrology to increase flushing with water of a higher quality or isolation of lakes from nutrient-rich inflows may be a useful management strategy, but the effectiveness of either approach depends on the ecological quality of the lake and inflowing river. Therefore, managing urban lakes in the face of climate change and increased urbanisation requires a detailed understanding of lake ecology and hydrology.

AB  - Urban land subdivision is one of the important stages in urban extensions. The meaning of urban land subdivision is not restricted to dividing residential lands to plots and demonstrating frontage of lots only. The aims of this paper are representation of the new concept of urban land subdivision and investigation of the relationship between urban space quality and land subdivision. The quality of urban spaces has decreased in new residential neighborhoods. The criteria of urban spaces quality are classified based on urban design and planning theories. It seems that one of the reasons of construction of undesirable urban spaces is the partial understanding of the concept and process of land subdivision, since it is not mono-factored. In general, every concept in urbanism is multi-factored. The research method in this paper is qualitative and is based on investigating global successful cases in urban extension. Global successful residential extensions will be investigated and represented based on land subdivision principles. Resident satisfaction in three land subdivision patterns, "grid, cul de sac and grid-cul de sac", will be investigated in three case studies. Karmandan (grid pattern), Olom paye (cul-de-sac pattern), Ansaria (grid-cul de sac pattern) are the case studies located in Zanjan Province. The questionnaire had 33 questions categorized in six groups of access, physical and spatial quality, safety, transportation, land use, recognition of neighborhood. Resident satisfaction in grid pattern was less than the two other patterns. Safety in grid pattern was less than the two other patterns, but access in grid pattern was more. In grid pattern, pedestrian access conflict with car is more than cul-de-sac pattern, so land subdivision patterns directly affect the quality of urban spaces in new urban extensions. Land subdivision pattern is influential in the qualitative criteria of urban spaces such as access, safety, hierarchical open space. Fundamental factors are physical, cultural, biological, economic, and political, therefore, the concept of land subdivision should not be restricted to the physical aspect only. Finally, suggestions will be given for increasing urban space quality based on urban land subdivision such as cohesive open spaces, mixed land use in edges, cul-de-sac access in residential land use, pedestrian access between blocks, shared semi public open spaces between residential blocks, variety in size, form and orientation of parcels, different gates for each neighborhoods for more visual readability in new urban extensions, use of hierarchical access networks rather than checkered networks for more pedestrian safety, use of small cohesive squares rather than large square, use of recreational facilities such as theatres, restaurants, cafes, cinemas, and libraries, hotels, and teenage meeting rooms, extending the usage of the square to night-time. Parking should be located in smaller areas closer to destinations, especially in higher density extensions and at local shops. They should preferably be located away from the street at the back of buildings. If parking lots are located at the front, a maximum of two rows of parking should be constructed. Parking structures should not dominate street frontages. Other suggestions include the effective separation of pedestrian and vehicular movement at a scale which encourages activity and pedestrian comfort. To maintain privacy, a minimal distance of 11 meters is needed, otherwise visual obstructing elements, such as trees, should be provided.
   Buildings should be constructed closer to the street so to increase pedestrian activity, reduce resident isolation, and foster pedestrian services such as retail outlets along streets connecting higher density extensions. Creating special public places would also help, as public spaces and public institutions are the focal point of community life. Public furniture should support the desired character of the space. Providing physical, visible and perceptual connectivity between cluster and linear open spaces, aligning the hard open space system and soft open space system with main public buildings, such as community centers or places of worship, and construction of public buildings in relation to formal public spaces and important movement routes are also beneficial. Hard open spaces
   should announce the buildings and accommodate informal activities that respond to these buildings. Locating symbolic and/or focal points in the middle of a cluster space or at the termination points of a linear space and continuation of special activities or functions that exist in the node and within the linkages towards the node are other suggestions

AB  - Brazil holds most of the Atlantic Forest Domain and is also one of the Rubiaceae diversity centers in the Neotropics. Despite the urban expansion in the state of Rio de Janeiro, large areas of continuous vegetation with high connectivity degree can still be found. Recently, new Rubiaceae species have been described in the Rio de Janeiro flora, which present small populations and very particular distribution. The current paper analyzed the similarity in the floristic composition of the Rubiaceae in eight Atlantic Forest remnants of Rio de Janeiro state protected by Conservation Units. We also surveyed and set guidelines for conservation of microendemic species. The similarity analysis were based on previously published studies in Area de Protecao Ambiental de Grumari, Area de Protecao Ambiental Palmares, Parque Estadual da Serra da Tiririca, Parque Nacional do Itatiaia, Parque Nacional de Jurubatiba, Reserva Biologica de Poco das Antas, Reserva Biologica do Tingua and Reserva Ecologica de Macae de Cima - using the PAST software ("Paleontological Statistics") with Sorensen coefficient. The floristic similarity analysis revealed two groups with distinct physiographic characteristics and different vegetation types. Group A consisted in two Restinga areas, Area de Protecao Ambiental de Grumari and Parque Nacional de Jurubatiba, which showed strong bootstrap support (98 %). Group B included forest remnants with distinct phytophisiognomies or altitudes, but with moderate bootstrap support. Low similarity levels among the eight areas were found due to the habitats' heterogeneity. The current study pointed out 19 microendemic species from the Atlantic Forest, they present a single-site distribution or a distribution restricted to Mountain and Metropolitan regions of Rio de Janeiro state. Concerning the conservation status of microendemic species, discrepancies between the Catalogue of Flora of Rio de Janeiro and the Red Book of Brazilian Flora (two of the main reference catalogs of Brazilian flora) have been identified. We have also highlighted the need for recollecting microendemic species from the Atlantic Forest, and for properly assessing the degree of threat faced by these taxons early.

AB  - The eco-environmental impact of highway construction is a long-term and cumulative process. Most of the existing studies pay attention to the environmental impact assessment technology of highway construction period and completion acceptance period, which can not fully explain the eco-environmental impact of highway operation period. At the same time, most of the previous studies have a single index and less consideration of the impact on species. Aiming at the highway located in the forest ecosystem in the middle temperate zone, considering the four aspects of species, land use, landscape pattern and ecological function, this paper establishes the post-evaluation index system of the eco-environmental impact of highway construction projects. This paper puts forward the quantitative assessment technology and spatio-temporal scale identification method of the long-term evolution of the impact of highway construction on the ecological environment, and uses the analytic hi-erarchy process to construct a comprehensive post-assessment system of ecological environmental impact of highway construction projects. Relying on the Changbai Mountain Ring Road, a 10-year comprehensive ecological impact assessment was carried out. Mammals tend to accumulate within 200 m of the road, and highway corridors attract bird activities; the animal mortality coverage rates of amphibians and reptiles are 100%, mammals 66.7%, and birds 50.9%. The utilization rate of bridges and culverts is 88% and 42%, and the total utilization rate is 49.3%. The landscape is changing to the dominant type of coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest, with lower evenness, less diversity and higher degree of natural connection, but the ability of the ecological environment to resist external changes is reduced. The closer the landscape fragmentation is to the highway, the more serious it is, and the lower the diversity is. The time and space scale of post-assessment of eco-environmental impact of highway construction project is in the range of 4-7 years and 200-300 m on the road side, and with the increase of operation time, the change of ecosystem along the line decreases year by year and tends to be stable gradually. The research results can provide a method of reference for the follow-up study of highway ecological environment in mid-temperate forest ecological areas.

AB  - Extensive acreage loss of coastal sage scrub (CSS), isolation of surviving stands, and the federal listing of several animal species with obligate relationships to this plant community, particularly the threatened California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica), have led to attempts to create CSS to mitigate habitat lost to urban development and other causes. Many of these creations lie within habitat conservation plan (HCP) sites, and they could play a more prominent role by being repositories for plants taken from a single site having site-specific genetics.
   Among others, one technique that increases initial resemblance to natural stands uses digitized, to-scale photography, which has been ground-truthed to verify vascular plant associations, which appear as mosaics on a landscape. A combination of placing patches of salvaged, mature canopy plants within larger matrices of imprinted or container plant plots appears to significantly enhance immediate use by CSS obligate bird species, accelerate "spread" or expansion of CSS, and can also introduce many epiphytic taxa that otherwise would be slow or unable to occupy developing CSS creations. Reptile, amphibian, butterfly, and rodent diversity in a salvaged canopy restoration case study at the University of California, Irvine, showed CSS species foraging and inhabiting transplanted canopy patches.
   Using restoration techniques to expand existing CSS stands has more promise than creating isolated patches, and the creation of canopies resembling CSS mid-fire cycle stands is now common. Gnatcatchers and other birds use restorations for foraging and occasional nesting, and in some cases created stands along "biological corridors" appear to be useful to bird movement. Patches of transplanted sage scrub shrubs along habitat edges appear to break up linear edge effects. There are no data on which long-term survival, succession, or postfire behavior can be predicted for CSS restoration sites, and postfire community changes are not part of either mitigation or restoration planning at present. Long-term planning including burning is needed so that a lire-adapted habitat will develop. Restoration is important in retaining genetic resources, for ameliorating edge effects, as habitat extenders in buffer zones around HCP sites, and by providing areas into which natural stands can expand.

AB  - Riparian wetland areas often represent critical corridors for animal and plant dispersion in wildland watersheds and downstream river systems. It is essential that integrated management of riparian wetland areas bc developed to reverse the loss of biological diversity. Agricultural and urban uses, and related water developments, have led to a marked decline of stream-side wetland habitats. Six major ways are discussed in which conventional agriculture alters wetlands and aquatic habitats: wetland drainage, water diversions, stream channelization, bank stabilization, grazing, and the release of agricultural pollutants. This article discusses these practices and suggests ways biological diversity can be protected, or even enhanced. In addition, aquaculture is discussed as a new force which affects the diversity of aquatic organisms. Aquaculture methods range in intensity of management from low to high. The higher the intensity the potentially more disruptive practices can be to surrounding aquatic systems. Management for biological diversity as well as for food production should be encouraged.

AB  - This paper describes the dynamic damage test of a reinforced concrete (RC) wall structure with seismic isolation sysytem It has been expected that seismically isolated structures are damaged in sudden when the accelerations of the structures exceed a certain level by hardening of the rubber bearings. However, the response behavior and the damage mode have not been observed by experimental test yet So, shaking table tests were carried out at "E-Defense", equipping the world's largest shaking table, located at Miki City, Hyogo prefecture, Japan The specimen was composed of an upper structure of 600 ton by weight and six lead-rubber bearings (LRBs) of 505 mm in diameter which provide both stiffness and hysteretic damping The upper structure consisted of a RC mass and four RC walls with counter weight. The RC wall structure was designed so that the damage of the RC wall occurred between the shear force at the hardening of the rubber bearings and that at their breaking. The dimensions of the RC wall were 1600 x 800 x 100 mm (B x H x t). The reinforcement ratios were 2 46% in vertical by D13 (deformed reinforcing bar, 13 mm in diameter) and 1.0% in horizontal by D10 The shaking table test was conducted consecutively by increasing the levels up to 225% of tentative design earthquake motion. Consequently, because of the increase of the structural response by the hardening of the rubber bearings, the damage of the wall structure with seismic isolation system suddenly happened. In addition, the preliminary finite element analysis simulated the test results fairly well, which were the restoring force characteristics, the crack patterns of the RC wall structure and such.

AB  - In the southwestern United States, non-native grass invasions have increased wildfire occurrence in deserts and the likelihood of fire spread to and from other biomes with disparate fire regimes. The elevational transition between desertscrub and montane grasslands, woodlands, and forests generally occurs at similar to 1,200 masl and has experienced fast suburbanization and an expanding wildland-urban interface (WUI). In summer 2020, the Bighorn Fire in the Santa Catalina Mountains burned 486 km(2) and prompted alerts and evacuations along a 40-km stretch of WUI below 1,200 masl on the outskirts of Tucson, Arizona, a metropolitan area of >1M people. To better understand the changing nature of the WUI here and elsewhere in the region, we took a multidimensional and timely approach to assess fire dynamics along the Desertscrub-Semi-desert Grassland ecotone in the Catalina foothills, which is in various stages of non-native grass invasion. The Bighorn Fire was principally a forest fire driven by a long-history of fire suppression, accumulation of fine fuels following a wet winter and spring, and two decades of hotter droughts, culminating in the hottest and second driest summer in the 125-yr Tucson weather record. Saguaro (Carnegia gigantea), a giant columnar cactus, experienced high mortality. Resprouting by several desert shrub species may confer some post-fire resiliency in desertscrub. Buffelgrass and other non-native species played a minor role in carrying the fire due to the patchiness of infestation at the upper edge of the Desertscrub biome. Coupled state-and-transition fire-spread simulation models suggest a marked increase in both burned area and fire frequency if buffelgrass patches continue to expand and coalesce at the Desertscrub/Semi-desert Grassland interface. A survey of area residents six months after the fire showed awareness of buffelgrass was significantly higher among residents that were evacuated or lost recreation access, with higher awareness of fire risk, saguaro loss and declining property values, in that order. Sustained and timely efforts to document and assess fast-evolving fire connectivity due to grass invasions, and social awareness and perceptions, are needed to understand and motivate mitigation of an increasingly fire-prone future in the region.

The H5 influenza A virus genes were detected from the intestinal organs, crop, and gut of the two blow fly species, Calliphora nigribarbis and Aldrichina grahami, by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for the matrix protein (M) and hemagglutinin (HA) genes. The HA gene encoding multiple basic amino acids at the HA cleavage site indicated that this virus is a highly pathogenic strain. Based on the full-length sequences of the M, HA, and neuraminidase (NA) segments of virus isolates through embryonated chicken eggs, the virus from C. nigribarbis (A/blow fly/Kyoto/93/2004) was characterized as H5N1 subtype influenza A virus and shown to have > 99.9% identities in all three RNA segments to a strain from chickens (A/chicken/Kyoto/3/2004) and crows (A/crows/Kyoto/53/2004) derived during this outbreak period in Kyoto in 2004. Our results suggest it is possible that blow flies could become a mechanical transmitter of H5N1 influenza virus.

AB  - A population survey during the general flowering (GF) of the critically endangered ornamental tree species locally known as Philippine teak (Tectona philippinensis Benth. & Hook. f., Lamiaceae) was conducted in four adjoining municipalities and across 14 barangays of Lobo in southern Batangas, Philippines in 2008. During the mass flowering episode of Philippine teak, 4,479 trees were counted based on plotless-ocular canopy density count. Natural population was pictured along coastal forests, littoral cliffs and inland exposed limestone ridges (5-200 m above sea level) in the municipality of Lobo (2,963) and adjoining Batangas City (946), Taysan (98) and San Juan (464). At least 62% (170 of 275 individuals) in the sampled habitats belonged to large diameter at breast height (DBH) class-size that exhibits GF. Flowering in at least >30 cm DBH class was observed during the arrival of the northeast monsoon in June until mid-July while masting started in August and drupes matured in September. Vegetative phenology (major leaf flushing) was observed from September to January until the population became leafless snags in summer.

AB  - A commercial yeast culture feed supplement (YC; Celmanax SCP, Vi-COR, Mason City, IA) was provided to turkeys throughout a 16-wk grow-out to determine if it would prevent the effects of stress on production and pathogen colonization. The YC was provided either continuously at 100 g/t (YC-CS) or intermittently during times of stress at 200 g/t (YC-IS). Birds were stressed with an environmental challenge of Escherichia coli and by transporting them in a vehicle for 3 h after which they were penned in new social groups, without feed or water, for an additional 9 h. Turkeys were transported and challenged at 6, 12, and 16 wk of age to model the movement of birds within a 3-stage housing system. The YC-IS was provided only for the first week after hatch and for a 1-wk period encompassing each challenge. At wk 7 and 9, a decrease in BW of challenged birds was prevented by YC-IS but not YC-CS. There were no significant differences in BW due to either challenge or YC during wk 11 and 13. At wk 16, the challenge decreased BW, but there was no improvement in either of the YC treatments. Overall feed conversion ratio (FCR) was increased by transport/E. coli (P < 0.0001). The YC-CS improved FCR of challenged birds by 21 points, whereas YC-IS improved FCR by 36 points and this effect was significant (P = 0.013). The YC-CS tended to decrease both Salmonella and Campylobacter isolation from the ceca of stressed birds (P > 0.05). The YC-IS also tended to decrease Salmonella isolation (P > 0.05) with no effect on Campylobacter isolation. These data suggest that the practice of transporting turkeys decreases performance and that YC-IS may be more effective than YC-CS for alleviating the effects of this stressor on feed efficiency.

AB  - A myriad of factors affect stream fish assemblages, and most of them are intimately regulated by surrounding land uses. One of the most pernicious impacts on streams is the release of urban effluents. Accordingly, understanding the fish assemblage patterns as well as the environmental drivers that modulate them in the context of urban streams which also are exposed to other land uses is mandatory. We evaluated the longitudinal patterns of fish assemblages in an urbanised Neotropical prairie stream exposed to downstream patches of different surrounding land uses. Several variables of water quality, in-stream habitat and riparian corridors were measured, and their relationships with fish metrics were explored. A fish metric selection protocol was implemented, and several multivariate analyses were used. Three main patterns of fish response were observed. Assemblage-level attributes as diversity, richness, biomass, number of families and trophic guilds and proportion of Characiformes and intolerant species were responsive to the natural gradient in habitat (pools) and riparian (riparian width) conditions expected in non-impacted lotic ecosystems. Conversely, a downstream continuum of recovery in water quality (dissolved oxygen, conductivity, NO3:NH4 and bacteriological loads) and habitat structure (sediment depth) would influence the distribution of fish species regarding their environmental tolerance and habitat preferences. Finally, local habitat aspects (nitrites, submerged macrophytes, bare soil cover and bank incisions by livestock) seemed relevant for the trophic structure (omnivorous species) of fish assemblages. A complex natural and anthropic longitudinal scenario together with local disruptions imposed by surrounding land uses were directive for fish.

AB  - Dengue fever (DF) is an endemic disease in developing countries including Indonesia. Bandung has the highest number of Dengue Fever in West Java Province with 1,180 cases. There is currently no drugs or vaccines that can prevent dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever, making vector control, both chemically and biologically, the primary prevention approach. One biological agent that has been used to control the larval population is Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). This study is an experimental study with factorial design aimed to obtain Bt isolates from soil of various altitude around Bandung city area period January to December 2015. Soil samples were acquired from 600 m, 800 m and 1,000 m above sea level. Sampling was conducted randomly from 3 points at every altitude. Bt were isolated with a selective medium. The acquired bacteria samples were then identified using gram stain, subterminal endospore observation, as well as glucose fermentation, citrate, indole, and manitol tests. Bt abundance for each altitude was calculated using Bt index. Three isolates with similarity with Bt were identified, i.e. STBD 2.02, CBRM 3.01 and KOPO 3.02 isolates. Bt index value indicates that the abundance of Bt at 800 m altitude is the highest compared to others.

AB  - River floodplains are hotspots of productivity and biodiversity and recognized to fulfil vital ecosystem functions and services. Restoration measures of the decoupled Danube floodplains east of Vienna aim to re-establish multi-functionality, that is, ensure navigation, preserve and restore unique fluvial and riparian habitats and re-establish natural processes and service provisioning. Side-channels are proposed for reconnection combined with the removal of embankments and groins. We evaluated how a programme of measures influences the diversity and quantity of specific ecosystem services (ES) and therefore, the overall multi-functionality of the floodplain compared to the current situation. Therefore, regulating ecosystem services (RES), such as nutrient retention and habitat provisioning, were modelled and predicted using multivariate regression models. Also, the potential of cultural ecosystem services (CES) was assessed based on mapping of recreational activities. The impact of proposed measures on ES quantity, that is, quantitative spatial representation, and quality, that is, biodiversity and nature experience, as well as potential synergies and trade-offs were analysed. Our results show clear synergies especially for RES (habitat for the rheotopic community and nutrient retention) and the CES of nature experience. Those services have a weak and local trade-off with the quantitative availability of opportunities for recreation. This pattern could only be detected by considering both, quantitative as well as qualitative aspects of ES. Overall, our results show that the restoration measures have a high potential to increase the multi-functionality of the floodplain system by supporting the provisioning of RES including habitat for endangered species and selected CES.

AB  - Dyeing wastewater collected in Kyoto city, Japan, was investigated for the occurrence of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands by using an AhR-responsive reporter gene assay. Concentrated extracts of wastewater samples elicited a dose-dependent increase in AhR ligand activity, and several hydrophobic HPLC fractions of the extracts were highly effective in inducing AhR ligand activity. Three potential AhR ligands were isolated from these fractions and identified to be Disperse Red 92, Disperse Yellow 64, and 3'-hydroxybenzo[b]quinophthalone by using HPLC and LC-MS/MS. Disperse Red 92, which has also been detected in the treated effluent from a sewage plant receiving the wastewater, is an anthraquinone disperse dye showing weak AhR binding affinity in the assay. Disperse Yellow 64 and 3'-hydroxybenzo[b]quinophthalone are quinoline disperse dyes capable of activating the AhR at nanomolar concentrations. In particular, Disperse Yellow 64 is a highly potent AhR ligand that was 3 times more effective in inducing AhR ligand activity than beta-naphthoflavone in the assay. Quinoline disperse dyes are suggested to be a new class of xenobiotic AhR ligands which pose a danger to aquatic biota and human health.

AB  - Riparian vegetation depends on hydrological resources and has to adapt to changes in water levels and soil moisture conditions. The origin and mixing of water in the streamside corridor were studied in detail. The development of riparian woodland often reflects the evolution of hydrological events. River water levels and topography are certainly the main causes of the exchange between groundwater and river water through the riverbank. Stable isotopes, such as 180, are useful tools that allow water movement to be traced. Two main water sources are typically present: (i) river water, depleted of heavy isotopes, originating upstream, and (ii) groundwater, which comes mainly from the local rainfall. On the Garonne River bank field site downstream of Toulouse, the mixing of these two waters is variable, and depends mainly on the river level and the geographical position. The output of the groundwater into the river water is not diffuse on a large scale, but localised at few places.
   At the confluence of two rivers, the water-mixing area is more complex because of the presence of a third source of water. In this situation, groundwater supports the hydrologic pressure of both rivers until they merge, this pressure could influence its outflow. Two cases will be presented. The first is the confluence of the Garonne and the Ariege Rivers in the south-west of France, both rivers coming from the slopes of the Pyrenees mountains. Localised groundwater outputs have been detected about 200 m before the confluence. The second case presented is the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamuna Rivers in the north of India, downstream of the city of Allahabad. These rivers are the two main tributaries of the Ganges, and both originate in the Himalayas. A strong stream of groundwater output was measured at the point of confluence. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Polygonum amplexicaule D. Don (Polygonaceae) (Chinese name: Xuesanqi) is a widely distributed medicinal plant in China. It has been used in folk medicine to treat many common and frequently-occurring diseases, such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, fractures, pain, etc. Thus, this plant has been of interest to researchers. However, the chemical constituents of Xuesanqi have not been investigated systematically. This study isolated and identified some effective compounds in this plant. The structure of important active chemicals of Xuesanqi from different regions was determined for the first time. Twelve phenolic compounds were isolated from this plant. Vanillin, isovanillic acid, p-hydroxyphenethyl alcohol, dihydro-kaempferol, and 5,7-dihydroxychromone were determined for the first time from Polygonum. As markers for quality standard of this herb, the content of methyl caffeate and ethyl caffeate was determined by HPLC. It was found that Xuesanqi from Wufeng, Lichuan, Badong Counties in Hubei Province and Jiujiang City of Jiangxi Province had higher content of both chemicals. The results suggest that the herb might be a potential source of phenolic compounds of an agent for improving blood circulation, treating various fractures, muscle and tissue swelling, and pain.

AB  - Five large (greater than 35 ha) urban bushland reserves in Greater Sydney were selected where herpetofaunal assemblages could be deduced and there were recent herpetofauna surveys. Four reserves (Rockdale Wetlands Corridor, Wolli Creek Valley, Burnt Bridge Creek Corridor and Middle Harbour Bushland Reserves) had been surrounded by residential development for more than 50 years. The fifth (University of Western Sydney, Richmond campus) was surrounded by agricultural and peri-urban development. Records from the scientific literature, local natural history groups, amateur herpetologists and council archives were used to gather historic information on the frogs and reptiles. Interviews were also conducted with researchers and neighbours of the reserves. Eight extant species were common to all reserves while another, predicted to be in all reserves, was universally absent. Despite the relatively large size of these bushland remnants, in all reserves the number of reptile and frog species had declined since urbanisation. The largest losses occurred in the four urban reserves. Seven species predicted to have occurred historically were now only present in the peri-urban site. Some herpetofaunal groups were more vulnerable than others. Goannas were locally extinct in urban reserves. Tree frogs and geckos were depleted while ground frogs and skinks were reduced to approximately half their original species numbers. This is in contrast to the peri-urban site where there had been no loss of tree frogs or goannas and generally more than half of the species in each group were extant. Urban impacts that appeared to relate to herpetofauna decline were direct human intervention that resulted in death or removal of individuals (e.g. goannas, large snakes), interference with habitat such as bush rock removal (e.g. smaller snakes, geckoes, skinks), fire (e.g. non-burrowing small residents), interference with the water cycle including infilling and pollution (e.g. frogs) and exotic predators (e.g. dragons, turtles, skinks). In general, herpetofauna with the least future prospects were those most susceptible to decline.These included the large, conspicuous fauna that required a substantial home range, attracted the attention of humans because of 'pet appeal' or due to their perceived danger; were vulnerable at some stage of the lifecycle to predation by feral species; and had specific habitat requirements for reproduction such as quality water or open sandy banks for egg incubation. Those that are small, generalist and unappealing to humans are most likely to survive. There is, therefore, little doubt that diversity in reserves will continue to dwindle unless strategies are devised to overcome the present trend. Current conservation strategies that generally target single species need to be expanded to ecosystem level to monitor threats and management implemented for their removal.

AB  - Today, automobile dependency constantly causes traffic congestion, delays, reduced access, increased fuel and energy consumption, and environmental emissions. Automobile dependency has caused many direct and indirect transportation problems that may influence our life. Urban planners and transportation engineers seek to improve transport networks considering social issues. One of the most successful solutions for advocating sustainable transport is transit-oriented development (TOD). Another solution that planners encourage to use is designing the roadways based on a complete street approach, which is a system that provides safe, convenient, and comfortable travel and increases accessibility for users of all ages regardless of their transport modes. The present study employed the saturated roads that have heavy traffic most of the time and public transport e-ticket data to investigate the potential complete streets in Qazvin. An online questionnaire was developed using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method based on the TOD and the complete street framework to investigate the essential criteria for redesigning the network based on the active transport approach. Thus, after analyzing the six criteria (density, diversity, distance, accessibility, demand management, and design) and eight sub-criteria (pedestrian flow, pedestrian density, connectivity, safety, bike route, bus route, road width, and urban tree canopy index), the proposed active transport network emerged and results show that five high priority streets were identified to be considered as a solution.

AB  - The basin of the Sinos River, located in the northeastern part of Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, has been highly impacted by industrial and urban activities. Water quality is low because of domestic and industrial sewage discharges. Most of the tributaries have suffered drastic structural interventions like canalisations and the removal of riparian vegetation. The aims of this study were to: 1) assess the diversity of fish at 34 sampling sites in twenty-four tributaries of the Sinos River basin; 2) quantify impact level by the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and an adapted Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI); and 3) check the interference of environmental impacts, formerly quantified in a Stream Corridor Assessment Survey (SCAS), on the fish assembly and 4) compare the relationship between the IBI with stream order. Fish sampling was performed by electric fishing in the period from April 2004 to August 2006. A total of 4,869 individuals were sampled, representing 61 species, 14 families and six orders. Significant relationships of the Shannon-Wiener index and IBI with SCAS scores and stream orders were found. Of all impacts that make up the SCAS score, only channel modifications were significantly correlated with IBI. These results indicate that the adaptation of the IBI was effective and performed better than the Shannon-Wiener diversity index when related directly to specific impact categories. The application of the IBI with the SCAS and the other variables was efficient in the tributaries of the Sinos River basin because it showed the biotic degradation in accordance with changes in physical habitat.

AB  - We examined vegetative and thermal aspects of roost-site selection in urban Yellow-billed Magpies (Pica nuttalli) in Sacramento, California, from winter 2003 to spring 2004. Vegetation used for roosting included cultivated species such as glossy privet (Ligustrum lucidum), English ivy (Hedera helix), and white mulberry (Morus alba), and native species such as interior live oak (Quercus wislizeni), valley oak (Q. lobata), and California laurel (Umbellularia californica). Percent canopy cover was consistently high (mean = 94% +/- 1.9 SD). Mean roost height was 9.7 m +/- 3.5 SD and the mean height at which magpies roosted was 6.6 m +/- 2.0 SD. Communal roosts were generally located within or near riparian corridors. Magpies roosted in relatively warm microhabitats, but they did not appear to obtain a thermal advantage by roosting communally. The timing of roost occupancy was restricted primarily to times when the roost was thermally advantageous.

AB  - Upstream anthropogenic perturbations can dramatically affect estuarine water quality, especially in small systems where water retention times are high. Management of these modified ecosystems often requires direct interventions to prevent detrimental long-term effects. The heavily urbanized and temporarily dosed Zandvlei Estuary in South Africa has a long history of anthropogenic manipulation, and therefore acts as an ideal case-study to gauge reactive management practices. Continued deterioration of estuarine water quality and ecological functioning prompted the adoption of an adaptive management approach. Subsequent management interventions to increase salinity variability and nutrient removal included the (1) adoption of a mouth management plan, (2) regular harvesting of submerged vegetation, and (3) removal of flow obstructions. Physico-chemical and nutrient monitoring data (2010-2018) were assessed to document the response of phytoplankton to these interventions. Time-series analysis indicated an upward trend in salinity throughout the estuary. This corresponded with a temporal decline in phytoplankton biomass levels and was supported by model results that highlighted a strongly inverse relationship with salinity. The frequency of high-biomass events (>80 mu g Chl-a l(-1)) also declined in each of the designated estuarine zones. In April 2012, an extensive harmful algal bloom (HAB) of Prymnesium parvum (Prymnesiophyceae) was recorded (similar to 530 mu g Chl-a l(-1)) in the estuary, culminating in hypoxic conditions (O-2 < 2 mg l(-1)) and fish kills. However, the subsequent mechanical breaching of the mouth has prevented reoccurrences of P. parvum. Similarly, more saline conditions arising from increased marine connectivity reduced the abundance of the previously dominant Bacillariophyceae and Chlorophyceae classes. The overall improvement in water quality validates the efficacy of management interventions aimed at restoring and conserving ecosystem functionality. Yet, these efforts are a deviation from natural estuarine functioning and thus a 'catchment to coast' approach that incorporates upstream nutrient mitigation measures is needed to achieve sustainable long-term management objectives.

AB  - California has been invaded by two distinct Euwallacea spp. that vector unique plant pathogenic symbiotic fungi on multiple hosts and cause Fusarium dieback. The objective of this study was to develop multiplex real-time quantitative PCR assays using hydrolysis probes targeting the beta-tubulin gene to detect, distinguish, and quantify fungi associated with the polyphagous shot hole borer (PSHB; Euwallacea whitfordiodendrus, Fusarium euwallaceae, Graphium euwallaceae, and Paracremonium pembeum) as well as the Kuroshio shot hole borer (KSHB; Euwallacea kuroshio, Fusarium kuroshium, and Graphium kuroshium) from various sample types. Absolute quantification reaction efficiencies ranged from 88.2 to 104.3%, with a coefficient of determination >0.992 and a limit of detection of 100 copies mu l(-1) for all targets across both assays. Qualitative detection using the real-time assays on artificially inoculated avocado shoot extracts showed more sensitivity compared with conventional fungal isolation from wood. All symbiotic fungi, except P. pembeum, from PSHB and KSHB female heads were detectable and quantified. Field samples from symptomatic Platanus racemosa, Populus spp., and Salix spp. across 17 of 26 city parks were positively identified as PSHB and KSHB through detection of their symbiotic fungi, and both were found occurring together on five trees from three different park locations. The molecular assays presented here can be utilized to accurately identify fungi associated with these invasive pests in California.

AB  - Improving our understanding of the impacts of urbanization on tropical island streams is critical as urbanization becomes a dominant feature in tropical areas. Although the "urban stream syndrome" has been successful in summarizing urban impacts on streams, the response of some island streams is different to that expected. Here we review available information on urban impacts to tropical island streams and describe unique responses to urbanization. We identified three key aspects that play particularly important or unique roles in determining tropical-island stream integrity: biotic response to water pollution, movement barriers along the stream network, and altered geomorphology that results in habitat loss. As expected, water pollution negatively impacts stream ecosystems in tropical islands and in some regions impacts can be severe, as untreated wastewaters are directly discharged into streams. While aquatic insects show the expected responses to pollution, other native fauna (e.g., shrimps and fishes) appear to be less impacted by moderate levels of pollution. Movement barriers along the stream network are especially important as much of the tropical island fauna have diadromous (either amphidromous or catadromous) life histories. Most native freshwater mollusks, shrimps, and fishes inhabiting tropical islands are diadromous and depend on unimpeded connections between freshwater and marine environments to complete their life cycles. The presence of these species in urban streams is best explained by longitudinal connectivity rather than by the degree of urban impact. Finally, in streams that remain connected to marine environments, the presence of native shrimps and fishes is strongly related to the physical habitat. Fish assemblages in channelized and severely altered stream reaches are almost completely devoid of native fauna and tend to be dominated by non-native species. In contrast, relatively diverse shrimp and fish assemblages can be found in reaches that retain their physical habitat complexity, even when they are impacted by urbanization. Our understanding of urban impacts on tropical island streams remains limited. However, the identification of key aspects can help us better understand urban impacts on streams in tropical islands, and best focus our management and research efforts to protect these unique ecosystems.

AB  - Urban stream features can be used to promote nutrient retention; however, their interactions with different hydrological regimes impact nutrient cycling, decrease their retention capacity, and inhibit stream ecosystem functioning. This study analysed the temporal and spatial dynamics of the uptake of three nutrients (nitrate, ammonium, and phosphorus) in an urban drainage stream during high flows. In particular, we studied variations in net uptake along the right margin (with native vegetation and a roots mat) comparatively to the left margin (a non-rooted grassy bank). Applying the spiralling approach within each subreach on either side, we determined nutrient subreach (sr) retention metrics: uptake rate coefficients K-net(sr), mass transfer rates (vf(net)(sr)), and areal uptake rates (U-net(sr)). Our results showed nitrate (NO3) and ammonium (NH4) net uptakes on the right side were higher and more frequent along subreaches where the root mat was more abundant (U-net(sr) [mu g m(-2) s(-1)] = 22.80 +/- 1.13 for NO3 and 10.50 +/- 0.81 for NH4), whereas on the left side both nutrients showed patchy and inconsistent net uptake patterns despite the homogeneous grass distribution. Net uptake for filtered reactive phosphorus (FRP) was not observed on either side at any flow rate. The impact of hydrological factors such as discharge, travel time, water depth, and concentration, on uptake metrics was studied. Despite increases in travel time as the flow decreased, there was a reduction in net uptake rates, vf(net)(sr) and U-net(sr), on either side. This was attributed to a reduction in water level with declining flows, which decreased hydrologic connectivity with the stream banks, combined with a decrease in water velocity and a reduction in nutrient concentrations. We concluded the rooted bank acted as an effective retention area by systematically promoting net uptake resulting in a twofold increased dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) retention relative to the non-rooted side where net uptake was spatially localized and highly dynamic. Overall, this work emphasized the importance of strategically sampling close to biologically active surfaces to more accurately determine areas where gross uptake surpasses release process.

AB  - Sandblossoms, Linanthus parryae is a widespread annual plant species found in washes and sandy open habitats across the Mojave Desert and Eastern Sierra Nevada of California. Studies in this species have played a central role in evolutionary biology, serving as the first test cases of the shifting balance theory of evolution, models of isolation by distance, and metrics to describe the genetic structure of natural populations. Despite the importance of L. parryae in the development of landscape genetics and phylogeography, there are no genomic resources available for the species. Through the California Conservation Genomics Project, we assembled the first genome in the genus Linanthus. Using PacBio HiFi long reads and Hi-C chromatin conformation capture, we assembled 123 scaffolds spanning 1.51 Gb of the 1.96 Gb estimated genome, with a contig N50 of 18.7 Mb and a scaffold N50 of 124.8 Mb. This assembly, with a BUSCO completeness score of 88.7%, will allow us to revisit foundational ideas central to our understanding of how evolutionary forces operate in a geographic landscape. In addition, it will be a new resource to uncover adaptations to arid environments in the fragile desert habitat threatened by urban and solar farm development, climate change, and off-road vehicles.

AB  - The health and economic impacts of infectious disease pandemics are catastrophic as most recently manifested by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The emerging infections that lead to substantive epidemics or pandemics are typically zoonoses that cross species boundaries at vulnerable points of animal-human interface. The sharing of space between wildlife and humans, and their domesticated animals, has dramatically increased in recent decades and is a key driver of pathogen spillover. Increasing animal-human interface has also occurred in concert with both increasing globalisation and failing health systems, resulting in a trifecta with dire implications for human and animal health. Nevertheless, to date we lack a geographical description of this trifecta that can be applied strategically to pandemic prevention. This investigation provides the first geographical quantification of the intersection of animal-human interfaces, poor human health system performance and global connectivity via the network of air travel. In so doing, this work provides a systematic, data-driven approach to classifying spillover hazard based on the distribution of animal-human interfaces while simultaneously identifying globally connected cities that are adjacent to these interfaces and which may facilitate global pathogen dissemination. We present this geography of high-impact spillover as a tool for developing targeted surveillance systems and improved health infrastructure in vulnerable areas that may present conduits for future pandemics.

AB  - Conventionally, resin fractionation (RF) method has been widely used to characterize dissolved organic matter (DOM) found in different source waters based on general and broad DOM fractions grouping. In this study, a new refined method using multistep, microvolume resin fractionation combined with excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (MSM-RF-EEMS) was developed for further isolation and characterization of subfractions within the primary DOM fractions separated from using the conventional RF method. Subsequently, its feasibility in indicating the occurrence of urban pollution in source waters was also assessed. Results from using the new MSM-RF-EEMS method strongly illustrated that several organic subfractions still exist within the regarded primary pure hydrophobic acid (HoA) fraction including the humic- and fulvic-like organic matters, tryptophan- and tyrosine-like proteins. It was found that by using the MSM-RF-EEMS method, the organic subfractions present within the primary DOM fraction could be easily identified and characterized. Further validation on the HoA fraction using the MSM-RF-EEMS method revealed that the constant association of EEM peak T1 (tryptophan) fraction could specifically be used to indicate the occurrence of urban pollution in source water. The correlation analysis on the presence of EEM peak T2 (tyrosine) fraction could be used as a supplementary proof to further verify the presence of urban pollution in source waters. These findings on using the presence of EEM peaks T1 and T2 within the primary HoA fraction would be significant and useful for developing a sensory device for online water quality monitoring.

AB  - Forest-associated species in fragmented landscapes must traverse potentially inhospitable gaps to move between habitat patches. Although conservation biologists advocate connecting patches with corridors or improving the matrix to make it suitable for movement, little is known about the factors influencing gap-crossing decisions for most species. We investigated gap crossing by the red squirrel (Tarniasciurus hudsonicus) in logged landscapes in southeastern Alaska, where the species avoids microhabitats associated with gaps created by clearcutting. We released individuals across clearcuts and determined the routes they took home with tracking spools and radio telemetry. Of 36 adult red squirrels translocated across six clearcuts, 14 crossed clearcuts to reach home. Squirrels were more likely to cross clearcuts if the detour efficiency (distance to home crossing gap divided by distance of forested detour) was low, indicating an ability to compare distances along alternate routes and travel costs or risks in different habitats. No other landscape metrics, such as gap size or crossing distance, predicted crossing behavior. Red squirrels of low body mass were more likely to cross clearcuts, where the probability of encountering conspecifics is low. Distance predicted route choice for squirrels detouring around clearcuts. Indirect evidence suggests that perceived predation risk, energetic costs, or both are higher in clearcuts. Detour efficiency reportedly influences the gap-crossing decisions of some forest-associated birds, but this is the first demonstration of its role in gap-crossing decisions by a mammal.

AB  - Urbanization in stream catchments can have strong effects on stream channel hydrogeomorphic features including channel dimensions, channel-floodplain connectivity, and flood regime. However, the consequences of hydrogeomorphic alterations on aquatic-terrestrial subsidy dynamics are largely unexplored. We examined the associations among hydrogeomorphic characteristics, emergent aquatic insect assemblages, and the density and trophic dynamics of riparian spiders of the family Tetragnathidae at 23 small urban stream reaches in the Columbus, OH (United States) Metropolitan Area. Naturally abundant stable isotopes of C-13 and N-15 were used to quantify the relative contribution of aquatically derived energy (i.e., nutritional pathways deriving from algae) to tetragnathid spiders and their trophic position. Bankfull discharge was negatively related to both emergence rate and family richness. On average, tetragnathid spiders relied on aquatically derived energy for 36% of their nutrition, with the greatest reliance found for spiders next to channels with wider flood-prone widths and proportionally fewer emergent insects of the family Chironomidae. Mean emergent aquatic insect reliance on aquatically derived energy was 32% and explained 44% of the variation in tetragnathid aquatically derived energy. A positive relationship between delta C-13 of tetragnathid spiders and emergent insects provides additional evidence of tetragnathid reliance on emergent insects. Mean tetragnathid trophic position was 2.85 and was positively associated with channel sinuosity and negatively associated with aquatic insect emergence rate. Sinuosity was also positively related to aquatically derived energy of emergent aquatic insects; as well as emergent insect family richness; % Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT); and aquatic insect emergence rate; implicating instream habitat-mediated shifts in emergent aquatic insect communities as an indirect mechanistic link between hydrogeomorphic processes and spiders. Our findings underscore that the impacts of stream hydrogeomorphic alterations can cascade into terrestrial food webs. These results suggest that monitoring and restoration of fluvial geomorphic form and function (e.g., sinuosity, slope, and hydrology) confer benefits to both aquatic and terrestrial riparian ecosystems in urban catchments.

AB  - In this study, the prevalence of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis in wild boars in northeast Germany was determined. For that purpose, the tonsils of 503 wild boars were sampled. The presence of Y. pseudotuberculosis was studied by diagnostic PCR. Positive samples were analyzed by cultural detection using a modified cold enrichment protocol. Ten Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates were obtained, which were characterized by biotyping, molecular serotyping, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). In addition, whole-genome sequences and the antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates were analyzed. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis was isolated from male and female animals, most of which were younger than 1 year. A prevalence of 2% (10/503) was determined by cultural detection, while 6.4% (32/503) of the animals were positive by PCR. The isolates belonged to the biotypes 1 and 2 and serotypes O:1a (n = 7), O:1b (n = 2), and O:4a (n = 1). MLST analysis revealed three sequence types, ST9, ST23, and ST42. Except one isolate, all isolates revealed a strong resistance to colistin. The relationship of the isolates was studied by whole-genome sequencing demonstrating that they belonged to four clades, exhibiting five different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) restriction patterns and a diverse composition of virulence genes. Six isolates harbored the virulence plasmid pYV. Besides two isolates, all isolates contained ail and inv genes and a complete or incomplete high-pathogenicity island (HPI). None of them possessed a gene for the superantigen YPM. The study shows that various Y. pseudotuberculosis strains exist in wild boars in northeast Germany, which may pose a risk to humans.
   IMPORTANCE Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is a foodborne pathogen whose occurrence is poorly understood. One reason for this situation is the difficulty in isolating the species. The methods developed for the isolation of Yersinia enterocolitica are not well suited for Y. pseudotuberculosis. We therefore designed a protocol which enabled the isolation of Y. pseudotuberculosis from a relatively high proportion of PCR-positive wild boar tonsils. The study indicates that wild boars in northeast Germany may carry a variety of Y. pseudotuberculosis strains, which differ in terms of their pathogenic potential and other properties. Since wild boars are widely distributed in German forests and even populate cities such as Berlin, they may transmit yersiniae to other animals and crop plants and may thus cause human infections through the consumption of contaminated food. Therefore, the prevalence of Y. pseudotuberculosis should be determined also in other animals and regions to learn more about the natural reservoir of this species.

AB  - The occurrences of Trihalomethanes (THMs) and heterotrophic bacteria were monitored in water samples from different locations "areas". The water samples we got them water from (El-Shocake RO plant system, Jazan, KSA) over a twelve -month period to investigate the association between (THMs) and heterotrophic bacteria populations. The sampling sites were chosen to cover the entire distribution pipes network of the El-Shocake RO system approximately more than 200 Km distance. A positive association between some bacterial species and THMs concentrations was found at some locations. Bacterial count of some type bacterial species could be used as an indicator for the presence of THMs in distribution systems.
   When we considered the relation between THMs and all identified culture-able bacterial isolates we observed that, the increase the concentrations of the THMs in the water increased the percent of gamma- Proteobacteria classes. The highest THMs values were recorded at water samples collected from the south region of Jazan province which included three main cities El-Ahad, El-Dagarer and Samta. We think that, there are many of yet-unknown bacterial strains "aerobic/anaerobic" which have relations with THMs and further studies on the isolation and identification bacteria using other mechanisms.

AB  - Urban road greening refers to the planting of trees, flowers and grass and road protection forests on both sides of roads and separation belts to achieve the purpose of noise isolation, air purification and environment beautification. It will bring a huge amount of work to the maintenance of the road green belt, because of the conflict between the diversity of plant growth and the standardization of road greening. However, with the rapid development of high technology, it is of great significance to develop a high-throughput inspection and monitoring platform for the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of road greening projects. The high-throughput unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform can be used for monitoring the plant canopy structure of road greening belt, which has the advantages of high efficiency, high reduction degree, low cost and so on. In the future, it will become a feasible technical means of road greening project maintenance. Based on the acquisition of plant growth status information of road green belt, the application prospect of high and new technology in the monitoring of functional indexes of road green belt is explored. Then, it can be a technical support for road safety, green belt design, structure optimization and maintenance management.

AB  - Changes in land-use practices have affected the integrity and quality of water resources worldwide. In Patagonia there is a strong concern about the ecological status of surface waters because these changes are rapidly occurring in the region. To test the hypothesis that greater intensity of land-use will have negative effects on water quality, stream habitat and biodiversity we assessed benthic macroinvertebrates, riparian/littoral invertebrates, fish and birds from the riparian corridor and environmental variables of 15 rivers (Patagonia) subjected to a gradient of land-use practices (non-managed native forest, managed native forest, pine plantations, pasture, urbanization). A total of 158 macroinvertebrate taxa, 105 riparian/littoral invertebrate taxa, 5 fish species, 34 bird species, and 15 aquatic plant species, were recorded considering all sites. Urban land-use produced the most significant changes in streams including physical features, conductivity, nutrients, habitat condition, riparian quality and invertebrate metrics. Pasture and managed native forest sites appeared in an intermediate situation. The highest values of fish and bird abundance and diversity were observed at disturbed sites; this might be explained by the opportunistic behavior displayed by these communities which let them take advantage of increased trophic resources in these environments. As expected, non-managed native forest sites showed the highest integrity of ecological conditions and also great biodiversity of benthic communities. Macroinvertebrate metrics that reflected good water quality were positively related to forest land cover and negatively related to urban and pasture land cover. However, by offering stream edge areas, pasture sites still supported rich communities of riparian/littoral invertebrates, increasing overall biodiversity. Macroinvertebrates were good indicators of land-use impact and water quality conditions and resulted useful tools to early alert of disturbances in streams. Fish and birds having a greater ability of dispersion and capacity to move quickly from disturbances would reflect changes at a higher scale. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Globally, the expansion of livestock and fisheries production is severely constrained due to the increasing costs and ecological footprint of feed constituents. The utilization of black soldier fly (BSF) as an alternative protein ingredient to fishmeal and soybean in animal feed has been widely documented. The black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) used are known to voraciously feed and grow in contaminated organic wastes. Thus, several concerns about their safety for inclusion into animal feed remain largely unaddressed. This study evaluated both culture-dependent sequence-based and 16S rDNA amplification analysis to isolate and identify bacterial species associated with BSFL fed on chicken manure (CM) and kitchen waste (KW). The bacteria species from the CM and KW were also isolated and investigated. Results from the culture-dependent isolation strategies revealed that Providencia sp. was the most dominant bacterial species detected from the guts of BSFL reared on CM and KW. Morganella sp. and Brevibacterium sp. were detected in CM, while Staphylococcus sp. and Bordetella sp. were specific to KW. However, metagenomic studies showed that Providencia and Bordetella were the dominant genera observed in BSFL gut and processed waste substrates. Pseudomonas and Comamonas were recorded in the raw waste substrates. The diversity of bacterial genera recorded from the fresh rearing substrates was significantly higher compared to the diversity observed in the gut of the BSFL and BSF frass (leftovers of the rearing substrates). These findings demonstrate that the presence and abundance of microbiota in BSFL and their associated waste vary considerably. However, the presence of clinically pathogenic strains of bacteria in the gut of BSFL fed both substrates highlight the biosafety risk of potential vertical transmission that might occur, if appropriate pre-and-postharvest measures are not enforced.

AB  - BackgroundThe first identified cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection in humans occurred in China during February and March 2013. We analyzed data obtained from field investigations to describe the epidemiologic characteristics of H7N9 cases in China identified as of December 1, 2013.
   MethodsField investigations were conducted for each confirmed case of H7N9 virus infection. A patient was considered to have a confirmed case if the presence of the H7N9 virus was verified by means of real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay (RT-PCR), viral isolation, or serologic testing. Information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines was obtained from patients with confirmed cases. Close contacts were monitored for 7 days for symptoms of illness. Throat swabs were obtained from contacts in whom symptoms developed and were tested for the presence of the H7N9 virus by means of real-time RT-PCR.
   ResultsAmong 139 persons with confirmed H7N9 virus infection, the median age was 61 years (range, 2 to 91), 71% were male, and 73% were urban residents. Confirmed cases occurred in 12 areas of China. Nine persons were poultry workers, and of 131 persons with available data, 82% had a history of exposure to live animals, including chickens (82%). A total of 137 persons (99%) were hospitalized, 125 (90%) had pneumonia or respiratory failure, and 65 of 103 with available data (63%) were admitted to an intensive care unit. A total of 47 persons (34%) died in the hospital after a median duration of illness of 21 days, 88 were discharged from the hospital, and 2 remain hospitalized in critical condition; 2 patients were not admitted to a hospital. In four family clusters, human-to-human transmission of H7N9 virus could not be ruled out. Excluding secondary cases in clusters, 2675 close contacts of case patients completed the monitoring period; respiratory symptoms developed in 28 of them (1%); all tested negative for H7N9 virus.
   ConclusionsMost persons with confirmed H7N9 virus infection had severe lower respiratory tract illness, were epidemiologically unrelated, and had a history of recent exposure to poultry. However, limited, nonsustained human-to-human H7N9 virus transmission could not be ruled out in four families.
   The first cases of human infection with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus were identified in China in early 2013. This report describes findings for 139 persons with confirmed H7N9 virus infection through December 1, 2013. The first identified cases of human infection with a novel influenza A(H7N9) virus occurred in eastern China during February and March 2013 and were characterized by rapidly progressive pneumonia, respiratory failure, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and fatal outcomes.(1) We analyzed available data from field investigations to characterize the descriptive epidemiology of laboratory-confirmed cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection in humans that were reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) as of December 1, 2013. In this report, we summarize the epidemiologic findings of case investigations and follow-up monitoring of close contacts of ...

AB  - In much of the United States and elsewhere, urbanization continues to transform landscapes. In central Texas, anthropogenic conversion of land is due in part to a rapidly growing population in the Austin and San Antonio metro areas and the subsequent infrastructure and resources needed to support that growth. Protected natural areas adjacent to urbanized landscapes are often intended to mitigate the impact of land development by serving as wildlife habitat. To maximize the potential of this habitat, we must assess how urbanization influences the occurrence of species in these natural areas (e.g., parks, greenspaces, preserves). We used motion -activated cameras to survey 72 sites (points) across six different regions throughout the urban corridor from San Antonio to Austin. Using occupancy modeling, we examined the influence of ten different urbanization factors (model covariates) on the occurrence of a variety of medium-sized mammal species. Generalist species, such as raccoons and opossums, had an increased probability of occurrence at sites with greater urban influence and were most likely to occur in smaller more urbanized study areas. Ringtails and grey foxes appeared to be unaffected by urbanization and were equally likely to occur across all sites. None of the other examined species were found to have a conclusively positive or negative response to urbanization. Knowledge of the effect of urbanization on wildlife will be important in evaluating current preserves as well as planning future preserves. Our study suggests that natural areas within urbanizing landscapes can be effective in providing habitat for some wildlife species. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rivers provide critically important ecosystem services to society, and play an essential role in maintaining the structure, function, and integrity of landscapes in which the rivers reside. Better understanding of the patterns and processes in river systems requires a broader landscape approach that goes beyond the traditional linear and longitudinal focus. Such a landscape approach is especially important for effectively restoring and managing already damaged or degraded rivers around the world. Toward this end, here we develop a riverscape transect approach by adapting landscape gradient analysis with pattern metrics so as to quantify the longitudinal variations in the spatial pattern of the river-land complex from headwater to mouth. Two rivers systems in southern China were used to develop and demonstrate the approach. For each river, we first constructed a riverscape transect, consisting of a spatial series of overlapping neighborhood landscapes, then computed a selected set of landscape metrics, and finally depicted the longitudinal profile of riverscape pattern with relative location-based plots. Our results have shown that this riverscape transect approach is conceptually consistent with the increasingly prominent riverine landscape perspective and technically feasible with the aid of remote sensing data and landscape pattern analysis methods. In particular, landscape metrics, such as percentages of urban and native vegetation, patch density, and Shannon diversity, can be used to reveal important variations in riverscape structure along the river. These longitudinal profiles of riverscape pattern, used as spatial indicators, can help identify key socioeconomic drivers and ecological impacts of land use and land cover change in the watershed. Our study demonstrates that this riverscape transect approach can be a new and effective way of facilitating the planning and evaluation of river restoration and management efforts.

AB  - The chironomid populations of a 40km section of the middle Loire (Tours region) were studied for the first time. Six collections (distributed over the years 1994 to 1996) of pupal exuviae and benthic pupae were made from April to November, in the main river bed, at 4 sites of this potamal zone. A total of 12,073 specimens were sorted and 117 species or taxa identified. Thirty one are new for continental France, in particular Polypedilum acifer TOWNEs and Saetheria reissi JACKSON, two dominant species. Among these, three genera are new: Hayesomyia, Robackia and Saetheria. A new pupal exuvia which has only been noted in the Loire has been recorded: Chironomus Pe23 (LANGTON 1995). A comparison of the middle Loire chironomid fauna with that of the potamal zones of five large European rivers - Rhone and Garonne (France)- Meuse (Belgium) - Po (Italy) - Rhine (Germany) - confirms the diversity and faunistic originality of the middle Loire using several descriptors such as diversity indexes, rarefaction curves, equitability index, distribution of species abundance, number of "endemic" species and distribution of dominant species. Causes of the high specific richness observed, as well as rare species abundance or scarcity, are discussed taking into account functional characteristics of the River Loire's potamic parts such as the connectivity pattern. The relationship between high biodiversity and large, sandy rivers is also discussed using similar results obtained on two other large sandy rivers: the Po and the Elbe (Germany) rivers.

AB  - A fourteen-month monitoring period (April 2007May 2008) was realized to investigate the removal and occurrence of eight pharmaceutical and personal care compounds, two metabolites and caffeine across the municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) of Agrinio city, located in Western Greece as well as in the discharging sampling point in Acheloos River, which receives the effluents of the plant. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) was used for the isolation and pre-concentration of the target pollutants and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) for their detection and quantification. All the selected compounds were detected in the wastewater samples. The concentrations determined in the influent of the municipal WWTP ranged between 65.3 and 6679ng L-1 recorded for triclosan and caffeine respectively, while in the effluent ranged between 24.9 and 552ng L-1 observed for triclosan and carbamazepine, respectively. The detected concentration levels in Acheloos River ranged from 37.6ng L-1 for caffeine to 305ng L-1 for paracetamol. Mean total removal efficiencies ranged between 46.3% for carbamazepine and 96.8% for naproxen. The results of this study demonstrate that most of the compounds are being reduced in low levels by municipal wastewater treatment processes but quite significant levels of pharmaceuticals enter river waterways.

AB  - The tidal flat in the transitional belt between land and ocean is deeply disturbed by human reclamation activity. The reclamation and development of tidal flat is the specific land use pattern of coastal zone. Jiangsu province possesses abundant tideland resources and a large-scale tidal flat reclamation has taken place in Jiangsu during the past several decades. Analysis of the landscape pattern of reclamation is one of the important components to realize the sustainable development in the coastal zone. This paper takes Yancheng City of Jiangsu as a case to analysis the landscape pattern of reclamation area by using GF-1 satellite imagery. The panchromatic and multispectral data were resampled for geometric correction and fused to obtain the multispectral data of 2m resolution. Object-based classification method was taken to classify different landscape categories in study area. Wheat paddies, rape paddies, forest and grass, rive and lake, aquaculture ponds, facility aquaculture, facility planting, industrial land and traffic land were extracted separately from the GF-1 imagery through multi-resolution segmentation, training samples selection, classification features establishment. Landscape indices of area, shape and distribution characteristics were calculated by using Fragstats software for analyses. The results show that within the study area, high resolution GF-1 satellite imagery could identify landscape types in tidal flat reclamation area and offer reliable information for the landscape pattern analysis. The cultivated land (including wheat paddies, rape paddies) and aquaculture area (including facility aquaculture and aquaculture ponds) are the main landscape types in the study area and the shape of most of the landscape type is very regular, which reflected the characteristics of intensification. As the corridors of the study area, traffic land, river and lake played a better connecting function and the overall connectivity of the landscape is relatively high. The distribution of landscape types is uneven, but the overall concentration trend is obvious.

AB  - A monitoring study was carried out for the four seasons over 1-year monitoring period (March 2006-March 2007) to investigate the residues of 11 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) belonging to various therapeutic categories. The selected areas of the study were the municipal and hospital wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) of Ioannina city, located in Western Greece. The most common pre-treatment technique for pharmaceuticals, solid-phase extraction (SPE), was used for the isolation and pre-concentration of the target analytes. The samples were screened using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results of the monitoring study, showed the occurrence of all target compounds in the wastewater samples. Concentrations in the municipal WWTP ranged between 0.3 and 164.4 mu g/L in the influent and between 0.5 and 13.9 mu g/L in the effluent. In the hospital WWTP concentrations ranged between 0.6 and 70.1 mu g/L in the influent and between 0.5 and 14.6 mu g/L in the effluent. Mean removal efficiencies ranged between 13% and 97% and between 9% and 87% for municipal and hospital WWTPs, respectively. Removal efficiencies were higher in the municipal WWTP than in the hospital WWTP. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This annotated checklist is the third major compilation for Singapore. It lists the current status of all bird species ever recorded in the wild in Singapore. A total of 404 species have been recorded, including 44 species which are now extinct or have not been recorded for the last 50 years. Some of the latter species have been recorded again as non-breeding visitors. There are now 342 species that occur naturally in Singapore and another 22 species that were introduced by man. Fifty-eight families of birds are represented. There are 121 resident species with proven breeding records and 21 other presumed residents. One hundred and fifty-four species are winter visitors and/or passage migrants, with another 25 species listed as non-breeding visitors and 21 others that occur in Singapore as vagrants.
   Census data since 1991 shows that the total number of birds in Singapore has declined by 40 % and the number of species has declined by nearly 17 %. The most abundant bird species Is a migrant, the Pacific Golden Plover (Pluvialis fulva). The most important site in terms of bird population is Sungei Mandai, an unprotected mudflat and mangrove ecosystem while Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve and Pulau Ubin are important in having the highest diversities of birds. The loss of mudflats through reclamation, damming of estuaries, and canalisation of rivers has resulted in a decline in waterbird density and diversity as shown in the Annual Waterfowl Census. The current total shorebird population in Singapore is only 4,000 - 5,000 birds, a vast decrease from the large wintering population of 10,000 birds at a single site, the Serangoon Estuary, in 1985.
   Forty-one of the 44 extinct species were resident forest birds, of which, 34 (82.9 %) went extinct between 1900 and 1950. This equates to 3.4 species lost every five years, an alarming rate of extinction for a small island like Singapore. The most susceptible families are the Trogonidae and Eurylaimidae, with 100 % species loss, and Picidae, with 56.3 % species loss. The susceptible bird families are predominantly those of the forest, whereas the resistant families exist largely in open country and scrub. In fact, only three extinct species were not largely dependent on tropical rainforests for their existence. Forest species such as the Green Broadbill (Calyptomena viridis) became extinct from the forests as recently as 1941. This emphasises the role that habitat destruction has played in shaping Singapore's avifauna.
   Fifty-four species of birds are at risk of extinction, of which 34 species (63 %) live in the forest. The remaining patches of forest in Singapore are mostly protected in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve that should provide a safe haven for the forest birds. However, the forests are too fragmented, small and constantly disturbed by thousands of visitors. By connecting the smaller Bukit Timah Nature Reserve to the much larger Central Catchment Nature Reserve, the forest patch size can be increased and might allow more movement of animals and plants between the two patches. Many forest birds are secretive or weak fliers and are reluctant to cross open spaces. A green corridor might encourage them to do so. Another 16 species (29.6 %) of threatened birds are specialists of mangroves and wetlands. Preservation of these most-threatened of ecosystems in Singapore is of utmost importance to the survival of the birds found in these special habitats. With improvement in the quality of habitats, we could perhaps slow down the rate of local extinction of the avifauna of Singapore. Our remaining habitats need to be protected and laws protecting wildlife must be strictly enforced, so that the birds may have a chance to coexist with us.

AB  - Background: Rock pigeon (Columba livia) is an exotic and invasive species of the Columbidae family found in several cities around the world, including Brazilian cities, and close to humans. This species is found in large populations often in public locations, where people may have contact. Several studies have demonstrated the isolation of human pathogens from these birds. However, there are scarce studies describing infections by Gram-negative bacteria to which pigeons are susceptible. Therefore, this report aimed to describe a case of natural coinfection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli in a feral pigeon.
   Case: A sick feral pigeon was delivered at the Laboratory of Ornithological Studies, State University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil. Due to poor prognosis, the individual was euthanized with ketamine via intravenous injection and submitted to necropsy, in which samples were collected for microbiological and histopathological procedure. The procedure was performed aseptically and samples were collected from intestine, liver, spleen, heart and lung. Bacterial isolation was performed with culture media selective for Gram negative bacteria and strains were identified biochemically. Histopathological examination was performed with conventional method and slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. DNA from E. coli isolates was extracted with simples boiling method and submitted to uniplex conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to diagnose diarrheagenic pathotypes with specific primers for the following genes: aaiC, aatA, eaeA, stx1, stx2, eltB, estA and ipaH. Escherichia coli was isolated from the intestine, liver, spleen and lung, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa was present in liver, spleen and lung. E. coli strains from liver and spleen were positive for the aaiC gene, which is a diagnostic gene for Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) pathotype. Necropsy revealed the presence of several caseous lesions around the head of the bird, cellulitis in the abdominal region, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, hemorrhagic intestine and pericarditis. Microscopical findings were most intense in liver and lung samples, presenting vascular and inflammatory alterations. Histopathological alterations indicated an acute presentation of the infections and several lesions in different organs, demonstrating the septicemic characteristic of the microorganisms involved in this case.
   Discussion: Both pathogens in this report were identified mostly in the same organs, which may indicate that there was an association in the pathogenesis. However, the entry routes of infection in this case may have been different, considering that Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not isolated from the intestine. The histopathological findings were not pathognomonic for either pathogen. However, some characteristic lesions were observed, such as cellulitis, which is commonly attributed to Escherichia coli. EAEC strains are human pathogens that cause acute and persistent diarrhea around the world. These microorganisms could be potentially transmitted to humans, as suggested by other studies with feral pigeons and enteric pathogens. However, the absence of reports of pigeon-transmitted diarrheagenic infections in humans may suggest that pigeons are only reservoirs of these pathogens. In addition, as this report demonstrates, these birds may also suffer from these infections. In conclusion, the free-living pigeon presented a natural occurring case of coinfection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli. Both are human opportunistic pathogens, and may have public health implications.

AB  - Coastal areas are undergoing continuous transformation to sustain the increasing residential, commercial, and tourist activities. However, the proliferation of artificial infrastructures (i.e. marinas and breakwaters) may contribute to destroy and fragment marine natural habitats, to alter the connectivity among populations and, as a consequence, the natural seascape. In particular, the upper sub tidal rocky fringe, where the coastal transformations are more conspicuous, represents the natural habitat of dominant engineering algae, such as Cystoseira and Sargassum; some of them, because of their sensitivity to environmental variability, are considered biological elements of water quality.
   The recent attempt to measure historical changes in macro algal diversity in the Gulf of Naples has highlighted a dramatic decrease of Cystoseira species in the upper sub littoral zones and at the same time the lack of information on their up to date extension. To verify the influence of coastal development on the decline of Cystoseira species in the Gulf, the percentage of natural/artificial coastal length has been estimated with Google Earth orto-photos. The results testified a correspondence: the higher was the Cystoseira spp. loss, the greater was the development of artificial urban infrastructures.
   To follow the temporal dynamics of these shallow systems, a complete remonitoring of the fucoid distribution along the Neapolitan coast has been planned. Up to now, the occurrence of these species has been mapped and digitalized in a qGIS database (scale 1:2,500) for the shallowest fringe of the island of Ischia. An ongoing homogenization of diversity at a medium scale has been recorded: Cystoseira compressa (the less sensitive species) is the widespread species; fragmented stands of Cystoseira amentacea (the most sensitive) still exist. Their distribution is limited to natural habitats slope more gently while the highest diversity has been reached in rocky pools. Occasional settlements were recorded on artificial structures when natural marine habitat was preserved in the surrounding area and the distance among the algal patches could not be a limiting factor in the spreading of the species. These preliminary data seem to suggest that a stronger collaboration between engineers and ecologists could favour a better coastal management in order to mitigate the impacts of artificial infrastructures on natural marine ecosystems and avoid the loss of biodiversity.

AB  - The Baltic Sea, one of the world's largest semi-enclosed-seas, which, with its very low salinity and quasi-isolation from the big oceans cannot decide whether it is a sea or a large lake. This geologically-unique environment supports an even more surprising and delicate marine ecosystem, where a complex community of fishes, marine mammals and important microscopic organisms creates a magical mosaic of life. Humans have enjoyed the abundance of life in the Baltic Sea for thousands of years, and major Scandinavian and Baltic cities have oriented themselves towards this geo-ecosystem in order to develop and seek ecological, economical and cultural inspiration and wealth. The 'Mosaic of Life' workshop aimed at going beyond the obvious in examining the meaning of the Baltic Sea by gathering together a selection of young, creative minds from different backgrounds ranging from the arts and economics to geology and life sciences. This intensive workshop was designed as a unique training opportunity to develop essential twenty-first century skills - to introduce and develop creative, critical and interdisciplinary thinking and collaborative teamwork, as well as to foster a visual and scientific literacy, using project-based learning and hands-on activities. Our final goal has been to be inspired by the resulting connections, differences and unifying concepts, creating innovative, interdisciplin-ary projects which would look further than the sea - further than the eye can see and further into the future.

AB  - Introduction: The incidence of opportunistic fungal infections has increased in recent years and is considered an important public health problem. Among systemic and opportunistic mycoses, cryptococcosis is distinguished by its clinical importance due to the increased risk of infection in individuals infected by human immunodeficiency virus. Methods: To determine the occurrence of pathogenic Cryptococcus in pigeon excrement in the City of Araraquara, samples were collected from nine environments, including state and municipal schools, abandoned buildings, parks, and a hospital. The isolates were identified using classical tests, and susceptibility testing for the antifungal drugs (fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, and amphotericin B) independently was also performed. After collection, the excrement samples were plated on Niger agar and incubated at room temperature. Results: A total of 87 bird dropping samples were collected, and 66.6% were positive for the genus Cryptococcus. The following species were identified: Cryptococcus neoformans (17.2%), Cryptococcus gattii (5.2%), Cryptococcus ater (3.5%), Cryptococcus laurentti (1.7%), and Cryptococcus luteolus (1.7%). A total of 70.7% of the isolates were not identified to the species level and are referred to as Cryptococcus spp. throughout the manuscript. Conclusions: Although none of the isolates demonstrated resistance to antifungal drugs, the identification of infested areas, the proper control of birds, and the disinfection of these environments are essential for the epidemiological control of cryptococcosis.

AB  - Bonefish (Albula vulpes) is a socioeconomically important species that supports a data-poor recreational fishery in developing countries. Understanding how environmental variables influence its abundance and movement is important for better decision-making. This study used mark-recapture to examine the association between abiotic (temperature, salinity, wind speed, tides moon phase, and sediment coarseness) and biotic (presence of predators and bottom vegetation) variables with bonefish movement and abundance in Corozal-Chetumal bay and the adjacent Caribbean coast of southern Mexico and northern Belize. We used seines to capture bonefish, marked 9657 using dart tags and recaptured 595 fish (6.2% recapture rate) during 16 sample periods between January 2016 and February 2018. Marked bonefish size ranged 19.5-56.4 cm and recaptured 23.9-49.4 cm. Total abundance for each seine sample and distance between mark and recapture locations were used in two separate multiple stepwise regression analyses. Movement was negatively associated with temperature and predator presence, while sediment coarseness and moon phase were positively associated. Temperature increases were associated with short-distance movements. Temperature decreases and high-illumination lunar phases were associated with longer-distance movement and likely related to spawning migrations. Presence of predators, like barracuda, was associated with low bonefish abundances and was likely an adaptive response to form multiple schools of low density by bonefish to avoid predation. These spatiotemporal movement and abundance patterns are recommended to be taken into account in fisheries and protected areas management and to inform the decision-making process in urban and tourism development in coastal habitats.

AB  - Pollution with microplastics (MPs), nanoplastics (NPs) and trace elements (TEs) remains a considerable threat for mangrove biomes due to their capability to capture pollutants suspended in the water. This study investigated the abundance and composition of plastics and TEs contained in the soil and pneumatophores of Avicennia alba sampled in experimental areas (hotel, market, river mouth, port, and rural areas) differentiated in anthropopressure, located in Bima Bay, Indonesia. Polymers were extracted and analyzed with the use of a modified sediment isolation method and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Trace elements were detected by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. The lowest and highest quantities of MPs in soil were recorded in rural and hotel areas, respectively. The rural site was characterized by distinct MP composition. The amounts of sediment-trapped MPs in the tested localities should be considered as high, and the recognized polymers partly corresponded with local human activity. Concentrations of seven plastic types found in plant tissues did not entirely reflect sediment pollution with nine types, suggesting a selective accumulation (particularly of polyamides and vinylidene chloride) and substance migration from other areas. Very low concentrations of non-biogenic TEs were observed, both in sediments and pneumatophores. The results highlight the relevance of environmental contamination with plastics.

AB  - beta-lactams and colistin resistance in Enterobacterales is a global public health issue. In this study we aimed to investigate the occurrence and genetic determinants of Extended-Spectrum beta-lactamases, carbapenemases and mcr-encoding-genes in Enterobacterales isolates recovered from the migratory bird species Ciconia ciconia in an Algerian city. A total of 62 faecal samples from white storks were collected. Samples were then subjected to selective isolation of beta-lactams and colistin-resistant-Enterobacterales. The representative colonies were identified using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionisation Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry. Susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method. ESBL, carbapenemases, and colistin resistance determinants were searched for by PCR and sequencing. The clonality relationships of the obtained isolates were investigated by multilocus sequence typing assays. Mating experiments were carried out to evaluate the transferability of the carbapenemase and mcr-genes. Forty-two isolates were identified as follows: Escherichia coli (n = 33), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), Proteus mirabilis (n = 4) and Citrobacter freundii (n = 1). Molecular analysis showed that twelve isolates carried the bla(ESBL) genes alone, fifteen E.coli isolates were positive for the bla(OXA-48) gene, six isolates were NDM-5-carriers (two P. mirabilis, two K. pneumoniae and two E. coli) and eight E. coli strains were positive for the mcr-1 gene. MLST results showed a high clonal diversity, where NDM-5-producing strains were assigned to two sequence types (ST167 for E. coli and ST198 of (2022) for K. pneumoniae), whereas the mcr-1 positive E. coli isolates belonged to ST58, ST224, ST453, ST1286, ST2973, ST5542, ST9815 and the international high-risk resistant lineage ST101. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of bla(NDM-5) gene in white storks and also the first describing the mcr-1 gene in white storks in Algeria. This study underlines the important role of migratory white storks as carriers of high-level drug-resistant bacteria, allowing their possible implication as indicators and sentinels for antimicrobial resistance surveillance.

AB  - Recent national concerns regarding the environmental occurrence of emerging contaminants (ECs) have catalyzed a series of recent studies. Many ECs are released into the environment through discharges from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and other sources. In 2005, the U. S. Geological Survey and the City of Longmont initiated an investigation of selected ECs in a 13.8-km reach of St. Vrain Creek, Colorado. Seven sites were sampled for ECs following a Lagrangian design; sites were located upstream, downstream, and in the outfall of the Longmont WWTP, and at the mouths of two tributaries, Left Hand Creek and Boulder Creek (which is influenced by multiple WWTP outfalls). Samples for 61 ECs in 16 chemical use categories were analyzed and 36 were detected in one or more samples. Of these, 16 have known or suspected endocrine-disruptin g potential. At and downstream from the WWTP outfall, detergent metabolites, fire retardants, and steroids were detected at the highest concentrations, which commonly exceeded 1 mu g/l in 2005 and 2 mu g/l in 2006. Most individual ECs were measured at concentrations less than 2 mu g/l. The results indicate that outfalls from WWTPs are the largest but may not be the sole source of ECs in St. Vrain Creek. In 2005, high discharge was associated with fewer EC detections, lower total EC concentrations, and smaller EC loads in St. Vrain Creek and its tributaries as compared with 2006. EC behavior differed by individual compound, and some differences between sites could be attributed to analytical variability or to other factors such as physical or chemical characteristics or distance from contributing sources. Loads of some ECs, such as diethoxynonylphenol, accumulated or attenuated depending on location, discharge, and distance downstream from the WWTP, whereas others, such as bisphenol A, were largely conservative. The extent to which ECs in St. Vrain Creek affect native fish species and macroinvertebrate communities is unknown, but recent studies have shown that fish respond to very low concentrations of ECs, and further study on the fate and transport of these contaminants in the aquatic environment is warranted.

AB  - Escherichia coli with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, isolated from urban streams, wastewater treatment plants and hospital effluent between 2004 and 2012, were compared based on multilocus sequence typing (MLST), quinolone and beta-lactam resistance determinants and plasmid replicon type. Isolates from the different types of water and isolation dates clustered together, suggesting the persistence and capacity to propagate across distinct aquatic environments. The most prevalent MLST groups were ST10 complex and ST131. Almost all isolates (98%) carried mutations in the chromosomal genes gyrA and/or parC, and 10% possessed the genes qepA, aac(6')-Ib-cr and/or qnrS1. Over 80% of the isolates were resistant to three or more classes of antibiotics (MDR >= 3). The most prevalent beta-lactamase encoding gene was bla(TEM), followed by bla(CTX-M-15), co-existing with plasmid mediated quinolone resistance. The plasmid replicon types of the group IncF were the most prevalent and distributed by different MLST groups. The genes aac(6')-Ib-cr and/or qnrS1 could be transferred by conjugation in combination with the genes bla(TEM), bla(SHV-12) or bla(OXA-1) and the plasmid replicon types I1-I gamma, K, HI2 and/or B/O. The potential of multidrug resistant E. coli with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, harboring mobile genetic elements and with ability to conjugate and transfer resistance genes, to spread and persist across different aquatic environments was demonstrated.

AB  - The Havana aeromycobiota diversity was studied from November 2010 to October 2011 using two complementary volumetric methods. A total of 35 fungal genera were characterised, 26 of them were recognised only by non-viable methods, six with viable methodology and the other three with both sampling methods. Furthermore, 47 species were identified by cultivation and the spores collected with the non-viable methodology. These could not be included in a specific genus, and thus, were categorised into five fungal types. In general, the main, spread worldwide, mitosporic fungi also predominated the Havana atmosphere. The predominant species were Cladosporium cladosporioides, Aspergillus flavus and Penicillium citrinum. Moreover, several Zygomycetes (Syncephalastrum racemosum, Rhizopus stolonifer and Rhizopus oryzae), Ascomycetes (Chaetomium globosum) and Basidiomycetes such as Coprinus or Ganoderma were isolated. In the present paper, the review of the airborne fungi conducted in previous studies in Cuba was completed by the detection of two new genera and the first isolation of ten new records in the Cuban atmosphere. Most of the fungi detected showed a diurnal pattern with high spore peak at 11.00-12.00.

AB  - Earthquakes can substantially disrupt the operation of critical lifelines in a community, particularly water, gas, and other below-ground infrastructure. The damage that occurs to lifelines in a community from an earthquake can, in turn, have a substantial impact, resulting in social and economic disruption. Furthermore, the duration of the loss in functionality of lifelines is a key factor in the economic disruption that results from an earthquake. In this study, a virtual community known as Centerville was subjected to earthquakes of varying intensity, each having the same assigned point source location, using a well-known attenuation model in order to examine the restoration of communities in the aftermath of an earthquake. The virtual community model being studied has the essential physical components that describe a community, but the focus of this paper is the natural gas network, which is composed of a processing plant, compressor stations, city gate stations, district regulating stations, and buried pipelines. Based on the level of damage that occurred to the network components and their connectivity (topology) throughout the community, the functionality of supplier nodes is assessed using Monte Carlo simulation, and functionality curves are presented for the community's natural gas network. Notably, the effect of the industrial makeup of a community on its natural gas recovery following an earthquake, as well as the influence of replacing conventional steel pipes with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) ductile pipelines, is examined. As expected, the ability of the HDPE pipe to reduce the network recovery time is substantial and is quantifiable at the community level using the approach presented herein.

AB  - Human interventions that limit channel mobility such as bank stabilization are frequent in riparian zones in urban or agricultural environments. This is potentially problematic because channel mobility is an important geomorphological and ecological agent that structures natural instream and riparian ecosystems. This study aims to (1) quantify the relationship between mobility and three types of habitat-related features, namely bars, oxbow lakes and log jams, for a 54-km-long reach of the Yamaska Sud-Est River (Quebec, Canada), which runs from the forested Appalachian Mountains to the agricultural St-Lawrence lowlands, and (2) evaluate the impact of human interventions and geomorphological characteristics on these three features. Channel mobility was measured from historical aerial photos for the period 1950-2009. A combination of high-resolution aerial photos, LiDAR digital elevation model, and field observations was used to measure and map sediment bars, oxbow lakes and log jams, as well as several geomorphological characteristics (channel width, slope, sinuosity and floodplain width). A strong link between the mobility and the presence of habitat features is revealed, but local geomorphological contexts result in different mobility patterns responsible for specific habitats. Floodplain to channel width ratio appears as the best geomorphological factor predicting habitat diversity. Human intervention, mostly through bank stabilization, also appears to be a key factor limiting mobility and its related habitats. These results highlight the importance of defining a protected mobility corridor along rivers where geomorphic processes such as bank erosion can freely occur, as it is an essential process that should be integrated in land use planning and river management.

AB  - Increase in antibiotic resistance (AR) in environment is a global health concern as the emergence of AR is limiting the treatment options. Inappropriate and indiscriminate uses of antibiotics are known causes for the spread of AR but lack of access to safe drinking water and poor sanitation aggravate the problem. The present study aims to estimate the abundance of coliforms, carbapenem and ESBL resistant bacteria and respective resistant genes in 20 sewer drains and 5 locations of the river Yamuna across New Delhi over two seasons. Significant positive correlations were observed between FC levels and carbapenem (R=0.90, p=0.002, n=40) and ESBL resistant bacteria (R=0.93, p=0.005, n=40) levels across all the samples, indicating possible association of resistant bacteria with faecal matter. However, higher abundances of coliforms, resistant bacteria and genes were observed in winter relative to summer season. Poor/lack of connectivity between drains and sewage treatment plants (STPs) and thus discharge of treated/untreated sewage at different locations of the river Yamuna is the major reason for increasing the pollution load of the river. Microbial culturing indicated presence of "critical pathogen" listed by WHO in urgent need of new antibiotics in the collected samples. Overall, release of untreated sewage into the river Yamuna carried by the sewer drains poses a high risk to the people residing in the city and highlights an urgent need to treat the entire sewage. Complete treatment of the entire sewage generated using treatment techniques such as advanced oxidation processes (80-90%) could reduce the introduction of these emerging pollutants in the environment.

AB  - The letting surveys from northern New England and New York provide a unique opportunity to derive quantitative documentary evidence on past forests. Due to the distinctive "proprietory town" land tenure system, northern New England has an extensive and virtually untapped archive of land division surveys done prior to settlement (1763-1820). I searched archives throughout Vermont, New Hampshire, and northern New York and located records from 179 towns documenting 48,260 individual trees across the region. Surveyors used 131 separate vernacular names representing at least 49 recognizable species. This collection of town-wide witness tree relative frequencies is a consistent and unbiased empirical estimate of the composition of the natural vegetation before confounding land use. Five ubiquitous taxa (beech, spruces, maples, hemlock, birches) comprised 79% of the witness trees. Beech (32%) consistently dominated the region with greater than 60% of the trees in some towns. Spruce (14%) was the second most abundant species and found throughout the region. Maples (12%) were consistently distributed with peak abundance in Vermont. Hemlock (12%) had a patchy distribution with pockets of abundance, including the eastern Adirondacks. Birches (9%) were a species group with higher abundance in the mountains or to the north. White pine was consistently uncommon with very low (<1%) abundance on the uplands. A dramatic "oak-beech" tension zone or ecotone separated the oak-pine Vegetation in the major southern valleys from the spruce-maple-beech composition northward. The central tendency was toward spruce-hardwoods with distinctive variants in the north, the Taconics, and the Champlain Valley. Major fires and blowdowns were equally rare and affected only 0.5% of the region. Fire was frequent only in the Hudson-Champlain corridor and windthrow was a low-level background disturbance. The most dramatic changes documented over the past 200 years have been the decline of beech and the profound effects of human land use.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the possible role of cockroaches in the epidemiology of nosocomial infections.
   DESIGN: Epidemiologic investigation of bacteria and fungi in cockroaches and evaluation of the antibiotic resistance of the bacteria isolated from the insects.
   SETTING: Ninety hospitals in Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County in Taiwan.
   METHODS: Cockroaches were collected in clinical and nonclinical areas and microorganisms were isolated from their external surface and alimentary tract. ne susceptibilities of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus species to 17 antibiotics were tested.
   RESULTS: Cockroach infestation was found in 46.7% of the hospitals studied. Two hundred three cockroaches were collected (139 Periplaneta americana and 64 Blattella germanica). Periplaneta americana was found more often in nonclinical areas (64.5%) and B. germanica in clinical areas (78.1916). There was no statistically significant difference between Periplaneta americana (98.6%) and B. germanica (96.9%) regarding overall isolation rate (P>.05). However, 33 species of bacteria and 16 species of fungi were isolated from Periplaneta americana and only 23 and 12, respectively, from B. germanica. Resistance to ampicillin (13.7% to 100%6), chloramphenicol (14.3% to 71.4%), tetracycline (14.3% to 73.3%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (14.3% to 57.1%) was found in two gram-positive and five gram-negative bacteria.
   CONCLUSION: Because cockroach infestation occurred in more than 40% of the hospitals and nearly all of the cockroaches harbored bacteria with multidrug resistance and fungi, cockroaches may play a potential role in the epidemiology of nosocomial infections in those hospitals.

AB  - Background. Rivers are considered as integrators systems reflecting physicochemical and biological processes that take place in its catchment area and have a constant flow of matter and energy. This is due to its connectivity and interactions with its watershed and the atmosphere. The Apatlaco and Chalma-Tembembe rivers (Balsas River basin) have different levels of disturbance, caused by changes in land use (US) in its watershed. Goals. To analyze the relationships of the physico-chemical characteristics of water and aquatic macroinvertebrates (AI) assemblages with different US adjacent to Apatlaco and Chalma-Tembembe rivers. Methods. In both rivers, water samples (20 sites studied) and AI were taken for four seasons, and the percentage of US corresponding to their area of impact was determined. Ordination analysis, similarity and Pearson correlation (p < 0.05), with the physicochemical parameters, biological and US were performed. Results. The river Apatlaco presented the higher alterations due to the combination of US, with a high percentage of urban use; Chalma-Tembembe showed more homogeneous physicochemical and biological characteristics. Conclusions. Some assemblage of macroinvertebrates families were correlated with healthy ecosystems (Belostomatidae, Cordulegastridae, Corixidae, Corydalidae, Dryopidae, Elmidae, Hebridae, Helicopsychidae, Heptageniidae, Hydrobiosidae, Lepidostomatidae, Libellulidae, Perlidae, Philopotamidae, Polycentropodidae, Scirtidae, Staphilinidae and Tabanidae); while others with highly disturbed environments (Ancylidae, Asellidae, Chironomidae, Hyalellidae, Psychodidae and Class Hirudinea); and sites impacted by agricultural activities were correlated with moderate abundances and low diversity of AI.

AB  - Societal needs for power generation, water management/use, and land uses (e.g., urban and agricultural) have often resulted in a significant departure from the natural processes of hydrologic regimes and material transport and deposition throughout most of the rivers flowing through arid and semi-arid landscapes of the western USA. We examine the compromised ecosystem integrity of one such river, the upper Snake River in eastern Idaho, below a large irrigation and power dam that has altered hydrologic regimes and reduced channel sediment supply. We review the ecological structure and function of gravel-bed rivers as they vary across a hierarchy of landscape scales with different spatial and temporal dimensions. Major linkages within the large, alluvial river systems of the western USA include exchange of water and materials along longitudinal connections from streams to rivers, lateral connections between river and floodplain systems, and vertical surface and subsurface (hyporheic) water exchanges. Longitudinal linkages dominate confined ( canyon) river reaches while unconfined ( floodplain) reaches show strong affinities for lateral and vertical exchange. Hydrogeomorphic processes, driven by river power and cut and fill alluviation, produce a dynamic landscape in floodplain reaches, which we refer to as a Shifting Habitat Mosaic (SHM). The SHM fosters high physical and ecological diversity of habitats, biotic communities, and ecosystem complexity. In this case study, we examine the dynamics of a series of floodplains along a 90 km river landscape, employing an airborne spectrophotometer, producing georeferenced hyperspectral imagery, coupled with ground truth measures of river hydraulics, river depth, riparian vegetation and other surface characteristics. From these data we derived estimates of the hydraulics and hydrographic regimes necessary to mobilize channel and riparian sediments, thus reestablishing the dynamics of the river SHM. We also evaluated subsequent variation in aquatic and riparian habitat characteristics. Evaluation of these factors, which affect interactions between the river channel and the surrounding river - riparian corridor, permitted us to develop a restoration strategy focused on normative variation among the various physical and biotic processes contributing to ecosystem integrity.

AB  - Managers are moving toward implementing large-scale coastal ecosystem restoration projects, however, many fail to achieve desired outcomes. Among the key reasons for this is the lack of integration with a whole-of-catchment approach, the scale of the project (temporal, spatial), the requirement for on-going costs for maintenance, the lack of clear objectives, a focus on threats rather than services/values, funding cycles, engagement or change in stakeholders, and prioritization of project sites. Here we critically assess the outcomes of activities in three coastal wetland complexes positioned along the catchments of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon, Australia, that have been subjected to restoration investment over a number of decades. Each floodplain has been modified by intensive agricultural production, heavy industry and mining infrastructure, urban/peri urban expansion, aquaculture development and infrastructure expansion. Most development has occurred in low-lying coastal floodplains, resulting in major hydrological modifications to the landscape. This has left the floodplain wetlands in a degraded and hydrologically modified state, with poor water quality (hypoxic, eutrophication, sedimentation, and persistent turbidity), loss of habitat, and disconnected because of flow hydraulic barriers, excessive aquatic plant growth, or establishment of invasive species. Successful GBR wetland ecosystem restoration and management first requires an understanding of what constitutes "success" and must be underpinned by an understanding of complex cause and effect pathways, with a focus on management of services and values. This approach should recognize that these wetlands are still assets in a modified landscape. Suitable, long term, scientific knowledge is necessary to provide government and private companies with the confidence and comfort that their investment delivers dividend (environmental) returns.

   Mycophagy is often underestimated as dietary strategy, but forms an important part of the webs of life, especially in forest ecosystems. The identification of consumed fungal species is crucial to gain more knowledge about food web structures. DNA based methods are the way of choice to overcome limitations of species determination by microscopic analysis. DNA extraction from fungal spores in faecal samples requires specific methodology, due to the resistance of fungal spores and due to the properties of the faecal matrix. We tested two open source extraction buffers, as well as one widely used commercial extraction kit in combination with a mechanical disruption procedure optimised for fungal spores in faecal samples. The efficiency of the DNA extraction was assessed by comparing DNA yield after amplification by PCR with fungus-specific primers. All three protocols were successful in extracting amplifiable fungal DNA. The CTAB protocol yielded the highest amounts of DNA after PCR and gave the most constant results, but the differences among protocols were not significant. The establishment of reliable protocols for DNA extraction from small quantities of fungal spores in faecal samples paves the way for high resolution non-invasive studies in the dietary ecology of wild-living mammals.

AB  - Mobile animals that traverse ecosystem boundaries can fundamentally reshape environments by providing critical nutrient and energy inputs to the ecosystems they inhabit. In particular, aggregations of seabirds often transform coastal and island ecosystems through large amounts of nutrient-rich guano deposition. Anthropogenically driven losses of these subsidies can occur through changes in abundance of mobile species, including seabirds, and have been shown to drive whole-scale ecosystem state change on islands. However, even though many species that forage on anthropogenic food sources are highly mobile and may thus play important roles in moving nutrients from urban systems to otherwise conserved ecosystems, the impacts of anthropogenic supplements on spatial subsidies have been largely ignored. Here we examine the effects of large nesting colonies of Western Gulls (Larus occidentalis), a generalist carnivore known to forage on human refuse, on the Channel Islands of California. Specifically, we explore how their foraging on human subsidies may change nutrient deposition patterns at their relatively remote and protected breeding islands. We equipped gulls with GPS loggers to assess the frequency of urban foraging, and we partnered this tracking data with bird density data to estimate the rate of wild and urban-derived guano deposition on two different islands. Consistent with research on other gull species, we found high (up to 40%) but island-specific rates of urban foraging, resulting between 66 and 93 kg ha(-1) of guano in these two sites during the breeding season, a level greater than half the amount of fertilizer applied annually in typical commercial agricultural settings and likely the primary source of nitrogen and phosphorus inputs to this system. Specifically, we estimate that 27 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of nutrient-rich guano is shuttled to these otherwise isolated islands from anthropogenic sources. This research highlights the large shadow (i.e., footprint) that human activity can cast on even remote ecosystems by driving significant nutrient enrichment through impacts on animal behavior and connectivity.

AB  - The dire wolf was one of the successful top predators in North America during the Pleistocene. It is best known from the southern part of North America, and it even immigrated to South America. Fossils of dire wolves are very rare north of 42- North latitude in North America. That distribution supported the belief that the low temperatures and ice sheets in the higher latitudes of North American formed an insurmountable barrier for the dispersal of dire wolves. Here we report the first record of the dire wolf fossil in Eurasia. The fossil is a partial mandibular fragment with a tooth recovered from a Late Pleistocene underwater sand mine site near the city of Harbin in Northeastern China. Other mammalian fossils from the same site suggest that this dire wolf coexisted with the typical Mammuthus-Coelodonta fauna of Eurasia. The newly discovered specimen has a huge m1; much larger than gray wolves and other large canids from the same region. The massive m1 trigonid accounts for a high percentage of its overall length. The m1 talonid is reduced, but retains a small entoconid. The m2-3 alveoli suggest that the two teeth were smaller than those of the gray wolf. The combination of these morphologies is present only in the dire wolf. When the body mass spectra of medium and large-bodied carnivores from Asia and North America were compared, the Asian dire wolf occupies a position nearly overlapping the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta ultima). During the Late Pleistocene, C. crocuta ultima was one of the most widely distributed and dominant carnivores in Asia. Competition from hyenas may have kept dire wolf Asian populations at very low levels leading to their rarity as fossils rare in Asia.

AB  - I examined the effects of habitat fragmentation on the distribution and abundance of mammalian carnivores in coastal southern California and tested the prediction that responses to fragmentation varied with the body, size of carnivore species. I conducted track surveys for nine native and two exotic carnivore species in 29 urban habitat fragments and 10 control sites. Fragment area and isolation were The two strongest landscape descriptors of predator distribution and abundance. Six species were sensitive to fragmentation, generally, disappearing as habitat patches became smaller and more isolated: three species were enhanced by fragmentation, with increased abundance in highly fragmented sites: and two species were tolerant of fragmentation, with little to no effect of landscape variables on their distribution and abundance, Within urban habitat fragments, the carnivore visitation rate increased at sites will.) more exotic cover and closer to the urban edge, a pattern driven largely, by, the increased abundance of fragmentation-enhanced carnivores at edge sites. Finally, body, size, in conjunction with other ecological characteristics, partially accounted for the heterogeneity, in responses to fragmentation among carnivore species. These differential sensitivities are useful criteria for choosing appropriate focal species for ecological research and conservation planning, a choice that depends on the scale of fragmentation in a region and the commensurate responses of carnivore populations at that scale.

AB  - Like other coastal zones around the world, the inland sea ecosystem of Washington (USA) and British Columbia (Canada), an area known as the Salish Sea, is changing under pressure from a growing human population, conversion of native forest and shoreline habitat to urban development, toxic contamination of sediments and species, and overharvest of resources. While billions of dollars have been spent trying to restore other coastal ecosystems around the world, there still is no successful model for restoring estuarine or marine ecosystems like the Salish Sea. Despite the lack of a guiding model, major ecological principles do exist that should be applied as people work to design the Salish Sea and other large marine ecosystems for the future. We suggest that the following 10 ecological principles serve as a foundation for educating the public and for designing a healthy Salish Sea and other coastal ecosystems for future generations: (1) Think ecosystem: political boundaries are arbitrary; (2) Account for ecosystem connectivity; (3) Understand the food web; (4) Avoid fragmentation; (5) Respect ecosystem integrity; (6) Support nature's resilience; (7) Value nature: it's money in your pocket; (8) Watch wildlife health; (9) Plan for extremes; and (10) Share the knowledge.

TI  - Microhabitats of planted sea wall strips used by pollinators and Orthoptera
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORTHOPTERA RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - As part of an Urban Buzz scheme, strips of teasel (Dipsacus fullonum) and greater knapweed (Centaurea scabiosa) have been established along a sea wall flood defense in the UK to provide a corridor of flower-rich habitat for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The cutting of tall grassland and planting of dicotyledons also created a suitable short sward environment (c. 30 cm height) for Orthoptera nymphs in the establishment year (2018). I lowever, by 2019, the grassland in the pollinator strips was taller (c. 75 cm) and suboptimal for grasshoppers; in contrast to Roesel's bushcricket (Roeseliana roeselii), which inhabited the taller vegetation in greater abundance. The progression to established grassland with flowering D. fut.lonztm saw the pollinator strips attract significantly higher numbers of bees and butterflies than the floristically poor control strips. This small-scale study illustrates that pollinator strips can have multi-functional benefits for ecosystems beyond pollination, with Orthoptera of tall grassland (R. roeselii) likely to persist alongside planted wildflowers.

TI  - JUAREZ COMPLEX - EXTERNAL RELATIONS SECRETARIAT. CIUDAD DE MEXICO
T2  - EN BLANCO-REVISTA DE ARQUITECTURA
LA  - Spanish
AB  - The Juarez Complex is in the Historic Centre of Mexico City, facing the Alameda Central. Covering a total surface area of 27,500m2 the complex is adjacent to the Avenida Juarez to the north, to the south to the Calle Independencia, the east to the Calle Dolores and to the west with the Calle Luis Moya.
   The aim of the Juarez Complex is to regenerate an important area of the Historic Centre of the City which suffered serious damage in the 1985 earthquakes. The Complex is made up of open spaces, walkways and squares.
   The new headquarters of the Foreign Affairs Secretariat, "Secretaria de Relaciones Exteriores - Torre Tlatelolco" and the High court Building "Tribunal Superior de Justicia del D.F." as well as some mixed usage buildings and car parks are found there.
   Due to its position, the complex finds itself in a transitional area between the Paseo de la Reforma with its larger scaled buildings and the Historic Centre characterised by lower-level buildings and more pedestrian-friendly spaces. The architectural aim is to reflect this context in terms of position and age, which is why a 12.65 m Perla Huxquilucan stone plinth base was designed. This height is exactly that of the Corpus Christi Temple, the design, materials and scale of which are clearly linked to those of the Historic Centre. Coordinating with the Fideicomiso (trusts responsible for the order of certain types of buildings) del Centro Historico and the INAH, The Corpus Christi Temple was redesigned to give it a new use working as an attraction to the centre.
   The flat roofs the base describes are treated as terraces and gardens to be used as expansion areas for the taller buildings. The Plaza Juarez is the main one of these outside areas surrounding the Corpus Christi Temple. The Square is the focal point for the rest of the complex radiating to and from the main pedestrian access points to each. With the collaboration of the artist and sculptor Vicente Rojo a great fountain was built in the centre of the square complementing the vegetation to be found in the Parque Alameda with the element of water.
   It forms a 35 x 30 metre mirror with over a thousand red concrete pyramids which, with the movement of the water via a series of injectors in each pyramid, transforms it into a fountain of great movement.
   As well as Vicente Rojo's fountain, along the outside areas is the "SPEED Mural" el Mural VELOCIDAD - by David Alfaro Siqueiros as well as other works of are, placed there to try and rekindle the tradition of public/street art in our city.
   EXTERNAL AFFAIRS SECRETARIAT "TORRE TLATELOLCO"
   The building is part of the Juarez Complex - el Conjunto Juarez which is contained in the block bordered by the Juarez, Independencia, Dolores and Luis Moya Avenues. It is a 23-storey building adjacent to the Plaza Juarez to the north and to the south with the Plaza Independencia.
   On the ground floor is the lobby, the "treaties vault" - boveda de tratados, conference and press rooms and some public offices. In this level there is a pedestrian portico, which leads to all the different elements of the complex.
   On the first floor, there are reception and meeting rooms within the space forming a 12.65 m high base, the height corresponding exactly to the scale of the Corpus Christi Temple and which, therefore links the project to the Historic Centre and the other buildings in the complex.
   Executive dining-rooms are on the second floor and the 19 floors above contain the sub-secretariats distributed at present in different buildings.
   Finally on top is a floor for the building services, under which are the executive offices.
   The facade of the building on the two base floors is in the Huixquilucan quarry type stone. From the second level the facade is covered with a decorative cladding.
   For the specifications criteria for the staircases, corridors, toilets, car parking and other elements, standards are at the least those of the Federal district building rules when use by the user is required.

AB  - Sylvatic plague (Yersinia pestis) is an exotic pathogen that is highly virulent in black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) and causes widespread colony losses and individual mortality rates >95%. We investigated colony spatial characteristics that may influence inter-colony transmission of plague at 3 prairie dog colony complexes in the Great Plains. The 4 spatial characteristics we considered include: colony size, Euclidean distance to nearest neighboring colony, colony proximity index, and distance to nearest drainage (dispersal) corridor. We used multi-state mark-recapture models to determine the relationship between these colony characteristics and probability of plague transmission among prairie dog colonies. Annual mapping of colonies and mark-recapture analyses of disease dynamics in natural colonies led to 4 main results: 1) plague outbreaks exhibited high spatial and temporal variation, 2) the site of initiation of epizootic plague may have substantially influenced the subsequent inter-colony spread of plague, 3) the long-term effect of plague on individual colonies differed among sites because of how individuals and colonies were distributed, and 4) colony spatial characteristics were related to the probability of infection at all sites although the relative importance and direction of relationships varied among sites. Our findings suggest that conventional prairie dog conservation management strategies, including promoting large, highly connected colonies, may need to be altered in the presence of plague.

AB  - In Kenya knowledge of the relative severity of threats to protected areas and the vulnerability of these areas to any threats is lacking. Such information is required, however, for assessment of the effectiveness of management of the country's protected areas, and to help identify critical management and policy weaknesses and priorities for improving management and allocating resources. We therefore studied the relative severity of threats to Kenya's 50 protected areas and their relative vulnerability to such threats based on the perceptions of protected area managers. Ten threats were identified by these managers, of which the most severe were illegal bushmeat hunting, poaching of large mammals, human-wildlife conflicts, human encroachment, and loss of migration corridors and dispersal areas. Thirty-two (64%) protected areas were vulnerable to over half of the threats, 54% vulnerable to over six of the threats and 32% vulnerable to over seven of the threats. Protected areas in marine, forested/montane and inland wetland ecosystems were regarded as highly vulnerable to the perceived threats. Protected areas adjacent to urban/industrial and agricultural areas were vulnerable to most of the threats. Our findings demonstrate that protected areas in Kenya are increasingly threatened, that major threats needs to be mitigated, and that prioritization of protected areas for strategic actions is required for effective management.

AB  - Conservation fences have been used as a tool to stop threatening processes from acting against endangered wildlife, yet little is known of the impacts of fences on non-target native species. In this study, we intensively monitored a pest-exclusion fence for 16 months to assess impacts on a reptile community in south-eastern Australia. We registered 1052 reptile records of six species along the fence. Encounters and mortality were greatest for eastern long-necked turtles (Chelodina longicollis), whereas impacts on lizards (Tiliqua rugosa, Tiliqua scincoides, Pogona barbata, Egernia cunninghami) and snakes (Pseudonaja textilis) were more moderate. We recorded several Chelodina longicollis recaptures at the fence and many of these were later found dead at the fence, indicating persistent attempts to navigate past the fence. We conservatively estimate that the fence resulted in the death of 3.3% and disrupted movements of 20.9% of the turtle population within the enclosure. Movement disruption and high mortality were also observed for turtles attempting to enter the nature reserve, effectively isolating the reserve population from others in the wider landscape. Of 98 turtle mortalities, the most common cause of death was overheating, followed by predation, vehicular collision, and entanglement. Turtle interactions were clustered in areas with more wetlands and less urban development, and temporally correlated with high rainfall and solar radiation, and low temperature. Thus, managers could focus at times and locations to mitigate impacts on turtles. We believe the impact of fences on non-target species is a widespread and unrecognized threat, and suggest that future and on-going conservation fencing projects consider risks to non-target native species, and where possible, apply mitigation strategies that maintain natural movement corridors and minimize mortality risk.

AB  - This study investigated the abundance of mosquitoes and circulation of mosquito-borne arboviruses from 16 villages in 8 cities of Hunan Province, China, in July-August of 2010 and in August of 2011. In total, 16,076 mosquitoes consisting of seven species from four genera were collected by ultraviolet-light trap. Culex quinquefasciatus was the most common species, accounting for 50.63% (8140/16,076) of the total. Anopheles sinensis (24.26%, 3900/16,076) made up the second most common species, followed by Culex tritaeniorhynchus (9.76%, 1569/16,076). The proportions of Culex pipiens pallens, Armigeres subalbatus, and Culex modestus were 6.7%, 5.2%, and 3.31%, respectively. Fourteen Aedes albopictus were detected. The mosquitoes were identified by morphologic characteristics and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The mosquitoes were pooled, triturated, and centrifuged. The clarified supernatant was used to inoculate monolayers of C6/36 and baby hamster kidney-21 cells. We obtained six virus isolates that caused cytopathic effects. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that two isolates were Akabane virus (AKAV, from A. sinensis and C. quinquefasciatus), two isolates were Japanese encephalitis virus (from C. pipiens pallens and C. quinquefasciatus), and two isolates were Tibet orbivirus (from C. quinquefasciatus and C. tritaeniorhynchus). This is the first report of AKAV isolated from A. sinensis and C. quinquefasciatus in nature in China. The detection of AKAV in these species confirms circulation of AKAV in Hunan province and suggests potential challenges to the prevention and control of arthropod-borne animal viruses in mainland China.

AB  - Introduction: Cryptococcosis is an invasive disease acquired by inhalation of infectious propagules from the environment. Currently, compulsory notification of the spread of this disease is not required in Colombia. However, reporting of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome cases to the National Surveillance System has suggested that there is a growing population at risk of contracting cryptococcosis. Few studies have described the occurrence of cryptococcosis in Colombia. Therefore, in this study, we examined the pathology of this disease in Atlantico, Colombia and determined the distributions of Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii in the environment. Methods: Clinical samples/isolates were gathered from cases of cryptococcosis previously diagnosed at health institutions in Atlantico, and surveys were completed by clinicians. The environmental study considered 32 sampling points and three tree species, i.e., Quickstick (Gliricidia sepium), Almond (Terminalia catappa), and Pink trumpet (Tabebuia rosea). Environmental and clinical samples/isolates were analyzed for phenotypic and genotypic confirmation. Results: From 1997-2014, 41 cases of cryptococcosis were reported. The mean patient age was 40.5 years (range: 18-63 years); 76% were men, and 78% were HIV positive. Isolation was possible in 38 cases (C. neoformans, molecular type VNI in 37 cases and C. gattii, molecular type VGI in one case). In 20122014, 2,068 environmental samples were analyzed with a positivity of 0.4% (C. neoformans, molecular type VNI) in Almond and Pink trumpet trees. Conclusions: Cryptococcus neoformans, molecular type VNI had a higher prevalence than C. gattii and was associated with human exposure and the pathogenesis of cryptococcosis in this geographical region.

AB  - Leptospirosis is caused by spirochete bacteria of the genus Leptospira that affect one million and kill 60,000 persons annually in the world, who get infected through environmental mammal-excreted (notably rodent) pathogens. Using qPCR and DNA sequencing approaches, we here examine Leptospira occurrence and diversity in 971 commensal small mammals in urban and peri-urban habitats from south Benin, where socio-environmental conditions are favorable for human contamination. Prevalence reached 12.9% on average, but showed very important variations in both space and time, thus pointing toward a role of local processes in the maintenance and circulation of rodent-borne leptospires in the area. Prevalence peaks may occur during or one month after moderate (100-200 mm) monthly rainfall, suggesting that rodent-borne leptospires may be more prevalent when standing waters are present, but not at their highest levels (i.e., floods). However, this pattern will have to be confirmed through proper diachronic analysis. Finally, an incomplete but significant host-specificity was observed, with L. kirschneri retrieved only in African shrews, and the invasive Rattus norvegicus and the native Mastomys natalensis preferentially infected by L. interrogans and L. borgpeterseni, respectively. Our study highlights the urgent need for investigations on human leptospirosis in the extensively urbanized Abidjan-Lagos corridor.

AB  - Recent archeobotanical work has shed light on prehistoric food globalization across the Eurasian landmass; however, much less research has focused on the foodways of the historical cities and settlements found throughout Central Asia on various portions of the 'Silk Road'. Here, we present archeobotanical and isotopic results from recent excavations at Shichengzi, a Han dynasty (202 BC-AD 220) military garrison. Our archeobotanical results recovered from 11 samples reveal that four types of cereals, naked barley, wheat, common millet, and foxtail millet, were the most common crops at the site. Naked barley, a drought and cold resistant crop, comprised 79% of the crop assemblage recovered from Shichengzi, and the rest of the assemblage is composed of wheat and millet. The reliance on drought resistant crops indicates that people at Shichengzi oriented their agricultural strategy toward mitigating environmental risks. In addition, our isotopic analyses (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of charred cereal grains (n = 22), animal and human remains (n = 12) recovered from excavations at Shichengzi suggests that the delta N-15 values of cereals were enriched by human or livestock dung. Moreover, the delta C-13 data from Shichengzi suggest that farmers preferentially planted their crops in wide areas that would have received the highest amounts of water available on the northern piedmont of the Tianshan mountains. Our research contributes to the growing understanding of the diversity of agricultural strategies used along the Silk Road.

AB  - One of the greatest challenges for Latin America and the Caribbean, the most biologically and culturally diverse region in the world, is to halt the loss of species caused by habitat destruction and land degradation. Up to now, setting aside protected natural areas is considered the most effective alternative to conserve biodiversity. Protected areas. however, are under increasing assault by agricultural. silvicultural, and industrial development that surround and isolate them, reducing their habitat quality at the landscape scale. Among the different types of protected areas that have been proposed, biosphere reserves stand out for their attempt to compatibilize social development and conservation. Their management is the most amenable to integration of natural and human disturbance, inclusion of traditional management techniques, and participation by social and economic sectors in the administration. Biosphere reserves have proliferated all over the world, and today there are 53 1 of them located in 105 countries. where they protect vast ecological and Cultural diversity. Even though the design of biosphere reserves is based on the landscape concept. it has vet to take into account ecosystem scales, possible long-term effects of disturbances, and better integrate and give higher consideration to the knowledge and experience of numerous ethnic groups that live within them. However, doing so requires a transformation of the function of the core, buffer. and transition areas. The Current design of biosphere reserves is centripetal because the main function of the buffer zone is to protect biodiversity in the core. We propose a centrifugal model. where biodiversity of the core spreads freely toward the area of greater human influence with the buffer zone functioning as a connector. This connectivity can promote land-use practices that are in alignment with both ecosystems functioning and biodiversity conservation in natural. semi-natural. urban and industrial landscapes.

AB  - 1. Vegetated islands within river corridors are pivotal landscape features and are among the first to disappear as a consequence of flow regulation and channelisation. However, how vegetated islands vary along human-impacted rivers is poorly understood. 2. We carried out a detailed analysis of the contemporary distribution, diversity and environmental state of vegetated islands within 12 human-impacted European rivers, using 75 Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images (19992002), historical maps, DEM data and landscape metrics. We tested whether channel fragmentation, catchment land use and the environmental state of fringing floodplains determine the spatial patterns of the islands. We also analysed the historical change of islands within selected sections of the Upper Danube, Upper Rhine and Olt rivers. 3. We identified 2771 islands in the contemporary landscape, varying from 0.06 to 9828 ha. Islands covered up to 21% of the active channel area and contributed up to 32% of the total riparian ecotone length. Island density ranged from 0.06 islands per river-km (River Sava) to 1.6 islands per river-km (River Tagliamento). River regulation has led to a marked loss of island density: 94% in the Upper Danube, 93% in the Upper Rhine, and 69% in the Olt. The environmental state of the islands was significantly less altered by human activity than of their fringing floodplains; 93.4% of the vegetated islands exhibited a near-natural state, while 86% of the fringing floodplains were expansively converted to agricultural and urban land uses. 4. Our results highlight the ubiquitous presence of vegetated islands, their sensitivity to river regulation and their pivotal role for the future restoration and management of river corridors.

AB  - Encroaching urban development is a leading cause of habitat loss, replacing natural areas with anthropogenic infrastructure and road networks. Roadways can influence the spatial ecology and survival of mammalian carnivores, particularly felids, thereby threatening longterm persistence and conservation of sensitive populations. Ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) are a federally endangered felid in the United States with breeding populations restricted to the Lower Rio Grande Valley of South Texas, an area of extensive anthropogenic expansion. We evaluated the influence of road networks on ocelot survival using a long-term telemetry dataset (1982-2001, n = 59) and draw comparisons with a spatially referenced historical dataset of ocelot-vehicle collisions in the same area (1982-2020, n = 54). Vehicle collisions accounted for 40% of radio-collared ocelot fatalities. Annual survival rates were 0.90 (95% CI = 0.84-0.95) for resident ocelots and 0.66 (95% CI = 0.45-0.97) for transient ocelots. We evaluated biological and road-related factors that may influence ocelot survival using Cox proportional hazards regression. The top model included density of unpaved, low-volume, and high-volume roads within home ranges and resident-transient status. Mortality risk increased 16% with every 0.07 km/km(2) increase of high-volume roads within annual home range, decreased 45% with every 1.12 km/km(2) increase of unpaved roads, and decreased 276% for residents compared to transients. Further, probability of mortality specifically from vehicle collision increased with greater density of low-volume roads within ocelot home ranges. Within the historical dataset of ocelot-vehicle collisions, 46% occurred on low -volume roads while 39% occurred on high-volume roads. Our results highlight the necessity for mitigation strategies on low-volume roads which cause the most ocelot-vehicle collisions. In addition, continued attention towards high-volume roads is necessary to ocelot conservation. Understanding how road attributes affect the survival of species sensitive to urbanization and habitat fragmentation can aid in their conservation. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Chemical-contaminant mixtures are widely reported in large stream reaches in urban/agriculture-developed watersheds, but mixture compositions and aggregate biological effects are less well understood in corresponding smaller headwaters, which comprise most of stream length, riparian connectivity, and spatial biodiversity. During 20142017, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) measured 389 unique organic analytes (pharmaceutical, pesticide, organic wastewater indicators) in 305 headwater streams within four contiguous United States (US) regions. Potential aquatic biological effects were evaluated for estimated maximum and median exposure conditions using multiple lines of evidence, including occurrence/concentrations of designed-bioactive pesticides and pharmaceuticals and cumulative risk screening based on vertebrate-centric ToxCast (TM) exposure-response data and on invertebrate and nonvascular plant aquatic life benchmarks. Mixed-contaminant exposures were ubiquitous and varied, with 78% (304) of analytes detected at least once and cumulative maximum concentrations up to more than 156,000 ng/L. Designed bioactives represented 83% of detected analytes. Contaminant summary metrics correlated strong-positive (rho (rho): 0.5690.719) to multiple watershed-development metrics, only weak-positive to point-source discharges (rho: 0.225353), and moderate- to strong-negative with multiple instream invertebrate metrics (rho: -0.373 to -0.652). Risk screening indicated common exposures with high probability of vertebrate-centric molecular effects and of acute toxicity to invertebrates, respectively. The results confirm exposures to broad and diverse contaminant mixtures and provide convincing multiple lines of evidence that chemical contaminants contribute substantially to adverse multi-stressor effects in headwater-stream communities.

AB  - Land-use change associated with human development can alter aquatic habitat and imperil aquatic species. Fish are challenged when urban streams are altered, for example for stormwater conveyance, but little is known about how such activities influence the space use of individual fish. Electronic tagging and experimental displacement of fish can be used to explore site fidelity and homing behaviour of fish and can therefore be useful for testing hypotheses about space use and habitat selection. In this study, we used experimental displacement to determine how longnose dace (LND, Rhinichthys cataractae) utilize reaches within a watershed that have varying degrees of degradation. LND were tagged using passive integrated transponders (PIT tags), transported upstream, and released either into the natural stream reach, impaired stormwater drain reach, or at their confluence. Fixed PIT antennas were used to monitor movement of the PIT-tagged fish among the three reaches for a period of 3 weeks. LND exhibited dramatic and rapid selection against the stormwater drain. No LND moved into the drain and 97% of fish transported to the drain left within 24 h. LND were actively avoiding the stormwater drain, emphasizing the need for enhancement work to improve the biological connectivity of the system.

AB  - In 1996, a coalition of diverse and determined organizations launched a new initiative in the Chicago region. Our vision? Chicago Wilderness: a thriving mosaic of natural areas, connected by greenways and wildlife corridors, embedded in the nation's third largest metropolis. In this vision, the region's human communities reclaim a cultural tradition of protecting and restoring these globally significant natural communities that enrich our lives. Today, more than 100 organizations join forces to transform this vision into reality. A regional Biodiversity Recovery Plan-the result of three Years OF assessment and planning by scientists, land managers, educators, and policy strategies-sets priorities and determines the lines of action for the coalition. This regional agenda stems from our vision and recovery goals for each ecological community; it encourages targeted research initiatives that focus on characterizing our native biological diversity and on analyzing elements critical to its recovery. Ultimately though the long-term survival of our natural wealth rests on the support from the public. While the challenges to conservation educators and communicators are many, Chicago Wilderness allows us to work together in understanding our. audiences, channeling our resources, and creating novel approaches to engage the wiliest public in our conservation efforts.

AB  - Current best-practice policy recommendations for managing fish stocks are achieved by a mixture of maintaining modest fishing mortality (restricting effort, times and gear), marine reserve networks and not subsidizing unprofitable fisheries. A seldom evaluated question is how effective these proposed approaches are for maintaining all fish stocks and biodiversity elements in marine seascapes? Both recommended and unrecommended fishing practices fragment habitats and reduce metapopulation connectivity with potentially unexpected seascape-level consequences. To better understand these outcomes, we pooled and evaluated fish community data into two seascape groupings for comparisons of biomass and life-history characteristics. These were remote baseline reefs (>9 hr from regional cities and >4 hr from human habitation, n = 584 locations) and those emulating best-practice seascapes (BPS, n = 140). BPS were a mix of high-compliance marine reserves (fishable biomass = 892 +/- 696 (+/- SD) kg/ha, n = 95; >5 km(2) and >15 years of closure) and fished seascapes (478 +/- 395 kg/ha, n = 45) that had biomass near the maximum sustained yield (MSY) estimates for coral reefs. The fish communities in the BPS locations differed considerably from the remote baseline by having 49% of the median and 32% of the mean biomass, smaller community-weighted body sizes, and faster growth and mortality rates. Most of the declines were associated with high biomass taxa that included carnivorous jacks (Carangidae), snappers (Lutjanidae), groupers (Serranidae) and triggerfish (Balistidae), which were reduced to between 11% and 28% of the mean baseline. Surgeonfish (Acanthuridae) and parrotfish (Scarinae) were an exception in being reduced to only 48 and 53% of the baseline's mean biomass, respectively. As expected, community-level body sizes and age values were larger and trophic level higher, while growth and mortality were lower in baselines than BPS seascapes. After evaluating the different environmental responses between seascapes and accounting for the largest geographic factor, longitude, we evaluated the community responses to 4 possible BPS planning scenarios. Biomass responses to age and trophic level and length at maturity were similar and predictable for the two seascapes. In contrast, growth and generation time responses differed between seascapes. Baselines had peak biomass patterns at intermediate values, whereas BPS displayed a declining influence of growth and a saturating response for generation time. Consequently, deviations between BPS and baselines indicate that current BPS proposals do not fully emulate the ecology of remote or wilderness locations. Therefore, wilderness will be a required management designation if the global fish communities are to be fully conserved.

AB  - BackgroundMicroorganisms such as coliform-forming bacteria are commonly used to assess freshwater quality for drinking and recreational use. However, such organisms do not exist in isolation; they exist within the context of dynamic, interactive microbial communities which vary through space and time. Elucidating spatiotemporal microbial dynamics is imperative for discriminating robust community changes from ephemeral ecological trends, and for improving our overall understanding of the relationship between microbial communities and ecosystem health. We conducted a seven-year (2013-2019) microbial time-series investigation in the Chicago Area Waterways (CAWS): an urban river system which, in 2016, experienced substantial upgrades to disinfection processes at two wastewater reclamation plants (WRPs) that discharge into the CAWS and improved stormwater capture, to improve river water quality and reduce flooding. Using culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches, we compared CAWS microbial ecology before and after the intervention.ResultsExaminations of time-resolved beta distances between WRP-adjacent sites showed that community similarity measures were often consistent with the spatial orientation of site locations to one another and to the WRP outfalls. Fecal coliform results suggested that upgrades reduced coliform-associated bacteria in the effluent and the downstream river community. However, examinations of whole community changes through time suggest that the upgrades did little to affect overall riverine community dynamics, which instead were overwhelmingly driven by yearly patterns consistent with seasonality.ConclusionsThis study presents a systematic effort to combine 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing with traditional culture-based methods to evaluate the influence of treatment innovations and systems upgrades on the microbiome of the Chicago Area Waterway System, representing the longest and most comprehensive characterization of the microbiome of an urban waterway yet attempted. We found that the systems upgrades were successful in improving specific water quality measures immediately downstream of wastewater outflows. Additionally, we found that the implementation of the water quality improvement measures to the river system did not disrupt the overall dynamics of the downstream microbial community, which remained heavily influenced by seasonal trends. Such results emphasize the dynamic nature of microbiomes in open environmental systems such as the CAWS, but also suggest that the seasonal oscillations remain consistent even when perturbed.

AB  - It is important to develop research methods that will detect deterioration in population health before severe declines occur. Amphibian population declines are widespread; the main causes are anthropogenic and include habitat fragmentation due to agriculture, mining, fires, and urban development. Brazil is the richest country in species of amphibians, and the Brazilian regions with the greatest amphibian diversity are experiencing relatively high rates of habitat destruction. We tested the use of measurements of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) taken on adult frogs, as well as heterozygosity estimates in frog populations, to detect anthropogenic stress. We hypothesized that greater human occupancy in the landscape might result in more stressful conditions for amphibians, which would be reflected in high FA levels and/or reduced heterozygosity. We conducted this study at the Espinhaco mountain range in southeastern Brazil, using an endemic species (Bokermannohyla saxicola, Hylidae) as a model. We found that adult frog FA levels differed among localities but did not find significant correlations between human modification of the landscape and FA levels. In the subsample of localities for which we had genetic data, heterozygosity was significantly inversely correlated with FA in adult frogs, and heterozygosity decreased with increasing human occupancy in the landscape, except for populations with marginal distribution within the species range that already had very low heterozygosity. Our major finding was that reduced heterozygosity may be caused by population isolation resulting from human occupancy (among other causes) and is correlated with increased fluctuating asymmetry, so that either may indicate higher levels of stress in populations of B. saxicola.

AB  - The extent to which the 'fragmented' properties of a landscape have actually been caused by anthropogenic fragmentation is often unknown. We can, however, understand links between spatial patterns of habitat in the current landscape and the biota. Built seawalls in Sydney Harbour, Australia, appear to fragment the natural, intertidal habitat. Rocky shores naturally occur, however, in a landscape of 'fragments', i.e. as patches of natural habitat separated by other natural habitats. To examine the extent to which fragmentation, i.e. due to human disturbance, has affected biota, we compared assemblages in these naturally patchy habitats to those in 'fragmented' habitats. Rocky shores were smaller and further apart from one another when surrounded by artificial habitat (called 'complete fragments') than when surrounded by other natural habitats (called 'natural patches'). This pattern matches the physical properties of 'fragmented landscapes'. We therefore tested whether patterns of diversity of biota in complete fragments, in mixed fragments (with one side adjacent to natural habitat and the other to artificial habitat) and in natural patches can be predicted from current models about the effects of the process of fragmentation. The number of taxa, number of unique taxa and variability in the number of taxa were all greater in natural patches than in mixed and complete fragments, although not all analyses were statistically significant. The current study supports notions that the composition and configuration of 'seascapes' is more important to the ecology of many marine organisms than previously thought.

AB  - We analysed the development of benthic invertebrate assemblages in restored urban streams in Germany. Prior to restoration these streams were open sewers and not inhabited by benthic invertebrates except Oligochaeta. Therefore, almost all taxa recolonised the streams after restoration. Restoration included the improvement of the water quality and the hydro-morphology. Following stream restoration, benthic invertebrate assemblages are supposed to undergo a distinct succession, as new habitats have been generated. These processes are poorly understood in streams. Our study revealed succession patterns and processes of benthic invertebrate assemblages in restored streams formerly transporting sewage, with pioneer taxa being dominant in the first years and a gradual assemblage maturation. We sampled 13 sites in seven restored streams in the springs of 2012 and 2013. Seven of these sites are connected to near-natural sections, whereas six sites lack this connection. The 13 sites differ in time since restoration and were sampled between one and 20 years after restoration. Additionally, we sampled 21 near-natural sites within the catchment and 11 near-natural sites in neighbouring catchments as potential recolonisation sources. Within 1 year, the restored sites underwent succession, which led to a higher resemblance of their assemblages to those of source sites. Derived from change values and non-metric multidimensional scaling, assemblages of young restored sites changed more than assemblages of old ones. In the first years after restoration we found assemblages with high abundances of pioneer taxa, while 5 years after restoration assemblages were increasingly similar to those of the source sites and mature assemblages were observed a decade after restoration. The succession towards near-natural assemblages is influenced by the instream habitats, catchment conditions and the recolonisation sources in the surroundings. Our findings reveal that monitoring results obtained fewer than 10 years after restoration will still be influenced by ongoing succession.

AB  - At the southernmost part of South America there is Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve where the Magellanic sub-Antarctic evergreen unfragmented the Nothofagus forests still persist. This zone has been considered as one of the world's most pristine regions and this area is currently subject to increasing development pressures from new connectivity, urban expansion and tourism development. Using a biocultural approach we found that the Magellanic Woodpecker (Campephilus magellanicus) is the favorite bird for the community of Puerto Williams, the world's southernmost town and the biggest human centre in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve. Although, significant differences (P < 0,05) exists between the preferences of the sociocultural groups toward birds, all groups agreed in their preferences toward the Magellanic woodpecker. This species of bird was the preferred for the people who have been longer in Cape Horn: the members of the Yahgan Indigenous Community and long time residents. The analysis of these results as well as the discovery of ten attributes that this species of picid presents which in addition is the largest of South America, have taken us to consider it like a charismatic or emblematic species with a high potential for the conservation of the austral forests of Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve. For this previous reasons the Magellanic woodpecker could be transformed into a symbol or a charismatic species for the conservation of the pristine austral forest. Between the year 2005 and 2007 we developed the Magellanic Woodpecker Implementation Program with the objective to increase both its intrinsic value and habitat valuation and the knowledge from the local community. The discovery of this species potential as well as their later implementation may contribute to the conservation of the fragile, singular and beautiful austral forests and its singular biological and cultural diversity.

AB  - Fire was arguably the most important forest and rangeland disturbance process in the Inland Northwest United States for millennia. Prior to the Lewis and Clark expedition, fire regimes ranged from high severity with return intervals of one to five centuries, to low severity with fire-free periods lasting three decades or less. Indoamerican burning contributed to the fire ecology of grasslands and lower and mid-montane dry forests, especially where ponderosa pine was the dominant overstory species, but the extent of this contribution is difficult to quantify. Two centuries of settlement, exploitation, management, and climate variation have transformed the fire regimes, vegetation and fuel patterns, and overall functionality of these forests. We present a narrative that portrays conditions beginning at the first contact of Euro-American settlers with Indoamericans of the region and extending to the present. Due in part to its geographic isolation, the Inland Northwest was among the last regions to be discovered by Euro-Americans. In 200 years the region has undergone fur trapping and trading, sheep, cattle, and horse grazing, timber harvesting, mining, road construction, native grassland conversion to agricultural production, urban and rural area development, fire prevention, and fire suppression. We highlight key changes to forest landscape patterns and processes that occurred under these combined influences, discuss implications of the changes, and progress towards restoring sustainability. An adaptive ecosystem management model has been adopted by public land management agencies to remedy current conditions. Ecosystem management is a relatively new concept that emphasizes the integrity and sustainability of land systems rather than outputs from the land. Adaptive management emphasizes the twin notions that incomplete knowledge and high degrees of risk and uncertainty about earth and climate systems will always limit land and resource planning and management decisions, and that management is chiefly a learning and adapting process. We discuss current issues and future options associated with ecosystem management, including the low likelihood of social consensus concerning desired outcomes, the lack of integrated planning, analysis, and decision support tools, and mismatches between existing land management planning processes, Congressional appropriations, and complex management and restoration problems.

AB  - Brachyspira pilosicoli is an anaerobic spirochaete that colonizes the large intestine of humans and various species of animals and birds. The spirochaete is an important enteric pathogen of pigs and poultry, but its pathogenic potential in humans is less clear. In the current study, the occurrence of B. pilosicoli in faecal samples from 766 individuals in two different population groups in Perth, Western Australia, was investigated by selective anaerobic culture. Of 586 individuals who were long-term residents of Perth, including children, elderly patients in care and in hospital and individuals with gastrointestinal disease, only one was culture positive. This person had a history of diverticulitis. In comparison, faeces from 17 of 180 (9.4 %) Indonesians who were short- or medium-term visitors to Perth were positive for B. pilosicoli. The culture-positive individuals had been in the city for between 10 days and 4.5 years (median 5 months). Resampling of subsets of the Indonesians indicated that all negative people remained negative and that some positive individuals remained positive after 5 months. Two individuals had pairs of isolates recovered after 4 and 5 months that had the same PFGE types, whilst another individual had isolates with two different PFGE types that were identified 2 months apart. Individuals who were culture-positive were likely to have been either colonized in Indonesia before arriving in Perth or infected in Perth following contact with other culture-positive Indonesians with whom they socialized. Colonization with B. pilosicoli was not significantly associated with clinical signs at the time the individuals were tested, although faeces with wet-clay consistency were 1.5 times more likely (confidence interval 0.55-4.6) than normal faeces to contain B. pilosicoli.

AB  - Cache Valley virus (CVV) is a mosquito-borne bunyavirus (family Bunyaviridae, genus Orthobunyavirus) that is enzootic throughout much of North and Central America. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have been incriminated as important reservoir and amplification hosts. CVV has been found in a diverse array of mosquito species, but the principal vectors are unknown. A 16-year study was undertaken to identify the primary mosquito vectors in Connecticut, quantify seasonal prevalence rates of infection, and define the spatial geographic distribution of CVV in the state as a function of land use and white-tailed deer populations, which have increased substantially over this period. CVV was isolated from 16 mosquito species in seven genera, almost all of which were multivoltine and mammalophilic. Anopheles (An.) punctipennis was incriminated as the most consistent and likely vector in this region on the basis of yearly isolation frequencies and the spatial geographic distribution of infected mosquitoes. Other species exhibiting frequent temporal and moderate spatial geographic patterns of virus isolation within the state included Ochlerotatus (Oc.) trivittatus, Oc. canadensis, Aedes (Ae.) vexans, and Ae. cinereus. New isolation records for CVV were established for An. walkeri, Culiseta melanura, and Oc. cantator. Other species from which CVV was isolated included An. quadrimaculatus, Coquillettidia perturbans, Culex salinarius, Oc. japonicus, Oc. sollicitans, Oc. taeniorhynchus, Oc. triseriatus, and Psorophora ferox. Mosquitoes infected with CVV were equally distributed throughout urban, suburban, and rural locales, and infection rates were not directly associated with the localized abundance of white-tailed deer, possibly due to their saturation throughout the region. Virus activity in mosquitoes was episodic with no consistent pattern from year-to-year, and fluctuations in yearly seasonal infection rates did not appear to be directly impacted by overall mosquito abundance. Virus infection in mosquitoes occurred late in the season that mostly extended from mid-August through September, when adult mosquito populations were visibly declining and were comparatively low. Findings argue for a limited role for vertical transmission for the perpetuation of CVV as occurs with other related bunyaviruses.

AB  - Recognition of the interrelationships between the global loss of nature and collapse of rural communities is essential. Compartmentalising or ignoring the diversity of stakeholder perspectives, policy objectives, and the complexity of nature has not worked. We must improve all natural and human capital to address the growing problems. Progressing environmental and development policies in isolation diminishes policy effectiveness, polarises communities by engendering dislocation, fear and conflict, and leads to ineffectual or deleterious natural and rural systems management. Conservation and rural policy can be recast to a new rural-urban dynamic: progressing from food and fibre production with little regard for externalities to one of food, fibre and sustainable natural and rural systems. We propose a conceptual framework based on the interdependence of humans and nature that recognises multiple forms of capital, and their role in environmental management and community development. Specifically, the 'forms of capital' framework directs attention to the transformational properties of different forms of capital and to the deterministic socioeconomic and political drivers of change. Integrating system governance and stewardship, in conjunction with coordinated, self-adapting processes of research, planning, monitoring and system evaluation, offers a means of improving sustainable management of the complex inter-relationships between people and nature.

AB  - Within the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) framework, a hierarchical model was created considering anthropogenic, genetic and ecological criteria and sub-criteria that directly affect Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)) risk of extinction in central Mexico. The sub-criteria values were standardized, weighted, and ordered by importance in a pairwise comparison matrix; the model was mathematically integrated to quantify the degree of extinction risk for each of the 29 populations present in the study area. The results indicate diverse levels of risk for the populations, ranging from very low to very high. Estanzuela, Presa Jaramillo, Penas Cargadas and Plan del Baile populations have very low risk, with values less than 0.25. On the other hand, Vicente Guerrero, Moran, Minatitlan, La Garita and Tonalapa populations have very high risk (>0.35) because they are heavily influenced by anthropogenic (close to roads and towns), ecological (presence of exotic species and little or no natural regeneration) and genetic (presence of mature to overmature trees and geographic isolation) factors. In situ conservation activities, prioritizing their implementation in populations at most risk is highly recommended; in addition, germplasm collection for use of assisted gene flow and migration approaches, including artificial reforestation, should be considered in these locations.

AB  - Integrated waterbird management over the past few decade has implicitly referred to methods for managing wetlands that usually attempt to enhance habitat for taxonomic groups such as shorebirds and wading birds, in addition to waterfowl, the traditional focus group. Here I describe five elements of integration in management: taxonomic, spatial, temporal, population and habitat, and multiple-use management objectives. Spatial integration Simply expands the Scale of management concern. Rather than emphasizing management on a very limited number of impoundments or wetlands in small refuges or wildlife management areas, the vision is beginning to shift to connectivity within larger landscapes on the order of many square kilometers as telemetry data on daily and seasonal movements for many species become available. Temporal integration refers to the potential for either simultaneous management for waterbirds and commercial "crops" (e.g., crawfish and rice) or for temporally-staggered management such as row crop production in spring-summer growing seasons and waterbird management on fallow fields in the non-growing (winter) season. Integrating population dynamics with habitats has become a major research focus over the past decade. Identifying which wetlands are "sources" or "sinks" for specific populations provides managers with critical information about effective management. Further, the applications of spatially explicit population models place heavy demands on researchers to identify use patterns for breeding and dispersing individuals by age, sex, and reproductive class. Population viability analysis models require much the same information. Finally, multiple-use management integration refers to trying to optimize the uses of wetlands, when only one (perhaps secondary) use may include waterbird management. Depending upon the ownership and primary land use of a particular parcel of land containing wetlands and,, or water bodies, managing for waterbirds may be an "easy sell" (e.g., public natural resource lands) or a very contentious one, where wetlands are created for industrial, aquaculture or urban uses. In the latter case, careful planning and implementation require broad stakeholder participation and education.

AB  - Riparian cottonwood/willow forest assemblages are highly valued in the southwestern United States for their wildlife habitat, biodiversity, and watershed protection. Yet these forests are under considerable threat from climate change impacts on water resources and land-use activities to support human enterprise. Stream diversions, groundwater pumping, and extended drought have resulted in the decline of cottonwood/willow forests along many riparian corridors in the Southwest and, in many cases, the replacement of these forests with less desirable invasive shrubs and trees. Nevertheless, ecophysiological responses of cottonwood and willow, along with associated ecohydrological feedbacks of soil water depletion, arc not well understood. Ecophysiological processes of mature Fremont cottonwood and coyote willow stands were examined over four consecutive growing seasons (2004-2007) near Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. The tree stands occurred near the inlet of a reservoir that was drained in the spring of 2005 and remained empty until mid-summer of 2006, effectively removing the primary water source for most of two growing seasons. Stem sap flux density (J(s)) in cottonwood was highly correlated with volumetric soil moisture (theta) in the upper 60 cm and decreased sevenfold as soil moisture dropped from 12% to 7% after the reservoir was drained. Conversely. J(s) in willow was marginally correlated with theta and decreased by only 25% during the same period. Opposite patterns emerged during the following growing season: willow had a lower whole-plant conductance (k(t)) in June and higher leaf carbon isotope ratios (delta(13)C) than cottonwood in August, whereas k(t) and delta(13)C were otherwise similar between species. Water relations in both species recovered quickly from soil water depletion, with the exception that sapwood area to stem area (A(s):A(st)) was significantly lower in both species after the 2007 growing season compared to 2004. Results suggest that cottonwood has a greater sensitivity to interannual reductions in water availability, while willow is more sensitive to longer periods of soil water depletion. These data shed light on the linkage between soil water deficits and ecophysiological processes of threatened riparian forests given potential land-use and long-term drought impacts on freshwater resources.

AB  - During the previous century, the wetland area in the lower Missouri River alluvial valley was reduced by 39% because of river channelization and bank stabilization projects. The Great Flood of 1993 reversed the trend of wetland loss by creating 466 new wetlands in the alluvial valley between Kansas City and St. Louis, Missouri. We estimated amphibian occupancy, detection probability and number of species exhibiting evidence of reproduction in eight flood-created and 16 pre-flood existing wetlands from 1996 through 1998. We also evaluated whether hydroperiod (the number of days any water was present in a wetland from 20 February through 31 August) and distance to river predicted those values. Detection probabilities for adult amphibian species were relatively constant across years and ranged from 0.013 [Great Plains toad (Anaxyrus cognatus)] to 0.280 [Woodhouse's toad (Anaxyrus woodhousii woodhousii)]. Occupancy of adult amphibians differed across years and was not correlated with habitat features. Estimated occupancy probabilities for amphibian species ranged from 0.126 [Plains spadefoot (Spea bombifrons)] to 0.896 [boreal chorus frog (Pseudacris maculata)]. Almost double the number of amphibian species showed evidence of reproduction in existing wetlands (wetlands created before the Great Flood of 1993) when compared with that in flood-created wetlands. Similarly, temporary wetlands had nearly double the number of amphibian species showing evidence of reproduction when compared with permanent wetlands. Finally, the highest number of species showed evidence of reproduction in wetlands with springsummer hydroperiods between 135 and 140?days. All these relationships suggest that the invasion and persistence of predators in wetlands negatively influence amphibian reproduction. If the Missouri River is allowed to reconnect with the alluvial valley, more predators may be introduced into wetlands, leading to reduced amphibian occupancy and reproduction. However, this connection will not likely occur over the entire alluvial valley and, therefore, should not adversely impact amphibians that find refuge in higher-elevation, non-connected regions of the alluvial valley.

AB  - Given the ongoing decline of many species, it is important to perform multifactorial analyses of conservation status and to assess the effects of species extinction on ecosystem services. In this study, we used long-term surveys to assess the influence of habitat change, landscape alteration and invasive species on extinction risk of the native crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes. We reviewed the existing literature to assess which ecosystem services are threatened by local extinction of A. pallipes and replacement with alien crayfish. We sampled 196 streams and wetlands in northern Italy. Of these, 117 received multiple surveys over a 13-year period (2004-2017), thus allowing accurate measurement of extinction rate. Thirty-four percent of A. pallipes populations underwent extinction between 2004 and 2017. The occurrence of alien crayfish in the catchment basin and urban growth in the landscape surrounding streams were associated with A. pallipes extinction. The probability of persistence was significantly higher in populations close to stream springs and with physical barriers (especially waterfalls) separating them from basins with alien crayfish. Extinction of native crayfish alters community structure and impairs regulating services such as detrital breakdown and pest regulation. Replacement by alien crayfish (Procambarus clarkii and Faxonius limosus) also threatens supporting and regulating services by altering nutrient cycling, food webs, sediments and erosion. The implementation of management practices that control river connectivity using selective barriers is needed to prevent further local extinction of native species. Integrating information on extinction with knowledge of impacts on ecosystem services is essential in developing more effective conservation policies.

AB  - We investigated the abundance of non-indigenous woody invasive plants in Farmington, Maine, a rural New England town in a forested landscape. We found 12 invasive species and more than 7 patches per kin from surveys on 33 transects (54.3 km) along field edges, abandoned railroad right-of-ways, roadsides, and riparian zones. Invasive abundance was apparently lower than for more developed areas of the northeastern US, where, in contrast to western Maine, invasives have extensively penetrated forest interiors. Invasive abundance increased with the amount of landscaping and proximity to town, suggesting a close association between local horticulture and the spread of woody invasives. Invasive abundance and diversity were highest in riparian areas, probably due to relatively high levels of propagule pressure. Species differed in the extent of invasiveness, ranging from those still dependent on planted parent trees to fully invasive populations. The invasive species recorded in this study have caused environmental and economic damage elsewhere. The lower levels of invasiveness in Farmington are likely a result of the isolation, small human population, and forested landscape rather than low levels of invasibility. This suggests the potential for future risks, and the importance of intervention while populations can still be eradicated or controlled.

AB  - Members of the genus Aeromonas that commonly occur in various aquatic ecosystems are taken into account as vectors spreading antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment. In our study strains of Aeromonas spp. (n = 104) not susceptible to ampicillin were isolated from municipal sewage of different levels of purification - raw sewage, activated sludge and treated wastewater. The crucial step of the study was the identification of beta-lactamase resistance genes. The identified genes encode beta-lactamases from 14 families - bla(TEM), bla(OXA), bla(SHV), bla(CTX-M), bla(MOX), bla(ACC), bla(FOX), bla(GES), bla(PER), bla(VEB), bla(KPC), cphA, imiH, and cepH. There were no significant differences in number of identified ARGs between isolation points. Bla(OXA), bla(FOX) variants and, characteristic for Aeromonas genus, metallo-beta-lactamase cphA-related genes were the most commonly identified types of beta-lactam resistance determinants. Moreover, we found four extended-spectrum b-lactamases (bla(SHV-11), bla(CTX-M-27), bla(CTX-M-98), and bla(PER-4)) - and seven AmpC (bla(ACC), bla(FOX-2-like), bla(FOX-3), bla(FOX-4-like), bla(FOX-9), bla(FOX-10-like), and bla(FOX-13-like)) types and variants of genes that had never been found among Aeromonas spp. before. Five of the b-lactamases families (bla(TEM), bla(OXA), bla(FOX), bla(VEB), and cphA) were identified in all three isolation sites, which supports the hypothesis that wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are hot spots of ARGs dissemination. The obtained ARGs sequences share high identity with previously described beta-lactamases, but new variants of those genes have to be considered as well. Characterization of antibiotic susceptibility was performed using disk the diffusion method with 12 different antibiotics according to CLSI guidelines. Over 60% of the strains are unsusceptible to cefepime and chloramphenicol and the majority of the strains have a multidrug resistance phenotype (68%). Finally, analysis of plasmid profiles among the resistant strains showed that 62% of the isolates from all three points of the WWTP carry plasmids of different sizes. Among some of the isolated plasmids bla(FOX-4-like) and blaGES genes have been found. To sum up, the results strongly suggest that Aeromonas spp. can be considered as agents of antibiotic resistance dissemination from wastewater to the natural environment.

AB  - The continuous emergence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) presents a great public health challenge. Mitigation of CPE spread in the environment is crucial, particularly from a One Health perspective. Here we describe the isolation of CPE strain SNI47 from influent water of a sewage treatment plant in Japan. SNI47 was identified as Klebsiella quasipneumoniae subsp. quasipneumoniae by phylogenetic analysis and was resistant to beta-lactams, including carbapenems. Of four plasmids detected from SNI47, the 185,311-bp IncA/C2 plasmid (pTMSNI47-1), which carried 10 drug resistance genes, including genes for four beta-lactamases (bla(CTX-M-2), bla(DHA-1), bla(KHM-1), and bla(OXA-10)), was transferred to Escherichia coli J53 via conjugation. The MICs of all tested beta-lactams for the transconjugant were higher than for the recipient. We constructed recombinant plasmids, into which each beta-lactamase gene was inserted, and used them to transform E. coli DH5 alpha cells, demonstrating that KHM-1 enhanced carbapenem resistance. In addition, these beta-lactamases were responsible for a wide-spectrum beta-lactam resistance acquisition with mutual compensation. KHM-1, recognized as a rare type of metallo-beta-lactamase, was detected in a transferable plasmid, from a sewage treatment plant, involved in horizontal gene transfer. The detection of such plasmids raises a health risk alarm for CPE dissemination.
   IMPORTANCE In our investigation of urban wastewater in Japan, carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella quasipneumoniae subsp. quasipneumoniae was isolated that carried the pTMSNI47-1 plasmid, which carries four beta-lactamase genes and has transferability among Enterobacteriaceae. pTMSNI47-1 was found to encode a rarely reported carbapenemase, KHM-1. Cooperative effects of beta-lactamases encoded by pTMSNI47-1 appeared to have broad-spectrum resistance to beta-lactams. The detection of the KHM-1 gene in urban wastewater suggests that such a rare antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene can be pooled in the environment, potentially emerging as an AMR determinant in a pathogen. When the number of beta-lactamase resistance genes is increased in one plasmid, the transfer of this plasmid can confer broad-spectrum resistance to beta-lactams, even if the individual gene confers narrow-spectrum resistance. The present study adds important information about the potential risk of sewage treatment plants as reservoirs and environmental suppliers of AMR genes, contributing to the public health from a One Health perspective.

AB  - The timing and geomorphological consequences of high-angle normal faulting in the Buyuk Menderes Graben (W Anatolia) is an essential yet poorly studied issue that has been evaluated mostly regarding detachment faulting in the Central Menderes Core Complex. However, this subject has direct concerns related to ongoing debates regarding the level of seismic risk and the response of surface process to active tectonics in the most rapidly extending region in the world. To approach this problem, an integrated scheme was followed that involves the study of late Quaternary stratigraphy, terraces, and ancient and modern civic structures in the Karacasu Graben located on the southern uplifted block of the Buyuk Menderes Graben. Our stratigraphic observations coupled with the existing micro-mammalian fossils demonstrate the widespread occurrence of terrestrial coarse red clastics (Karacasu Formation) before the appearance of the narrow-faulted corridor. The onset of high-angle normal faulting started with gradual denudation through the axial Dandalas Creek and its confluences southward while alluvial sedimentation remained active in the more southern areas of the Karacasu Graben. Ages from surface dating techniques (mainly OSL and cosmogenic radionuclides) show that previous knickpoints determined by the incision/accumulation threshold reached the vicinity of the antique Greek city of Aphrodisias, 30 km from the Buyuk Menderes Valley with a headward erosion rate of 75mky(-1) by the end of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Incision rates derived from terraces and Roman aqueducts in the middle and upper reaches of the basin increased from 1 mmy(-1) (background average geological rate for the last 65 ka) to 3 mmy(-1) in the last 2.3 ka, presumably due to increased population pressure in and around the vicinity of the city of Aphrodisias at the centre of the graben. Modern civic structures such as aqueducts and bridges constructed after the 1970's demonstrate the second wave of incision increased to as much as 10 mmy-1, likely due to increasing human pressure and the mechanisation of farming. On the other hand, inverse extrapolation of the knickpoint progression rate yields a surprisingly younger age of 400 ka for the birth of the new narrow tectonic corridor. This morphotectonic transformation exposed large depositional areas such as Karacasu and Bozdogan grabens to erosion and should have resulted in a significant increase in the sediment supply to BuyukMenderes River. However, seismic investigations in the Aegean Sea have yet to identify the sedimentary record of this tectonic transformation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The energy landscape is experiencing accelerating change; centralized energy systems are being decarbonized, and transitioning towards distributed energy systems, facilitated by advances in power system management and information and communication technologies. This paper elaborates on these generations of energy systems by critically reviewing relevant authoritative literature. This includes a discussion of modern concepts such as 'smart grid', 'microgrid', 'virtual power plant' and 'multi-energy system', and the relationships between them, as well as the trends towards distributed intelligence and interoperability. Each of these emerging urban energy concepts holds merit when applied within a centralized grid paradigm, but very little research applies these approaches within the emerging energy landscape typified by a high penetration of distributed energy resources, prosumers (consumers and producers), interoperability, and big data. Given the ongoing boom in these fields, this will lead to new challenges and opportunities as the status-quo of energy systems changes dramatically. We argue that a new generation of holonic energy systems is required to orchestrate the interplay between these dense, diverse and distributed energy components. The paper therefore contributes a description of holonic energy systems and the implicit research required towards sustainability and resilience in the imminent energy landscape. This promotes the systemic features of autonomy, belonging, connectivity, diversity and emergence, and balances global and local system objectives, through adaptive control topologies and demand responsive energy management. Future research avenues are identified to support this transition regarding interoperability, secure distributed control and a system of systems approach.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly changed people?s ability to recreate in public green spaces, which is likely to exacerbate the psychological impacts of the pandemic. In the current study, we seek to understand whether greenery can support mental health even with insufficient outdoor exposure in times of physical isolation from the outdoor environment.
   Methods: Between 17 May and 10 June, 2020, we conducted an online survey among 323 students (21.99 ? 3.10 years; 31% male) in health-related programs from two universities in the city of Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Severities of depressive and anxiety symptoms over the past two weeks were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale. We employed two self-reported measures of greenery experienced indoors (number of houseplants in the home and proportion of exterior greenery visible from inside the home) and two measures of greenery experienced outdoors (presence/absence of a domestic garden and availability of neighborhood greenery). Restorative quality of the home (the ?being away? dimension of the Perceived Restorativeness Scale; PRS) and the neighborhood (the ?being away? and ?fascination? dimensions of the PRS), engagement with outdoor greenery (frequency of different types of interaction) and perceived social support were treated as mediators. Associations between greenery and mental health were tested using generalized linear regression and logistic regression. Structural equation modelling (SEM) techniques were used to test the theoretically-indicated relations among the variables.
   Results: Clinically-meaningful symptoms of moderate depression and anxiety were reported by approximately 33% and 20% of the students, respectively. The relative abundance of greenery visible from the home or in the neighborhood was associated with reduced depressive/anxiety symptoms and lower depression/anxiety rates. Having more houseplants or a garden was also associated with some of these markers of mental health. As hypothesized, the mental health-supportive effects of indoor greenery were largely explained by increased feelings of being away while at home. Neighborhood greenery contributed to neighborhood restorative quality, which in turn facilitated social support and more frequent engagement with greenery, and that led to better mental health.
   Conclusions: Students who spent most of their time at home during the COVID-19 epidemic experienced better mental health when exposed to more greenery. Our findings support the idea that exposure to greenery may be a valuable resource during social isolation in the home. However, causal interpretation of these associations is not straightforward.

AB  - Hydrogeomorphic (HGM) functional assessment models were used to assess whether function in created wetlands of two ages (1 year old and > 12 years old) was equivalent to that of natural (reference) mainstem floodplain wetlands. Reference wetlands scored higher than both created age classes for providing energy dissipation and short-term surface water storage. Reference wetlands scored higher in maintaining native plant community and structure than 1-year-old sites, and 12-year-old wetlands scored higher than reference sites for providing vertebrate habitat structure. Analysis of individual model variables showed that reference wetlands had greater vegetative biomass and higher soil organic matter content than both created wetland age classes. Created wetlands were farther from natural wetlands and had smaller mean forest patch sizes within a 1-km-radius circle around the site than did the reference sites, indicating less hydrologic connectivity. Created wetlands also had less microtopographic variation than reference wetlands. The 1-year-old created sites were placed in landscape settings with greater land use diversity and road density than reference sites. The 12-year-old sites had a higher gradient and a higher percentage of their surrounding area in urban land use. These results show that the created wetlands were significantly structurally different (if not functionally so) from reference wetlands even after 12 years. The most profound differences were in hydrology and the characteristics of the surrounding landscape. More attention needs to be focused on placing created wetlands in appropriate settings to encourage proper hydrodynamics, eliminate habitat fragmentation, and minimize the effects of stressors to the site.

AB  - The state of Amapa is a federative unit of Brazil, it has a large part of its territory governed by rules for the protection of natural resources, in such a way that it directly interferes in public policies in the cross-border region with French Guiana, French Department in South America. In this way, the study addresses the issue of land situation and the condition on the border between Amapa and French Guiana. The objective of the study was to analyze the characteristics of territorial management at the border, the environmental protection rules, the dynamics and confrontations of strategic actions. The methodological actions were based on data collection, biographical and documentary research techniques with a qualitative research approach. The results obtained identified the complex diversity of interests that affect the territory with the administrative overlap of the territorial management of the federal entity that holds the largest area in hectares of Amapa land, configured as protected areas. Territorial management is conflicting, caused by the inconsistency between the purposes of creating protected areas and the potential inherent in the cross-border corridor, and the third aspect, are the challenges of confrontation in the territorial organization of Amapa that are directly related to the process os strengthening governance, as competent institutions such as communities living in the vicinity of protected areas, do not participate much in improving the indicators of sustainability and social inclusion, and can provide the development inducing the conservation of natural and cultural resources of conservation units for full use in the state of Amapa. The conclusion of the article is that the territorial area where the biodiversity corridor is inserted is the same area where the Amapa cities that integrate the cross-border corridor are inserted, but the plans are not integrated, thus generating fragmented institutional actions.

AB  - Urban and agricultural development has resulted in drastically modified riverine corridors that are often considered to be detrimental to the recovery of anadromous salmonid populations. Although mitigation features (e.g., large wood and shallow-water areas) are frequently incorporated in flood control infrastructure to offset the impacts of streambank stabilization, little is known regarding their effectiveness and the habitat characteristics associated with enhanced nearshore rearing conditions in large rivers. We evaluated two measures of habitat use by emigrating juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha relative to different shoreline types (rock revetment [riprap], mitigated, and natural) and analyzed associations between environmental characteristics and habitat occupancy using a large number of presence/absence samples in the lower Sacramento River, California. We found both measures of habitat use to be significantly higher at natural shorelines and those including mitigation features than at shorelines consisting predominantly of rock revetment. A predictive logistic regression model suggested that the density of woody material and inundated terrestrial vegetation, depth, and substrate type significantly affected habitat occupancy. Despite a moderate predictive capability (62% of correctly classified records in a leave-one-out simulation), the model was useful in identifying habitat characteristics associated with significantly increased habitat use in this large, low-gradient river, most notably the presence of instream cover (wood or vegetation), gently sloping streambanks, fine substrate, and variable nearshore current velocity. Conversely, habitat occupancy by juvenile Chinook Salmon diminished with large, rocky substrate and increased depth, characteristics favored by introduced predatory Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu. This study illustrates the value of incorporating mitigation features and identifies characteristics that enhance habitat use by emigrating juvenile Chinook Salmon.

AB  - Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a carcinogenic compound that is commonly present in groundwater and has been detected in drinking water sources for Mexican towns in the Mexico-US border area. Nitrifying bacteria, such as Nitrosomonas europaea, have been shown to be capable of degrading halogenated compounds, including TCE, but it is difficult to obtain high cell concentrations of these bacteria. The aim of the present study was to generate biomass of a nitrifying bacterial consortium from the sludge of an urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and evaluate its capacity to biodegrade TCE in two different natural lab-scaled packed bed bioreactors. The consortium was isolated by a novel method using a continuous stirred-tank bioreactor inoculated with activated sludge from the Domos WWTP located in Cd. Obregdn, Sonora, Mexico. The bioreactor was fed with specific media to cultivate ammonia-oxidizing bacteria at a dilution rate near the maximum specific growth rate reported for Nitrosomonas europaea. Optical density and suspended solids measurements were performed to determine the culture biomass production, and the presence of inorganic nitrogen species was determined by spectrophotometry. The presence of nitrifying ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) was confirmed by PCR amplification, and biofilm formation was observed by scanning electron microscopy. Batch-scale experiments confirmed the biodegradative activity of the isolated consortium, which was subsequently fixed in an inorganic carrier as zeolite and a synthetic carrier such as polyurethane to both be used as lab-scale packed-bed bioreactors, with up to 58.63% and 62.7% of TCE biodegradation achieved, respectively, demonstrating a possible alternative for TCE bioremediation in environmental and engineering systems.

AB  - The current unprecedented expansion of infrastructure promises to enhance human wellbeing but risks causing substantial harm to natural ecosystems and the benefits they provide for people. A framework for systematically and proactively identifying the likely benefits and costs of such developments is badly needed. Here, we develop and test at the subregional scale a recently proposed global scheme for comparing the potential gains from new roads for food production with their likely impact on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Working in the Greater Mekong-an exceptionally biodiverse subregion undergoing rapid development-we combined maps of isolation from urban centres, yield gaps, and the current area under 17 crops to estimate where and how far road development could in principle help to increase food production without the need for cropland expansion. We overlaid this information with maps summarising the importance of remaining habitats to terrestrial vertebrates and (as examples of major ecosystem services) to global and local climate regulation. This intersection revealed several largely converted yet relatively low-yielding areas (such as central, eastern, and northeastern Thailand and the Ayeyarwady Delta), where narrowing yield gaps by improving transport links has the potential to substantially increase food production at relatively limited environmental cost. Concentrating new roads and road improvements here while taking strong measures to prevent their spread into areas which are still extensively forested (such as northern Laos, western Yunnan, and southwestern Cambodia) could thus enhance rural livelihoods and regional food production while helping safeguard vital ecosystem services and globally significant biological diversity.

AB  - The northern house mosquito Culex pipiens sensu stricto is one of the most important disease vector mosquitoes in temperate zones across the northern hemisphere, responsible for the emergence of West Nile Virus over the last two decades. It comprises two ecologically distinct forms- an aboveground form, pipiens, diapauses in winter and primarily bites birds, while a belowground form, molestus, thrives year-round in subways, basements and other human-made, belowground habitats, bites mammals, and can even lay eggs without a blood meal. The two forms hybridize in some but not all places, leading to a complex ecological mosaic that complicates predictions of vectorial capacity. Moreover, the origin of the belowground molestus is contentious, with iconic populations from the London Underground subway system being held up by evolutionary biologists as a preeminent example of rapid, in situ, urban adaptation and speciation. We review the recent and historical literature on the origin and ecology of this important mosquito and its enigmatic forms. A synthesis of genetic and ecological studies spanning 100+ years clarifies a striking latitudinal gradient - behaviorally divergent and reproductively isolated forms in northern Europe gradually break down into what appear to be well-mixed, intermediate populations in North Africa. Moreover, a continuous narrative thread dating back to the original description of form molestus in Egypt in 1775 refutes the popular idea that belowground mosquitoes in London evolved in situ from their aboveground counterparts. These enigmatic mosquitoes are more likely derived from populations in the Middle East, where human-biting and other adaptations to human environments may have evolved on the timescale of millennia rather than centuries. We outline several areas for future work and discuss the implications of these patterns for public health and for our understanding of urban adaptation in the Anthropocene.

AB  - Environmental contamination by heavy metals (HMs) is a severe problem worldwide, various anthropogenic, industries and agricultural practices contributes to pollution of the environment due to their non-biodegradable nature that considerable effect all resources became increasingly contaminated, threatening land ecosystems, surface and groundwater, as well as food safety and human health. Zawar is a small mining township near Udaipur which is contaminated with heavy metals like zinc, lead, cadmium, nickel, copper, and iron etc. which offer a threat to microbial diversity. This study represents the isolation and morphology characterization of heavy metal tolerant Rhizobacteria from Zawar Mines Area, Udaipur, Rajasthan. Soil samples were collected from five different site of rhizosphere of the plants growing near Zawar mines area, Udaipur, Rajasthan, India. The rhizosphere soil sample from a north Baroi branch of the Zawar Mines area was collected and physico-chemical parameters were analysed. Rhizosphere Soil samples were enriched separately in the nutrient broth supplemented with 100 ppm of HMs (Pb2+, Cd2+ and Ni2+). From enriched broth, serial dilution tubes were prepared and followed by the spread on N-agar plates supplemented with 100 ppm of HMs (Pb2+, Cd2+ and Ni2+). Total 51 rhizobacteria were isolated from Zawar Mines Area and the morphological and colony characteristics of isolated rhizobacteria were noted. These isolates may be useful further for potential agents for bioremediation and in combination with phytoremediation of heavy metals in contaminated soil.

AB  - To reverse the global epidemic of physical inactivity that is responsible for more than 5 million deaths per year, many groups recommend creating "activity-friendly environments."Such environments may have other benefits, beyond facilitating physical activity, but these potential co-benefits have not been well described. The purpose of the present paper is to explore a wide range of literature and conduct an initial summary of evidence on co-benefits of activity-friendly environments. An extensive but non- systematic review of scientific and "gray" literature was conducted. Five physical activity settings were defined: parks/open space/trails, urban design, transportation, schools, and workplaces/buildings. Several evidence-based activity-friendly features were identified for each setting. Six potential outcomes/co-benefits were searched: physical health, mental health, social benefits, safety/injury prevention, environmental sustainability, and economics. A total of 418 higher-quality findings were summarized. The overall summary indicated 22 of 30 setting by outcome combinations showed "strong" evidence of co-benefits. Each setting had strong evidence of at least three co-benefits, with only one occurrence of a net negative effect. All settings showed the potential to contribute to environmental sustainability and economic benefits. Specific environmental features with the strongest evidence of multiple co-benefits were park proximity, mixed land use, trees/greenery, accessibility and street connectivity, building design, and workplace physical activity policies/programs. The exploration revealed substantial evidence that designing community environments that make physical activity attractive and convenient is likely to produce additional important benefits. The extent of the evidence justifies systematic reviews and additional research to fill gaps.

AB  - An extractive industries boom in Africa is driving unprecedented expansion of infrastructure into sparsely populated regions. Much of the investment is in high-volume minerals such as iron and coal that will require heavy infrastructure and large settled workthrces. New roads and railways are being built to support these industries. Mineral infrastructure is reinforcing the dynamic of designated "growth corridors", which are increasingly determining settlement patterns and rural land use in Africa. These corridors are penetrating into areas where agriculture has been constrained by lack of access to markets. They could unleash a major expansion of arable crops in the Guinea and Miombo savannahs, tropical tree crops in Congo Basin rainforests and irrigated agriculture on the floodplains of several African river systems. Rapidly growing African cities are largely dependent on imported food but growth corridors linking them Lo hinterland areas could favour shifts Lo African-sourced foods. Governance weaknesses may allow outside investors to make land grabs along growth corridors and further marginalise poor smallholders. New pressures on environmentally sensitive areas may emerge. Policy changes are needed to avoid negative impacts of this major new development trend and to exploft the potential for poverty alleviation and food-security benefits. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Most Americans are at least three generations removed from the farm, thereby at least three generations removed from the reality of where their food comes from. Not surprisingly, there are many misconceptions about modern food production, including the potential collateral environmental damage attributed to agriculture, particularly the application of pesticides. However, the implication of conventional agriculture in the broader narrative of wildlife species status outcomes (SSOs) lacks context and relativity. Since the dawn of civilization, humans have had a profound impact on their environment. Originating as hunter-gatherer societies, our ancient ancestors initially exploited anything that could be consumed or brought to bear. With the advent of the "first proto-farmers," humans began manipulating their environments to maximize available resources. Urban centers propagated and flourished proximal to agricultural origins, where modern societies have been built primarily on an abundance of food. As societies "developed," and continue to develop, an inevitable economic transition occurs from agriculture to industry/service predominance, culminating in a corresponding shift in land use. Developed countries have typically experienced maximal expansion of the agricultural frontier, where farmland is now steadily eroding by a proverbial flood of urban development. In contrast, in developing countries, this shift in economic development has not yet fully manifested and the agricultural footprint continues to expand at the expense of native habitats. Thus, the relative influence of "agriculture" on SSOs, in terms of land use, is primarily dependent on economic developmental status, which can be, at least in part, ameliorated via technology by increasing yield from existing land. Moreover, in addition to the land use challenge, there are multiple other factors affecting wildlife SSOs, including a figurative plague of invasive species, a literal plague of disease, a barrage of buildings, bumpers, grilles, and windshields to collide with, light pollution to confuse cues with, poachers to contend with, and even more complicated factors such as climate change. Being an easy target does not mean pesticides are the right target, and this fixation can potentially detract from public awareness regarding the primary drivers affecting SSOs as well as the opportunity to proactively address them. So, relatively speaking, how do these other factors compare to "pesticides" in terms of driving SSOs? Moreover, why is the popular media so fixated on the pesticide narrative? Based on the available evidence, this manuscript attempts to address these questions from a holistic and relative perspective within the context of land use change, economic development, population growth, and associated implications of global connectivity and commerce.

AB  - Lake Butrint (39 degrees 47 N, 20 degrees 1 E) is a ca. 21 m deep, coastal lagoon located in SW Albania where finely laminated sediments have been continuously deposited during the last millennia. The multi-proxy analysis (sedimentology, high-resolution elemental geochemistry and pollen) of a 12 m long sediment core, supported by seven AMS radiocarbon dates and Cs-137 dating, enable a precise reconstruction of the environmental change that occurred in the central Mediterranean region during the last similar to 4.5 cal kyrs BP. Sediments consist of triplets of authigenic carbonates, organic matter and clayey laminae. Fluctuations in the thickness and/or presence of these different types of seasonal laminae indicate variations in water salinity, organic productivity and runoff in the lake's catchment, as a result of the complex interplay of tectonics, anthropogenic forcing and climate variability. The progradation of the Pavllo river delta, favoured by variable human activity from the nearby ancient city of Butrint, led to the progressive isolation of this hydrological system from the Ionian Sea. The system evolved from an open bay to a restricted lagoon, which is consistent with archaeological data. An abrupt increase in mass-wasting activity between 1515 and 1450 BC, likely caused by nearby seismic activity, led to the accumulation of 24 homogenites, up to 17 cm thick. They have been deposited during the onset of finely laminated sedimentation, which indicates restricted, anoxic bottom water conditions and higher salinity. Periods of maximum water salinity, biological productivity, and carbonate precipitation coincide with warmer intervals, such as the early Roman Warm Period (RWP) (500 BC-0 AD), the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) (800-1400 AD) and recent times (after 1800 AD). Conversely, lower salinity and more oxic conditions, with higher clastic input were recorded during 1400-500 BC, the Late Roman and the Early Medieval periods (0-800 AD) and during the Little Ice Age (1400-1800 AD). Hydrological fluctuations recorded in Butrint are in phase with most central and western Mediterranean records and correlate with NAO variability. In contrast, opposite hydrological patterns have been recorded in the Eastern Balkans and the Levant during the last millennium, emphasizing a complex spatial variability in the region. Phases of maximum settlement intensity in Butrint (Roman-Late Antique) coincide with warmer and/or stable climate periods (0-800 AD and MCA, respectively), indicating a long-term influence of climatic conditions on human activities. The Late Holocene sedimentary record of Lake Butrint demonstrates the complex interplay of climate variability, tectonics and human impact in the recent evolution of coastal Mediterranean regions.

AB  - This paper presents an example of how agroforestry is practised to satisfy the local people's basic subsistence needs in the isolated Indian Ocean island of Soqotra, Republic of Yemen, south of the Arabian Peninsula. Combined with an arid tropical climate, the harsh seasonal conditions and annual period of isolation have moulded the culture of the Soqotra population, and fostered a traditional approach to land-use, based on the seasonal cultivation of homegardens and ranging of livestock ( mostly goats). The homegardens contain many species of cultivated plants, composed of a wide diversity of plant groups. In addition to food, some cultivated plants provide medicine ( mostly endemic plants such as Aloe perryi, Jatropha unicostata, Commiphora ornifolia), forage for domestic goats, cattle and camels (e.g., Paracalyx sp., Thespesia populnea, Pennisetum purpureum), shade and other aesthetic values ( e. g., Cordia sinensis, Parkinsonia aculeata, Pithecolobium dulce). Most gardens are located around the periphery of towns and villages, with aspects of location, climate, and other ecological parameters carefully considered in their establishment. Homegardens are mostly worked by women, and to a lesser extent by children and men. At present, only a small proportion of Soqotra's population cultivates homegardens. Historically, and up to the present day, there has been little commercial utilisation of the cultivated species. Considerable potential exists for the development and/or expansion of local markets, although the recent increase in supply of produce from the mainland via commercial air delivery may limit such expansion.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict is increasing as urbanization expands and wildlife species adjust to living near people. Translocation is often used to manage human-wildlife conflict because it is considered to be humane, yet fates of translocated animals are largely unknown. As an urban adapter, woodchucks (Marmota monax) are a common source of human-wildlife conflict due to their burrowing, foraging, and scent-marking behavior. We examined survival and movements of 27 nuisance woodchucks captured by a nuisance wildlife operator in the Chicago metropolitan area, radiomarked with internal transmitters, and translocated to exurban release sites mimicking typical practices. We also captured and radiomarked 16 resident woodchucks from the release landscape for comparison. Translocated woodchucks moved farther than residents immediately post release with no evidence of homing and most left the release site. Annual survival did not differ between translocated and resident woodchucks. However, survival was extremely low (0.18) compared to previous estimates for woodchucks, primarily due to high predation by coyotes (Canis latrans). Translocation should be used only when other nonlethal methods are ineffective (e.g., exclusion, removing food sources, selecting unpalatable plants for gardens). When necessary, the practice of translocation could be improved by reducing predation risk for translocated animals, either by selecting release sites with low predation risk, or by using soft-release methods, such as acclimation enclosures or artificial burrows.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation represents the single greatest conservation challenge of the 21st century. This problem is particularly acute for large, obligate carnivores like pumas Puma concolor which have persisted in North and South America in the face of habitat fragmentation and other anthropogenic disturbances. Shrinking habitat and reduced connectivity mean that mapping habitat is increasingly important for species conservation in multiple-use landscapes. Previous work suggests that pumas occupy habitats where sufficient stalking cover and preferred prey are present, yet the intersection of these factors has rarely been assessed. Here we used data from 68 299 camera trap nights collected from 181 sites throughout the San Francisco Bay Area over a four-year period to identify key predictors of habitat occupancy for pumas and their primary prey (mule deer Odocoileus hemionus). Our goal was to determine whether pumas occupy habitats based on relative measures of prey availability (detection frequency), or ease of predation (density of stalking cover) and whether these predictors changed between seasons. Our results indicated that pumas primarily occupied forested habitats and did not choose habitats with abundant deer. Instead, pumas preferentially occupy habitats that facilitate their stalk and ambush hunting strategy, rather than higher prey densities, per se. The best occupancy models for mule deer indicated the importance of roads and shrub cover. However, even the best deer models performed poorly compared to the puma models, likely due to the ubiquity of mule deer in the region. Although prey density is a widely accepted correlate of habitat quality for many carnivores, our results suggest that structural elements of habitat may be a more important variable in predicting habitat use by large stalk and ambush predators like pumas, which has important implications for conservation success.

AB  - Agroforestry and sustainable landscape management are key strategies for implementing the UN-Sustainable Development Goals across the world's production landscapes. However, both strategies have so far been studied in isolation from each other. This editorial introduces a special feature dedicated to scrutinizing the role of agroforestry in sustainable landscape management strategies. The special feature comprises eleven studies that adopt inter- and transdisciplinary perspectives, integrating ecological, agricultural, and socio-economic sciences, and in some cases also practical knowledge. The studies relate to a range of different ecosystem goods and services, and to a diversity of societal sectors (e.g., agriculture, forestry, nature conservation, urban planning, landscape protection) and demands, including their mutual synergies and trade-offs. They inform land-use policy and practice by conceptualizing agroforestry as a set of "nature-based solutions" useful to help tackle multiple societal challenges. The studies encompass four themes: social-ecological drivers, processes, and impacts of changes of agroforestry landscapes; the sustainability outcomes of agroforestry at landscape scale; scaling up agroforestry through multi-stakeholder landscape strategies; and development of conceptual and operational tools for stakeholder analysis in agroforestry landscape transitions. Key steps to harness agroforestry for sustainable landscape management comprise: (i) moving towards an "agroforestry sustainability science"; (ii) understanding local land-use trajectories, histories, and traditions; (iii) upscaling agroforestry for landscape-scale benefits; (iv) promoting the multiple economic, environmental, social, and cultural values of agroforestry; (v) fostering inclusive forms of landscape governance; and (vi) supporting the innovation process of agroforestry system analysis and design.

AB  - A number of forests in agroforestry environments are at risk due to urban development or agricultural expansion. These forests often consist of patches of wooded areas scattered in the agricultural and urban grid, and often constitute green corridors that enable a flow between animal and plant species (migration corridors). This study evaluates the composition and structure of riparian forests in agroforestry areas that are subject to various natural and anthropogenic disturbances. This study aims to understand the dynamics of these riparian forest populations and evaluate the effects of the disturbances on the tree stands (e.g. floods, partial cutting), while taking into account their development over space and time based on a diachronic assessment from 1945 to 2010. Although these woodlands are subject to various disturbances, a fairly large diversity of tree species can be noted, and the regeneration of the saplings and small trees follows a normal growth curve (asymmetric) with a high contingency of young tree population comparable to a typical reverse-J distribution. However, lower densities are observed for riparian stands subject to frequent flooding, which could over time compromise recruitment and forest regeneration for some tree species (e.g. woody plants with weak adaptive strategies). The multivariate analyses (Redundancy Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis) conducted over all the soil, environmental and forest data reveal that some variables are more strongly related to the composition of the forest populations, including pH, ground litter and soil drainage. However, these variables must still be considered as being part of a set of interacting soil conditions. Lastly, the future of these woodlands may appear uncertain because there are no government policies or measures to ensure their protection and preservation.

AB  - Background: For millennia, the southern part of the Mesopotamia has been a wetland region generated by the Tigris and Euphrates rivers before flowing into the Gulf. This area has been occupied by human communities since ancient times and the present-day inhabitants, the Marsh Arabs, are considered the population with the strongest link to ancient Sumerians. Popular tradition, however, considers the Marsh Arabs as a foreign group, of unknown origin, which arrived in the marshlands when the rearing of water buffalo was introduced to the region.
   Results: To shed some light on the paternal and maternal origin of this population, Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation was surveyed in 143 Marsh Arabs and in a large sample of Iraqi controls. Analyses of the haplogroups and sub-haplogroups observed in the Marsh Arabs revealed a prevalent autochthonous Middle Eastern component for both male and female gene pools, with weak South-West Asian and African contributions, more evident in mtDNA. A higher male than female homogeneity is characteristic of the Marsh Arab gene pool, likely due to a strong male genetic drift determined by socio-cultural factors (patrilocality, polygamy, unequal male and female migration rates).
   Conclusions: Evidence of genetic stratification ascribable to the Sumerian development was provided by the Y-chromosome data where the J1-Page08 branch reveals a local expansion, almost contemporary with the Sumerian City State period that characterized Southern Mesopotamia. On the other hand, a more ancient background shared with Northern Mesopotamia is revealed by the less represented Y-chromosome lineage J1-M267*. Overall our results indicate that the introduction of water buffalo breeding and rice farming, most likely from the Indian subcontinent, only marginally affected the gene pool of autochthonous people of the region. Furthermore, a prevalent Middle Eastern ancestry of the modern population of the marshes of southern Iraq implies that if the Marsh Arabs are descendants of the ancient Sumerians, also the Sumerians were most likely autochthonous and not of Indian or South Asian ancestry.

AB  - Objectives: Novel approaches to mental health and suicide prevention are lacking. Converging evidence has shown the effectiveness of horticultural therapy (HT) in improving mental health symptoms, but whether it would reduce suicide risk and contributing risk factors is unknown.
   Design: Using a cohort model, HT was delivered 3.5 h over four weekly, sessions administered by a registered horticultural therapist to veterans with history of suicide ideation or attempt who felt isolated and experienced ongoing environmental stressors with interest in learning new coping strategies. Setting: HT delivery occurred in an urban garden, through a community partnership between the VA (Veterans Administration) and the New York Botanical Garden. Guided by principles of biophilia, participating veterans took part in nature walks, self-reflection and journaling, and planting activities.
   Outcome measures: Stress, mood, pain, and social isolation levels were measured weekly pre-post HT sessions using thermometer scales, with concordant validity to validated clinical instruments.
   Results: Of the 20 men and women with a history of suicide attempts/ideation, HT demonstrated immediate improvements after each session across all symptom domains in magnitude of reduction in stress, pain, mood, and loneliness. The effect sizes were in medium to large range (Cohen's d>.5). Additionally, a single HT session showed a sustained effect over subsequent 2-to-4 weeks as observed by the significantly decreased pre-session thermometer scores in subsequent weeks. Reductions in mood symptoms correlated with decline in suicidal ideation (rs = 0.63).
   Conclusion: HT intervention maybe a promising therapeutic modality for improving overall wellness in suicide prevention in at-risk veteran populations.

AB  - Understanding recent speciation history requires merging phylogenetic and population genetics approaches, taking into account the persistence of ancestral polymorphism and possible introgression. The emergence of a clear phylogeny of hares (genus Lepus) has been hampered by poor genomic sampling and possible occurrence of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) introgression from the arctic/boreal Lepus timidus into several European temperate and possibly American boreal species. However, no formal test of introgression, taking also incomplete lineage sorting into account, has been done. Here, to clarify the yet poorly resolved species phylogeny of hares and test hypotheses of mtDNA introgression, we sequenced 14 nuclear DNA and 2 mtDNA fragments (8205 and 1113 bp, respectively) in 50 specimens from 11 hare species from Eurasia, North America, and Africa. By applying an isolation-with-migration model to the nuclear data on subsets of species, we find evidence for very limited gene flow from L. timidus into most temperate European species, and not into the American boreal ones. Using a multilocus coalescent-based method, we infer the species phylogeny, which we find highly incongruent with mtDNA phylogeny using parametric bootstrap. Simulations of mtDNA evolution under the speciation history inferred from nuclear genes did not support the hypothesis of mtDNA introgression from L. timidus into the American L. townsendii but did suggest introgression from L. timidus into 4 temperate European species. One such event likely resulted in the complete replacement of the aboriginal mtDNA of L. castroviejoi and of its sister species L. corsicanus. It is remarkable that mtDNA introgression in hares is frequent, extensive, and always from the same donor arctic species. We discuss possible explanations for the phenomenon in relation to the dynamics of range expansions and species replacements during the climatic oscillations of the Pleistocene.

AB  - Edge effects are a well-known result of habitat fragmentation. However, little has been published on fragmentation, isolation and the intrusive influence from the surrounding matrix at the landscape level. The objectives of the present study are to evaluate the presence of dogs in the Brasilia National Park (BNP) in relation to habitat type and the influence from the surrounding matrix. In addition, this study examines the response of the native mammal fauna to the presence of dogs. Track stations were built along dirt roads in the BNP and subsequently examined for the presence or absence of tracks. We used a stepwise logistic regression to model the occurrence of five mammal species relative to habitat variables, with an alpha=0.05 to determine whether to enter and retain a variable in the model. A simulation of each species occurrence probability was conducted using a combination of selected habitat variables in a resource selection probability function. Results indicate a negative relationship between distance from the BNP edge and the probability of dog occurrences. From an ecological perspective, the presence of dogs inside the BNP indicates an edge effect. The occurrence of the maned wolf was positively associated with distance from a garbage dump site and negatively associated with the presence of dog tracks. The maned wolf and giant anteater seem to avoid areas near the garbage dump as well as areas with dog tracks. There is no support for the possible existence of a feral dog population inside the BNP, but the effects of free-ranging dogs on the wildlife population in such an isolated protected area must not be neglected. Domestic dog Canis familiaris populations and disease control programs should be established in the urban, sub-urban and rural areas surrounding the BNP, along with the complete removal of the garbage dump from the BNP surroundings.

AB  - An analytical method is presented for the determination of tetra-, penta- and hexacyclic aromatic sulfur heterocyclic compounds (thiaarenes) in workplace air. Using a clean-up procedure for the isolation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and high-resolution gas chromatography with atomic emission detection, selective detection of thiaarenes was possible in the presence of abundant homocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Applying the method to an indoor air sample from an aluminium melting facility, more than 130 sulfur-containing components were detectable of which 53 components were identified as thiaarenes. Quantification of all identified thiaarenes by using one internal standard was possible due to the compound independent sulfur response of an atomic emission detector. The summarized concentration of all sulfur-containing polycyclic aromatic compounds isolated was found to be 12 mu g/m(3). (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Project aims at connecting Rangpo town (Sikkim State) with the existing Sivok Railway Station on N.F. Railway with a Broad Gauge Single Line in West Bengal State. This alignment will cross an area with steep hills, dense forests in the District of Darjeeling (West Bengal State) and East Sikkim (Sikkim State). Landslides are quite common in West Bengala and Sikkim causing relevant damages each year. The Special Publication no. 94 of the Geological Survey of India "An Inventory of Major Landslides in Sikkim-Darjeeling Himalaya" describes 164 major landslides: 32 rock slides, 33 debris slides and 99 complex slides. Landslides generally occur along one or more discrete surfaces and commonly involve earth and/or rock debris or bedrock, although sometimes both the bedrock and the shallow cover are involved. Local geological features and the high intensity of rainfall are the main causes of landslides occurrence. Yearly precipitation in the capital of Sikkim average similar to 3,539 mm, mainly occurring during the monsoon season. This work presents a landslide hazard map produced by combining a number of thematic raster datasets related to the triggering factors of shallow-landslides occurrence: Slope; Cover type; Vegetation; Prevailing mineralogical composition. Operational phases followed to produce the hazard map are the following: Data acquisition; Shallow landslide inventory map for the study area; Definition of unique condition units; Hazard assessment.

AB  - The Detroit River and western Lake Erie, located in the heart of the Great Lakes basin, support a great diversity of fish and wildlife, and their habitats, despite the enormity of habitat losses due to urban development and industrialization. This ecosystem also links Canada and the U.S. who share a long history of cooperative conservation. The river and lake are: at the intersection of two major North American bird migration flyways (i.e., the Atlantic and Mississippi); a significant fish migration corridor; and well recognized for their unique biodiversity. Over the past three decades much has been done to improve environmental conditions and to restore and conserve habitats. This paper reviews habitat management efforts within the environs of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge and provides advice to improve such efforts in the future. Ecological improvements resulting from these habitat projects, as well as the cumulative effects of these changes, have yet to be quantified or evaluated against existing program goals or targets. Habitat management remains a fragmented responsibility among many agencies and interests, which is often an obstacle to realizing ecological improvements, recovery, and sustainability. Moreover, cumulative habitat modifications are not reviewed often enough with respect to their impacts on the goals and targets established in existing programs, as well as their impacts on ecosystem results (e.g., fish or wildlife productivity). Clearly, there is a need to share experiences, synthesize science, learn from mistakes and successes, coordinate activities, and transfer knowledge on best practices and ecological effectiveness of habitat management.

AB  - Purpose
   This paper places a college at the centreof a multi-hazard assessment (earthquake, flood and landslide). The college is within a less studied, rural area of Ladakh, North India. Research focusses on a case study (Students Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL) College), close to Leh, Ladakh, and extends to incorporate/apply thinking from/to the wider Ladakh region. The approach adopted, centring on the hazard assessment of a single entity/local area, allows a rapid uptake of hazard recommendations within a college environment planning to continue its existence for decades ahead. A sister paper (Petterson et al., 2019) documents the active involvement of college staff and students in the principles of geohazard assessment and the development of student-centric hazard assessments of the college and their home village. SECMOL is a self-sufficient, alternative, college, organised along strong environmentally sustainable principles. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This work has adopted different strategies for different hazards. Fieldwork involved the collection of quantitative and qualitative data (e.g. shape and size of valleys/river channels/valley sides, estimation of vegetation density, measurement of sediment clasts, angle of slopes, assessment of sediment character, stratigraphy of floodplains and identification of vulnerable elements). These data were combined with satellite image analysis to: define river catchment character and flood vulnerability (e.g. using the methodology of Collier and Fox, 2003), examine catchment connectivity, and examine landslip scars and generic terrain analysis. Literature studies and seismic database interrogation allowed the calculation of potential catchment floodwater volumes, and the collation of epicentre, magnitude, depth and date of seismic events, together with recent thinking on the return period of large Himalayan earthquakes. These data were used to develop geological-seismic and river catchment maps, the identification of vulnerable elements, and disaster scenario analyses.
   Findings
   This research concludes that SECMOL, and much of the Ladakh region, is exposed to significant seismic, flood and landslide hazard risk. High magnitude earthquakes have return periods of 100s to c. 1,000 years in the Himalayas and can produce intense levels of damage. It is prudent to maximise earthquake engineering wherever possible. The 2010 Leh floods demonstrated high levels of devastation: these floods could severely damage the SECMOL campus if storms were centred close by. This study reveals the connectivity of catchments at varying altitudes and the potential interactions of adjacent catchments. Evacuation plans need to be developed for the college. Northern ridges at SECMOL could bury parts of the campus if mobilised by earthquakes/rainfall. Slope angles can be lowered and large boulders moved to reduce risk. This work reinforces recommendations that relate to building quality and urban/rural planning, e.g. using spatial planning to keep people away from high-risk zones.
   Practical implications - The frequency of hazards is low, but potential impacts high to very high. Hazard mitigation actions include engineering options for hazardous slopes, buildings to be earthquake-proofed, and evacuation management for large floods.
   Originality/value
   Methodologies undertaken in this research are well-tested. Linkages between disciplines are ambitious and somewhat original. The application of this work to a specific college centre site with the capacity to rapidly take up recommendations is novel. The identification of catchment inter-connectivity in this part of Ladakh is novel. This work complements a sister paper (Petterson et al., 2019) for community aspects of this study, adding to the novelty value.

AB  - The black yeast Exophiala dermatitidis is known as a rare etiologic agent of neurotropic infections in humans, occurring particularly in East and Southeast Asia. In search of its natural habitat, a large sampling was undertaken in temperate as well as in tropical climates. Sampling sites were selected on the basis of the origins of previously isolated strains, and on the basis of physiological properties of the species, which also determined a selective isolation protocol. The species was absent from outdoor environments in the temperate climate, but present at low abundance in comparable habitats in the tropics. Positive outdoor sites particularly included faeces of frugivorous birds and bats, in urban as well as in natural areas, Tropical fruits were found E. dermatitidis positive at low incidence. Of the human-made environments sampled, railway ties contaminated by human faeces and oily debris in the tropics were massively positive, while the known abundance of the fungus in steam baths was confirmed. On the basis of the species' oligotrophy, thermotolerance, acidotolerance, moderate osmotolerance, melanization and capsular yeast cells a natural life cycle in association with frugivorous animals in foci in the tropical rain forest, involving passage of living cells through the intestinal tract was hypothesized. The human-dominated environment may have become contaminated by ingestion of wild berries carrying fungal propagules

AB  - Portland's Brookside Wetland and Stream Enhancement project is intended to exemplify a multi-objective approach to urban stream corridor management by providing numerous environmental benefits on one site. These include improvements such as augmented flood storage (the overriding objective of the project), streambank erosion control, and improved habitat conditions for fish.
   This paper focuses on the rehabilitation efforts undertaken along the approximately 0.8 kilometers (1/2 mile) of Johnson Creek traversing the project site. Before rehabilitation, the meandering channel was entrenched into a generally level floodplain as much as 4.5 meters (15 feet) and had rapidly eroding banks in many places. The channel also provided relatively limited habitat opportunities for salmonid fishes (which survive in small numbers in the creek), for which most inchannel habitat rehabilitation work was targeted.
   An important aspect of the project was the regrading of oversteepened channel banks to a lower, stable angle. Established streamside trees were preserved wherever possible and many additional riparian trees and shrubs will be planted this year and in 1998. Since soils are highly erodible, regraded channel banks were lined with coir matting to protect them until herbaceous vegetation can take hold. Biotechnical bank stabilization along eroding outer bend banks relied on vegetated geogrid treatments. These were constructed over a hardened bank toe comprised of large boulders and interspersed root wads. A unique bank cover/log crib revetment was also installed along a constructed channel cutoff. This provides a long section of artificial undercut bank, an extremely valuable type of fish habitat. Other improvements to fish habitat included the placement of large woody debris and boulders in the low-flow channel. All treatments will enhance channel complexity, providing both winter and summer holding habitat for fish.
   Excavation, grading, and the construction of streambank stabilization and instream habitat structures occurred during the summer of 1997. The author's experience in providing construction oversight highlighted a number of issues pertaining to the on-the-ground implementation of the project. Some of these are discussed in this paper.

AB  - Extraction of viral DNA/RNA from environmental samples as part of the analytical procedure in quantifying waterborne viruses, is of great importance. In this study, two commercially available kits were compared to assess their performance, the MO BIO PowerViral Environmental DNA/RNA Isolation kit and the Qiagen QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit. A performance assessment of extraction kits for detecting and quantifying six human enteric viruses as the commonest waterborne pathogens and one plant virus as an alternative fecal indicator has been carried out using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Water samples were collected from seven sites in Singapore during March and April 2015. In general, a strong association was observed between two different viral DNA/RNA extraction kits and detection frequency of targets (P = 0.017). The Qiagen kit showed higher extraction efficiency than the MoBio kit. However, in terms of quantification, a significant difference was only observed in the occurrences of NoV GI and PMMoV between two different kits (P < 0.05), although the kits showed similar efficiency removing qPCR inhibitors. The Qiagen kit was preferred for routine water quality monitoring.

AB  - The entire region of Vojvodina (region in northern Serbia) is an agricultural - steppe - forest zone. The area of Vojvodina covers 2,150,000 ha of which arable land is 1,579,643 ha (73,45 %). Total forested area is about 130,000 ha or 6% of the total area. At present, all the ecosystems (agro and forest ecosystems), in this region are highly endangered. This is the consequence of local and global economic activities after 1945, which altered societies relationship with the natural environment (Bouma et al., 1998). The soils in Vojvodina are affected by aridification, acidification, eutrophication and pollution. As a region with highly productive agricultural soil, it is subject to and endangered by, different destructive processes, primarily wind erosion, that is climatic extremes, because of which its maximal productive potential cannot be utilised. Wind erosion, as a very destructive factor, causes the detachment and transport of the most fertile particles of the arable topsoil, permanently changing its fertility properties. In addition droughts might also reduce yield. This is multiplied by potential effects of climate changes. Environmental improvement is only possible by integral understanding of urban, non-urban and green spaces, rural landscapes, protective green areas, diversity in agro-ecological areas and protected areas. That is why afforestation is planned over almost 100,000 ha by the establishment of different types of forest plantations and other plantations, such as greenways, shelterbelts, bee-keeping plantations, buffer plantations, eco-corridors, etc. By the implementation of planned afforestation, it could be possible to increase the yield in agriculture, timber production, protection against wind, to improve the environmental conditions, production of honey, development of hunting, sports, recreation tourism and sustainable land use.

AB  - Perylene is a frequently abundant, and sometimes the only polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) in aquatic sediments, but its origin has been subject of a longstanding debate in geochemical research and pollutant forensics because its historical record differs markedly from typical anthropogenic PAHs. Here we investigate whether perylene serves as a source-specific molecular marker of fungal activity in forest soils. We use a well-characterized sedimentary record (1735-1999) from the anoxic-bottom waters of the Pettaquamscutt River basin, RI to examine mass accumulation rates and isotope records of perylene, and compare them with total organic carbon and the anthropogenic PAH fluoranthene. We support our arguments with radiocarbon (C-14) data of higher plant leaf-wax n-alkanoic acids. Isotope-mass balance-calculations of perylene and n-alkanoic acids indicate that similar to 40% of sedimentary organic matter is of terrestrial origin. Further, both terrestrial markers are pre-aged on millennial time-scales prior to burial in sediments and are insensitive to elevated C-14 concentrations following nuclear weapons testing in the mid-20th Century. Instead, changes coincide with enhanced erosional flux during urban sprawl. These findings suggest that perylene is definitely a product of soil-derived fungi, and a powerful chemical tracer to study the spatial and temporal connectivity between terrestrial and aquatic environments.

AB  - The wetland ecosystem along a river in a coastal region has great significance in purifying water bodies, regulating climate, and providing habitat for animals and plants. Studying the effects of human disturbances on the landscape patterns of wetlands is of great significance to the protection and management of an ecosystem. This study used Guannan County and Guanyun County, two counties in China that are located on both banks of the Xinyi River as the study area. The spatiotemporal characteristics of the landscape pattern evolution of wetlands and their relationship with human interference from 2009 to 2020 were analyzed by the landscape dynamic rate, landscape conversion matrix, landscape indices, human disturbance index, and the quadratic regression equation. The results showed that: (1) Except for the increase in the area of beach and paddy fields, the area of other landscape types decreased; (2) the changes in wetlands were heterogeneous and showed different trends in different regions; (3) the boundary shape's complexity and the landscape pattern's fragmentation showed a decreasing-increasing trend and the connectivity and the diversity of the landscape decreased; and (4) the human disturbance index increased from 2009 to 2014 and then decreased from 2014 to 2020, declining outward from the places where towns and construction land aggregated. Moreover, there was an inverted U-type relationship with the landscape pattern indices. The findings provide direct, specific, and explicit information and theoretical guidance for the protection of wetlands along the river in the coastal region as well as for the restoration of wetland ecosystem function and the improvement of wetland biodiversity in relevant regions.

AB  - River Restoration represents an important domain for water authorities in Europe, especially due to the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/CE which aims at improving the status of rivers ecosystems in a broad, integrated, ecological perspective and to the new Flood Directive. Development of infra-structure projects associated with power supply, abstractions, waste disposal and both rural and urban land-use can all have impacts on the river systems and they threat the bio-diversity and sustainability of flora and fauna including the fish populations. Barriers to fish migration have profound consequences for hydrology and habitats, revering fisheries and upstream and downstream migration of fish. Flood protection is one of the key driving forces causing river and habitat continuity interruption in the Romania country. In Romania there are a small number of fish's passes in four river basins. Most structures, including large barrages, flood-control dams, sluices, flood gates etc., have been built for floods control, water conservation during dry periods, for hydropower, irrigation, for safety or for water supply.
   This paper focuses on ecological solutions for the fish migration, representing a limited effort related to the achievement of a good ecological status for the heavy modified bodies. Connectivity is crucial in the context of restoration. From a list of 788 reservoirs, only 77 dams/weirs were analyzed, being characterized by surface area above 50 ha and height of the dams until 15 m.
   The study case has been identified taking into account several criteria such as: the historical fish zone, the present monitoring fish data and the ecological prioritization criteria recommended by the International Commission for the Danube River Protection. The paper presents the ecological solution for the Abramut Crestur reservoir, created in 1976 year, after the sluicing of the Fancica river (total length: 25 km, surface: 100 km(2)) from the Cris River basin. The reservoir is situated in an agriculture area, characterized by low flows and two species of migratory fishes: Barbus barbus and Chondrostoma nasus. Before the embankment the floodplain provided an important habitat and food source (marshland and wet zone covered with reed) for migratory birds and fishes.
   The proposed ecological solution is to restore natural hydrological functions of the Fancica River by creating a lateral "natural bypass channel" for the fish, on the left side of the reservoir, all along the reservoir. Taking into account the neighborhoods of the dams it is enough space for the construction of the fish passes in "cascade", being equipped with artificial or natural obstacles such as weirs, stone-blocks and alluvial material mimicking a natural watercourse. The slope of such fish facility will be very slow, and long enough for providing resting areas for the fish. This way the proposedfish way could be an important means of redressing the detrimental effects of obstructions.

AB  - Bat surveys were conducted during 2006 and 2007 in the Willoughby Local Government Area (LGA) in the northern suburbs of Sydney to determine the occurrence and movement of microbats. Based on the frequency of bat detections and the direction of bat movements, two major and five minor bat flyways were identified in the study area. The two major flyways were north south movement corridors that occurred on the eastern and western margins of the LGA; each major flyway had minor flyways branching from them. The two major flyways were separated from each other by the Pacific Highway rise that runs north south through the centre of the study area. The rise acts as an effective flyway barrier as tree corridors are completely disrupted by an exposed, noisy, night-illuminated residential and commercial strip. Minor bat flyways approach the Pacific Highway rise from the east and west and are only separated by a relatively short distance. Extending these flyways to create an east west passage across the study area would greatly extend the foraging range of bats on either side of it. In order to link the major flyways, the eastern and western minor flyways need to be extended by the creation of a continuous tree canopy through residential areas to the Pacific Highway rise. Controlled street planting and supported private plantings of trees along strategic routes, together with modified street lighting could achieve this result. The crossing of the Pacific Highway would require the construction of a lightweight "flyover bridge" that commenced and ended in the extended tree canopies. This would provide a wind and light shielded crossing point for bats attempting to fly east west across the Willoughby LGA. The components of the "flyover bridge" are discussed along with other considerations in achieving an effective extended flyway through a densely populated residential area.

CP  - 5th International Conference on Environmental Odour Monitoring and Control
AB  - An increasing complaint situation on odour nuisance in the cities Mainz and Wiesbaden in the Rhine corridor brought the ministries of the two German counties Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate to the decision that comprehensive field measurements are necessary to determine the real impact situation. The Olfasense GmbH (formerly Odournet GmbH) conducted this huge field inspection on behalf of the ministries. The measurement area of around 7.500.000 m(2) was covered with a grid of 157 measurement points and 100 grid cells. Over half a year a panel of 21 assessors conducted field measurements and assigned the occurring odours to 15 defined odour characters.
   The article will describe the advantages of the used web technology in comparison to the former proceeding with paper registration of odours especially due to the quick access to the results during the whole investigation period. This has several benefits for the local authorities and plant operators. It will present the results of the measurements according to prEN16841-1 and the Guideline on Odour in Ambient Air (GIRL) as well for the complete odour situation as for single odour characters. In parts the results showed a clear exceedance of the German limit values (allowed frequency of odour perception) for living areas. We will provide a discussion on the influence of odours of different sources and different characters occurring in the same period of time (odour hour) and the attempt to relate this to the effects on the citizens.

AB  - Manor parks are characteristic objects in the agricultural landscape of Poland. Lack of proper management after World War II, however, led to their devastation from a cultural point of view, but may allow the regeneration of rare and endangered species. The aim of our study was to determine if the presence of forests in the vicinity of manor parks will work as an accelerator of the regeneration process of oak-hornbeam and ancient forest species. Phytosociological analyses were conducted in manor parks adjacent to forests and not adjacent to the forest as well as natural forests. The total number of plant species, number and percentage share of ancient forest species, and plant species consistent with oak-hornbeam habitat were analyzed using a GLM model. Characteristic species were identified using detrended correspondence analysis. Parks adjacent to forests and natural forests showed higher numbers of total species, ancient forest species, and oak-hornbeam species compared with parks not adjacent to forests, but there were no differences in percentage shares of ancient forest species and oak-hornbeam species. For all three types of studied objects, characteristic species could be identified. We conclude that adjacent forests allow greater regeneration of ancient forest species and oak-hornbeam forest species in manor parks.

AB  - Diachronic analysis with a GIS-based classification of land-use changes based on aerial photographs, orthophotos, topographic maps, geotechnical reports, urban plans, and using landscape metrics has permitted insight into the driving forces responsible for landscape fragmentation in the Mont Saint-Hilaire (MSH) Biosphere Reserve over the period 1958-2015. Although the occurrence of exogenous factors, such as extreme weather and fires, can have a significant influence on the fragmentation of the territory in time and space, the accelerated development of the built environment (+470%) is nevertheless found to be primarily responsible for landscape fragmentation and the loss of areas formerly occupied by orchards, agriculture, and woodlands. The landscape metrics used corroborate these results, with a simplification of the shape of polygons, and once again reveal the difficulties of harmonizing different land uses. MSH has become somewhat of a forest island in a sea of residential development and agriculture. To counter this isolation of fragmented habitat components, forest corridors have been proposed and developed for the Biosphere Reserve and particularly for the core area. Two corridors, to the north and south, are used to connect the protected area and other wooded areas at the regional scale, in order to promote genetic exchange between populations of various species. In that regard, the forest buffer zone around the hill continues to play a key role and has great ecological value for species and ecological preservation and conservation. However, appropriate management and landscape preservation actions should recognize and focus on landscape composition and the associated geographical configuration.

AB  - Characterizing time intervals between successive fires in the recent history is of main interest for fire hazard prevention and sustainable environmental management as it indicates what the typical fire return interval for each type of ecosystem is. We tested the extent to which fire return intervals (FRIs) depend on fuel type and age, and we compared FRI values between two fire-prone areas of south-eastern France (Provence). These areas had similar weather and roughly similar fuel types but fuels occurred in patches with different sizes and shapes in the landscape. We built a fire database (1960-2010) and we fitted Weibull distributions of FRI in order to compute the probability density function and the hazard of burning. Our results indicate maximal probability of burning again for shrublands (garrigues and maquis), and minimal values for mixed broadleaf-conifer forests and broadleaved forests. Most fuel types of Provence showed no effect of fuel age on the probability of burning again. Only the unmanaged maquis showed a linear increase of fire hazard in time due to a rapid postfire fuel build up. Rather long fire-free intervals and low age-dependency for most forest fuels of Provence suggest that reducing their biomass may not be sufficient to reduce fire risk. In contrast, the flammable shrublands have rather short fire return intervals and represent a high fire hazard for the whole study area. The two areas had statistically significant difference of fire return intervals for a same fuel type (e.g. 18-22 years for shrublands, 20-24 years for pine forests, and 24-27 years for oak forests). This suggested that size, shape and connectivity of fuels play a major role in the probability of burning again and should be taken into account for fire management. The present policy of fire prevention puts efforts into public information and prevention, and preferential management of fuels at risk in the vicinity of roads and wildland-urban interfaces where fires occur preferentially. However, fire suppression may also take advantage of favouring low-flammable fuels with low age-dependency on strategic places in the landscape. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular pathogen thought to be widely distributed in the environment. We investigated the prevalence and characteristics of L. monocytogenes isolates from surface waters derived from catchments within the South Nation River watershed (Ontario, Canada). This watershed is dominated by urban and rural development, livestock and crop production, and wildlife habitats. From June to November 2005, a total of 314 surface water samples were collected biweekly from 22 discrete sampling sites characterized by various upstream land uses. Presumptive Listeria spp. were isolated using a selective enrichment and isolation procedure, and 75 L. monocytogenes isolates were identified based on colony morphology, hemolytic activity, and amplification of three pathogenicity genes: iap, inlA, and hlyA. Thirty-two of 314 (10%) surface water samples were positive for the presence of L. monocytogenes, but detection ranged between 0 and 27% depending on the sampling date. Isolates belonging to serovar group 1/2a, 3a (50%) and group 4b, 4d, 4e (32%) were dominant. L. monocytogenes populations were resolved into 13 EcoRI ribotypes and 21 ApaI and 21 AscI pulsotypes. These had Simpson indexes of discrimination of up to 0.885. Lineage I-related isolates were dominant (61%) during the summer, whereas lineage 11 isolates were dominant (77%) in the fall. Isolates were, on average, resistant to 6.1 +/- 2.1 antibiotics out of 17 tested. Half of the L. monocytogenes isolates exhibited potential virulence linked to the production of a functional internalin A, and some isolates were found to be moderately to highly virulent by in vitro Caco-2 plaque formation assay (up to 28% of entry). There was a statistically significant link between the occurrence of L. monocytogenes and proximity to an upstream dairy farm and degree of cropped land. Our data indicate that L. monocytogenes is widespread in the studied catchments, where it could represent a public health issue related to agricultural land use.

TI  - THE TOWN OF PAG - AN EXAMPLE OF A 15TH CENTURY "REAL TOWN"
T2  - PROSTOR
LA  - Croatian
AB  - The town of Pag, situated on the homonymous island in North Dalmatia is a unique example of a completely planned urban space whose construction started in 1443. In the course of the following thirty years, it mainly witnessed the execution of the final design stages which included the construction of town walls. They represent an original example of urban planning which has been well attested by archival documents. The creation of this new town, Citta Nouva, was said to have been prompted by the decision to relocate a smaller settlement called Old Pag which had been during the Trecento the centre of the insular community due to ancient salt plants built within the spacious bay in the centre of the uninhabited side of the island. The prehistoric and ancient Roman settlements with the capital Cissa were situated in a fertile valley further to the north, whereas Novalia contemporary Novalja, was a settlement which developed during late antiquity exclusively as a sea port. The ethno-political changes that occurred during the early Middle Ages led to the abandonment of these settlements since the development of commerce on the Adriatic coast and in its hinterland stimulated construction of salt plants which came to be in the end of the 14th century the biggest salt plants in the Croatian Littoral. Important natural resources were the reason the area was desired by Zadar, the town that in many respects presented competition to Venice. In order to defend themselves from constant military upsurges, the islanders of Pag voluntarily consented to the protection offered by Venice and in 1409 the island became part of Venice's Stato del Mar. This meant colonial dependence of the island of Pag on the imperial power of Serenissima, but also encouragement to the economic growth of the local community.
   Due to a misfortunate position of Old Pag, its community decided to move closer to the salt plants, which was also in the interest of Venice in that it eagerly wanted to keep its monopolistic position in salt trade. The establishment of New Pag was therefore approved by the Venice dodge and it took place on the site which was compared to that of Old Pag more appropriate for organized life of the community and maritime connection to the main centre of the Venetian Republic. According to written sources the foundations of St Mary's Church and of the main fort near the entrance to the town from the port were laid in 1443. Both buildings were built on the site which was soon after divided into four unequal quarters of the future town. The town was constructed gradually, but the planimetry of the site clearly shows that all components necessary for the town's functions were rationally planned from the very beginning. Particularities of the net-like system of streets attest primarily to the axial communication between the salt plants in the east and the port in the western part of the town, while the cardo of the transversally positioned Strada magna form the cross shaped plan with a square in the centre. Although geometrically completely irregular, the quadrangle space comprises the most important facilities for urban life: the Rectors' palace and the tower with a public clock positioned diagonally to the largest church and facing the communal loggia later on destroyed, situated on the opposite side of the parish church, and the Bishop's palace which never saw completion. Residential quarters were built in blocks composed of rows of axially attached private houses and perpendicularly positioned to the main road which was at places double-laned. In the northern section of the town the blocks were formed by two densely built rows of small houses, clearly intended for lower classes. In contrast, the rows in the southern section are double in size since they contained more spacious houses with back yards belonging to richer families. This social stratification was already established in the very cadastre which also confirms the morphological quality of the architecture although lagging behind the architectural achievements in other towns of the Venetian province of Dalmatia.
   The urban features of Novi Pag, congruent in typology to the town-colonies related to semi-industrial production, have been attested by the modest fortified walls which entirely surrounded the town. Their irregular pentagonal shape with each side adjusted to the terrain and defence strategy formed a ring around the town. The western side of the fortification retracted towards the town centre providing thus better protection of the port with the most strongly built corner forts. The south side faced the salt plants with warehouses and controlled the approaching space in front of them together with the western, shorter and functionally most neutral side. The longest, northern side protruding in a triangle-like formation contained a town gate facing the island fields. The walls of the fortification containing an interior corridor were easily and quickly accessible in case of enemy attacks.
   A more thorough analysis of town planning and design, which can be detected in the present urban core of Pag, reveals detailed rational approach to urban development guided by the politics of organized local administration and strategy of the powerful state authorities. If observed from within that context, a question might arise about the true origin of Pag which seems to be the centre of the enigma including arrivals of the most significant artists of the Croatian Quattrocento to Pag as well as interpretations of Pag as the precursor of the Renaissance ideal town. Attempting to dispel such misconceptions, this text draws attention to fragmentary records of terrain measurement performed by Venetian military engineers by which Citta Nuova was divided into quarters. Subsequently, in 1460, the galley commander Andrea Buon made the measurement of the wider are of the town. The fact that the Senate of the Venetian Republic for years allotted 300 ducats for the construction of Pag and even controlled land exchange supports the premise that the Venetian centralist state had a decided role in conceiving the initial urban project of Pag. The execution of the concept design must have been handed to the local authorities and aristocrats who commissioned builders from southern Adriatic towns. The most esteemed among them, Giorgio Mathei Dalmaticus, had until 1466 participated as a building contractor in the construction of the fortification, while other building work was done by his collaborators among who there was not a single foreigner. That is the reason the entire architectural heritage of Pag, with unsubstantial number of sculptural works conforms to the artistic character of the coastal Croatia. The paper further supports the view that New Pag should be valued as an exceptional example of "real town" adapted to the achievements of mature humanism in the Eastern Adriatic without insisting on stylistically defining it in terms of Renaissance which has been attempted, though questionably, in the history of urban theory and practice.

AB  - Background: Anthropogenic habitat disturbance is a prime cause in the current trend of the Earth's reduction in biodiversity. Here we show that the human footprint on the Central African rainforest, which is resulting in deforestation and growth of densely populated urban agglomerates, is associated to ecological divergence and cryptic speciation leading to adaptive radiation within the major malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In southern Cameroon, the frequency of two molecular forms-M and S-among which reproductive isolation is strong but still incomplete, was correlated to an index of urbanisation extracted from remotely sensed data, expressed as the proportion of built-up surface in each sampling unit. The two forms markedly segregated along an urbanisation gradient forming a bimodal cline of similar to 6-km width: the S form was exclusive to the rural habitat, whereas only the M form was present in the core of densely urbanised settings, co-occurring at times in the same polluted larval habitats of the southern house mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus-a species association that was not historically recorded before.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results indicate that when humans create novel habitats and ecological heterogeneities, they can provide evolutionary opportunities for rapid adaptive niche shifts associated with lineage divergence, whose consequences upon malaria transmission might be significant.

AB  - The introduction of rabies virus (RABV) to barrier islands, which are often popular tourist destinations with resource-rich habitats and connectivity and proximity to the mainland, is especially concerning because it can easily become endemic due to factors like dense rabies-vector populations (e.g., raccoons [Procyon lotor]), high inter-and intraspecies contact rates, and anthropogenic activities such as supplemental feeding of feral cats (Felis catus). In January 2013, a neurologic raccoon found on the Jekyll Island (JI), Georgia, US causeway tested positive for rabies. Mortality investigations of 29 raccoons have been conducted between December 2012-May 2017. The two most common diagnoses were RABV (n = 11) and canine distemper virus (CDV; n = 8). Parvoviral enteritis was diagnosed in four raccoons but no coinfections were diagnosed. There was no apparent seasonality for rabies cases, but all CDV cases occurred in spring-fall. Most (64%) rabies submissions came from residential or recreational use areas located near feral cat feeding stations. Jekyll Island is a popular destination where tourists engage in numerous outdoor activities which facilitate human-wildlife interactions. Concerns regarding public and animal health highlight the importance of rabies surveillance, prevention, and control on islands. This is the first report of rabies on JI and emphasizes the importance of disease investigations because the assumption that neurologic raccoons have CDV, an endemic pathogen, can miss the establishment of novel pathogens such as RABV.

AB  - The Primorje Gorski Kotar County is situated between Dalmatia, Central Croatia and Slavonia. The Bay of Kvarner (Port of Rijeka) is well connected with the Pannonian valley with the traffic routes passing through the Kupa River valley. The Primorje Gorski Kotar County is especially important when considering inland traffic connections between the Pannonian and the Adriatic territories, as well as for the traffic connection of the Mediterranean with the Central European territories. The nodes of the main road and railway traffic routes (Branch of the corridorVb and the Adriatic Ionian motorway), road, railway, sea and air traffic terminals are all concentrated in the Rijeka agglomeration. This fact, along with the relief characteristics of the coastal area and its abundant biodiversity characterize the complexity of the problem with regard to the solution of the overall traffic node.
   The complexity and management of individual traffic infrastructure segments at different administrative levels along with the spatial development of the area require a certain level of coordination and solution to the conflicts within the overall traffic network of the area.
   The already existing, planed elements of individual traffic networks are linked into an agglomerate of defined and composite traffic networks (road, railway, sea, air traffic etc.), and along with all adjoining elements (zones used for traffic etc.) form and integral traffic node the Rijeka node, which includes public and individual traffic, i.e. passenger and cargo traffic. An integral network of passenger and cargo traffic in the Rijeka node had to be outlined, as an element of development according to the spatial planning principles as well as general goals of overall development of the Primorje Gorski Kotar County. The aim of the Study was a long term and integrated definition of development of the Rijeka traffic node.

AB  - In recent years populations of howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata) in southeastern Mexico have decreased substantially due to the transformation and loss of natural habitats. This is especially evident in the Santa Marta mountain range, Veracruz, Mexico where several studies have evaluated the impact of fragmentation on howler monkey populations in order to propose management programs for their conservation. The conditions generated by fragmentation likely change the rates of parasitic infection and could decrease howler survival. In this study, gastrointestinal parasite species richness, prevalence, and egg density of infection were determined in howler groups inhabiting five forest fragments at the Santa Marta mountain range. Two hundred and seventy-eight fresh fecal samples were collected between October 2002 and April 2003. Three parasite species were found during the dry and the wet season in all forest fragments sampled: one unidentified species of Eimeriidae; Topanoxyuris minutus (Oxyuridae); and Controrchis biliophilus (Dicrocoeliidae). Both the prevalence of T. minutus and infection density for all parasites differed between seasons and fragments (the largest fragment consistently differed from other fragments). Host density, distance to the nearest town, fragment size, fragment shape, and total basal area of food trees explained parasite prevalence, but each species had a different pattern. Although parasite richness was lower, prevalence and density were higher than values reported for howlers in conserved forests. These results suggest that the establishment of biological corridors and animal translocation programs must take into account the parasite ecology of each fragment to avoid higher infection rates and preclude potential consequent mortality.

AB  - Brazil is the third world largest maize producing country, and Parana state is the second largest producer state of this essential crop in this country. The bacterial microbiota of cereal grains depends on the environment where they were grown, handled, and processed - and it can influence plant growth and food safety. The industrial enzymes market is rapidly increasing around the globe, and new producer microorganisms are in demand. Hydrolases correspond to 75% of all industrial enzymes. Considering the dearth of information about maize bacterial microbiota in Brazil and that this microbiota might produce hydrolases for degrading maize grains biomolecules, we examined the bacteria of maize grains within a region of Parana state and looked for hydrolytic enzymes producers. Harvest leftover dried maize ears presenting rotting symptoms were collected from three different farms in two towns of the North Central region of Parana state. The ears were threshed, and a grain portion of each ear was incubated in peptone water. Aliquots of this suspension were diluted and inoculated in nutrient agar. Individualized and morphologically diverse colonies were transferred to selective media containing starch, microcrystalline cellulose, skimmed milk, or triolein. Halo development around the bacterial colonies was representative of hydrolase production. Isolates (n = 137) presenting hydrolytic activity were stored, and their biochemical profile was analyzed. Fifty-five isolates that had unique biochemical characteristics were chosen to be molecularly identified by DNA barcoding. A phylogenetic tree showed that most of the bacterial strains belonged to the phylum Proteobacteria, but some also were from the phyla Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. Some of the isolated species had already well-characterized enzymes. However, new producers were also found, including amylase producing isolate of Massilia timonae and a lipase producing isolate of Pantoea dispersa.

AB  - Prescribed fires are conducted extensively in pine-dominated forests throughout the Eastern USA to reduce the risk of wildfires and maintain fire-adapted ecosystems. We asked how fire behavior and fuel consumption during prescribed fires are associated with turbulence and energy fluxes, which affect the dispersion of smoke and transport of firebrands, potentially impacting local communities and transportation corridors. We estimated fuel consumption and measured above-canopy turbulence and energy fluxes using eddy covariance during eight prescribed fires ranging in behavior from low-intensity backing fires to high-intensity head fires in pine-dominated forests of the New Jersey Pinelands, USA. Consumption was greatest for fine litter, intermediate for understory vegetation, and least for 1 + 10 hour wood, and was significantly correlated with pre-burn loading for all fuel types. Crown torching and canopy fuel consumption occurred only during high-intensity fires. Above-canopy air temperature, vertical wind velocity, and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) in buoyant plumes above fires were enhanced up to 20.0, 3.9 and 4.1 times, respectively, compared to values measured simultaneously on control towers in unburned areas. When all prescribed fires were considered together, differences between above-canopy measurements in burn and control areas (Delta values) for maximum Delta air temperatures were significantly correlated with maximum Delta vertical wind velocities at all (10 Hz to 1 minute) integration times, and with Delta TKE. Maximum 10 minute averaged sensible heat fluxes measured above canopy were lower during low-intensity backing fires than for high-intensity head fires, averaging 1.8 MJ m(-2) vs. 10.6 MJ m(-2), respectively. Summed Delta sensible heat values averaged 70 +/- 17%, and 112 +/- 42% of convective heat flux estimated from fuel consumption for low-intensity and high-intensity fires, respectively. Surprisingly, there were only weak relationships between the consumption of surface and understory fuels and Delta air temperature, Delta wind velocities, or Delta TKE values in buoyant plumes. Overall, low-intensity fires were effective at reducing fuels on the forest floor, but less effective at consuming understory vegetation and ladder fuels, while high-intensity head fires resulted in greater consumption of ladder and canopy fuels but were also associated with large increases in turbulence and heat flux above the canopy. Our research quantifies some of the tradeoffs involved between fire behavior and turbulent transfer of smoke and firebrands during effective fuel reduction treatments and can assist wildland fire managers when planning and conducting prescribed fires.

AB  - Hydrotechnical activities on the Slupia river above the town of Slupsk (northern Poland) were performed against floods in the valley. The results based on the data on fauna and flora gathered before (in 2003, T+0) and after (in T+2, T+6 and T+11) the reclamation showed that the river canalization and oxbow lake dredging can significantly disturb the ecology of water bodies adjacent to the river. Observations of the oxbow lake (OLS5), showed the decrease in the number of macrophyte phytocenoses from 11 before the dredging to 6 very valuable Potametea phytocenoses, after wards. The development of common pleustonic phytocenoses of Lemnetea minoris and the massive development of green algae resulted from the bottom sediment removal. In the case of population, Stratiotes aloides was rebuilt after elimination during dredging already in T+2. Before hydrotechnical works, the oxbow lake was characterized by 12 invertebrate taxa inhabiting S. aloides, whereas only 9 were found first period after the dredging, 15 taxa in second period and 23 in a recent study. During both observation periods, dominated by Chironomidae larvae (T+0), Trichoptera larvae (T+2 and T+6) and again Chironomidae larvae (T+11). The hydrotechnical activities significantly altered in the first period the structure of fauna and flora inhabiting the water body. Such radical interference in natural values of oxbow lakes is un-suitable for the preservation of ecosystems due to the significant decrease in their biodiversity. Achieved on a similar or higher level of macrophytes diversity and epiphytic invertebrates was noticeable ten years after the dredging of a water body.

AB  - The alteration of aquatic ecosystems and increasing aquarium fish trade with exotic species is promoting the presence and invasion of these species in large river systems, with the consequent loss of native biodiversity and the homogenization of aquatic systems. The Chontalcuatlan-Amacuzac hydrological system belonging to the biogeographical province of the Balsas River is one of the main regions in Mexico devoted to the breeding and rearing of aquarium fish, where the improper handling of these organisms has caused their escape to adjacent hydrological systems and, together with urban and industrial pollution, are changing schemas and levels of regional biodiversity. As a first approximation to determine these effects, we evaluate a segment of 140 km of this hydrological system through surveys in 12 sites during the time of major climatic and flow stability, and relating environmental variables with the distribution and abundance of fish. Also, the structure of fish assemblages was assessed by means of similarity and multivariate statistical methods (correspondence and principal components analysis), and these assemblages were found to be segregated by a thermal gradient. Exotic fish were dominant in conditions of low environmental quality, while native species were restricted to areas with better quality of water and geographic isolation. Exotic taxa such as Amatitlania nigrofasciata, Pterigloplictys disjunctivus, Pterigloplictys pardalis, Poeciliopsis gracilis and Heterandria bimaculata, have achieved the degree of invasive due to the fact that they are distributed of abundant manner in the entire hydrological system.

AB  - 1. Sea turtles are globally endangered, and face daily anthropogenic threats, such as direct take, by-catch, and habitat degradation. Current research efforts on sea turtles in the South China region mainly focus on captivity and husbandry, haematology and blood chemistry, and nesting ecology. Published information on the marine habitat use of wild populations is limited. 2. This situation therefore creates a pressing need for scientific research on freeranging sea turtles as a foundation for habitat management and species protection in South China. In this study, habitat use and oceanic movement of nesting, and bycatch or stranded green turtles, were determined by satellite tracking combined with home-range analysis. 3. Coupled with previous findings, the foraging grounds of several sea turtle species (green turtle Chelonia mydas, hawksbill turtle Eretmochelys imbricata and loggerhead Caretta caretta) were mainly distributed along the coasts of Hainan Island Province and Guangdong Province, mainland China, as well as Taiwan and the Philippines, and the outlying islands in the South China Sea and East China Sea. 4. Habitat hot spots and migratory corridors of green turtles, in particular nesting turtles in South China, were identified. Coastal waters near Wanning City of Hainan Island, the eastern Leizhou Peninsula, Iriomote-jima and Ishigaki-shima of the Ryukyu Islands of Japan, and Dao Bach Long Vi of Vietnam serve as foraging grounds for nesting green turtles from different origins in South China. Moreover, the Paracel (Xisha) and the Pratas (Dongsha) Islands in the South China Sea, Huidong Gangkou, and its vicinity in mainland China, and Liouciou Island and Penghu Island of Taiwan contain both nesting sites and foraging grounds for green turtles. 5. The sites that are associated with migratory corridors, in particular Hainan Island, eastern Leizhou Peninsula, and Liouciou Island, which currently lack conservation plans for sea turtles, should be given higher priority for habitat and species protection.

AB  - The AMS technique was applied to analyse black carbon (BC), total organic carbon (TOC), and previously reported polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in PM10 aerosols from a residential area, suburban Tokyo, to determine natural abundance of radiocarbon (C-14), an ideal tracer to distinguish fossil fuel (C-14-free) from modern biomass combustion sources of pyrolytic products. The C-14 concentrations in BC, isolated using the CTO-375 method, were 42% and 30% pMC (in terms of percent Modern Carbon: pMC) in summer and winter, respectively. The C-14 concentrations in BC were also compared with those of compound-class specific C-14 content of PAHs previously reported for the same samples: they were 45% and 33% pMC in summer and winter, respectively. The C-14 signals of BC were identical to those of high molecular weight (MW >= 226, 5-6 rings) PAHs. The resemblance between C-14 signals of BC and PAHs can be referred as a 'certificate' for the validity of the BC isolation method employed in this study. Also, it suggests that C-14-BC approach can be a surrogate for PAHs specific C-14 analyses to monitor seasonal source variation of combustion-derived pyrolytic products. On the other hand, C-14 contents of total organic carbon in 2004 were 61% and 42% pMC in summer and winter, respectively. This is likely attributed to higher contribution of plant activity in summer.

AB  - In total, 93,532 female mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) were captured in traps placed in subterranean (catch basin), ground (approximate to 1.5 m above ground), and canopy (approximate to 7.0 m above ground) habitats in Stamford and Stratford, CT, during 2003-2005. Culex pipiens L. was the most abundant (64.8%) of the 31 species identified. Significantly greater numbers of Cx. pipiens were captured in canopy-placed mosquito magnet experimental traps, and significantly greater numbers were collected in catch basin-placed (Centers for Disease Control) CDC traps than in CDC traps placed elsewhere. Culex restuans Theobald was captured in significantly greater numbers in traps placed in catch basins. Aedes vexans (Meigen), Aedes cinereus Meigen, and Aedes cantator (Coquillett) were significantly more abundant in ground traps, In total, 429 isolations of West Nile virus (WNV) were made from seven species of mosquitoes from late June through the end of October during 2003 through 2005. Three hundred ninety-eight (92.8%) isolates were from Cx. pipiens. Others were from Cx. restuans (n = 16), Culex salinarius Coquillett (n = 5), Ae. vexans (n = 4), Ae. cantator (n = 3), Aedes triseriatus (Say) (n = 2), and Ae. cinereus (n = 1). Multiple isolates from Cx. pipiens were made each week, primarily during the later part of July through the end of September. Weekly minimum infection rates (MIRs) were lower in 2004 (highest weekly MIR = 7.1) when no human cases were reported in Connecticut in comparison with 2003 and 2005 (highest weekly MIR = 83.9) when human cases were documented. Frequencies of infected pools were significantly higher in Cx. pipiens captured in traps in the canopy and significantly higher in catch basin placed traps than in traps at ground level. The physiological age structure of Cx. pipiens captured in the canopy was significantly different from that of Cx. pipiens collected in catch basins. Invariably, Cx. pipiens captured in the canopy were nulliparous or parous with ovaries in Christophers' stage 2, whereas 58.7% of the females captured in catch basins possessed ovaries filled with mature oocytes in Christophers' stage 5. Our results suggest that females in the canopy are seeking hosts, and after digestion of the bloodmeal and development of mature oocytes, they descend to catch basins for shelter and deposition of eggs. WNV was isolated from three, one, and two pools of male Cx. pipiens captured in catch basin-, ground-, and canopy-placed traps, respectively, and from six nulliparous Cx. pipiens females collected in the canopy. Weekly MIR ranged from 1.2 to 31.1 per 1,000 male specimens. These data show that mosquitoes become infected by means other than by blood feeding, possibly by transovarial transmission. The placement of traps in tree canopies and in catch basins can be used to augment current practices of placement of traps near the ground for surveillance of mosquitoes infected with WNV and for studies of the ecology of WNV.

AB  - Alluvial and colluvial sequences were studied around the prehistoric tell Arslantepe in 11 exposures and additional auger cores. The chronology is based on 11 optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages, four radiocarbon ages, and the embedded artifacts. Sediments contained wood charcoals, providing information on former vegetation. Fluvial activity is documented during Late Glacial times (15.4 +/- 2.5, 12.8 +/- 3.1kyr) and frequently after Roman times. Slope and soil erosion occurred in the early (10.6 +/- 1.4, 8.2 +/- 0.7kyr) and mid-late Holocene (6.7 +/- 0.9, 5.4 +/- 0.7-4.7 +/- 0.7, 2.6 +/- 0.2-2.5 +/- 0.2, 1.9 +/- 0.2-1.8 +/- 0.2kyr, and during the last 1000 years). The early Holocene erosion phases pre-date the so far established onset of settlement at the tell. This either indicates an earlier onset of agricultural land use than assumed or climatic influence on erosion, such as the 10.3 and 8.2kyr climate events known from Western Europe. The erosion phases at around 5.0 and 2.6kyr could reflect geomorphic responses to societal collapse (Late Chalcolithic state, Neo-Hittite kingdom) at Arslantepe. Most intensive Holocene soil erosion and landscape degradation occurred after occupation of the region by the Roman Empire. This is paralleled by the onset of river activity. A part of the lower neo-Hittite town as well as an early Holocene Terra Rossa-like soil that had formed rapidly were found buried. So far, no indication for mid-late Holocene fluvial activity of the adjacent creeks until Roman times has been found. Our results illustrate the large potential of slope deposits for long term reconstructions of human induced landscape transformation in Anatolia.

AB  - The goals of landscape planning are multiple for rural ecosystems of the resettlement area in the Hubei Province of China. They relate to the types, diversity and patterns of the ecosystems, and to the conservation of ecosystem functions and biodiversity. We were interested in the improvement of socio-economic conditions, and the promotion of the development of farmland ecosystems and natural forest ecosystems. The landscape planning took into account the conservation and the restoration of forestlands, and the reconstructions of farmlands, towns and villages. The areas of towns and villages were assigned by trade-off analysis balancing ecological, economic and social benefits. The spatial pattern of used lands was designed by a multi-criteria optimal spatial planning, resulting in the strengthening of some primary ecosystem functions. In the resettlement area forests will expand to a matrix, and cropland patches together with tree fences will form patch-corridor systems. Significant ecological, economic and social benefits can be derived from this landscape pattern.
