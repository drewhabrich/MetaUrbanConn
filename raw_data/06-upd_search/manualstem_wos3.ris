AB  - Remote sensing techniques were used to detect the heat islands over the Romanian region, based on multi-temporal Meteosat Second Generation, Land Surface Analysis Satellite Applications Facility/ Land Surface Temperature products (MSG LSASAF/LST). A method was proposed for the rapid and accurate mapping of heat island areas based on the combinational use of normalized land surface temperatures. In order to do it, the IDL routines developed locally have been used. It was studied 2976 LSA-SAF/LST images acquired during the period of August 2008 and it were used to calculate LST parameters. The LST values from 15 August 2008 were used to detect expansion and heat islands changes over the Romanian region. The LST product has a temporal resolution of 15 minutes. The LST values can be determined, theoretically, 96 times per day.
   One of the main causes of urban heat island phenomenon are buildings and streets/pavements which accumulate heat during day time and release it at night, back into the atmosphere, warming the area. As a consequence of the heat accumulation, the air temperature is higher inside buildings, particularly in inner spaces of residential and commercial buildings with poor thermal isolation. In order to assure an adequate interior temperature, the overall energy consumption for cooling (i.e. refrigeration and air-conditioning) becomes higher, hence increasing the energy production by power plants, meaning more costs to citizens and inducing significant economic impacts. Thermal rehabilitation of the buildings is a proven solution to decrease the energy consumptions for cooling and helps to the improving of the interior comfort for the occupants.

AB  - Lakes are invaluable archives of past ecosystem changes, and this study focuses on one of the largest freshwater lakes in the western US. At 380 km(2), Utah Lake is the third-largest freshwater lake in the USA west of the Mississippi River. Adjacent to an urban corridor, it is an important resource for surrounding communities as well as being impacted by them. Recently, large harmful algal blooms have drawn attention to its ecosystem health, and a rapidly growing population and recent lengthy drought continue to stress the lake. Its sedimentary record is an important archive of human impacts to ecosystems. Three freeze cores were obtained in 2019 to investigate environmental changes and human impacts since European settlement began in similar to 1850. After establishing core chronologies using Pb-210, Cs-137 and correlation, proxies investigated included pollen, C- and N-isotopes, nutrients (C, N, and P), and heavy metal abundances. Low C:N ratios indicated that organic matter budget was dominated algae rather than plant debris. Discernable increases in nutrients began in the mid-twentieth century, whereas increases in Pb began as early as similar to 1900. Nutrient increases were related to agricultural runoff and variably treated sewage effluent, whereas heavy metal loading was due to heavy industry (iron and steel), coal combustion, and urban runoff. Over the last several decades, nutrient and metal loadings have stabilized, indicating a steady state has been reached. Gains in nutrient removal from effluent have been offset by growing populations and decreases in heavy industry and coal combustion have been countered by urbanization. Overall, the lake has been continually oxic, with possible episodes of anoxia during algal blooms. This study also provides a measure of pre_Eurpopean ecosystem health using geochemical baselines in order to establish reasonable water-quality standards.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems of the world, playing an important role in coastal defense and wildlife conservation. These ecosystems, however, are usually affected by human activities, which may cause a loss and degradation of their ecological status, a decline of their biodiversity, an alteration of their ecological functioning, and a limitation of their ecosystem services. La Pletera salt marshes (NE Spain) are located in a region mainly dominated by agriculture and tourism activities. Part of these wetlands and lagoons has been affected by an incomplete construction of an urban development and in this moment is the focus of a Life(+) project, whose aim is to restore this protected area. Several studies have analyzed the role of hydrological regime in nutrients, phytoplankton and zooplankton in this area, however, the role of groundwater was never considered as a relevant factor in the lagoon dynamics, and its influence is still unknown. In this study, the hydrogeological dynamics in La Pletera salt marshes has been analyzed, as a basis to set sustainable management guidelines for this area. In order to determine their dependence on groundwater resources, monthly hydrochemical (with major ions and nutrients) and isotopic (delta O-18(H2O) and delta D) campaigns have been conducted, from November 2014 to October 2015. In particular, groundwater from six wells, surface water from two nearby streams and three permanent lagoons, and sea water was considered in these surveys. Taking into account the meteorological data and the water levels in the lagoons, the General Lake Model has been conducted to determine, not only evaporation and rainfall occurring in the lagoons, but also the total inflows and outflows. In addition, the Gonfiantini isotopic model, together with equilibrium chemical-speciation/mass transfer models, has been used to analyze the evaporation and the physicochemical processes affecting the lagoons. Results show that during the dry season groundwater inputs may account for 15-80% of the water in La Pletera lagoons. Besides, water salinity depends on two main processes: 1) mixing of fresh and sea water occurring within the lagoons or in the aquifer; and 2) evaporation. According to the obtained results, the goal of preserving La Pletera lagoons and their salinity conditions implies maintaining groundwater fluxes towards the ocean, and also the hydraulic connectivity of these lagoons with the aquifer.

AB  - Background: The mite Ornithonyssus bursa is a bloodsucking parasite of domestic and wild birds and it is typical of tropical regions. On the host it can cause considerable loss of blood and lesions with intense itching. Cases of parasitism in human beings have been reported causing dermatitis, and most of these cases are due to the presence of nests of synanthropic birds near of the residences, When in large infestations or lack of hosts, the mites leave the nests to perform the parasitism in humans. Human infestation occurs mainly in people who handle infected birds and nests, or when happen the dispersion of these mites, through some path which lead to the interior of homes, factories and hospitals.
   Case: The present case occurred in November of 2008, when one of the dwellers of an apartment on the fourth floor of a building downtown in Santa Maria, woke up with pruritic lesions over the arms and legs. Upon inspection of the bedroom, several mites were seen, measuring almost a millimeter long, coming out of a pipe of a portable air conditioner installed on site. They were already scattered by the inside walls, floor and bed. The mites were collected and maintained in 70% alcohol for later identification.
   After the clarification the slides mounting were performed, and the mites with measure between 0,48 mm wide by 0,74 mm long were classified by the position of the anal opening, formed by the dorsal plate and three pairs of bristle on the sternal plate, as belonging to the species Ornithonyssus bursa.
   On external outlet of the air portable conditioner, a nest with a couple of birds and three cubs was found. The birds were identified as belonging to the species Myiodynastes maculatus, popularly known as brindle Bem-Te-Vi. The birds were removed from the place and treated with antiparasitic macrolactones to control the infestation.
   Discussion: In the present case report the O. bursa was found inside of an apartment in the downtown area, parasitizing birds which had their nest sheltered in the outlet air of a portable air conditioner. The presence of synanthropic bird brindle Bem-Te-Vi and the ease of access to the interior of the residence led to a home infestation of this ectoparasite. This fact may be happend due to the nesting of birds in urban buildings, seeking for a favorable environment for their survival, specially near of local that providing heat, like heaters, furnaces and hot water pipes.
   When the young birds parasitized by hematophagous leave the nests, the mites can cause the parasitism in humans mainly by food shortage. In the present study the occurrence of accidental home infestation and accidental parasitism in humans is related to the presence of many specimens of birds in the same nest, with offering of food and favorable environmental conditions for reproduction of the mites and their dissemination.
   Mite infestations in humans are characterized by erythematous papulovesicles distributed throughout the body, mainly on the limbs and chest. In this case report the parasitism caused erythematous lesions, especially in the arms with intense itching. The dermatitis produced by mesostigmatas hematophagous mites are not specific impeding the diagnosis, and may be confusing with other ectoparasites. For this reason the present diagnosis was performed by isolation and identification of the mite.
   Based on the description above it was possible to conclude that the bird Myiodynastes maculatus are parasitized by the mite Ornithonyssus bursa and its synanthropic habits allowed the infestation of mites in this residence.

AB  - Asian elephants are threatened throughout their range due to habitat loss, fragmentation, and conflict with humans. Limited data on spatial and temporal use of habitats in largely intact forests by elephants in Sumatra is a major hindrance for conservation and land use planning, and consequently human-elephant conflict mitigation. We analysed GPS data from collared elephants to investigate their use of habitat in relation to available land cover and human disturbance in Aceh, Sumatra, Indonesia. We applied remote sensing techniques to extract environmental variables to use in state-space Hidden Markov Models and integrated Step Selection Function to analyse foraging strategies and land use selectivity, while using dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models and Minimum Convex Polygons to determine used and available habitat features within their home ranges. Our results show that Sumatran elephants in Aceh preferred areas with lower elevation (< 200 m) and slopes (0-10 degrees), with minimal terrain ruggedness, which also happen to be areas selected by humans. Elephants closely adhered to rivers and mountain valleys when utilizing homogenous dense natural forests, and expanded from the rivers in heterogenous forests toward open, resource-dense, land use types. Overall, slope, vegetation, and human disturbance had the largest impact on each of the clans' foraging strategies. Areas closer to human settlements were used more by night and less by day, indicating that human presence and activities influence elephant habitat use and avoidance. Our findings conclude future management decisions should focus on protecting the remaining lowland forests and preventing further urban encroachment in areas with lower elevation and slope, particularly in proximity to rivers which act as corridors between natural habitats, in order to mitigate human-elephant conflict and protect the species from extinction.

AB  - We investigated patterns of moth occurrence among habitats in two different landscapes surrounding roosts of the endangered Ozark big-eared bat (Corynorhinus townsendii ingens) from May to August 2005, and compared these data with published results on the diet of this subspecies. Landscapes were situated in the Ozark Mountains, USA, and consisted of a fragmented, agricultural landscape and a contiguous national forest. We captured 8720 moths constituting >= 314 species and 22 families. Pastures demonstrated a lower abundance and richness of moths than other habitats in the fragmented landscape (p < 0.05). Neither abundance nor richness of moths varied by habitat in the forested landscape, but we did observe variation among roost locations (p < 0.05). Abundant families of moths (n >= 100 specimens captured) did vary in abundance among habitats in both landscapes (p < 0.05), with poletimber stands, riparian forest and upland forest selected, and pasture, forest edge, sawtimber and sapling stands avoided by at least one family of moths. Density and richness of woody plant species were correlated with the occurrence of moths at sampling sites. We recommend maintaining habitat heterogeneity around roosts of the Ozark big-eared bat to encourage an abundance and richness of moth prey, and suggest that forested riparian corridors are important habitat elements for Ozark big-eared bats foraging in fragmented landscapes.

AB  - Internet of Drones (IoD) is an efficient technique that can be integrated with vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) to provide terrestrial communications by acting as an aerial relay when terrestrial infrastructure is unreliable or unavailable. To fully exploit the drones' flexibility and superiority, we propose a novel dynamic IoD collaborative communication approach for urban VANETs. Unlike most of the existing approaches, the IoD nodes are dynamically deployed based on current locations of ground vehicles to effectively mitigate inevitable isolated cars in conventional VANETs. For efficiently coordinating IoD, we model IoD to optimize coverage based on the location of vehicles. The goal is to obtain an efficient IoD deployment to maximize the number of covered vehicles, i.e., minimize the number of isolated vehicles in the target area. More importantly, the proposed approach provides sufficient interconnections between IoD nodes. To do so, an improved version of succinct population-based meta-heuristic, namely Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) inspired by food searching behavior of birds or fishes flock, is implemented for IoD assisted VANET (IoDAV). Moreover, the coverage, received signal quality, and IoD connectivity are achieved by IPSO's objective function for optimal IoD deployment at the same time. We carry out an extensive experiment based on the received signal at floating vehicles to examine the proposed IoDAV performance. We compare the results with the baseline VANET with no IoD (NIoD) and Fixed IoD assisted (FIoD). The comparisons are based on the coverage percentage of the ground vehicles and the quality of the received signal. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IoDAV approach allows finding the optimal IoD positions throughout the time based on the vehicle's movements and achieves better coverage and better quality of the received signal by finding the most appropriate IoD position compared with NIoD and FIoD schemes.

AB  - Protected areas are crucial for biodiversity conservation because they provide safe havens for species threatened by land-use change and resulting habitat loss. However, protected areas are only effective when they stop habitat loss within their boundaries, and are connected via corridors to other wild areas. The effectiveness of protected areas is threatened by development; however, the extent of this threat is unknown. We compiled spatially-detailed housing growth data from 1940 to 2030, and quantified growth for each wilderness area, national park, and national forest in the conterminous United States. Our findings show that housing development in the United States may severely limit the ability of protected areas to function as a modern "Noah's Ark." Between 1940 and 2000, 28 million housing units were built within 50 km of protected areas, and 940,000 were built within national forests. Housing growth rates during the 1990s within 1 km of protected areas (20% per decade) outpaced the national average (13%). If long-term trends continue, another 17 million housing units will be built within 50 km of protected areas by 2030 (1 million within 1 km), greatly diminishing their conservation value. US protected areas are increasingly isolated, housing development in their surroundings is decreasing their effective size, and national forests are even threatened by habitat loss within their administrative boundaries. Protected areas in the United States are thus threatened similarly to those in developing countries. However, housing growth poses the main threat to protected areas in the United States whereas deforestation is the main threat in developing countries.

AB  - Crown gall disease caused by Agrobacterium tumefaciens (Smith and Townsend) Conn. is one of the most destructive diseases in stone fruit nurseries in Himachal Pradesh. Extensive surveys were carried out in the four stone fruit growing districts of the state and isolations of the causal organism was carried out to ascertain the prevalence of different biovars. Different isolates were subjected to biochemical tests viz., 3-ketoglycoside test, acid production from erythritol, growth on Schroth et al medium, growth at 35 degrees C and reaction to litmus milk. All the isolates tested positive to biovar 1 tests indicating that biovar-1 of Agrobacterium tumefaciens is widely prevalent in Himachal Pradesh infecting stone fruit plants in nurseries.

AB  - In the early 20th century when it was discovered that the yellow fever virus was transmitted in its urban cycle by Aedes aegypti, measures of control were introduced leading to its disappearance. Progressive neglect of the disease, however led to a new outbreak in 1927 during which the etiological agent was isolated; some years later a vaccine was discovered and yellow fever disappeared again. in the 1960s, rare cases of encephalitis were observed in young children after vaccination and the administration of the vaccine was forbidden for children under 70 years. Five years later a new outbreak of yellow fever in Diourbel, Senegal, was linked to the presence of Aedes aegypti. in the late 1970s, the idea of a selvatic cycle for yellow fever arose. Thanks to new investigative techniques in Senegal and Cote d'Ivoire, the yellow fever virus was isolated from he reservoir of virus and vectors. The isolated virus was identified in monkeys and several vectors: Aedes furcifer, Aedes taylori, Aedes luteocephalus. Most importantly the virus was isolated in male mosquitoes. Until recently he only known cycle had been that of Haddow in East Africa. The virus circulate in the canopea between monkeys and Aedes africanus. These monkeys infect Aedes bromeliae when they come to eat in banana plantations. This cycle does not occur in West Africa.
   Vertical transmission is he main method of maintenance of the virus through the dry season, "Reservoirs of virus" are often mentioned in medical literature, monkeys having a short viremia whereas mosquitoes remain infected throughout their life cycle. in such a selvatic cycle, circulation can reach very high levels and no child would be able to escape an infecting bile and yet no clinical cases of yellow fever have been reported. The virulence - as it affects man - of the yellow fever virus in its wild cycle is very low.
   In areas where he virus can circulate in epidemic form, two types of circulation can be distinguished. intermediate yellow fever - a term coined to define epidemia which do not correspond exactly to urban yellow fever The cycle involves men and monkeys through wild vectors as Aedes furcifer but also through Aedes aegypti and the mortality rate is much lower than for urban epidemics. in urban yellow fever man is the only vertebrate host involved in he circulation of the virus, the vector being generally Aedes aegypti. This vector maintains a selective pressure, increasing the transmission of viruses capable of producing high viremia in man.
   In the selvatic cycles, two cycles can be distinguished: one of maintenance which does not increase he quantity of virus in circulation and one of amplification which does increase this quantity. As we shall see, it develops into an epizootic form but also in an epidemic form in man. When the decrease in yellow fevers across Africa is considered, it appears that ail major epidemics occur in West Africa inspite of the presence of wild cycles of the yellow fever virus in Central and East Africa. For the rare epidemics that have occurred here, the vector has never been Aedes aegypti, in a recent outbreak in Kenya, the vector was Aedes bromeliae. The examination of part of the gene encoding for envelope protein showed the presence of two geographical types corresponding to West-Africa and Central East-Africa.
   Clinically speaking, yellow fever is an haemorrhagic fever with hepatitis similar to other haemorrhagic fevers such as Rift Valley fever When, in 1987, an outbreak of haemorrhagic fever occurred in southern Mauritania, for several days it was thought to be yellow fever Four days later the diagnosis was corrected by isolating and identifying the virus as that of Rift Valley fever (RVFV). RVFV causes several pathogenic syndromes in human beings: acute febrile illness, haemorrhagic fever haemorrhagic fever with hepatitis, nervous syndromes or ocular disease. Mortality rate was high for haemorrhagic fever with hepatitis, reaching 36%.
   Epidemiological investigations in the field showed the importance for transmission to man of direct contact with animals. in northern Senegal, the isolation of RVFV six years alter the outbreaks caused by Aedes vexans and Aedes ochraceus would seem to indicate the maintenance of the virus in the same place by transovarial transmission in mosquitoes.
   Such data are very important for the prevention of human diseases.

AB  - When attempting to address the environmental problems of a catchment, it is important to consider changes in a long-term environmental context. However, the long-term data on the state of the environment that are required for such an examination are rarely documented. Such data collection typically requires several years of investigation and observation. In addition, as there may be a significant time lag between the occurrence of a phenomenon and its cause, subsequent environmental investigations of changing animal and plant states scaling up to 5 years may be inadequate. We conducted a long-term analysis of the environmental changes in five sub-catchments of the Nagara River, Japan, assessing a period of 30 years, using a questionnaire survey approach involving local communities. Four sub-catchments of the Yoshida River were also analyzed for comparison. In addition, we attempted to clarify the relationship between various environmental factors and the space-time response of animals and plants. The survey included eight topics: assumed information, hydrological characteristics, habitat conditions for living things, forest state, land cover conditions, river awareness, free-entry information, and respondent information. Our method also has academic significance in that it validates the environmental agent extraction technique using a questionnaire survey. Our results identify management strategies for minimizing biodiversity loss due to climate change. Forest management and human activities should be undertaken with care, and the environmental context going forward into the next century should be considered for integrated catchment management. Elsewhere, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, a much expanded network of protected areas, and/or efforts to provide corridors to ease species movements may be necessary at the global level.

AB  - Stream conservation and restoration strategies commonly focus on preserving extant riparian forest and restoring riparian habitat. Though these practices are beneficial to stream habitat, they may not suffice to restore stream condition in catchments heavily influenced by intensive land use. To evaluate this hypothesis, we measured invertebrate populations in 12 streams affected by different land-use types (cultivated, developed, forested and grassland). Within each stream, we compared reaches with and without riparian buffers of remnant mature forest. Within each reach, we calculated the relative abundance of individuals from the insect orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (%EPT) and assessed specific conductance, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature and substratum composition. Forested catchments had the highest %EPT (average 23.8) followed by grassland (16.1), cultivated (1.96) and developed (0.31). Reaches with forested buffers present were not associated with higher %EPT in forested, cultivated or developed catchments. In grassland catchments, however, %EPT was about eightfold higher in reaches with forested buffers than those without. High values of %EPT were associated with large stream substratum and low specific conductance and temperature, which were most common in forested catchments. Developed and cultivated catchments did not follow this pattern, %EPT being uniformly low, even where abiotic conditions were similar to forested catchments. These results confirm that intensive urban and cultivated land uses at the catchment scale degrade stream biological communities. They also indicate that patchy forested riparian corridors, as found in many restoration projects, are probably insufficient to mitigate severe, large-scale biological degradation.

AB  - fragmented woodlands in agricultural regions of Australia, roadside environments (road verges) provide important refuges for threatened native fauna and isolated populations of plant species. However, as roads are transport corridors for humans and their vehicles; species survival is affected through destruction, fragmentation and modification of remaining habitat by human activity. Few studies have recognised the effects of anthropogenic disturbances, in the form of historical roadworks activities, on adjacent roadside plant populations. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of soil disturbance from roadworks on the spatial patterns and structural dynamics of roadside Acacia populations in an agricultural area in southeastern Australia. Stem size and disturbance data were collected from 135 roadside populations of three species of Acacia shrubs in the Lockhart Shire area. Spatial pattern analysis using the Network K-function and Discriminant Function analyses showed that road verge width, road category, disturbance intensity and distance to nearest town were highly significant variables in relation to disturbance from roadworks and shrub structural dynamics. Colonising populations were more abundant along gravel roads where soil disturbance intensity was high, whereas stable populations were more abundant where soil disturbance intensity was low. Senescent populations were more abundant in narrow, little used road verge corridors 4-6 km from nearby towns. These results suggest that anthropogenic disturbance regimes may be critical to shrub recruitment and persistence in roadside environments, which has important consequences for conservation of threatened native flora and fauna in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - Yellow fever (YF) is a zoonotic arthropod-borne disease that is caused by the yellow fever virus (YFV) and characterized by a sylvatic and urban cycle. Its most severe presentation is manifested as a hemorrhagic disease, and it has been responsible for thousands of deaths in the last decades. This study describes the public health approaches taken to control the 2016-2017 YF outbreak in nonhuman primates (NHPs) that took place in the northeastern region of SAo Paulo state, Brazil. NHPs recovered from the field were necropsied, and YF diagnoses were made at the Laboratory of Molecular Virology, RibeirAo Preto Medical School and the Center of Pathology, Adolfo Lutz Institute of SAo Paulo. NHP samples were inoculated into Vero cells for YFV isolation. RNA extraction was performed directly from NHP tissues and tested by RT-qPCR. YFV-positive samples were confirmed by sequencing. Based on the rapid RT-qPCR results, surveillance actions were implemented in the entire region. Confirmatory histopathology and immunohistochemistry for YFV were also performed. Among nine NHPs, gross hepatic involvement was observed in six animals, five of which were YFV-RT-qPCR-positive. One YFV was isolated from the serum of an infant NHP. YFV RNA sequences diverged from the virus responsible for the last epizootic that occurred in SAo Paulo state, but it was similar to the current Brazilian epizootic. Public health actions included dissemination of information on YF transmission, investigation of the probable location of NHP infection, characterization of the environment, and subsequent creation of the blueprint from which prevention and control measures were implemented. The YFV sylvatic cycle occurred in the periurban areas of the northeastern region of SAo Paulo state, but no human cases were reported during this period, showing that integrated actions between human, animal, and environmental health professionals were critical to restrain the virus to the sylvatic cycle.

AB  - American wildcelery (Vallisneria americana Michx.) is a valuable submersed aquatic plant that was negatively affected by pollution and urban runoff in the lower Detroit River for much of the 20th century. Following 25 years of water-pollution and urban- runoff abatement initiated in the early 1970s, we postulated that water clarity had increased and that this would allow restoration of wildcelery in the lower Detroit River. In addition, water clarity increased in the late 1980s due to waterfiltration and particulate removal by exotic dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis), which could contribute to potential wildcelery restoration. We sampled wildcelery in 1996-97 and compared these data to wildcelery data from 1950-51 and 1984-85. Over the 48-year period of comparison, areal density of wildcelery tubers decreased 72% (from 51.2 million to 14.4 million tubers) between 1950-51 and 1984-85 then increased 251% (from 14.4 million to 50.5 million tubers) between 1984-85 and 1996-97. As a result, overall areal abundance was about the same in 1950-51 as in fall 1996-97. However, tuber densities in spring 1996 were similar to historical low abundances in springs of 1984-85. Then between spring and fall 1996, tuber densities increased 333% and remained relatively abundant through October 1997 indicating the beginning of the restoration of wildcelery in the lower Detroit River. In addition, we believe further reductions of turbidity through continued pollution-abatement programs and water filtration by dreissenid mussels combined with habitat protection and active management of wildcelery will contribute even further to the restoration of wildcelery in the Detroit River in the 21st century.

AB  - At locations throughout the world, hazardous wastes have been buried in an attempt to ensure the health and safety of the environment, The ability of simple and complex barriers to protect against biotic intrusion in the short-and long-term is questionable. Little research has been conducted to assess the risk that biota mag pose to barrier integrity, Evidence of documented and potential cases of biointrusion of protective barriers by various species of plants, burrowing mammals, and invertebrates at various hazardous waste sites throughout the USA is examined to assess whether biointrusion has occurred. Studies documenting plant root intrusion were examined to assess their ability to affect barrier integrity, Various plant species, including kochia [Kochia scoparia (L,) Schrader], crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum L,), big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis Nutt,), and salt cedar (Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb,) were found to have penetrated into protective barriers in mesic and arid environments. There is also evidence of biointrusion by harvester ants (Pogonomymrmex owyheii) through rock barriers, Mice (Perognathus parvus, Peromyscus maniculatus), kangaroo rats (Dipodyms ordii), pocket gophers (Thomomys bottae), ground squirrels (Spermophilus elegans, S. townsendii), and prairie dogs (Cynomyous leucurus) are also a threat to the integrity of protective barriers. These results indicate that plants, invertebrates, and burrowing mammals pose a threat to barrier integrity and waste isolation. Engineered protective caps have been designed without the consideration of ecological principles and processes. The incorporation of these components into barrier designs may be crucial to their performance.

AB  - A study was carried out on the fruit rot of watermelon (Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. Nakai) in Ilorin, Nigeria between February and May, 2008. A large area planted to watermelon in Obbo-ille, a town near Ilorin, Kwara State was severely infected with both leaf and fruit blotches. Both diseases occurred together in all infected watermelon stands. Leaf and fruit samples were taken to the laboratory at the University of Ilorin, for investigation. A bacterial isolate identified as Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes Stanier (= Acidovorax avenae) was recovered from both infected leaf and fruit samples. Koch's postulates were performed on both samples using a suspension of the culture isolate. Symptoms were produced on artificially inoculated leaves and fruits and P. pseudoalcaligenes was also re-isolated. This organism was, therefore, identified as the causal organism of bacterial fruit and leaf blotch in watermelon in Ilorin, Kwara State of Nigeria.

AB  - Source types or source regions contributing to the concentration of atmospheric fine particles measured at Brigantine National Wildlife Refuge, NJ, were identified using a factor analysis model called Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF). Cluster analysis of backward air trajectories on days of high- and low-factor concentrations was used to link factors to potential source regions. Brigantine is a Class I visibility area with few local sources in the center of the eastern urban corridor and is therefore a good location to study Mid-Atlantic regional aerosol. Sulfate (expressed as ammonium sulfate) was the most abundant species, accounting for 49% of annual average fine mass. Organic compounds (22%; expressed as 1.4 x organic carbon) and ammonium nitrate (10%) were the next abundant species. Some evidence herein suggests that secondary organic aerosol formation is an important contributor to summertime regional aerosol.

AB  - Pollinators play a key role within most terrestrial communities in maintaining plant populations, as well as pollinating many agricultural crops for seed and fruit production. The mobility of pollinating animals is significant to their importance but we know little about how landscape structure influences pollinator movements. Linear landscape features such as hedgerows and embankments are conspicuous features of agricultural landscape structure and are important artificial habitats in their own right. However, there has been some debate as to the function of these landscape elements as corridors between larger expanses of semi-natural habitat separated by urban and agricultural habitats. Few studies have specifically studied insect flight responses to linear landscape elements. By observing bumblebee flight behaviour along hedgerows and, by creating a medium-scale experimental array of flower patches using an artificial linear feature, we examined whether such structures can elicit an oriented flight response along them and therefore facilitate insect movement through the landscape. We found that both hedgerows and artificial linear landscape features can influence the flight directions of bumblebees (Bombus spp. Hymenoptera, Apidae), one of Europe's most important groups of pollinators. A bioassay experiment in which Salvia pratensis (Lamiaceae) was planted into landscape patches with differing numbers of connecting hedgerows showed that this directional response can have a profound effect on plant reproductive success plants had increased pollinator activity, pollen receipt and subsequent seed set in patches with more connections. The overall hedgerow connectedness of a landscape is therefore important both to bumblebee movement and to those plants which depend on bumblebees for pollination services.

AB  - We examined the efficacy of a mitigation project in Avra Valley Arizona, established to provide wildlife access across the barrier created by a canal, the Central Arizona Project (CAP). We monitored movements of 17 radio-collared desert mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus eremicus) to determine if deer were using the corridor for access across the canal and the 26-km wide valley We also determined frequency of corridor use by desert mule deer relative to surrounding lands. Four deer crossed the canal but stayed within 500 m of the crossing site. One deer traversed the valley via the corridor. Two of these deer used crossing areas not in the designated corridor. Overall, 22.4% of deer locations were in the corridor. The corridor currently serves as a link with other undeveloped lands to provide movement for animals seeking to cross Avra Valley, but some lands outside the corridor are scheduled for development for agriculture. With increasing pressures from an urban population, the corridor may prove to be of greater value in the future.

AB  - Lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) winter in the Grand Calumet River-Indiana Harbor Canal (GCR-IHC) drainage into southern Lake Michigan, a polluted oasis in the highly urban and industrial corridor of northern Illinois and Indiana. The GCR-IHC is an important wintering area for lesser scaup in northwestern Indiana, especially after Lake Michigan freezes, because of the lack of other wildlife habitat in the area. We investigated the feeding and movement patterns of these wintering lesser scaup to better understand the ecological significance of this area to wintering waterfowl and to interpret contaminant levels in these lesser scaup. We implanted radio transmitters in 20 individuals in January 1994 and tracked them until early March 1994. Four lesser scaup disappeared and four died within the first 2 weeks after implantation; 12 lesser scaup remained in the GCR-IHC for the next 6-7 weeks. Individual radio-marked scaup (n = 12) were located in the GCR-IHC on an average of 62.2% (extreme values = 25-87%) of the searches. No radio-marked lesser scaup were located outside the GCR-IHC. Lesser scaup were feeding during 23% of the radio fixes.

AB  - We studied the persistence of 281 towns of the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) from surveys conducted in Oklahoma in 1966 and 1967 and again in 1988 and 1989. Town size during initial surveys tended to increase along a northwesterly gradient toward the panhandle of the State, and larger towns tended to occur in clusters while small towns occurred as isolates. Persistence of prairie dog towns from 1967 to 1989 increased significantly with town size and decreased with town isolation, with higher persistence for towns that occurred in landscapes with greater coverage of other towns. Comparisons to our studies of persistence of towns mapped in 1989 and resurveyed in 1997 [Journal of Mammalogy, 82 (2001) 937] indicate that the latter part of this pattern was reversed, with persistence highest for the most isolated towns. The reversal in persistence patterns may be attributed to an outbreak of plague (Yersinia pestis) during the early 1990s, favoring isolated towns. We recommend adaptive management and a mixed strategy for the development of prairie reserves which should include networks (clusters) of relatively large reserves, along with large but isolated reserves across the species' native range.

AB  - Populations of mammals that depend on early successional forests or shrub-dominated habitats are declining in portions of the eastern United States. Although much of this decline can be attributed to maturation of young forests that once dominated the East, fragmentation and suppression of natural disturbances also have been implicated. Responses by habitat specialists (e.g., New England cottontails [Sylvilagus transitionalis]) and carnivores with large area requirements that rely on prey associated with early successional habitats (e.g., bobcats [Lynx rufus]) have been most extreme. Populations of facultative or opportunistic users of early successional habitats (e.g., black bears [Ursus americanus] and little brown bats [Myotis lucifugus]) apparently have not been affected by fewer young stands. As eastern forests mature, biotic and abiotic forces will increase abundance of early successional habitats. However, maturation of these forests will take a century or more. In the meantime, using even-aged silviculture and applying controlled burns to native shrublands may be useful to alleviate current shortages. In landscapes modified substantially by suburban-urban developments and dense networks of roads, conventional management efforts likely will be insufficient. In these regions, increased populations of generalist predators are of exerting intense predation on mammalian herbivores that are restricted to small patches, and movement between patches by small mammals is limited. Mammals large area requirements also are hampered in these landscapes by frequent road crossings. These limitations may require implementing habitat management programs for mammals that differ from those developed for other disturbance-dependent taxa. Large (>10-ha), clustered patches of early successional habitat may be necessary to maintain viable populations. The effectiveness of these managed habitats will be further enhanced by positioning them close to existing land uses that are characterized by early successional habitats (e.g., powerline corridors). In agricultural landscapes, the representation of old-field habitats could be increased in set-aside programs.

AB  - The environmental conflict throughout land development varies for every landform. In hilly areas, the ecological effects, such as the properties of the land surface and the diversity of flora and fauna cannot be reflected through assessment indexes, which include the building density, green areas ratio, etc. This paper is to provide the impervious index and the corridor index as a complement to the master planners. The indexes is an approach that integrates ecological landscape principles and methods for analyzing the eco-rationality of the master planning using ecological indexes which provides a measure for adjusting development density. An application of the indexes to the residential development of Kunming Expo Eco-town in Yunnan Province, China is provided. The result shows that the indexes can be used to quantify the interrelationship between the development project and the environment and that the required regulatory measures for land development can be implemented via master plans.

AB  - Widespread shallow coral reef loss has led to calls for more holistic approaches to coral reef management, requiring inclusion of ecosystems interacting with shallow coral reefs in management plans. Yet, almost all current reef management is biased towards shallow reefs, and overlooks that coral reefs extend beyond shallow waters to mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs; 30-150 m). We present the first detailed quantitative characterization of MCEs off Cozumel, Mexico, on the northern Mesoamerican Reef in the Mexican Caribbean, and provide insights into their general state. We documented MCE biodiversity, and assessed whether MCEs adjacent to a major town and port, where coastal development has caused shallow reef damage, have similar benthic and fish communities to MCEs within a National Park. Our results show that overall MCE communities are similar regardless of protection, though some taxa-specific differences exist in benthic communities between sites within the MPA and areas outside. Regardless of protection and location, and in contrast to shallow reefs, all observed Cozumel MCEs were continuous reefs with the main structural habitat complexity provided by calcareous macroalgae, sponges, gorgonians and black corals. Hard corals were present on MCEs, although at low abundance. We found that 42.5% of fish species recorded on Cozumel could be found on both shallow reefs and MCEs, including 39.6% of commercially valuable fish species. These results suggest that MCEs could play an important role in supporting fish populations. However, regardless of protection and depth, we found few large-body. fishes (greater than 500 mm), which were nearly absent at all studied sites. Cozumel MCEs contain diverse benthic and fish assemblages, including commercially valuable fisheries species and ecosystem engineers, such as black corals. Because of their inherent biodiversity and identified threats, MCEs should be incorporated into shallow-reef-focused Cozumel National Park management plan.

AB  - Bletilla striata is a traditional Chinese medicine plant. Guizhou Province is the largest producer of B. striata, with the biggest cultivation area and highest yield in China. Anthracnose is the main disease affecting the crop. In July 2021, an anthracnose outbreak occurred in Shibing County, Guizhou Province, seriously affecting the yield and quality of B. striata. Thirty samples of B. striata anthracnose were collected from Shuangjing, Niudachang, and Yangliutang towns in three main planting areas of Shibing County to clarify the causal agent of B. striata anthracnose. Fifty anthracnose strains were isolated by tissue isolation and single-conidium culture. Through morphological observation and multigene phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer, actin, beta-tubulin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and chitin synthase genes, the isolated strains were identified as Colletotrichum spaethianum. The infection process of C. spaethianum on B. striata leaves was observed by cell tissue staining. The results showed that at 25 degrees C, the conidia of C. spaethianum on B. striata leaves began to germinate after 3 h, and the peak period of conidia germination was 8 h. Appressoria formation peaked after 24 h. During 48-72 h, the hyphae randomly expanded horizontally and vertically on the host surface, gradually forming a reticular distribution. This study is the first report of C. spaethianum causing anthracnose in B. striata. Our study clarifies the infection and development process of C. spaethianum on B. striata leaves, thus providing a theoretical basis for further study on the monitoring of B. striata anthracnose.

AB  - We reconstructed the geological evolution and the history of the fluvial network in the central part of the Po Plain in Lombardy, northern Italy, since the Middle Wurm. We focused on evidences of dissection and incision of former rivers into the large outwash fans originating from piedmont glaciers of the southern Alps in the Last Glacial Maximum. The studied area is located between the Po River and the Alps north of the Adda/Serio river confluence, around the town of Crema. Morphometric analysis and stratigraphic investigation were carried out, supported by palaeobotany, sand petrography and radiometric dating. The obtained stratigraphic framework is presented by cross sections and by a geological map. During the Middle Wurm, an alluvial fan of the Adda River oriented NWN-SSE occupied the area, feeding south and west the Romanengo hill. A substantial reorganisation of the fluvial network occurred during the Last Glacial Maximum. Since 32-30 ka cal. BP, the area was fed by two outwash rivers, originated from the Adda and the Oglio piedmont glaciers, both characterised by a prevalent southward drainage, 160 degrees-170 degrees S in the LGM. After the LGM the fan-head was dissected by trunk channels and, at the downslope fan limit, the southward flow shifted to a southeastern direction. Thereafter, major dissection and downcutting occurred in the Lateglacial, confining the major rivers into large alluvial corridors, further shaped by lateral erosion during the Holocene. The Late Holocene history of the Serio River is marked by fluvial floods during the late Roman Age, and by a capture of the lower reach by the Adda River. The geomorphological evidence supports the historically inferred age assignment of the diversion to 12th-14th c. AD.

AB  - Ranaviruses have been observed with increasing frequency amongst poikilothermic vertebrate hosts. The impact of ranaviruses upon amphibian populations has remained largely unknown. A gene probe for Bohle iridovirus (BIV) based upon primers designed to detect epizootic haematopoietic necrosis virus (EHNV) was constructed. A PCR and dot-blot system was used successfully in screening for the presence of BIV nucleic acid in digested formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded amphibian tissues. Juvenile frogs were more susceptible to BIV than adults. In experimental challenges and epizootics in captive frogs, juvenile Litoria caerulea, L. alboguttata, Cyclorana brevipes and Pseudophryne coriacea were acutely susceptible. High mortality (at or near 100%) resulted, usually occurring within 5 to 25 d depending on dose and method of exposure. Histopathological changes included mainly hepatic, renal and splenic necroses. Significant haemosiderosis was encountered in more chronically infected frogs. BIV could be reisolated from juvenile L caerulea >40 d after inoculation, and >200 d after the first mortalities occurred in an epizootic in L. alboguttata. Adult L. rubella, L. inermis, L. caerulea, Cophixalus ornatus and Taudactylus acutirostris were less susceptible in trials ranging from 30 to >100 d. There was some evidence of chronic infection, and BIV could be detected by PCR. Wild moribund adult L. caerulea from Townsville and captive juvenile Pseudophryne corieacca from Sydney undergoing mortality tested positive with the BIV PCR. PCR and dot blot was more sensitive than viral isolation. PCR could detect BIV in amphibians long after BIV challenge, and in amphibians which appeared healthy. Ranaviruses could be having an impact on Australian herpetofauna.

AB  - Consumption of contaminated poultry and poultry products represents a common source of nontyphoidal Salmonella infection. Little is known on the status of Salmonella and their antimicrobial susceptibility in poultry farms in Ethiopia. This study investigated the prevalence, serotype distribution, and antimicrobial susceptibility of nontyphoidal Salmonella among poultry farms in Adama and Modjo towns. Three hundred thirty-four cloacal swabs, 384 fecal droppings of birds, 59 feed, 59 floor swabs, and 36 stools from in-contact humans were collected and processed for Salmonella isolation. Isolates were tested for their susceptibility to 15 antimicrobials using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion assay. Seventeen (28.8%) of the farms and 24 (2.9%) of the samples from poultry farms and 2.8% (1/36) of stool samples of humans in-contact with poultry were positive for Salmonella. Most of the isolates (n = 21) were recovered from fecal droppings of birds while the remaining isolates were recovered from floor swab samples (n = 2) and cloacal swab sample (n = 1). Only three Salmonella serovars: S. Haifa (n = 14, 56%), S. Anatum (n = 7; 28%), and S. Give (n = 4; 16%) were detected. Poultry farms in Adama town, large flock sized farms, and farms that used antimicrobials were significantly associated with the occurrence of Salmonella (p < .05). Twenty (80%) and 19 (76%) of Salmonella isolates were resistant to streptomycin and tetracycline, respectively. Nineteen (76%) of the isolates were resistant to two or more antimicrobials. Detection of multidrug-resistant strains of Salmonella in poultry farms suggests the need for detailed epidemiological and molecular studies to establish sources of acquisition of resistant Salmonella strains.

AB  - Aim: The present study was aimed to investigate "Effects of Solvents and Extraction Methods on Naringenin, LC-MS Based Quantitative Studies and major Metabolite of Cochlospermum Gossypium".
   Study Design: LC-MS based Quantification Studies.
   Place and Duration of Study: Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, GITAM Institute of Pharmacy, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh between April 2019 and July 2020.
   Methodology: Rapid and Quantitative efficient extraction methods were used by using soxhlet and Ultrasound mediated extraction techniques for a range of polar solvents and Isolation of Naringenin by gradient elution technique, In the present study Naringenin was isolated in abundance (1%) by repetitive chromatographic purifications of the ethyl acetate extract of the bark part of C.gossypium. In view of high therapeutic potential, detailed HPLC based quantitative studies was carried out on C. gossypium bark, which contains significant levels of Naringenin.
   Results: The chromatographic separation was performed on the stationary phase, based on different retention mechanisms due to hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions between compounds and stationary phase. In total, 24 different polar extracts were generated by soxhlet and ultrasound extraction methods from the two bark samples which were collected from Jaipur town (Telangana state) and Trichur town (Kerala state).
   Conclusion: The highest Naringenin content (0.59%) was found in the methanol + chloroform (1:1) extract (E8) generated by direct Soxhlet extraction of C.gossypium bark collected from Jaipur (Telangana state). Naringenin was isolated from a non-citrus plant for first time from Cochlospermum gosspyium and more significantly it is isolated in large quantity. It was obtained in 99.9% purity as shown by LCMS.

AB  - Nesting Canada geese (Branta canadensis) appear to be colonizing portions of the Colorado River in Glen Canyon and Grand Canyon, Arizona. We report the first appearance of nesting geese in this area with one record in the 1950s, followed several decades later by single-pair nesting records in 2001, 2012, 2013, and 2016, increasing to two pairs in 2018, five or six pairs in 2019, and at least two pairs in 2020. Our recent field observations (2018-2020) document that nesting geese are currently successfully raising broods in two geographically distinct areas separated by over 300 km along the river corridor in Grand Canyon: a 4-km area from river kilometer 80 to river kilometer 84 in eastern Grand Canyon, and a 54-km area from river kilometer 392 to river kilometer 446 in western Grand Canyon. The eastern nesting area is dominated by riparian habitat that has proliferated in a relatively stabilized shoreline since Glen Canyon Dam began regulating the river in 1963. The western nesting area is within the fluctuating inflow of the river with Lake Mead, a geomorphologically distinct area where >20 years of drought-induced declining reservoir levels have exposed sediments deposited when Lake Mead was higher than at present (1950s-2001). Two factors likely contribute to the increased presence of nesting geese in Grand Canyon, including (1) expanding populations of nonmigratory, resident geese and the southward expansion of their historic breeding range and (2) the availability of nesting habitat along the Colorado River today that may not have existed historically.

AB  - The steep declines over the last quarter century of wild pollinators in the Southwest among native bees, monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus L.), hummingbirds, and nectar-feeding bats have come during a time of accelerated climate change, and are likely due to a variety of stresses interacting with climatic shifts. Nevertheless, there is mounting evidence that declining availability and altered timing of floral resources along "nectar corridors" accessible to pollinators involves climatic shifts as a serious stressor that had been previously underestimated. Longitudinal studies from both urban heat islands and rural habitats in Southwestern North America suggest peak flowering of many wildflowers serving as floral resources for pollinators is occurring three to five weeks earlier in spring than a century ago, leaving "phenological gaps" in nectar resource availability for certain pollinators. To avoid the threat of what A. Dobson (Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University) and others have termed "food web collapse," a range of groups have initiated ecological restoration efforts in semi-arid zones that attempt to (a) assemble more resilient plant-pollinator food chains, and (b) hydrologically restore watercourses to ensure water scarcity will be less likely to disrupt re-assembled food chains in the face of droughts, catastrophic floods, and other correlates of global climate change. We recommend "bottom-up food chain restoration" strategies for restoring nectar corridors in protected areas on or near geopolitical and land management boundaries in all regions, but particularly in the Southwest or US-Mexico desert border states. We highlight binational and multicultural workshops facilitated to communicate about, and initiate restoration of, mutualistic relationships among plants, pollinators, and people to protected area managers on both sides of the border.

AB  - The area occupied by colonies of the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus; BTPD henceforth) in northwestern Mexico was dramatically reduced between 1988 and 2005. We conducted a quantitative assessment of the distributional changes of these BTPD colonies during the periods 1988-2000 and 2000-2005 focusing on the potential roles of plant biomass, landscape configuration, habitat loss, and habitat suitability. We used remote sensing and GIS tools to characterize habitat and landscape conditions at areas of extinction and persistence at the beginning of each period. Based on this information, we contrasted areas of extinction and persistence within single BTPD colonies, and used logistic regression to model extinction of entire colonies. The greatest levels of reduction, fragmentation and extinction of colonies occurred between 1988 and 2000. The trend of reduction continued between 2000 and 2005 because the largest colony became smaller and fragmented, driving the area down, however, the rest of the towns showed a marginal increase. During the first period, extinction of entire colonies was higher in smaller colonies occupying low-biomass areas. Both extinction models and raw data indicate that colony area lost to agriculture and urbanization was relatively low for both periods. Because the period exhibiting the highest colony area loss coincided with a severe period of drought (1994-1995), we hypothesized that an unusually high food shortage could be the driving force behind this generalized reduction in colonies. Our results suggest that BTPD populations are sensitive to size and isolation effects mainly in the context of severe drought. Because changes in precipitation have profound impacts on plant productivity and composition in arid ecosystems, BTPD populations at the southernmost edge of their geographic range are especially vulnerable to drought and desertification processes, and therefore to climate disruption.

AB  - We have a limited understanding of the effects that an increasing human population and urban and agricultural development are having on elephant movements in Botswana. Elephant movements are complex because they are influenced by a wide range of location-specific variables. This study aimed to investigate how elephants move through different human-dominated landscapes in the Chobe District, Botswana. The movements of four female elephants from the Chobe District were studied over a period of 13 months using GPS collars to follow them. Annual home ranges of the elephants were calculated using both the 100% minimum convex polygon (MCP) and 95% fixed kernel (FK) methods. Additionally, general estimating equation models were used to investigate which factors influenced the elephants' distance moved, both hourly and daily. We found the elephants' movement behaviour was dependent on the time of day and type of land use: whether agricultural areas, protected areas or wildlife management areas, trophy hunting blocks, and multi-use zones (e.g. game management areas). Overall, all of the elephants had smaller annual home ranges (similar to 450-1,750 km(2)) than seen in other studies within southern Africa, and there was a difference in seasonal movements, between individuals. Additionally, contrary to previously published studies, the elephants made larger diurnal movements than nocturnal movements. Movements were significantly different between different land-use areas, suggesting that elephants could be developing different strategies to move through differing levels of human disturbance.
   It is vital for any wildlife management plan that the spatial movements of key conservation species are thoroughly understood, in order to formulate informed management decisions and create an integrated land-use management plan that enables both development and elephant coexistence.

AB  - Mapping landslide-prone regions are crucial in natural hazard management and urban development activities in hilly and tropical regions. This research aimed to delineate a spatial prediction of landslide hazard areas along the Jelapang Corridor of the North-South Expressway in Malaysia by using two statistical models, namely, logistic regression (LR) and evidential belief function (EBF). Landslides result in high economic and social loses in Malaysia, particularly to highway concessionaries such as PLUS Expressways Berhad. LR and EBF determine the correlation between conditioning factors and landslide occurrence. EBF can also be applied in bivariate statistical analysis. Thus, EBF can be used to assess the effect of each class of conditioning factors on landslide occurrence. A landslide inventory map with 26 landslide sites was recorded using field measurements. Subsequently, the landslide inventory was randomly divided into two data sets. Approximately 70 % of the data were used for training the models, and 30 % were used for validating the results. Eight landslide conditioning factors were prepared for landslide susceptibility analysis: altitude, slope, aspect, curvature, stream power index, topographic wetness index, terrain roughness index, and distance from river. The landslide probability index was derived from both methods and subsequently classified into five susceptible classes by using the quantile method. The resultant landslide susceptibility maps were evaluated using the area under the curve technique. Results revealed the proficiency of the LR method in landslide susceptibility mapping. The achieved success and prediction rates for LR were 90 and 88 %, respectively. However, EBF was not successful in providing reasonable accurate results. The acquired success and prediction rates for EBF were 53 and 50 %, respectively. Hence, the LR technique can be utilized in landslide hazard studies for land use management and planning.

AB  - Introduction: The study aims at identifying traffic/highway design/driver-vehicle information significantly related with fatal/severe crashes on urban arterials for different crash types. Since the data used in this study are observational (i.e., collected outside the purview of a designed experiment), an information discovery approach is adopted for this study. Method: Random Forests, which are ensembles of individual trees grown by CART (Classification and Regression Tree) algorithm, are applied in numerous applications for this purpose. Specifically, conditional inference forests have been implemented. In each tree of the conditional inference forest, splits are based oil how good the association is. Chi-square test statistics are used to measure the association. Apart from identifying the variables that improve classification accuracy, the methodology also clearly identifies the variables that are neutral to accuracy, and also those that decrease it. Results: The methodology is quite insightful in identifying the variables of interest in the database (e.g., alcohol/drug use and higher posted speed limits contribute to severe crashes). Failure to use safety equipment by all passengers and presence of driver/passenger in the vulnerable age group (more than 55 years or less than 3 years) increased the severity of injuries given a crash had Occurred. A new variable, 'element' has been used in this study, which assigns crashes to segments, intersections, or access points based on the information from site location, traffic control, and presence of signals. Impact: The authors were able to identify roadway locations where severe crashes tend to occur. For example, segments and access points were found to be riskier for single vehicle crashes. Higher skid resistance and k-factor also contributed toward increased severity of injuries in crashes. (C) 2009 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd, All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: In June 2020, severe symptoms of leaf mosaic and fruit malformation were observed on greenhouse-grown cucumber plants in Xizhou Township of Changhua County, Taiwan. An unknown virus, designated CX-2, was isolated from a diseased cucumber sample by single lesion isolation on Chenopodium quinoa leaves. Identification of CX-2 was performed. Moreover, the incidence of cucumber viruses in Taiwan was also investigated. Methods: Transmission electron microscopy was performed to examine virion morphology. The portable MinION sequencer released by Oxford Nanopore Technologies was used to detect viral sequences in dsRNA of CX-2-infected leaf tissue. The whole genome sequence of CX-2 was completed by Sanger sequencing and analyzed. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with species-specific primers and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with anti-coat protein antisera were developed for virus detection in the field [see Additional file 1]. Results: Icosahedral particles about 30 nm in diameter were observed in the crud leaf sap of CX-2-infected C. quinoa plant. The complete genome sequence of CX-2 was determined as 4577 nt long and shared 97.0-97.2% of nucleotide identity with that of two cucumber Bulgarian latent virus (CBLV) isolates in Iran and Bulgaria. Therefore, CX-2 was renamed CBLV-TW. In 2020-2022 field surveys, melon yellow spot virus (MYSV) had the highest detection rate of 74.7%, followed by cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus (CCYV) (32.0%), papaya ringspot virus virus watermelon type (PRSV-W) (10.7%), squash leaf curl Philippines virus (SLCuPV) (9.3%), CBLV (8.0%) and watermelon silver mottle virus (WSMoV) (4.0%). Co-infection of CBLV and MYSV could be detected in field cucumbers. Conclusion: The emerging CBLV-TW was identified by nanopore sequencing. Whole genome sequence analysis revealed that CBLV-TW is closely related, but phylogenetically distinct, to two known CBLV isolates in Bulgaria and Iran. Detection methods including RT-PCR and indirect ELISA have been developed to detect CBLV and to investigate cucumber viruses in central Taiwan. The 2020-2022 field survey results showed that MYSV and CCYV were the main threats to cucumbers, with CBLV, SLCuPV and WSMoV were occasionally occurring.

AB  - In the Brazilian Pantanal, wildfire occurrence has increased, reaching record highs of over 40,000 km2 in 2020. Smoke from wildfires worsened the situation of isolated, as well as urban communities, already under an increasing toll of COVID-19. Here we review the impacts and the possible causes of the 2020 mega-fires and recommend improvements for public policies and fire management in this wetland. We calculated the amount of area burnt annually since 2003 and describe patterns in precipitation and water level measurements of the Paraguay River. Our analyses revealed that the 2020 wildfires were historically unprecedented, as 43% of the area (over 17,200 km2) had not been burnt previously in the last two decades. The extent of area affected in 2020 represents a 376% increase compared to the annual average of the area burnt annually in the last two decades, double than the value in 2019. Potential factors responsible for this increase are (i) severe drought decreased water levels, (ii) the fire corridor was located in the Paraguay River flood zone, (iii) constraints on firefighters, (iv) insufficient fire prevention strategy and agency budget reductions, and (v) recent landscape changes. Climate and land use change will further increase the frequency of these extreme events. To make fire management more efficient and cost-effective, we recommend the implementation of an Integrated Fire Management program in the Pantanal. Stakeholders should use existing traditional, local ecological, and scientific knowledge to form a collective strategy with clear, achievable, measurable goals, considering the socio-ecological context. Permanent fire brigades, including indigenous members, should conduct year-round fire management. Communities should cooperate to create a collaborative network for wildfire prevention, the location and characteristics (including flammability) of infrastructures should be (re)planned in fire-prone environments considering and managing fire-catalysed transitions, and depending on the severity of wildfires. The 2020 wildfires were tackled in an ad-hoc fashion and prioritisation of areas for urgent financial investment, management, protection, and restoration is necessary to prevent this catastrophe from happening again.

AB  - Landscapes can influence the distribution of harvesting by influencing animal distribution and hunter access. For species like caribou, Rangifer tarandus, decades-long shifts in abundance and distribution might alter such relationships, but few studies have been conducted at such scales. We examined relationships between landscape features and 21,380 harvest records of migratory caribou in Newfoundland during caribou population growth (1980s), cessation of growth (1990s), and decline (2000s). We focused on features hypothesized to influence the distributions of caribou and hunters: lichen landcover, roads, cutblocks, outfitter camps, power lines, and towns. We uncovered larger harvests by resident hunters of male and female caribou among lichen landcover, likely providing preferred caribou forage, and larger harvests by non-resident hunters of male caribou away from towns, reflecting the locations of outfitter camps. Only during later decades, resident harvests occurred nearer power lines and cutblocks, likely providing hunter access and reflecting risk-prone foraging by caribou. We surmise that the harvest was facilitated by open habitats, preferred by caribou, and anthropogenic features leading to hunter access, especially as the caribou population declined. Such knowledge at broad scales is increasingly important in an era of widespread disruption to landscapes.

AB  - Tiger, being a solitary and territorial animal, often tends to move out of protected areas into the surrounding forests. This is especially true in the case of sub-adult animals leading to escalating conflicts and deaths in the surrounding human-dominated landscapes. Unless adequately protected against various human activities, such corridors and surrounding forests will soon disappear, trapping the animals within protected areas with resultant local extinctions. In this paper we ascertain tiger presence, occupancy and numbers in one such partially protected area, the Sathyamangalam forest, located close to better known tiger reserves in India, through non-invasive faecal DNA analysis. Here we highlight the potential of Sathyamangalam as a tiger habitat. Tiger positive faecal samples were considered as evidence to establish occupancy in two different parts of Sathyamangalam, reserve forest and wildlife sanctuary. We collected 103 faecal samples out of which 69 were tiger positive. Species occupancy (psi), was 0.672 (+/- 0.197) with a detection probability of 0.2 (+/- 0.06) in the wildlife sanctuary area; while psi was 0.72 (+/- 0.2) with detection probability of 0.212 (+/- 0.6) in the reserve forest. Further, number of males and females, as determined in our study, was close to the ideal sex ratio in a healthy forest with good prey abundance. This study also highlights the presence of more females in the reserve forest (n = 10) than the wildlife sanctuary (n = 3) possibly indicating lesser disturbance and more prey availability. We recommend that the reserve forest to the north of Sathyamangalam wildlife sanctuary be declared as a tiger reserve. The wildlife sanctuary could serve as a buffer zone between this reserve and Sathyamangalam town which lies to the south of the forest. Proper protection of Sathyamangalam will go a long way in saving the entire landscape and tigers of the Western Ghats of India.

AB  - This paper explores an issue of maximum importance for the environment, namely the heavy metal pollution in the area of Copsa Mica town, a settlement known worldwide for the high pollution caused by the non-ferrous and chemical plants of its industrial site. Of great significance for this study are also the geographical location of the industrial site and the distribution of landforms along the wide valley corridor of the Tarnava Mare, which channels the air masses and encourages the deposition of solid and gaseous pollutants. The pollution triggered by SC Sometra SA has negatively impacted the human health (increasing morbidity) and the terrestrial and aquatic fauna, leading to the diminution or disappearance of certain living populations, as well as to the occurrence of pathological alterations. The assessment of soil quality tit the region highlights significant impairment on large areas with specific pollutants The study has revealed the existence of three polluted areas, as follows the most polluted area, the middle polluted area and the least polluted area.
