AB  - Active citizens may contribute to the environmental, social, and institutional resilience of cities. This review discusses how citizen initiatives protect biodiversity hotspots, contribute to social cohesion, institutional innovation, and diversity in urban green space management. Challenges related to social inclusiveness, ecological connectivity and continuity suggest government involvement is pertinent, but needs to be refocused. To maximise environmental outcomes of active citizenship, governments may adopt an enabling and stimulating governance style that harnesses the transformative potential of active citizenship. This paper argues for mosaic governance to work with the heterogeneous array of people, institutions, and spatial practices associated with active citizenship. Mosaic governance aims for a context-sensitive way of urban green infrastructure planning, enhancing relationships between the diversity of landscapes and communities across cities.

AB  - University campuses often contain contiguous areas of urban green space (UGS) which are otherwise scarce in large cities and, thus, may provide critical habitat for numerous species. In this study, we evaluate butterfly and plant diversity at Chiba University in Japan from five UGS types, including intensive green roofs, meadows, roadsides, open spaces. and community gardens. Surveying non-destructively every two weeks from June to November 2010, we identified 707 individual butterflies to 25 species from five families, including red-listed species (e.g. Parantica sita Kollar, 1844). However, one species, Pseudozizeeria maha Kollar, 1848, represented over 50% of all individuals surveyed. Butterflies in the family Papilionidae showed strong preference for roadside habitat, indicating the importance of 'butterfly flyways' and contiguous habitat corridors on University campuses. Butterfly richness and abundance was significantly different between UGS types and highest in the community garden and roadsides. We recorded 70 garden plant species and 117 spontaneous plant species (which grew opportunistically, without design input), of which 58% were native. Total plant richness was positively correlated with butterfly species richness, and non-native spontaneous plant species richness was positively correlated with butterfly richness, abundance, diversity, and evenness. Additionally, 76% of the spontaneous species identified were determined to be used by butterflies as larval hosts or for adult feeding. Identification of spontaneous plant species and use of selective weeding should be included in landscape management planning on campuses to promote butterflies, which can act as ambassadors for biodiversity conservation and help connect people to nature.

AB  - Habitat destruction and fragmentation are known to strongly affect dispersal by altering the quality of the environment between populations. As a consequence, lower landscape connectivity is expected to enhance extinction risks through a decrease in gene flow and the resulting negative effects of genetic drift, accumulation of deleterious mutations and inbreeding depression. Such phenomena are particularly harmful for amphibian species, characterized by disjunct breeding habitats. The dispersal behaviour of amphibians being poorly understood, it is crucial to develop new tools, allowing us to determine the influence of landscape connectivity on the persistence of populations. In this study, we developed a new landscape genetics approach that aims at identifying land-uses affecting genetic differentiation, without a priori assumptions about associated ecological costs. We surveyed genetic variation at seven microsatellite loci for 19 Alpine newt (Mesotriton alpestris) populations in western Switzerland. Using strips of varying widths that define a dispersal corridor between pairs of populations, we were able to identify land-uses that act as dispersal barriers (i.e. urban areas) and corridors (i.e. forests). Our results suggest that habitat destruction and landscape fragmentation might in the near future affect common species such as M. alpestris. In addition, by identifying relevant landscape variables influencing population structure without unrealistic assumptions about dispersal, our method offers a simple and flexible tool of investigation as an alternative to least-cost models and other approaches.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of biodiversity maintenance is a fundamental issue in ecology. The possibility that species disperse within the landscape along differing paths presents a relatively unexplored mechanism by which diversity could emerge. By embedding a classical metapopulation model within a network framework, we explore how access to different dispersal networks can promote species coexistence. While it is clear that species with the same demography cannot coexist stably on shared dispersal networks, we find that coexistence is possible on unshared networks, as species can surprisingly form self-organised clusters of occupied patches with the most connected patches at the core. Furthermore, a unimodal biodiversity response to an increase in species colonisation rates or average patch connectivity emerges in unshared networks. Increasing network size also increases species richness monotonically, producing characteristic species-area curves. This suggests that, in contrast to previous predictions, many more species can co-occur than the number of limiting resources.

AB  - More than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, a proportion that is expected to increase. Even if urbanisation is widely regarded as a major threat to global biodiversity, recent research highlighted the potential ecological importance of cities for pollinators. Key determinants of cities' ability to sustain pollinators are the presence of green areas and the connectivity between them. However, also temperature is expected to be of primary importance for pollinator activities. Here, we aimed at disentangling the effects of temperature, open habitat cover, and distance from the city centre on wild bee communities in the city of Rome (Italy). We selected 36 sites along two statistically independent gradients of temperature and open habitat cover, and we sampled wild bee communities using pan-traps for 4 months. Then, we measured functional traits of wild bee species, that is, body size, social behaviour, nesting strategy, and diet breadth. Temperature emerged as the main driver of wild bee communities, with communities richer in species and individuals at warmer temperatures. We found little species replacement between cold and warm sites. In addition, with increasing temperatures, bee communities were dominated by polylectic and small-bodied species. Here, we showed that in a highly urbanised environment, temperature shapes pollinator communities irrespective of other landscape metrics. Even if warming seemed beneficial for urban pollinator abundance and richness, it might strongly homogenise bee communities by selecting for those traits that make species more easily adaptable.

AB  - In order to increase biodiversity in the urban environment, several wildflower species were tested in terms of attractiveness towards pollinators. The species were selected on the basis of their mutualistic relation with pollinators, in terms of pollination biology. Plants with very showy flowers, like those belonging to the botanical families of Amaryllidaceae, Dipsacacee, Malvacee, Campanulacee, Asteraceae, Apiaceae, Ranunculaceae, Lamiaceae, Caryophyllaceae and Campanulaceae, were selected, grown in pots and tested in the urban environment to explore their potentiality to attract pollinators (bees, bumblebees, diptera and butterflies) in spite of the typically adverse life conditions of the urban environment. During the spring and summer months of the period 2006-2007, some observations were made on both wildflowers grown in the city and spontaneous plants of the same species in the natural environments, where the seeds of the studied species used were collected. The urban ecosystem tends to heavily limit the presence of pollinators, especially regard to the categories of butterflies and bumblebees, while solitary bees and diptera (especially Bombyliidae and Syrphydae) were more stable. In conclusion, in order to make the dynamics of wildflowers' survival sustainable over time, it is necessary to make pollinators' life possible in the city through the creation of environments for their breeding and of ecological corridors that can facilitate their entry into urban ecosystem.

AB  - Persistence of wildlife populations depends on the degree to which landscape features facilitate animal movements between isolated habitat patches. Due to limited data availability, the effect of landscape features on animal dispersal is typically estimated using expert opinion. With sufficient data, however, resistance surfaces can be estimated empirically. After modeling suitable prospecting habitat using an extensive dataset from the federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), we used data from over 800 prospecting events from 34 radio-tagged birds to identify the best relationship between habitat suitability and resistance surfaces. Our results demonstrated that juvenile female P. borealis prospecting for new territories beyond their natal territories preferred to traverse through forests with tall canopy and minimal midstory vegetation. The non-linear relationship between habitat suitability and resistance surfaces was the most biologically relevant transformation, which in turn identified the specific forest composition that promoted and inhibited prospecting and dispersal behavior. These results corresponded with over 60 % of dispersal events from an independent dataset of short-distance dispersal events. This new understanding of P. borealis prospecting behavior will help to identify areas necessary for maintaining habitat connectivity and to implement effective management strategies. Our approach also provides a framework to not only estimate and evaluate resistance surfaces based on species-specific responses to intervening landscape features, but also addresses an often-neglected step, selecting a biologically relevant function to transform habitat suitability model into a resistance surface.

AB  - Through a literature review, we determined the current state of knowledge on urban ecology in the larges cities of southern Chile: Temuco, Valdivia, Osorno, Puerto Montt and Punta Arenas. This review revealed the scarcity of studies on urban ecology where urbanization is increasing considerably, unkowning the impacts that this phenomenon may have on their ecosystems. Puerto Montt is the city with greater increase in urban population and simultaneously, the city with the lowest number and diversity of studies. The main impacts generated by the process of urbanization on the landscape are watershed pollution, air pollution, loss of native biodiversity and increasing exotic species. Suggestions are given to increase and conserve local biodiversity in the urban landscapes of southern Chile, as well as the lines of research needed to be done.

AB  - Maintaining animal movement in fragmented landscapes depends upon the levels of connectivity among habitat patches, which in turn may depend upon the landscape matrix. Little is known about how the matrix affects dispersal abilities, in part because few experimental tests have been conducted. We experimentally translocated 142 migratory American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) and resident Jamaican Todies (Todus todus) 0.6-4 km from their territories across landscapes fragmented by pen-urban development and bauxite mining and continuous forest. Redstarts returned more rapidly and with greater success than todies across all landscapes, with 95% of redstarts returning in an average of 2.5 days versus 60% of todies in >20 days. Return success was best predicted by translocation distance for redstarts and by sex for todies, with a trend of fewer birds returning when released in bauxite landscapes. Return time was strongly affected by matrix type, with both species returning more rapidly in a forested relative to a bauxite matrix and intermediately in a pen-urban matrix. These findings provide strong experimental evidence that land cover surrounding forested habitat influences species mobility. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We assessed the benefit of 11 gravel pits for the settlement of waterbird communities in an urbanized area lacking natural wetlands. Gravel pits captured 57% of the regional species pool of aquatic birds. We identified 39 species, among which five were regionally rare. We used the Self-Organizing Map algorithm to calculate the probabilities of presence of species, and to bring out habitat conditions that predict assemblage patterns. The age of the pits did not correlate with assemblage composition and species richness. There was a positive influence of macrophyte cover on waterbird species richness. Larger pits did not support more species, but species richness increased with connectivity. As alternative wetland habitats, gravel pits are attractive to waterbirds, when they act as stepping stones that ensure connectivity between larger natural and/or artificial wetlands separated in space.

AB  - Fragmentation of habitat is recognised as the number one threat to biodiversity and as such has attracted considerable research. However, much of this research has been conducted in forestry and agricultural environments, with little research in urban areas. In this study, field surveys were conducted measuring the impact of fragmentation on bird, frog, plant and fungi species richness, within the fragmented urban landscape of southern Sydney. Of all fragmentation parameters examined, remnant area was the best and most significant predictor of species richness for all taxa studied. Remnant size thresholds, below which biodiversity declined rapidly, were observed at approximately 4 ha for bird and frog species richness and approximately 2 ha for plant and fungal species richness. A further threshold appears to exist at approximately 50 ha for the dominance of forest interior species. Further relationships were also observed for perimeter:area ratio, indicating the influence of various edge effects on all taxa. Isolation effects were observed in the form of an inverse linear relationship between distance to other large reserves and species richness for fungi, birds and frogs. Corridor connectivity also produced an overall positive relationship for birds, frogs and plants. It is concluded that the identification of fragmentation thresholds and relationships provides an important management toot for the design of networks aimed at conserving biodiversity in fragmented urban environments.

AB  - Researchers, advocates and policymakers have proposed urban conservation as an emerging, integrative discipline that can contribute to sustainable cities by delivering co-benefits to human and non-human components of biodiversity. Given the recent growth in biodiversity-friendly designs and management schemes, there is an urgent need for a synthesis of this fragmented research base to inform planners and decision-makers. We conducted a systematic multidisciplinary literature review (787 papers) and found that the importance of urban areas for general conservation is not convincingly supported by empirical research. Only few studies demonstrated that cities can directly contribute to conservation efforts, by hosting viable populations of rare or endangered species, or by providing green corridors for the passage of natural populations. From a social perspective, while several studies demonstrated that green infrastructure could provide services for people (notably cultural services), only few studies explored the role of species diversity per se. Our review also shows strong geographical, location and taxonomic biases in urban biodiversity conservation research that make generalisations difficult. It is a disturbing paradox that while research in urban biodiversity conservation is rising exponentially, the main motivations for conserving urban biodiversity remain largely untested and unproven. We thus propose a framework for promoting integrative urban conservation research to bridge those gaps. Together, these findings warn against expanding cities under green planning and call for enhancing biodiversity experience by improving the quality of existing green spaces throughout the entire urban matrix. We provide a set of recommendations for practitioners and decision-makers to continue action. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Several studies reveal that the richness of fauna declines with urbanization- being able to live into urban areas, such as birds, mammals, and herpetofauna. This research aims to be the first one in estimating indirectly the potential urban fauna richness in Santiago. In order to achieve this, a multicriteria analysis was conducted based on five factors (human disturbance, energy present in the system, heterogeneity of land uses, complexity of land uses, and natural areas), which contribute to the fauna richness along with their respective relative weights. Thus, a potential fauna richness index (PFRI) was generated, whose mapping allowed the identification of favorable areas for the fauna richness (FAFR). In addition, the effect of a gradient of urbanization on FAFR was evaluated, the connectivity between FAFR was generated, and also the PFRI over the green areas, which belong to the urban area, was analyzed. As a result, in the urban area, the highest PFRI was displayed in the municipalities of Lampa, Lo Barnechea, Vitacura, and Penalolen, followed by San Bernardo, Puente Alto, Pudahuel, Las Condes y Quilicura. Connectivity between FAFR was located north-east of Santiago city and near the Andes. Public green areas showed a surface and a PFRI with low value, in contrast to private green areas, located north-east with the higher values. Additionally, there is no perceivable effecton the PFRI due to the gradient of urbanization. Perhaps it is because, near to the limit of the urban area, there are highly densified natural patches. Consequently, the urban areas in Santiago would not help increasing the fauna richness, being the most affected species those that inhabit in the ground. Finally, at the moment of evaluation of the fauna richness, not only a landscape study should be conducted, but also the local habitat characteristics should be incorporated, among which highlights the surface of the green areas. Also it is necessary to carry out an urban landscape planning, which leads to the connectivity between natural patches and green areas. This planning would allow the entry of fauna that circulates around urban areas, and thus would contribute to the improvement of biodiversity.

AB  - Research was carried out in the city of Turin (Northern Italy) in order to assess the suitability of the urban environment for fireflies.The study started in 2007 with an artistic and scientific project promoted by Parco Arte Vivente (PAV-Park of living art). Citizens joining the project recorded 18 areas where they could observe fireflies, which were identified as Luciola italica L. (Coleoptera Lampyridae). All of the 18 areas recorded by citizens were then visited during the summer of 2009 and the abundance of L. italica was estimated using transects. In 12 sites the presence of the firefly was confirmed. The habitat structures of L. italica were woods interspersed with clearings in the urban districts in the hills, and parks along rivers in the lower and more populated part of the city. In sites where fireflies were observed, the level of illuminance measured was significantly lower than in areas where L. italica was absent. The analysis of the landscape around the study areas showed a negative correlation between the extent of urbanization and fireflies abundance. Survival of L. italica populations in the urban area of Turin is influenced by the extent of green areas and the level of artificial illumination. Parks lying among rivers preserve a level of darkness suitable for fireflies and are connected by woody strips growing along the banks of rivers, that probably function as ecological corridors.

AB  - Approximately 100 years ago, unregulated harvest nearly eliminated white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from eastern North America, which subsequently served to catalyze wildlife management as a national priority. An extensive stock-replenishment effort soon followed, with deer broadly translocated among states as a means of re-establishment. However, an unintended consequence was that natural patterns of gene flow became obscured and pretranslocation signatures of population structure were replaced. We applied cutting-edge molecular and biogeographic tools to disentangle genetic signatures of historical management from those reflecting spatially heterogeneous dispersal by evaluating 35,099 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived via reduced-representation genomic sequencing from 1143 deer sampled statewide in Arkansas. We then employed Simpson's diversity index to summarize ancestry assignments and visualize spatial genetic transitions. Using sub-sampled transects across these transitions, we tested clinal patterns across loci against theoretical expectations of their response under scenarios of re-colonization and restricted dispersal. Two salient results emerged: (A) Genetic signatures from historic translocations are demonstrably apparent; and (B) Geographic filters (major rivers; urban centers; highways) now act as inflection points for the distribution of this contemporary ancestry. These results yielded a statewide assessment of contemporary population structure in deer as driven by historic translocations as well as ongoing processes. In addition, the analytical framework employed herein to effectively decipher extant/historic drivers of deer distribution in Arkansas is also applicable for other biodiversity elements with similarly complex demographic histories.

AB  - 1. Millions of dollars are spent on wildlife crossing structures intended to reduce the barrier effects of roads on wildlife. However, we know little about the degree to which these structures facilitate dispersal and gene flow.
   2. Our study incorporates two elements that are rarely used in the evaluation of wildlife crossing structures: an experimental design including a before and after comparison, and the use of genetic techniques to demonstrate effects on gene flow at both population and individual levels. We evaluated the effect of wildlife crossing structures ( canopy bridges and glider poles) on a gliding mammal, the squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis). We genotyped 399 individuals at eight microsatellite markers to analyse population structure, first-generation migrants and parentage relationships.
   3. We found that the freeway was not a complete genetic barrier, with a strong effect evident at only one site. We hypothesise that the presence of corridors alongside the freeway and throughout the surrounding landscape facilitated circuitous detours for squirrel gliders.
   4. Installing a crossing structure at the location with a strong barrier effect restored gene flow within just 5 years of mitigation.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our study highlights the importance of using genetic techniques not just to evaluate the success of road-crossing structures for wildlife, but also to guide their placement within the landscape. Managers wishing to reduce the effects of linear infrastructure on squirrel gliders and other arboreal mammals should aim to preserve and enhance vegetation along roadsides and within centre medians, as well as mitigate large gaps by implementing wildlife crossing structures.

AB  - The urbanization process of Bogota has a direct impact on tree cover, because construction projects prioritize logging instead of transplant, and their landscape projects do not generate sufficient compensation. The progressive reduction of green spaces and trees, diminish the necessary habitats for the birds. In the management of the urban trees that includes activities of planting, pruning, transplant and logging, the city applies procedures to reduce its impact on avifauna. Its environmental authority has generated information to expand knowledge and allow understanding of the dynamics between trees and urban birds, which serves as a basis to analyze the efficiency of its action, both in the birdlife management procedure and in the design and selection of species in new tree plantings. This article shows statistics from a review of avifauna management final reports in various infrastructure projects and the work's results of a study prepared between the District Department of Environment -SDA- and the Bogota's Ornithology Association -ABO-, in which technical criteria are formulated for the ecological connectivity with emphasis on bird conservation and consolidation of restoration processes in the city's main ecological structure.

AB  - The fragmentation of natural habitats is a major threat for biodiversity. However, the impact and spatial scale of natural isolation mechanisms leading to species loss, compared to anthropogenic fragmentation, are not clear, mainly due to differences between fragments and islands, such as matrix permeability. We studied a 500km(2) Mediterranean region in France, including urban habitat fragments, continuous habitat, and continental-shelf islands. On the basis of 295 floristic releves, we built species-area relationships to compare isolation in fragments after urbanization, with continuous habitat and continental-shelf islands. We assumed either no dispersal, infinite dispersal, or estimated intermediate levels of habitat reachability through graph theory. Isolation mechanisms occurred in fragments but with a lower strength than in near-shore islands, and most importantly affected perennial plants. Annual plants were less affected, probably due to their smaller size and shorter life cycle. Isolation occurred at landscape level in fragments and at patch level in islands. The amount of reachable habitat (accounting for spatial configuration) explained local species richness in both systems, but the amount of habitat (no consideration of spatial configuration) was already a good predictor. These results suggest an important role of habitat amount around fragments in mitigating the isolation effects observed in near-shore islands, and the importance of carefully considering different functional groups.

AB  - Urbanization is a major contributor to habitat loss and fragmentation and is considered a global threat to biodiversity. We studied reptile and amphibian species diversity and abundance in a highly fragmented landscape adjacent to the second largest metropolitan area in the United States. Habitat patches in our study area were made up of remnant native vegetation surrounded by roads, housing, and other urban development. Species richness and diversity were positively associated with patch size, but patch age was not significantly associated with community characteristics. Four relatively common species were not detected in the small patches, indicating the possibility they had been extirpated by the time monitoring began, and six rarer species were not detected or detected only once in these patches. Although the patch size effect on species diversity was strong, we found that several of the small habitat patches had similar diversity to large patches, indicating potential value of these small habitat patches in protecting species as "microreserves.'' In addition, one lizard species was found to be significantly more abundant in the smaller patches. To determine if abundance changed over time, we compared capture rates for four common lizards at the same sites ten years later. For three of the four species, abundance decreased over that period, specifically in the small patches. Although our long-term monitoring has confirmed that the full suite of herpetofauna is currently preserved in the study area overall, declines even in the common species over time hint at the potential severity of the threat of urbanization to rare species.

AB  - With the implementation of human activities, such as logging, reclamation, and construction, the increasing fragmentation of ecological space and the increasing blockage of biological migration corridors cause many threats to biodiversity conservation. In this study, we used the Northwest Beijing Ecological Containment Area as the research area. Based on an integrated circuit theoretical model, we identified functional connectivity networks and analyzed the spatial and temporal changes of ecological blockage patterns in the region from 1998-2018 in terms of the landscape connectivity, ecological breakpoints, pinch points, and barriers, respectively. The results show that the average remote sensing ecological index had a trend of decreasing and then increasing, and a total of 33, 34, and 63 habitat core areas and 70, 74, and 152 ecological corridors were identified in 1998, 2010, and 2018, respectively. The regions with high ecological blockage were mainly in the central part of Yanqing District, the southwest corner of the study area, and the eastern urban area. Although the number of potential ecological corridors gradually increases with the probability of migration in the study area, the blockage status and vulnerability of the ecological corridors continue to increase due to the conflict between land uses. The ecological status of the study area reflects the comprehensive effectiveness of the capital's high-quality development under the strategic deployment of ecological civilization. In the context of habitat fragmentation, the effective protection and restoration of the ecological conditions in the ecological function areas is of great importance in guaranteeing the ecological quality and sustainable development of the country.

AB  - The dispersal of marine organisms is a critical process for the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning across a seascape. Understanding the patterns of habitat connectivity that arise from the movement of multiple species can highlight the role of regional processes in maintaining local community structure. However, quantifying the probability and scale of dispersal for marine organisms remains a challenge. Here, we use a biophysical model to simulate dispersal, and we conduct a network analysis to predict connectivity patterns across scales for the community of invertebrates associated with seagrass habitat in British Columbia, Canada. We found many possible connections and few isolated habitat meadows, but the probability of most connections was low. Most habitat connections occurred within 3 days of dispersal time over short distances, indicating potential limits to long distance dispersal and little effect of species-specific dispersal abilities on the potential spatial extent of habitat connectivity. We then highlight the different roles that individual seagrass meadows can play in maintaining network connectivity. We also identify clusters of connected meadows and use these clusters to estimate the spatial scale of community dynamics. The connectivity patterns generated by our dispersal simulations highlight the importance of considering marine communities in their broad seascape context, with applications for the prioritization and conservation of habitat that maintains connectivity.</p>

AB  - Roads provide humans with a means of mobility between destinations, be it for transportation of goods and services or as a means of connecting with others. However, roads are also known to contribute toward a number of deleterious landscape processes, such as habitat destruction and fragmentation, pollution (e.g., chemical, noise and light) and animal mortality. Few studies however have investigated their effects on avifauna. We investigated the influence of road width on movements of nearby bird assemblages in Australia by comparing crossing counts of four species guilds and sizes over roads of varying widths in Southern Brisbane. In addition, we also sought to determine the association of seasonality with species crossing richness and abundance. Species guild affiliations were based on definitions from previous literature: small forest dependent, large forest dependent, honeyeater, and urban tolerant; whereas body size classifications were arbitrarily defined: small (< 20 cm), medium (20-29 cm), and large (> 30 cm). Road sites were selected based on their vegetation likeness, both within and between sites, and this was assessed using the Specht classification system. We detected strong, negative correlations between road width and forest species richness, crossing species richness and species crossing abundance. In particular, analysis of species guild classifications revealed species richness and crossing likelihoods of the small forest dependent guild to be consistently lower than those of large forest dependent, honeyeater and urban tolerant guilds. Analysis of species by body size classification yielded similar outcomes: small birds were consistently less likely to be present nearby and cross over roads of all widths compared to medium and large birds. We believe gap permeability, particularly changes in vegetation structure and complexity that may restrict a species ability to access to the gap, as well as competition and predation, play an important role in determining species presence and crossing likelihood. Dense vegetation is known to benefit smaller species due to the provision of foraging resources and shelter from larger, more aggressive species.

AB  - Cities are considered important refuges for insect pollinators. This has been shown repeatedly for wild bees, but may also be true for other diverse taxa such as hoverflies. However, our understanding of how urban environmental filters shape pollinator species communities and their traits is still limited. Here, we used wild bee and hoverfly species, communities and their functional traits to illustrate how environmental filters on the landscape and local scale shape urban species pools. The multi-taxon approach revealed that environmental filtering predominantly occurred at the landscape scale as urbanisation and 3D connectivity significantly structured the taxonomic and functional composition of wild bee (sociality, nesting, diet, body size) and hoverfly (larval food type, migratory status) communities. We identified urban winners and losers attributed to taxon-specific responses to urban filters. Our results suggest that insect pollinator conservation needs to take place primarily at the landscape level while considering species traits, especially by increasing habitat connectivity.

AB  - Urbanisation is a significant threatening process for amphibians, causing loss of habitat, altered hydrology and increased mortality. Impacts operate at different spatial scales and consequences vary depending on the sensitivity of individual species. Most studies of the impact of urbanisation on anurans have occurred in large metropolitan cities. There is a paucity of research in smaller urban settlements where the impacts of development may be less pronounced. We examined the richness and occurrence of anuran species in wetlands in regional towns in south-eastern Australia as a factor of natural and built features occurring at multiple spatial scales, and the socio-economic characteristics of surrounding neighbourhoods. Anuran species richness declined with increasing isolation of wetlands and reduced cover of terrestrial vegetation. The occurrence of two wide-spread anuran species was negatively related to level of urban intensity and positively related to neighbourhood vegetation cover, whereas the converse was true for a third common species. Vegetation cover was greater in neighbourhoods with 'higher' socioeconomic status (e.g. more disposable income). These less developed neighbourhoods occurred on the fringes of towns, often in elevated locations, and tended to support more anuran species. The level of urban intensity increased closer to town centres and more developed neighbourhoods with lower socio-economic status were often built in low-lying areas where wetlands tend to form naturally. Yet, these neighbourhoods harboured few anuran species.
   Our study suggests that careful planning of low-lying neighbourhoods near town centres and periurban neighbourhoods on town fringes is required to ensure anuran conservation in urban settlements. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Simple Summary On weekends, people do things differently from weekdays, such as dining at a restaurant, going to a night club, attending a concert or a sporting event, or simply staying up late. These leisure activities in the city can change the environment people live in and can hurt wildlife that also lives in the same city. We recorded bats in the city center and in the city periphery and compared how active bats were. We found that in the city center, bats were less active on weekends than weekdays. The opposite pattern was found in the city periphery. It is possible that bats moved from the city center to the city periphery on weekends. Thus, continuous greenways are important to facilitate bat movements and avoid human-wildlife conflict. City planners can add new parks and/or preserve old-growth vegetation to form the center-to-periphery greenways. In the urban environment, wildlife faces novel human disturbances in unique temporal patterns. The weekend effect describes that human activities on weekends trigger changes in the environment and impact wildlife negatively. Reduced occurrence, altered behaviors, and/or reduced fitness have been found in birds, ungulates, and meso-carnivores due to the weekend effect. We aimed to investigate if urban bat activity would differ on weekends from weekdays. We analyzed year-round bat acoustic monitoring data collected from two sites near the city center and two sites in the residential area/park complex in the city periphery. We constructed generalized linear models and found that bat activity was significantly lower on weekends as compared to weekdays during spring and summer at the site in the open space near the city center. In contrast, during the same seasons, the sites in the city periphery showed increased bat activity on weekends. Hourly bat activity overnight suggested that bats might move from the city center to the periphery on weekends. We demonstrated the behavioral adaptability in urban wildlife for co-existing with human. We recommend that urban planning should implement practices such as adding new greenspaces and/or preserving old-growth vegetation to form continuous greenways from the city center to the city periphery as corridors to facilitate bat movements and reduce possible human-wildlife conflict.

AB  - Birds are considered a good model for indicators of biodiversity response to habitat variations, as they are very sensitive to environmental change. However, continuous observations of habitat alterations from undisturbed landscapes to human-dominated ones, as well as the associated effects on bird biodiversity, are lacking. In this study, New Jiangwan Town in Shanghai, China was selected to illustrate the response of bird species, and thus biodiversity, to habitat loss and fragmentation. land use/land cover (LULC) data and bird records from 2002 to 2013 were collected and analyzed. The results suggested that, due to urban sprawl, the area of wetland and shrub land had dropped by 82.4% and 87.3% by the end of 2013. Four different urbanization stages were identified in terms of the spatio-temporal variations in the landscape. To measure bird biodiversity, species richness and relative abundance were calculated, and they could account for the overall trend in biodiversity but might mask the process of species replacement. As an indicator of biodiversity accounting, the mean species abundance (MSA) of the original species would not include exotic or invasive species in its calculation, and its value decreased from 100% to 76.8% to 52.2% to 24.5% in the four corresponding stages. Finally, suggested by redundant analysis, the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on bird biodiversity differed in various bird communities, and the area and connectivity of wetlands were the most significant variables. Our findings could provide important information to inform bird biodiversity protection and habitat restoration. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Roads are the link between geographic space and human socio-economic activities, promoting local economic development, and simultaneously causing various negative effects, such as segmentation, interference, destruction, degradation, and pollution. In China, the construction of roads is rapid, which might affect wildlife movement, landscape pattern, and land use change, thereby, affecting the conservation of heritage sites. In the present study, the minimum cumulative resistance model, along with geographic information system technology, was adopted to compute the ecological corridor for wildlife movement between the source patches and to analyze ecological corridor changes under two conditions (road presence/absence) at two time points in Kanas, nominated as a World Natural Heritage site. The relationships between the ecological corridor changes and various factors, including the cutting index of the road-effect zones', terrain, and road geometric characteristics, were examined using the geographical detector model to identify the influencing factors and mechanisms of the corridor changes, in order to rationally simulate the potential ecological corridors. In addition, the detached and fragmented ecological patches can be connected to effectively protect the biodiversity, biological habitats, and species, which are important means to achieve regional sustainable development and ecological construction.

AB  - 1. Throughout the world, decreased connectivity of fluvial habitats caused by artificial river channel alterations such as culverts, weirs and dykes is seen as an important threat to the long-term survival of many aquatic species. In addition to assessing habitat quality and abundance, wildlife managers are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of taking into account habitat connectivity when setting priorities for restoration. In this paper, a new approach of spatial analysis adapted to rivers and streams is proposed for modelling 2D functional habitat connectivity, integrating distance, costs and risk of travelling between habitat patches (e.g. daily use, spawning, refuge) for particular fish species, size classes and life stages.
   2. This approach was applied to a case study in which brown trout (Salmo trutta) habitat accessibility was examined and compared under various scenarios of stream restoration in a highly fragmented stream in Ile-de-France. Probabilities of reaching spawning habitats were estimated from a trout-populated area located downstream of the barriers and from potential daily-use habitat patches across the stream segment.
   3. The approach successfully helped prioritize restoration actions by identifying options that yield the greatest increase in accessible spawning habitat areas and connectivity between spawning habitat and daily-use habitat patches. This case study illustrates the practical use of the approach and the software in the context of river habitat management.

AB  - Globally, little is known about the dispersal abilities of carnivores, their survival in non-protected areas, and the connectivity between protected and non-protected populations. More than a decade of sighting data for 496 known African lions Panthera leo, with 189 individuals engaging in dispersing activities plus an exchange of cross-site information, has provided unique insight into connectivity and survival in unprotected and protected areas in Kenya. In particular, three individuals, across two generations residing solely in unprotected landscapes, demonstrated connectivity between three protected areas that, to our knowledge, have not previously been recognized as harbouring connected populations. These observations suggest that unprotected areas and the human communities that reside in them may successfully create corridors of tolerance that facilitate connectivity and the long-term persistence of lion populations, both within and outside protected areas.

AB  - Landscape genetics is an important framework for investigating the influence of spatial pattern on ecological process. Nevertheless, the standard analytic frameworks in landscape genetics have difficulty evaluating hypotheses about spatial processes in dynamic landscapes. We use a predictive hypothesis-driven approach to quantify the relative contribution of historic and contemporary processes to genetic connectivity. By confronting genetic data with models of historic and contemporary landscapes, we identify dispersal processes operating in naturally heterogeneous and human-altered systems. We demonstrate the approach using a case study of microsatellite polymorphism and indirect estimates of gene flow for a rainforest bird, the logrunner (Orthonyx temminckii). Of particular interest was how much information in the genetic data was attributable to processes occurring in the reconstructed historic landscape and contemporary human-modified landscape. A linear mixed model was used to estimate appropriate sampling variance from nonindependent data and information-theoretic model selection provided strength of evidence for alternative hypotheses. The contemporary landscape explained slightly more information in the genetic differentiation data than the historic landscape, and there was considerable evidence for a temporal shift in dispersal pattern. In contrast, migration rates estimated from genealogical information were primarily influenced by contemporary landscape change. We discovered that landscape heterogeneity facilitated gene flow before European settlement, but contemporary deforestation is rapidly becoming the most important barrier to logrunner dispersal.

AB  - Understanding the way in which habitat fragmentation disrupts animal dispersal is key to identifying effective and efficient conservation strategies. To differentiate the potential effectiveness of 2 frequently used strategies for increasing the connectivity of populations in fragmented landscapes-corridors and stepping stones-we combined 3 complimentary methods: behavioral studies at habitat edges, mark-recapture, and genetic analyses. Each of these methods addresses different steps in the dispersal process that a single intensive study could not address. We applied the 3 methods to the case study of Atrytonopsis new species 1, a rare butterfly endemic to a partially urbanized stretch of barrier islands in North Carolina (U. S. A.). Results of behavioral analyses showed the butterfly flew into urban and forested areas, but not over open beach; mark-recapture showed that the butterfly dispersed successfully through short stretches of urban areas (<500 m); and genetic studies showed that longer stretches of forest (>5 km) were a dispersal barrier, but shorter stretches of urban areas (<= 5 km) were not. Although results from all 3 methods indicated natural features in the landscape, not urbanization, were barriers to dispersal, when we combined the results we could determine where barriers might arise: forests restricted dispersal for the butterfly only when there were long stretches with no habitat. Therefore, urban areas have the potential to become a dispersal barrier if their extent increases, a finding that may have gone unnoticed if we had used a single approach. Protection of stepping stones should be sufficient to maintain connectivity for Atrytonopsis new species 1 at current levels of urbanization. Our research highlights how the use of complementary approaches for studying animal dispersal in fragmented landscapes can help identify conservation strategies.

AB  - The configuration of urban land-covers is essential for improving dwellers' environments and ecosystem services. A city-level comparison of land-cover changes along the Belt and Road is still unavailable due to the lack of intra-urban land products. A synergistic classification methodology of sub-pixel un-mixing, multiple indices, decision tree classifier, unsupervised (SMDU) classification was established in the study to examine urban land covers across 65 capital cities along the Belt and Road during 2000-2015. The overall accuracies of the 15 m resolution urban products (i.e., the impervious surface area, vegetation, bare soil, and water bodies) derived from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)/Operational Land Imager (OLI) images were 92.88% and 93.19%, with kappa coefficients of 0.84 and 0.85 in 2000 and 2015, respectively. The built-up areas of 65 capital cities increased from 23,696.25 km(2) to 29,257.51 km(2), with an average growth rate of 370.75 km(2)/y during 2000-2015. Moreover, urban impervious surface area (ISA) expanded with an average rate of 401.92 km(2)/y, while the total area of urban green space (UGS) decreased with an average rate of 17.59 km(2)/y. In different regions, UGS changes declined by 7.37% in humid cities but increased by 14.61% in arid cities. According to the landscape ecology indicators, urban land-cover configurations became more integrated (oShannon's Diversity Index (SHDI) = -0.063; oPatch Density (PD) = 0.054) and presented better connectivity (oConnectance Index (CON) = +0.594). The proposed method in this study improved the separation between ISA and bare soil in mixed pixels, and the 15 m intra-urban land-cover product provided essential details of complex urban landscapes and urban ecological needs compared with contemporary global products. These findings provide valuable information for urban planners dealing with human comfort and ecosystem service needs in urban areas.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a prevalent threat to biological diversity, and urbanization is a primary agent of fragmentation and a leading cause of species endangerment. Landscape biogeographic and local habitat characteristics can be important determinants of the distribution of species in habitat patches in urban landscapes. However, the specifics of which characteristics are most critical to maintaining biological diversity are not fully known for prairie ecosystems, especially in fragmented urban habitat. This study focuses on black-tailed prairie dogs along an urban gradient in Denver, CO. Prairie dogs have declined precipitously throughout the region and are an essential part of the prairie ecosystem, making them excellent study subjects. We identified a series of habitat fragments along a gradient of urbanization in the fully urbanized areas and south suburbs of Denver, CO, both containing and not containing prairie dogs. Local characteristics, including fragment slope and vegetative cover, and landscape characteristics, including fragment size, age and connectivity, were measured on each fragment. We used likelihood-based methods to explore which variables most accurately predicted prairie dog occurrence within our study area. Multiple factors influenced the distribution of prairie dogs in urban settings, with colony connectivity the strongest predictor of occupancy. Large and recently isolated fragments near other prairie dog colonies, flat areas and those with high graminoid cover were most likely to support prairie dog populations. Our study provides the first attempt to model prairie dog occurrence in highly fragmented urban habitat and has important implications for the management and conservation of prairie dogs.

AB  - We conducted extensive mist netting and radio tracking of common frugivorous, seed-dispersing, and tropical forest-dwelling blue-crowned manakins (Lepidothrix coronata; BCMA) and white-ruffed manakins (Corapipo altera; WRMA) to study their habitat use, movements, breeding success, and seed dispersal potential in the fragmented landscape of southern Costa Rica. We obtained 1354 GPS locations from 20 BCMAs and 4040 GPS locations from 54 WRMAs we tracked. These birds were dependent on forest remnants and rarely moved through open habitats. This was more likely for WRMAs, which were slightly more tolerant of forest fragmentation. BCMAs preferred the local Las Cruces Forest Reserve and riparian corridors to smaller (<10 ha) and more isolated forest fragments. Radio tracking showed that both species used small forest fragments less than expected based on the birds' sites of capture. In general, age ratios were immature-biased and sex ratios were female-biased, especially in riparian corridors, which enabled movements across the highly deforested landscape. Average daily nest survival rate was 92.2 % for BCMA nests and 97.1 % for WRMA nests. Both species used riparian corridors 3-5 times more than expected based on land cover, utilizing these corridors for food, water, breeding, and for moving across a highly deforested landscape. Although most movements of both species were 100 m or less, some birds moved more than 600 m between observations, sometimes in only 15 min. These manakins are abundant in the forest understory and are capable of dispersing seeds more than 600 m, helping the regeneration of native vegetation. Tropical countryside riparian corridors provide critical habitat and connectivity for these common seed-dispersing forest understory birds in a fragmented landscape.

AB  - The effects of habitat fragmentation and deforestation are exacerbated by some elements, such as roads and power lines, which may become filters or barriers to wildlife movements. In order to mitigate mortality and restore connectivity, wildlife passages are being constructed as linear corridors. The installation of these mitigation measures must be followed by systematic monitoring, in order to evaluate their use and effectiveness, to assist in their management, and to convince stakeholders of their value. In this paper we present the results of a monitoring study of the use of rope overpasses developed near a protected area in Porto Alegre, southern Brazil. The canopy bridges were installed by the Urban Monkeys Program in places where electric hazards and road-kills of brown howler monkeys (Alouatta guariba clamitans Cabrera, 1940) were recorded. Camera traps were installed at each bridge, and local people were selected and trained to monitor overpass use over 15 months, from August 2008 to October 2009. Three species were recorded using canopy bridges: brown howler monkey (Alouatta guariba clarnitans Cabrera, 1940), white-eared opossum (Didelphis albiventris Lund, 1840) and porcupine (Sphiggurus villosus Cuvier, 1823). Rope bridges with the highest number of species recorded had more forest cover and lower urban area around them than overpasses little used. Our results indicate that overpasses, in Porto Alegre, work as a linear corridor between forest remnants, although the outcomes for individual survival, group persistence, population demography or gene flow have not been measured. Furthermore, canopy bridges may be important to mitigate the impact of roads and power lines on wildlife, but electric cables also need to be completely isolated when present, to warrant animals' physical integrity.

AB  - Clarifying how species move across and utilize human-modified landscapes is key to the conservation of declining populations, as well as to the management and control of invasive species. The North American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) is a globally distributed invasive amphibian that has been implicated in the decline of native amphibians across its invasive range and may also act as a transport vector for a number of deadly amphibian pathogens. Identifying the landscape-level features that facilitate or hinder this species as it moves across an ever-changing landscape is necessary to inform control efforts and limit this species' impact on already declining amphibian populations. We conducted surveys of 243 wetlands across the Colorado Front Range and used an information-theoretic approach to evaluate the contribution of wetland-specific characteristics and landscape-level factors in determining the detection of bullfrog populations and breeding bullfrog populations. Specifically, our goal was to determine whether features related to overland dispersal or to the connectivity of wetlands were better predictors of bullfrog occurrence. Our results indicated that landscape-level factors that may either hinder or facilitate overland movement, such as topographic complexity and the density of wetlands, were the best predictors of bullfrog occurrence at the scale of our analysis, rather than characteristics relating to the connectivity of wetlands to lotic waterway systems. We suggest that when considering the control or eradication of this species, efforts should be directed at reducing hydroperiod of wetlands and should target regions with a high density of wetlands and/or low topographic relief.

AB  - Urban development increasingly occupies more landscape and is responsible for habitat alteration and fragmentation of so many ecosystems that urban environments can no longer be excluded from the areas to be considered in conservation strategies. Appropriate management measures ensuring population viability are needed, but due to the usually irreversible feature of the urbanisation process, the measure; may differ from non-urbanised areas. Sufficient gene flow levels, leading to successful seed production, appear to be a key element in the sustainable persistence of insect-pollinated plant remnant populations. This study investigated reproductive success and pollen dispersal patterns in Centaurea jacea, an insect-pollinated hay-meadow herb, in the Brussels urban area (Belgium). Reproductive performance of urban park populations was compared with populations occurring in urban semi-natural sites. Pollen dispersal patterns were examined within and among-population patches front two urban parks using fluorescent dye as a pollen analogue. Urban park populations showed a higher reproductive success than those in urban semi-natural sites. Depositions of fluorescent dye particles on recipient individuals were found within populations (< 20 m), among populations within parks (over a few hundred meters) and among parks (maximal investigated distance: 2.6 km), indicating pollinator movements and a potential gene flow by pollen over relatively long distances. Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution with respect to spatial distance. The very small populations received more immigrant dye deposition when located at short distances from the source population. These findings demonstrate that urban populations do not perform worse in reproductive success than populations from agricultural landscapes, despite their small size, and can function as a network exchanging pollen. The conversion of urban park lawns into interconnected networks of ecologically managed hay meadows, allowing simultaneous flowering and seed production in many patches of target species, is to be strongly encouraged.

AB  - Trees in urban landscapes provide a range of ecosystem services, including habitat, refugia, food, and corridors for other fauna and flora. However, there is some debate whether the richness and abundance of other biodiversity supported is influenced by the provenance of trees, i.e., native or non-native. This study assessed the presence of mistletoes and birds (and nests) in 1261 street trees. There were marked differences between native and non-native street trees, with the former having a significantly higher prevalence of birds (and nests) and supporting more species and in greater densities, whilst the latter supported a higher prevalence of mistletoes. Additionally, for birds, the proximity to green space, tree size and species were also important, whilst for mistletoes, the proximity to green space, slope aspect, and tree species were significant. Preference ratios indicated that some tree species had a higher than random occurrence of birds or mistletoes, whilst others had a low abundance. The indigenous tree species, Acacia karroo Hayne was the only reasonably abundant street tree species that was important for birds, nests, and mistletoes. At the street scale, there was a positive relationship between street tree species richness and bird species richness. These results emphasise the importance of selecting appropriate tree species if biodiversity conservation is a core outcome.

AB  - Context Graph-theoretic evaluations of habitat connectivity often rely upon least-cost path analyses to evaluate connectedness of habitat patches, based on an underlying cost surface. We present two improvements upon these methods. Objectives As a case study to test these methods, we evaluated habitat connectivity for the endangered San Martin titi monkey (Plecturocebus oenanthe) in north-central Peru, to prioritize habitat patches for conservation. Methods First, rather than using a single least-cost path between habitat patches, we analyzed multigraphs made up of multiple low-cost paths. This allows us to differentiate between patches connected through a single narrow corridor, and patches connected by a wide swath of traversable land. We evaluate potential movement pathways by iteratively removing paths and recomputing connectivity metrics. Second, instead of performing a sensitivity analysis by varying costs uniformly across the landscape, we generated landscapes with spatially varying costs. Results This approach produced a more informative assessment of connectivity than standard graph analyses. Of the 4340 habitat patches considered across the landscape, we identified the most important 100, those frequently ranked highly through repeated network modifications, for multiple metrics and cost surfaces. Conclusions These methods represent a novel approach for assessing connectivity, better accounting for spatial configurations of habitat patches and uncertainty in cost surfaces. The ability to identify habitat patches with more possible routes to other patches is of interest for resiliency planning and prioritization in the face of continued habitat loss and climate change. These methods should be broadly applicable to conservation planning for other wildlife species.

AB  - To support eco-friendly hydropower planning in developing regions, we propose a spatial optimization model for locating dams to balance tradeoffs between hydropower generation and migratory fish species richness. Our model incorporates two special features. First, it is tailored to the dispersal of tropical migratory fishes, which typically require long, unimpeded river stretches to complete their life-cycle. To model fish with this type of dispersal pattern, we introduce the concept of a river pathway, which represents a novel way to describe river connectivity. Second, it combines decisions about dam placement and removal, thus facilitating opportunities for hydropower offsetting. We apply our model to the Sao Francisco River basin, Brazil, an area of hydropower-freshwater biodiversity conflict. We find that dams have reduced weighted migratory fish richness 51% compared to a pre-dam baseline. We also find that even limited dam removal has the potential to significantly enhance fish biodiversity. Offsetting the removal of a single dam by the optimal siting of new dams could increase fish richness by 25% above the current average. Moving forward, optimizing new dam sites to increase hydropower by 20%, rather than selecting the fewest number of dams, could reduce fish species losses by 89%. If decisions about locating new dams are combined with dam removal, then a win-win can even be achieved with 20% greater hydropower and 19% higher species richness. Regardless of hydropower targets and dam removal options, a key observation is that optimal sites for dams are mostly located in the upper reaches of the basin rather than along the main stem of the Sao Francisco River or its main tributaries.

AB  - Urbanization rapidly changes landscape structure worldwide, thereby enlarging the human-wildlife interface. The emerging urban structures should have a key influence on the spread and distribution of wildlife diseases such as canine distemper, by shaping density, distribution and movements of wildlife. However, little is known about the role of urban structures as proxies for disease prevalence. To guide management, especially in densely populated cities, assessing the role of landscape structures in hampering or promoting disease prevalence is thus of paramount importance. Between 2008 and 2013, two epidemic waves of canine distemper hit the urban red fox (Vulpes vulpes) population of Berlin, Germany. The directly transmitted canine distemper virus (CDV) causes a virulent disease infecting a range of mammals with high host mortality, particularly in juveniles. We extracted information about CDV serological state (seropositive or seronegative), sex and age for 778 urban fox carcasses collected by the state laboratory Berlin Brandenburg. To assess the impact of urban landscape structure heterogeneity (e.g., richness) and shares of green and gray infrastructures at different spatial resolutions (areal of 28 ha, 78 ha, 314 ha) on seroprevalence we used Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models with binomial distributions. Our results indicated that predictors derived at a 28 ha resolution were most informative for describing landscape structure effects (AUC = 0.92). The probability to be seropositive decreased by 66% (0.6 to 0.2) with an increasing share of gray infrastructure (40 to 80%), suggesting that urbanization might hamper CDV spread in urban areas, owing to a decrease in host density (e.g., less foxes or raccoons) or an absence of wildlife movement corridors in strongly urbanized areas. However, less strongly transformed patches such as close-to-nature areas in direct proximity to water bodies were identified as high risk areas for CDV transmission. Therefore, surveillance and disease control actions targeting urban wildlife or human-wildlife interactions should focus on such areas. The possible underlying mechanisms explaining the prevalence distribution may be increased isolation, the absence of alternative hosts or an abiotic environment, all impairing the ability of CDV to persist without a host.

AB  - Understanding how human-dominated landscapes affect biodiversity and ecosystems is essential for effective conservation planning. This work aims to understand the relationship between the acoustic diversity of forested landscapes, and descriptors of habitat structure, composition, and anthropogenic pressure, as well as to identify the characteristic scale at which acoustic community diversity relates to those metrics in central Massachusetts. Ten passive acoustic recorders were placed within forest areas in central Massachusetts, during the breeding season. Mono audio recordings were collected during the dawn chorus. The relationship between acoustic indices (AI), and core habitat quality, connectivity, vegetation productivity, percent tree cover, human edge, artificial illumination, and traffic noise were assessed. Significant relationships were found between AI and variables related to habitat structure and human pressure. Sounds related to biota (biophony) and acoustic complexity were positively correlated with core habitat quality, connectivity, and vegetation while negatively correlated with human pressure variables, including nighttime lights, traffic noise, and human edge. AI can therefore act as successful indicators of habitat quality in highly modified landscapes The highest correlations were found at buffers between 1.5 and 3 Km. This response of AI to the broad spatial context and not to the local site characteristics indicate that they can act as robust landscapescale indicators. The large characteristic scale indicates that urban planning should consider potential impacts acting at scales beyond site planning. Moreover, conservation planning can benefit from managing the context matrix to support biodiversity, particularly traffic noise and artificial illumination reduction initiatives.

AB  - A major conservation objective of wildlife overpasses is to maintain levels of dispersal between fragmented areas of habitat, thereby allowing gene-flow and sustaining population viability of target species. We documented crossing rates of a range of avian species, of four defined species guilds, over a vegetated 15 m wide wildlife overpass in suburban Brisbane, south-eastern Queensland, Australia. The overpass spanned a 60 m wide major arterial road, and linked two areas of isolated sub-tropical eucalyptus forest. Crossing rates of these species guilds were also determined over the major road, and two other high-traffic roads, 20 and 90 m wide respectively.
   Species guilds differed markedly in their crossing rates of the overpass, and in their method of crossing. They also differed in their relative ability to cross high-traffic roads of different width. Our results indicate that, although honeyeater and large forest insectivore guilds made extensive use of the wildlife overpass as a foraging resource and as a conduit between forest areas, the conservation value of wildlife overpasses in relation to potential gene-flow lies mainly with the small insectivore species guild, predominantly with forest-dwelling species of lower bodyweight and with flight characteristics not well-suited to sustained direct flight. Differences between species within this guild may be linked to a range of inter-related factors, including flight capacity, habitat use, and evolutionary history.
   Overpasses specifically for birds have rarely, if ever, been constructed. It would, however, be relatively simple to incorporate narrow, linear strips of appropriate vegetation strata into multi-purpose overpasses to benefit these target species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental and ecological degradation can be monitored by biological indicators such as plants, yet little research has been done using subterranean organisms such as collembola, especially in cities. Collembola, a soil fauna group, can be used to assess soil quality and to decipher assembly rules of soil organisms in cities. Here, we review 75 articles on soil collembola in an urban context. We found that soil properties and landscape characteristics influenced soil communities. There is a need for more connectivity between green urban spaces to allow the dispersion of collembola. Little information is available on the assembly of collembola communities, on biotic interactions and on dynamics of colonisation.

AB  - Urbanization affects amphibian communities through habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation of habitat quality. The effects of these changes in habitat at different scales vary depending on the sensitivity of individual species. We assessed the breeding distribution of anurans along an urban-rural gradient in Shanghai, China, a region experiencing intensive urbanization. Our results showed that urban density had a significantly negative influence on the overall anuran abundance and diversity and that the responses of individual species to urbanization varied. Pond age was an overall predictor in models describing the responses of Pelophylax nigromaculatus, Fejervarya multistriata, and M. fissipes and total anuran abundance. The quality of habitat at a pond was also important, and the high abundance of Bufo gargarizans and Pelophy lax plancyi was associated with ponds with aquatic vegetation coverage. Urban density showed strong negative effects on B. gargarizans, total anuran abundance, and species richness. The broad-scale landscape variables associated with forests, agricultural fields, and wetlands surrounding breeding ponds have been shown to affect anuran abundance and species richness. The response of individual species, total abundance, and species richness to urbanization reflected differences in their ecological requirements. We quantified the effects of urbanization on frogs in a rapidly urbanizing region, and our results demonstrated that both multi-spatial and temporal variables affect anurans in Shanghai. Our results emphasized the importance of anuran conservation planning in urbanized areas to preserve and/or restore terrestrial habitat and to improve connectivity between ponds and other wetlands.

AB  - Human activities have tremendous impact on the environment but the extent of this influence on animals is frequently unknown. Here we focus on a ubiquitous man-made landscape element, power line corridors in forested areas where vegetation is regularly mowed, and its effects on avian species richness and abundance. We surveyed bird communities at 35 sites in southern Czech Republic and found power line corridors hosted on average three more bird species and eight more individuals than transects in the surrounding forests. The lesser whitethroat (Sylvia curruca) and the tree sparrow (Passer montanus) were the most frequently detected species under power lines, suggesting the importance of these habitats for openhabitat specialists. Overall, we found positive effects of this human-altered landscape element on avian communities but future studies could focus on communities of other animals in this habitat with an emphasis on the presence of endangered species.

AB  - Suitability of the local habitat (habitat filtering') and dispersal between stream reaches determines the composition of insect communities, and urban land use may affect both processes. While urban streams are often poor habitats for insects and dispersal between them is often hindered, conservation and restoration activities generally focus solely on the local (in-stream) environment.
   We determined whether in-stream habitat filtering (a local' process) or dispersal between reaches (a regional' process) controlled assemblage composition in a landscape subject to ongoing urban development (urbanizing'). We compared models incorporating geographic distance between sites, environmental dissimilarity, and land-use/land-cover attributes of dispersal pathways in an attempt to explain the dissimilarity of stream insect assemblages. Distance and land-use/land-cover attributes were characterised along both overland (straight line) and corridor pathways.
   Both in-stream habitat filtering and dispersal affected assemblage composition, but habitat had a stronger influence. Overland distance was a better predictor of assemblage dissimilarity than corridor distance, implying stream insect dispersal occurs across catchment boundaries as well as along stream corridors. The best model incorporated land-use/land-cover attributes along dispersal pathways, which supported the idea that urban land-use in the terrestrial environment mediates dispersal.
   Conservation and restoration strategies for streams in urbanizing landscapes that focus on local habitat quality and ignore dispersal are missing a potentially important mechanism affecting insect assemblage composition. While the primary focus should be on maintaining or improving the local habitat, potential dispersal pathways should also be considered.

AB  - The recent development of landscape ecology emphasizes the importance of connectivity for population viability. Landscape connectivity is the degree to which the landscape facilitates or impedes movement among resource patches. Most of the empirical data identifying landscape spatial patterns (connectedness) that interfere with individual movements, concern walking animals with low powers of dispersal. For flying animals, the distance between patches is measured in almost all cases using euclidean distance. This does not account for the behavioural characteristics of species that depend on landscape patterns for their movements. We hypothesized that the presence of Short-toed Tree Creeper (Certhia brachydactyla) depends on landscape spatial structure, so we tested it in two contrasting rural landscapes. These adjacent landscapes differ in grain size, the quality of linear landscape elements delimiting fields, and their history. in the recently reclaimed polder, Tree Creepers are only present in linear rows of trees with a high degree of connection, long enough to support the home range of this bird (supplementation process). Colonisation of this recent landscape from the 'bocage', acting as a source of dispersers, required connectedness between hedgerows and planted dykes (source-sink process).

AB  - Private gardens provide vital opportunities for people to interact with nature. The most popular form of interaction is through garden bird feeding. Understanding how landscape features and seasons determine patterns of movement of feeder-using songbirds is key to maximising the well-being benefits they provide. To determine these patterns we established three networks of automated data loggers along a gradient of greenspace fragmentation. Over a 12-month period we tracked 452 tagged blue tits Cyantistes caeruleus and great tits Parus major moving between feeder pairs 9,848 times, to address two questions: (i) Do urban features within different forms, and season, influence structural (presence-absence of connections between feeders by birds) and functional (frequency of these connections) connectivity? (ii) Are there general patterns of structural and functional connectivity across forms? Vegetation cover increased connectivity in all three networks, whereas the presence of road gaps negatively affected functional but not structural connectivity. Across networks structural connectivity was lowest in the summer when birds maintain breeding territories, however patterns of functional connectivity appeared to vary with habitat fragmentation. Using empirical data this study shows how key urban features and season influence movement of feeder-using songbirds, and we provide evidence that this is related to greenspace fragmentation.

AB  - Exotic plant invasions have triggered environmental and economic problems throughout the world. Our ability to manage these invasions is hindered by the difficulty of predicting spread in fragmented landscapes. Because the spatial pattern of invasions depends on the dispersal characteristics of the invasive species and the configuration of suitable habitat within the landscape, a universal management strategy is unlikely to succeed for any particular species. We suggest that the most effective management strategy may be an adaptive one that shifts from local control to landscape management depending on the specific invader and landscape. In particular, we addressed the question of where management activities should be focused to minimize spread of the invading species. By simulating an invasion across a real landscape (Antietam National Battlefield in Maryland, USA), we examined the importance of patch size and connectivity to management success. We found that the best management strategy depended on the dispersal characteristics of the exotic species. Species with a high probability of random long-distance dispersal were best managed by focusing on the largest patches, while species with a lower probability of random long-distance dispersal were best managed by considering landscape configuration and connectivity of the patches. Connectivity metrics from network analysis were useful for identifying the most effective places to focus management efforts. These results provide insight into invasion patterns of various species and suggest a general rule for managers in National Parks and other places where invasive species are a concern.

AB  - Understanding the effects of local habitat and wider landscape connectivity factors on tick presence, nymph density and Borrelia species (spp.) prevalence in the tick population is important for identifying the public health risk from Lyme borreliosis. This multi-city study collected data in three southern England cities (Bath, Bristol, and Southampton) during spring, summer, and autumn in 2017. Focusing specifically on urban green space used for recreation which were clearly in urbanised areas, 72 locations were sampled. Additionally, geospatial datasets on urban green space coverage within 250 m and 1 km of sampling points, as well as distance to woodland were incorporated into statistical models. Distance to woodland was negatively associated with tick presence and nymph density, particularly during spring and summer. Furthermore, we observed an interaction effect between habitat and season for tick presence and nymph density, with woodland habitat having greater tick presence and nymph density during spring. Borrelia spp. infected Ixodes ricinus were found in woodland, woodland edge and under canopy habitats in Bath and Southampton. Overall Borrelia spp. prevalence in nymphs was 2.8%, similar to wider UK studies assessing prevalence in Ixodes ricinus in rural areas. Bird-related Borrelia genospecies dominated across sites, suggesting bird reservoir hosts may be important in urban green space settings for feeding and infecting ticks. Whilst overall density of infected nymphs across the three cities was low (0.03 per 100 m2), risk should be further investigated by incorporating data on tick bites acquired in urban settings, and subsequent Lyme borreliosis transmission.

AB  - Compared to conventional approaches, the integration of population size analysis with habitat suitability assessment on a large scale can provide more evidence to explain the mechanisms of habitat isolation and fragmentation, and thus make regional conservation plans. In this paper, we analyzed the habitat suitability for giant pandas in the Minshan Mountains, China, using the ecological-niche factor analysis (ENFA) method, and then evaluated the current conservation status of this endangered species. The results showed that (1) giant pandas were distributed in a narrow altitudinal range in which vegetation cover was dominated by coniferous forest, mixed coniferous and deciduous broadleaf forest, and deciduous broadleaf forest with scattered bamboo understory, and (2) roads and human settlements had strong negative effects on the panda habitat selection. According to habitat analysis, the total habitat area of giant panda in the Minshan Mountains was 953,173 ha, which was fragmented into 12 habitat units by major roads, rivers, and human settlements. The habitat of the mid-Minshan was less fragmentized, but was seriously fragmented in the north. The panda population size estimation showed that 676 individuals inhabited the study area, and 94.53% of them were in the mid-Minshan, but small panda populations less than 30 individuals inhabited the isolated and fragmented habitat patches in the north. The nature reserves in the Minshan Mountains have formed three conservation groups, which covered 41.26% of panda habitat and protected 70.71% of panda population of the study area, but there still exists two conservation gaps, and the connectivity among these reserves is still weak. Due to habitat isolation and extensive human disturbances, giant pandas in the north (i.e., Diebu, Zhouqu, and Wudou) are facing threats of local extinction. In order to protect pandas and their habitats in this area, some effective conservation approaches, such as establishing new reserves in gap areas, creating corridors among patches, and seasonally controlling traffic flux in key roads, should be implemented in the future to link these isolated habitats together.

AB  - City life is harsh and inhospitable for many animal species, particularly for non-volant mammals that face increased mortality risks in urban settings. Yet, studies on non-volant city mammals are limited and mostly restricted to temperate regions. Here, I evaluated the density and adaptability of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a species with a series of advantageous pre-adaptations that could facilitate city life, in highly built up urban environments of a tropical city Joao Pessoa (>800,000 people), in NE Brazil. I surveyed a total of 56 streets from seven randomly chosen districts within the city. I used multiple linear regression to determine the factors that could influence marmoset abundance. I found a total of 53 tree species of which half could be used as food resources. To reach food resources marmosets moved along and crossed streets using insulated power lines and phone cables. Marmoset density (66.9 ind/km(2)) was significantly low compared to populations inhabiting forest remnants. Nevertheless, along streets with high canopy cover, their density was similar to that reported for forest fragments. Canopy cover and trees providing food resources were key predictors of marmoset abundance. The presence of an exotic tree species (Terminalia catappa) that provides gum, showed to be key for groups persisting in extremely urbanized areas. Planting more of this species and increasing connectivity between forested areas are management strategies that might help long term persistence of marmosets in highly built up areas. Marmosets are common in Brazilian cities and could provide opportunities for contact with nature and increased well-being of human urban dwellers.

AB  - Life for human populations in high-density urban areas can be considerably enriched by being in closer contact with nature, leading to many benefits for psychological well-being. The movement, colours and sounds of birds can be particularly attractive and the steps taken to create suitable and sustainable habitats for them in urban landscapes can make city-life much more attractive for a significant part of the human population. The challenges set by the ecology of a humid tropical environment are examined. Based on fundamental ecological principles guidance is provided for the landscaping design and species planting for cities in SE Asia. The conservation of wild refuges, wise park planting, and well-laid out ecological corridors are all critical components which need to play together. Advice is provided on the types of species, both indigenous and exotic, which can be used and how these interact with particular bird species in the Malay Peninsula. As the ecosystems of tropical SE Asia rapidly change in the face of large-scale resource exploitation such activities in cities are increasingly important in keeping alive a public awareness of the dependence of economic development upon environmental sustainability.

AB  - Globally insects are declining, but some guilds of pollinators are finding refuge in urban landscapes. The body of knowledge on urban pollinators is relatively mature, which means it is now possible to begin to make generalization. Unfortunately, studies do not represent climatic regions evenly and there is a gap in research from the African continent. This study aimed to address some of the gaps on urban pollination knowledge in South Africa and to identify opportunities to improve urban habitats for pollinators. We reviewed the international literature on urban pollinators and the South African literature on pollinators with a landscape ecology focus, drawing on literature with an emphasis on agricultural and ecosystem services. The findings show that some taxa (e.g. large-bodied, cavity nesting bees) will exploit urban environments increasing in abundance with urban intensity. Moderately sensitive taxa (such as small-bodied, ground-nesting bees) take advantage of urban environments only if local habitats are supportive of their needs for resource provision and habitat connectivity. The South African urban poor rely on pollination services for subsistence agriculture and the reproduction of wild-foraged medicines and food. Potential interventions to improve habitat quality include strategic mowing practices, conversion of turf-grass to floral rich habitats, scientific confirmation of lists of highly attractive flowers, and inclusion of small-scale flower patches throughout the urban matrix. Further research is needed to fill the Africa gap for both specialized and generalized pollinators (Diptera, Halictids, Lepidoptera and Hopliini) in urban areas where ornamental and indigenous flowering plants are valued.

AB  - Urbanisation often has profound impacts on ecological processes. Management of these impacts is central to urban conservation efforts. We used data from 6591 individually ringed weaver birds from 42 ringing locations to investigate the influence that the urban matrix, as well as patch isolation, size and quality, had on weaver bird movement between ringing locations in Cape Town, a growing city within a global biodiversity hotspot. Distance-based linear models revealed that proximity to other sites was the dominant predictor of weaver movement while the site variables (wetland size and bird abundance) had a limited and inconclusive influence. Once the variation explained by the proximity and site variables had been accounted for, the composition of the surrounding urban matrix, the length of the least cost path between wetlands, and the presence of rivers as potential movement corridors (measured at three spatial scales) all had little influence on weaver movement. Analysis of the weaver bird movement-wetland network using social network analysis showed that the network is simple, clustered, and non-random, with relatively high vulnerability to node loss and some indication of preferential attachment (i.e., increased use of more used sites). Since proximity (site isolation) is the dominant influence on weaver movements, and the network is already sparse, further wetland loss is likely to reduce population viability. Our results match the predictions of classical theory and suggest that patch management will matter more for wetland passerines than matrix management. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban sprawl has led over wide areas to alteration and fragmentation of so many ecosystem types that it becomes essential to consider biodiversity conservation in urban planning. As the urbanisation is usually irreversible, the urban context has to be taken into account when defining appropriate management measures to sustain viable populations. Connectivity through pollen flow appears to be a key-factor for the long-term persistence of populations of insect-pollinated plant species. We investigated pollen dispersal using fluorescent dye as pollen analogue in Lychnis flos-cuculi, an insect-pollinated wetland herb, along the Woluwe River, in Brussels urban zone (Belgium). Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution, with particles mainly deposited on neighbouring individuals and populations. The mean distance of dye transfer was 133.6 m, with a maximal distance of 523.7 m. Dye deposition was positively related to the number of potential recipient plants when distance to dye source was held constant. This may be associated with a higher flowering plant density across the flying distance that increases attractiveness and visitation rate of pollinators, and/or with secondary dye transfer. When connected, small and large populations only differed in response to the number of potential recipients. The small isolated population received little immigrant pollen flow, but remained a dye donor. Our study demonstrates that small populations of L. flos-cucli along an urban river may still exchange pollen thanks to pollinator movements, and might therefore be regarded in management planning as potential connecting components between populations.

AB  - ContextWild flowering plants and their wild insect visitors are of great importance for pollination. Montane meadows are biodiversity hotspots for flowering plants and pollinators, but they are contracting due to tree invasion.ObjectivesThis study quantified flowering plants and their flower-visitor species in montane meadows in the western Cascade Range of Oregon. Species diversity in small, isolated meadows was expected to be lower and nested relative to large meadows. Alternatively, landform features may influence richness and spatial turnover.MethodsFlowering plants and their visitors were sampled in summers of 2011-2017 in twelve montane meadows with varying soil moisture. All flowering plants and all flower-visitors were recorded during five to seven 15min watches in ten 3x3m plots in each meadow and year.ResultsA total of 178 flowering plant species, 688 flower-visitor species and 137,916 interactions were identified. Richness of flower-visitors was related to meadow patch size, but neither plant nor flower-visitor richness was related to isolation measured as meadow area within 1000m. Species in small meadows were not nested subsets of those in large meadows. Species replacement accounted for more than 78% of dissimilarity between meadows and was positively related to differences in soil moisture.ConclusionsAlthough larger meadows contained more species, landform features have influenced meadow configuration, persistence, and soil moisture, contributing to high plant and insect species diversity. Hence, conservation and restoration of a variety of meadow types may promote landscape diversity of wild plants and pollinators.

AB  - Global climate change threatens the structure and function of ecological communities in urban areas, including public and private gardens. An adaptation strategy was developed to accommodate the challenges of urban greenspace design under a changing climate. The strategy offers a protocol for planting design that focuses on adding resilience to plantings rather than matching specific plant species to specific predictions of climate change. The adaptation strategy begins by rating locally appropriate plant species on ecological criteria for plasticity, functional redundancy, response diversity, and structural diversity. The plant palette is then developed within the confines set by ecological value and aesthetic goals, plus cultural and financial considerations. Collective application of the strategy at smaller scales across the urban landscape has the potential to protect and expand nature corridors that are resilient to climate change and to provide a low cost version of assisted migration. Examples of how to apply the adaptation strategy demonstrate that the approach is not specific to place or scale, and does not require extensive training or bring added expense. The benefits and manageable challenges of the strategy are discussed in relation to biodiversity conservation, social impact, the opportunity for "designed" experiments that examine urban ecosystem processes, and existing model forecasts for climate change.

AB  - Urban plans for pedestrian-friendly environments by reducing exposure to air pollutants and enhancing movement are crucial for public health and accessibility of social infrastructure. Here, we develop a novel network analysis-based approach, which identifies pivotal local walkways that lower exposure risk to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) while improving the urban landscape connectivity. We employ an exponential distance-decay model and partial correlation analysis to estimate traffic-induced PM2.5 and to test the relationship between the proxies and actual PM2.5 concentrations, respectively. We use a proxy for pedestrians' PM2.5 exposure as a movement cost when conducting network analyses to compute pedestrian network centrality, reflecting both low PM2.5 exposure risk and landscape connectivity. As a result, we found a significant contribution of traffic to the estimated PM2.5 exposure and PM2.5 concentrations. We also found that walkways make a large contribution to regional connectivity regardless of the estimated PM2.5 exposure risk owing to the composition and configuration of urban landscape elements. Regarding the spatial features and planning context, this study suggests four types of pedestrian networks to provide urban authorities with useful practical information in city-wide urban plans for enhancing walkability: PM2.5 reduction required; PM2.5 reduction recommended; optimal areas; and alternatives of optimal areas.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) fertilizer has often been generously applied to increase crop biomass yield. Although the influences of inorganic N fertilizer on soil microbial communities have been widely studied, the effect of N fertilizer on microbial co-occurrence networks and its metagenome is largely unknown. Further, seasonal changes in microbial community responses to N addition have rarely been reported. In this study, three N fertilizer rates (0, 56, 196 kg N/ha) were applied annually in switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) grown for bioenergy production in the upper Midwest, USA. The soil microbiome was affected by both fertilizer and low pH in the 7th year of fertilization treatments. The microbial community structures were relatively stable during the growing season for each N fertilizer rate. However, the excess N fertilizer (196N) increased the seasonal variation of bacterial and fungal communities. Network analysis showed that the microbial interactions at the 196N treatment were more intense, with decreased bacteria-fungal interactions compared to 56N and 0N. This suggests that the microbial community became more sensitive to environmental change under the influence of long-term excess N fertilizer. Metagenomic analysis showed that the long-term excess N fertilizer promoted many metabolic processes, especially carbohydrate and amino acid related metabolism and Archaea mediated ammonia oxidation. However, N fertilizer also reduced many other traits, especially N2 fixation and signal transduction, the latter of which may contribute to the decreased interactions between bacteria and fungi.

AB  - Information on mechanisms of differentiation or homogenization of urban floras is deficient, despite their importance for urban nature conservation and urban land management. Roads, as a major human promoter of urbanization, can be an initial habitat for plants dispersed by transportations. We assumed that variation in weed vegetation along urban-rural roadside gradients is small, particularly in curbside cracks. We classified vegetation occurring in curbside cracks along the National Route 3 in southern japan and compared the characteristics of the vegetation types recognized. Species in curbside cracks were recorded on 40 plots. Three vegetation types were classified, in part related to surrounding land-use types. Although the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and the number of native species clearly differed among the vegetation types in the curbside cracks, no significant differences between the three floristic vegetation types were found in the number of non-natives and invasive alien species. This may result from the small specificity and complexity of landscape structures, due to the continuity and connectivity of paved-road networks. Of the 122 species, 44 were non-natives or invasive alien species. The vegetation types generally involved the same plant families, with large numbers of species from the Asteraceae and Poaceae, regardless of vegetation types, but frequency of occurrence of the two families clearly differed between natives and non-natives and invasive alien species. Ephemeral non-natives and invasive alien species. particularly Asteraceae and Poaceae, seem to have advantageous dispersal strategies or low habitat dependency facilitating their occurrence in curbside cracks, regardless of adjacent land uses and the urban-rural landscape gradient. Expansion of these species may cause a homogenization of regional floras along roads. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban green spaces (UGSs) play a crucial role in supporting urban ecological systems and improving human well-being in cities. The spatial patterns of UGS are vital bases for analyzing various ecological processes. However, few studies have investigated morphological UGS patterns, especially in high-density cities. The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) in China is one of the four major bay areas in the world. The aim of this study was to investigate the patterns and distributions of UGS in the core GBA cities (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Hong Kong, and Macao), and discuss the shortcomings and potential environmental impacts of the contemporary patterns of UGS. Morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) was used to analyze the spatial UGS pattern. Seven MSPA metrics (core, islet, perforation, edge, loop, bridge, and branch) were assessed to measure morphological UGS patterns. The results showed that: (1) Hong Kong has the highest quality habitat, with a large and continuous distribution of UGSs, and a few smaller green spaces scattered in built-up areas; (2) Guangzhou's UGSs are unevenly distributed, with large green spaces concentrated in the northern part of the city and many small, scattered green spaces distributed in built-up areas, demonstrating the most prominent pattern of green space fragmentation; (3) green space patches in the Shenzhen-Hong Kong region exhibit a relatively complex form; and (4) the UGS in Zhuhai-Macao is relatively discrete, and its connectivity is relatively low. These findings not only improve the depth of understanding of the spatial pattern of UGS in the GBA, but also confirm the applicability of MSPA in the analysis of spatial patterns of UGS.

AB  - The "fragmentation-barrier" effect of road network expansion on landscape function draws attention throughout the world. Presently, there is a lack of quantitative analysis to integrate different ecological effects of road networks at landscape scale to depict, compare and evaluate landscape changes. In this study, the "Probability of Connectivity (PC)" index was used to evaluate the effects of road networks on landscape connectivity for an area in Xishuangbanna, Southwest China. The results indicate that the fragmentation effect of road networks decreased in PC value by 15.81%, the barrier effect of road networks decreased in PC value by 11.73% and the combination of the two effects decreased PC value by 32.78%. In conclusion, the combined fragmentation and barrier effects of road networks considerably degraded landscape connectivity more than either individual effect. In addition, the fragmentation effect influenced connectivity to a greater degree for ecological processes having low movement abilities. The barrier effect influenced connectivity to a greater degree for medium to high movement abilities. The combined effects influenced connectivity for those ecological processes of low movement ability within the study area. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Green roofs are often installed atop buildings to provide ecological services such as mitigating storm water runoff and cooling air within urban heat islands. We found that green roofs in Portland, Oregon, also can support biodiversity, including a diverse assemblage of parasitoid wasps, with 20 morphospecies from 10 families present on the four roofs we surveyed. The roofs with greater plant diversity and structural complexity harbored comparatively more parasitoid morphospecies than the structurally simpler Sedum-dominated roofs. The oldest green roof supported much greater diversity than the younger roofs, including a comparably planted roof three times its size. Parasitoid wasps from the Hymenopteran families we found are high-trophic-level organisms known to feed on a variety of arthropods, including many insects commonly considered to be pests in urban areas. We suggest that green roofs have the potential to provide an often-overlooked ecological service by supporting parasitoid wasps that can act as natural biological control agents.

AB  - How best to manage forest patches, mitigate the consequences of forest fragmentation, and enable landscape permeability are key questions facing conservation scientists and managers. Many temperate forests have become increasingly fragmented, resulting in reduced interior forest habitat, increased edge habitats, and reduced connectivity. Using a citizen science landscape-scale mark-release-recapture study on 87 macro-moth species, we investigated how both life-history traits and landscape characteristics predicted macro-moth responses to forest fragmentation. Wingspan, wing shape, adult feeding, and larval feeding guild predicted macro-moth mobility, although the predictive power of wingspan and wing shape depended on the species' affinity to the forest. Solitary trees and small fragments functioned as stepping stones, especially when their landscape connectivity was increased, by being positioned within hedgerows or within a favorable matrix. Mobile forest specialists were most affected by forest fragmentation: despite their high intrinsic dispersal capability, these species were confined mostly to the largest of the forest patches due to their strong affinity for the forest habitat, and were also heavily dependent on forest connectivity in order to cross the agricultural matrix. Forest fragments need to be larger than five hectares and to have interior forest more than 100 m from the edge in order to sustain populations of forest specialists. Our study provides new insights into the movement patterns of a functionally important insect group, with implications for the landscape-scale management of forest patches within agricultural landscapes.

AB  - The analysis of urban ecosystems is crucial for building resilience in cities and moving towards their sustainability. One of the fundamental components of these ecosystems is the urban forest. To determine the contributions and effects of trees in cities, a sample of the urban area of the city of Turrialba in central Costa Rica was analyzed using the model iTree Eco, which allows the main ecosystem services provided by trees in cities to be valued. Although in this study it was not possible to quantify all the ecosystem services included in the model, it was possible to analyze the elements and structural context of the study area, the value of carbon sequestration and storage, as well as the structural value of the trees. Annually, in the study area, with 18 tree species identified, more than 60 000 USD are generated from these three ecosystem services alone. Of the species identified, Zygia longifolia stood out for its greater abundance and leaf area, Erythrina poeppigiana in height and greater carbon storage, Mangifera indica in greater carbon sequestration and oxygen production, and Veitchia sp with the greatest structural value. Likewise, it was evident that maintaining the riverbanks of the Turrialba River and its tributaries, in its passage through the urban area of this city, provides the greatest amount of ecosystem services derived from the trees it keeps and where there is still a significant potential to include new plantations.

AB  - The Natural Range of Variability is a concept used under the ecosystem management paradigm that means understanding the disturbance-driven spatial and temporal variability of the ecological systems and mimicking them in management strategies. With this project, we developed a framework that permitted addressing biodiversity issues under the lens of the Natural Range of Variability (NRV) for a managed public forest in central-west Alberta. To do so, we brought together a spatial harvest scheduler, a fire and succession landscape simulator, and a toolbox of biodiversity indicator models. Indicator models, that encompass landscape configuration, ecosystem diversity, stand internal habitat features and species-specific habitat supply models, were applied on the outputs of the landscape dynamics simulator to define the NRV. The risk of losing biodiversity values in applying the forest management strategy was addressed by comparing indicators outputs over the simulation horizon with their respective NRV. Results demonstrate that no forest-age-related indicator evaluated on the harvest scheduler output shows an important deviation from the NRV. However, in regards to forest cover types there is obviously a loss in ecosystem diversity, as a direct effect of the stand composition control of the silvicultural strategies. We found that patch size distribution is generally compliant with the NRV, although we observed more large patches and better connectivity for old growth patches under fire-driven landscapes. We also found that downed woody debris volume and many understory vegetation (ground lichen, herb and shrub) covers were at risk. Over the seventeen wildlife species, we detected nine species that could be jeopardized by important loss of habitats. Back-tracking bottleneck forest conditions that put these biodiversity values at risk has allowed development of recommendations with regards to landscape design and adapted practices.

AB  - The Atlantic Forest in Paraguay has been severely affected by large-scale habitat loss and fragmentation, processes that have increasingly isolated its protected areas. Here we identified priority areas capable of maximizing connectivity between protected areas for multiple species while minimizing potential socio-economic conflicts in Paraguay's Atlantic Forest. We built multi-scale habitat suitability models for 15 species and mapped connectivity using circuit theory and least-cost path methods. Then, we used connectivity maps and different socioeconomic factors to identify priority areas. We created three scenarios to explore the effects of including socio-economic factors in prioritization: Optimized-connectivity Scenario that assumes no conflicts; Optimistic Conflict Scenario that seeks a balance between biodiversity and socio-economic interests, with the former having greater priority over the latter; and Pessimistic Conflict Scenario that represents a high conflict situation. The inclusion of socio-economic data in the analysis caused a shift in priority areas from east to west and reduced the representation of connectivity by up to 15%. Regardless of the scenario considered, forest restoration is needed to improve connectivity. The Optimistic Conflict Scenario returned the likely most cost-effective solution because, compared to the Optimized-connectivity Scenario, the 7% decline in connectivity (from 34 to 27%) was offset by a reduction in restoration efforts from 2.2% to 0.6% of the study area. Our study presents solutions to balance the trade-offs between socio-economic issues and connectivity conservation in Paraguay's Atlantic Forest. In particular, well-planned conservation and restoration efforts outside protected boundaries have the potential to improve connectivity while boosting local socio-economic development.

AB  - Unsheltered homelessness in the United States forces hundreds of thousands of people to sleep, eat, and live in the public sphere. Urban parks often become temporary homes for individuals facing poverty, substance addiction, mental illness, servitude, and other social concerns. For individuals facing homelessness, these parks are primary sources of stability in often desperate situations. Residing in parks and protected areas, however, raises concerns for the residents in terms of personal health and safety, and raises other concerns for public health, public safety, and environmental impacts. This research considers the relationships between unsheltered homelessness and perspectives of local environmental conditions. Surveys were completed by recreational users (n = 332) of City Creek Canyon, a riparian corridor in Salt Lake City, Utah, to understand visitors' perspectives of the social and environmental impacts of unsheltered homelessness in the area. Results indicate an overall awareness of homelessness in the area, and a simultaneous indication that homelessness does little to affect either recreational behavior or perceived environmental impacts to the water, wildlife, or overall ecological functioning. Implications from this research illuminate that common responses of forced displacement of individuals facing homelessness from parks-by law enforcement, health department, or park management officials-represent not only social justice concerns but also environmental justice concerns for those facing homelessness. Similar to "right to the city" movements, access to environmental resources, in this case a place to live, represents an environmental justice issue for some of the most marginalized members of our communities.

AB  - The majority of forests in urban areas are small and isolated. Improving habitat quality of small forests instead of increasing habitat size and connectivity could be an effective means of conserving the biodiversity of such highly fragmented landscapes. In this study, we investigated the relative importance of habitat quantity, quality and isolation on butterfly assemblages in urban fragmented forests in Tokyo, Japan. We used four habitat geographic parameters: (1) fragment size, (2) shape index, (3) isolation (distance to the mainland), and (4) connectivity; and three habitat quality parameters: (1) herbaceous nectar plant abundance, (2) herbaceous nectar plant diversity, and (3) larval host plant diversity. We surveyed butterfly assemblages along transects in 20 forest fragments that ranged in size from 1 to 122 ha. We used generalized linear models to relate the number of species in a fragment to four habitat geographic parameters and three habitat quality parameters. The averaged models based on AIC(c) showed that fragment size had a strong positive effect on butterfly species richness. There was also a positive effect of herbaceous nectar plant abundance on species diversity. These findings suggest that improving the habitat quality of small and isolated forests in highly fragmented landscapes may be capable of maintaining levels of butterfly diversity comparable to those of large fragments.

AB  - Green roofs could mitigate the negative effects of urbanization by providing habitats for arthropods. However, more studies are necessary to understand if these new ecosystems can harbor similar numbers of species and levels of ecological processes than habitats at the ground-level. In 15 houses of 1-2 floors with extensive green roofs from a semi-rural area in Cordoba (central Argentina), we analyzed the species richness and abundance of arthropods on green roofs and their neighboring ground-level habitats and evaluated the influence of landscape composition (proportion of buildings, grasslands, and streets). We focus on feeding groups (herbivores, predators, omnivores, detritivores, parasitoids, and pollinators) and two ecological processes (herbivory and predation). Moreover, we tested two factors that may drive the communities on ground-level habitats and green roofs: habitat area and plant species richness. Species richness and abundance of arthropods (total and by feeding groups), and predation rates were significantly higher in ground-level habitats than on green roofs. Nevertheless, arthropod diversity on living roofs was striking, with almost 400 species from different feeding groups. Street cover in the landscape negatively affected total richness and several feeding groups. On ground-level habitats, herbivory increased with street cover and predation with grassland cover. The main factor driving arthropods in both green roofs and ground-level habitats was habitat area, whereas plant richness had a positive effect only in predators, detritivores, and omnivores. Our results reinforce the role of green roofs as habitat for arthropod species in semi-rural areas of Latin-American countries, where the evidence was so far lacking.

AB  - Pollen dispersal in tropical seed plants is established mainly by biotic vectors, both in intact and fragmented environments. In urban landscapes, the segregation of natural remnants by an artificial matrix can reduce pollinator foraging efficiency. It is unknown how nectarivorous bats, regarded as long-distance pollen dispersers, respond to such habitat structure combined with city-related factors. Here, we investigated the pollen dispersal pattern between spatially segregated individuals of the bat-pollinated Bignoniaceae Crescentia cujete within an urban environment. From 2015 to 2017, we assessed their spatiotemporal structure, breeding system and annual fruit set in order to relate these factors to the bat activity in the region. We employed fluorescent dyes as pollen analogues to infer the role of bats in pollen flow. Adding to the low density of individuals, we found a low daily flower emission and low flowering synchrony (S = 0,092), all of which are traits that favor outcrossing. Individuals were distributed in two distant groups (>600 m), with no occurrence of dye flow between them. In contrast, flow within the same individual was intense, which points toward bats' territorial behavior. C. cujete is self-compatible, but not autogamous; therefore, despite few outcross events, bats could be ensuring the plant's year-round fruit production mainly through self-pollination. Our findings show restricted bat foraging extent, which affects overall pollen dispersal distance and population connectivity. These results can be extrapolated to natural metapopulations inserted in an urban matrix and serve as a groundwork for studying directly the effect of city-related factors on pollinator behavior.

AB  - The source-sink model of population dynamics predicts that density drives emigration of subordinate animals to habitats offering lower competition for resources. Several authors have suggested use of this model as a potential framework for conservation of exploited carnivores when precise enumeration is unfeasible. Dispersal is a critical behavioural mechanism for management based on this model, yet there is a lack of knowledge on the habitat and social conditions that motivate carnivore emigration and settlement. The cougar Puma concolor is a widely distributed and heavily exploited carnivore, indigenous to the western hemisphere. We evaluated patterns in cougar dispersal behaviour from two sites in Utah, differing in terms of management and the level of natural and anthropogenic habitat fragmentation. We used our results to evaluate three predictions with respect to cougar dispersal behaviour: 1) natal population density and maternal reproductive status prompt emigration, 2) movement of dispersing cougars is shaped by habitat configuration and permeability, and 3) dispersers preferentially settle in areas of high habitat quality and low conspecific density. We documented the emigration of 62 individuals and measured movement variables, including sex and site-specific frequency, distance, seasonality, direction and the habitat quality and harvest rates characterizing areas where immigrants settled. Although males and females exhibited pronounced differences in dispersal frequency, we found few differences in distance traveled, season of departure and direction moved. Dispersal occurred most frequently during spring, coinciding with the estrus pulse. Natural and anthropogenic obstacles modified landscape permeability, and therefore dispersal distances were shorter in fragmented habitats than in contiguous ones. Relative to males, females dispersed into habitats of lower productivity with higher mean annual harvest rates. Patterns in male settlement suggested habitat selection based on mating opportunities, whereas female settlement was predicated on avoiding conspecifics. Cougars in this Great Basin ecosystem largely conformed to source-sink predictions. Results can be used to parameterize source-sink models based on animal behaviour and landscape permeability to conserve exploited carnivores, under conditions of population expansion or recoionization of habitats where Alee effects are a limiting factor.

AB  - Urbanization may have a large affect on biodiversity patterns by enhancing biological invasions. Urban habitats harbour high numbers of introduced plant species and may function as starting points for invasions along urban-rural gradients. As information on underlying mechanisms is critical for managing biological invasions, we test the role of rivers as dispersal corridors for primarily wind-dispersed ornamentals. We released tagged fruits of three invasive tree species in the Spree River (Berlin, Germany) and directly observed the fate of the floating samaras. The number of floating samaras declined exponentially with distance from the release point. A quarter floated 1200 m within 3 h. Despite marked differences in fruit morphology, there were no interspecific differences in floating capacity. We showed hydrochory to be an effective dispersal agent in wind-dispersed tree species, extending wind-related transport distances by several times. In this way, rivers are expected to link urban propagule sources with natural habitats downstream. Our results suggest that planting native tree species along river corridors would help prevent invasion risks and contribute to implementing principles of ecological design in urban greenways and generally consider the importance of eradicating wind-dispersed invasive tree species in floodplains in early invasion stages to prevent further water-mediated dispersal.

AB  - The conflict between humans and wild animals is a special type of phenomena between human development and wild animal conservation, not only leading to massive economic loss to local residents, but also imposing severe impacts upon the production and living activities and even personal safety of the residents. Human-elephant conflict has existed as a phenomenon of human settlement development for more than 20 years in Xishuangbanna, China. There are periodic incidents of wild elephants hurting/killing people as well as feeding on and destroying subsistence and cash crops. It is an increasingly urgent and important issue for China to resolve while protecting and managing Asian elephants. Our study employed an Ecological-Niche Factor Analysis model to perform a risk assessment of areas where the Asian elephant currently is distributed and to predict future risks. It employed a Circuit Theory model based on random walk theory to predict multiple potential movement or migration pathways of Asian elephants within Xishuangbanna. The results indicated that: (1) the regions with human-elephant conflict risk in Xishuangbanna Prefecture had an area of about 4349.08 km(2), accounting for 22.77% of the total prefecture area, with the risk regions primarily present in the middle and north parts of Menghai County and Jinghong City and in Mengla County in which there was a wide geographical distribution covering from the south to the north; (2) The regions of agriculture and garden that were close to Asian elephant distribution and roads were likely occurring risk; (3) There were more potential movement paths of elephants within Mengyang and Menghai distribution regions, which indicated that the connection of these areas was better. While the potential movement paths of elephants within Mengla and Shangyong were little; (4) There were some potential movement paths between different distribution areas of Asian elephant, but the migration possibility of elephants in different distribution areas was decreasing due to natural barriers (Mengyang-Menghai has Lancang river) and discontinuous potential paths between Mengla and Shangyong. Additionally, we discussed that created ecological corridors between different natural reserves to allow more dispersal and gene flow of elephants and diminish conflict between human and elephant. We also put forward compensation suggestions in different risk area. We hope our analytical methods can be applied, improved and expanded to other areas with similar wildlife damage.

AB  - The three main landscape dynamics now underway in Europe urban sprawl, agricultural intensification and rural abandonment are observed in a Catalan study area located in an edge environment between a metropolitan fringe and two natural protected sites. In this context, ecological connectivity becomes a key to host biodiversity. By applying to the available land cover maps several landscape metrics and modelling, we perform a historical landscape analysis of the changes experienced in land-use patterns and ecological processes. The results show up the relevant connectivity role played by the traditional agro-forest mosaics that linked both sides of the edge, providing a heterogeneous but continuous land matrix able to maintain high species richness. However these agro-forest mosaics are currently disappearing due to the ongoing urban sprawl and agricultural intensification in the plain, and reforestation leading to rural abandonment in the mountains. The current location of Mediterranean orchids in the study area is used to demonstrate that the results obtained through the ecological landscape assessment are not an analytical construct, but reflect the actual loss of meadows and open grazing spaces formerly created in woodland areas by a traditional multiple-use of forest and pastures now abandoned. The results show up that recovering the historical dynamics behind the current land-use patterns is a necessity for the emerging approaches to integrated biological conservation seeking a more complex and multidimensional management of sustainable cultural landscapes.

AB  - This study addresses social-ecological dynamics in the greater metropolitan area of Stockholm County, Sweden, with special focus on the National Urban Park (NUP). It is part of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) and has the following specific objectives: (1) to provide scientific information on biodiversity patterns, ecosystem dynamics, and ecosystem services generated; (2) to map interplay between actors and institutions involved in management of ecosystem services; and (3) to identify strategies for strengthening social-ecological resilience. The green areas in Stockholm County deliver numerous ecosystem services, for example, air filtration, regulation of microclimate, noise reduction, surface water drainage, recreational and cultural values, nutrient retention, and pollination and seed dispersal. Recreation is among the most important services and NUP, for example, has more than 15 million visitors per year. More than 65 organizations representing 175,000 members are involved in management of ecosystem services. However, because of population increase and urban growth during the last three decades, the region displays a quite dramatic loss of green areas and biodiversity. An important future focus is how management may reduce increasing isolation of urban green areas and enhance connectivity. Comanagement should be considered where locally managed green space may function as buffer zones and for management of weak links that connect larger green areas; for example, there are three such areas around NUP identified. Preliminary results indicate that areas of informal management represent centers on which to base adaptive comanagement, with the potential to strengthen biodiversity management and resilience in the landscape.

AB  - The effect of landscape dynamics on carabid communities was investigated using a chronosequence of managed grassland sites. A total of 52 carabid species was found. Species richness was significantly higher in early than in later stages of grassland succession. The change from an arable land to a grassland carabid community was almost complete 10 years after the conversion to grassland. The accompanying change in the dominant feeding mode indicates a marked shift in the functional structure of the carabid community from arable land to grassland. Correlation analysis revealed a positive response of phytophagous species to dense and species-rich grassland vegetation that was only loosely related to grassland age.
   Invasion of grassland species was largely confined to the early stages of carabid succession. On the other hand, loss of species continued until the latest stage of the chronosequence, though many species preferring arable land had already vanished a short time after the conversion to grassland. The species turnover was independent of the dispersal abilities of the carabid species involved. This is probably due to the high spatial connectivity of suitable habitats in the small-scale landscape mosaic of the Lahn-Dill-Bergland.
   It is concluded that the variety of land use (arable land versus grassland) contributes considerably more to the species richness of carabids at the landscape level than the simultaneous availability of grassland sites of different age, provided that areas converted to grassland are allowed to persist for at least 10 years. The missing invasion of additional species into later stages of grassland succession can partly be explained by the premature state that is maintained at the older sites by management.

AB  - For organisms that reproduce in discrete habitat patches, land cover between patches (known as the matrix) is important for dispersal among breeding sites. Models of patchy populations often incorporate information on the permeability of the matrix to dispersal, sometimes based on expert opinion. I estimated the relative resistance to gene flow of land cover types and barriers using F-ST calculated from microsatellite markers in two amphibians, within an 800-km(2) area in northern Switzerland. The species included a frog (Rana temporaria: 996 individuals, 48 populations, seven markers) and a newt (Triturus alpestris: 816 individuals, 41 populations, seven markers). Open fields and urban areas were more resistant to gene flow than forested land; roads and highways also reduced permeability. Results were similar for the two species. However, differences in resistance among matrix elements were relatively low: gene flow through urban areas was reduced by only 24-42% relative to forest; a divided highway reduced gene flow by 11-40% and was 7-8 times more resistant than a secondary road. These data offer an empirically based alternative to expert opinion for setting relative resistance values in landscape models.

AB  - Urbanization has recently emerged as an exciting new direction for evolutionary research founded on our growing understanding of rapid evolution paired with the expansion of novel urban habitats. Urbanization can influence adaptive and nonadaptive evolution in urban-dwelling species, but generalized patterns and the predictability of urban evolutionary responses within populations remain unclear. This editorial introduces the special feature "Evolution in Urban Environments" and addresses four major emerging themes, which include: (a) adaptive evolution and phenotypic plasticity via physiological responses to urban climate, (b) adaptive evolution via phenotype-environment relationships in urban habitats, (c) population connectivity and genetic drift in urban landscapes, and (d) human-wildlife interactions in urban spaces. Here, we present the 16 articles (12 empirical, 3 review, 1 capstone) within this issue and how they represent each of these four emerging themes in urban evolutionary biology. Finally, we discuss how these articles address previous questions and have now raised new ones, highlighting important new directions for the field.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has dramatically spurred economic development since the 1980s, especially in China, but has had negative impacts on natural resources since it is an irreversible process. Thus, timely monitoring and quantitative analysis of the changes in land use over time and identification of landscape pattern variation related to growth modes in different periods are essential. This study aimed to inspect spatiotemporal characteristics of landscape pattern responses to land use changes in Xuzhou, China durfing the period of 1985-2015. In this context, we propose a new spectral index, called the Normalized Difference Enhanced Urban Index (NDEUI), which combines Nighttime light from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System with annual maximum Enhanced Vegetation Index to reduce the detection confusion between urban areas and barren land. The NDEUI-assisted random forests algorithm was implemented to obtain the land use/land cover maps of Xuzhou in 1985, 1995, 2005, and 2015, respectively. Four different periods (1985-1995, 1995-2005, 2005-2015, and 1985-2015) were chosen for the change analysis of land use and landscape patterns. The results indicate that the urban area has increased by about 30.65%, 10.54%, 68.77%, and 143.75% during the four periods at the main expense of agricultural land, respectively. The spatial trend maps revealed that continuous transition from other land use types into urban land has occurred in a dual-core development mode throughout the urbanization process. We quantified the patch complexity, aggregation, connectivity, and diversity of the landscape, employing a number of landscape metrics to represent the changes in landscape patterns at both the class and landscape levels. The results show that with respect to the four aspects of landscape patterns, there were considerable differences among the four years, mainly owing to the increasing dominance of urbanized land. Spatiotemporal variation in landscape patterns was examined based on 900 x 900 m sub-grids. Combined with the land use changes and spatiotemporal variations in landscape patterns, urban growth mainly occurred in a leapfrog mode along both sides of the roads during the period of 1985 to 1995, and then shifted into edge-expansion mode during the period of 1995 to 2005, and the edge-expansion and leapfrog modes coexisted in the period from 2005 to 2015. The high value spatiotemporal information generated using remote sensing and geographic information system in this study could assist urban planners and policymakers to better understand urban dynamics and evaluate their spatiotemporal and environmental impacts at the local level to enable sustainable urban planning in the future.

AB  - Roads and associated human development are prevalent features in many landscapes and can have significant impacts on wildlife populations, including the creation of barriers to movement that can reduce connectivity within and among populations. We evaluated how a highway in the northern Rocky Mountains influenced movements of American black bears (Ursus americanus) in a landscape modified by humans, resulting from human residences, recreation, and resource extraction. The objectives of the study were to determine habitat characteristics that were selected at locations where bears crossed the highway and develop and evaluate a predictive model for road-crossing locations based on habitat characteristics. Eleven out of 23 black bears fitted with GPS collars crossed highway 95 at least once. When bears crossed the highway they selected for specific habitat attributes, at both roadside and landscape scales, characterized by forested areas away from human development, with additional important habitat features including distance to cover, amount of shrub along the highway, and distance to water. Validation of our model with 24 independent highway crossing events from 2 years demonstrated high model predictability. We described how animal movement data can be used to identify and predict important road crossing areas for wildlife, which can assist in designing planning strategies for roadways and landscapes to facilitate wildlife movement to maintain connectivity among populations and to reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions.

AB  - Aim: The aim of the present study was to estimate the diversity and abundance of native bee fauna in an urban green space in Bengaluru, India.
   Methodology: Native bees were sampled from ten observational plots randomly selected from a 20 ha urban green space. Bee diversity and abundance were recorded at 15-day interval and estimated using diversity indices.
   Results: Nineteen species and thirteen genera under Apidae. Halictidae, and Megachilidae family were recorded. Bee species under Apidae were the most abundant, with four social, five solitary, and one kleptoparasitic species, followed by Halictidae and Megachilidae, with five and four solitary bee species, respectively. Trigona iridipennis was the dominant species followed by Apis dorsata among the social bees, and Lasioglossum sp. and Hriades sp. were dominant among the solitary bees. The number of cavity nesting species was more that of tree-nesting or ground-nesting species. Shannon's and Simpson's diversity indices confirmed the species richness, species abundance, and uniform distribution of native bee species in the urban green space.
   Interpretation: Green patches within urban areas can support a diverse population of bees. The study area consisted of both social and solitary bees. Cavity-nesting and oligolectic generalist bees were more predominant in the urban area, thus confirming the role of urban spaces in adding to bee diversity. Green pockets within urban areas support a diverse population of bees, and urban green spaces and green corridors can help to conserve bee biodiversity and, in turn, the urban ecosystem.

AB  - Community-driven vertical greenery provides a previously under-appreciated resource that could be an important component of tropical urban ecology. While the corridors of buildings have been designed to facilitate the circulation of residents between spaces, this study shows that such corridors incidentally served as an informal space for community-driven vertical greenery. Across 1.86 ha of surveyed corridors, a total of 265 plant species and cultivars were present, with an average richness of 124 species per hectare. This is beneficial to urban ecology through its high species diversity, occurrence of endangered and vulnerable native species. Based on a classification of specific plant attributes referenced from literature, provision of food and medicinal resources (77.5%), and aesthetic benefits (72.3%) were the key ecosystem services provided by the species present. Community-driven vertical greenery could function as refugia for native species of conservation interest through providing an additional buffer against further losses in the wild. It also provides immediate opportunities for interactions between humans and nature. This study finds that corridors with larger areas and simpler geometries typically hold a higher abundance of plant pots. Future efforts to increase the abundance and diversity of vertical greenery, and its concomitant increase in the provision of ecosystem services, could be driven by local communities, rather than be formally planned by landscape architects, engineers and urban planners.

AB  - Landscape connectivity for wildlife populations is declining globally due to increasing development and habitat fragmentation. However, outside of full protection of undeveloped wildlife corridors, conservation planners have limited tools to identify the appropriate level of densification such that landscape permeability for wildlife is maintained. Here we sought to determine the development characteristics that contribute to movement potential in an exurban landscape for a large carnivore, the puma. We first fit a piecewise step-selection function from movement paths from 28 male pumas to identify threshold levels of development that produce barriers to movement. We then applied this threshold to projected housing densities of existing parcels under a full General Plan buildout scenario in Santa Cruz County to illustrate how parcels at risk of increasing above the puma movement threshold can be identified. Finally, we tested the relative importance of characteristics associated with parcels and the surrounding area on relative puma movement. We found that pumas exhibit avoidance of housing density that saturates at a threshold, and that puma utilization of parcels at risk of densification above this threshold is predicted by parcel area and the housing density and area of surrounding parcels. Our work suggests that maintaining permeability in developing landscapes is likely contingent on preventing densification and parcel subdivision in exurban areas. We discuss how our findings and approach can be used by conservation planners to promote landscape permeability in already partially developed landscapes.

AB  - Understanding the spatial patterns and environmental drivers of freshwater diversity and community structure is a key challenge in biogeography and conservation biology. However, previous studies have focussed primarily on taxonomic diversity and have largely ignored the phylogenetic and functional facets resulting in an incomplete understanding of the community assembly. Here, we examine the influence of local environmental, hydrological proximity effects, land-use type and spatial structuring on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic (using taxonomic relatedness as a proxy) alpha and beta diversity (including the turnover and nestedness-resultant components) of pond macroinvertebrate communities. Ninety-five ponds across urban and non-urban land-uses in Leicestershire, UK were examined. Functional and phylogenetic alpha diversity were negatively correlated with species richness. At the alpha scale, functional diversity and taxonomic richness were primarily determined by local environmental factors while phylogenetic alpha diversity was driven by spatial factors. Compositional variation (beta diversity) of the different facets and components of functional and phylogenetic diversity were largely determined by local environmental variables. Pond surface area, dry phase length and macrophyte cover were consistently important predictors of the different facets and components of alpha and beta diversity. Our results suggest that pond management activities aimed at improving biodiversity should focus on improving and/or restoring local environmental conditions. Quantifying alpha and beta diversity of the different biodiversity facets facilitates a more accurate assessment of patterns in diversity and community structure. Integrating taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity into conservation strategies will increase their efficiency and effectiveness, and maximise biodiversity protection in human-modified landscapes.

AB  - Plantation forestry has been widely used for industrial purposes, creating vast extensions of culture forests. Although these plantations have a primary economic goal, they may indirectly serve other functions, such as landscape connectivity. Eucalypts are among the main plantation species used worldwide. In those areas in which they are not native, eucalyptus have been regarded as pernicious species for autochthonous forest and forest dwelling fauna. However, they may enhance connectivity between natural forest patches, thus favouring faunal dispersal. In Cantabria (Spain), Eucalyptus globulus were extensively planted in deforested areas mainly occupied by bushes and meadows. Here, we examine whether their massive introduction has modified landscape connectivity in the region. We used two indices based on graph theory and on the habitat availability concept (Integral Index of Connectivity and Probability of Connectivity), and applied them to the current forest network. Our results show how eucalyptus afforestation, principally based on temporary woodlands, has not improved forest connectivity in Cantabria significantly, though in the coast some of the new plantation areas may be locally important. Specific management actions targeted at these particularly relevant patches may enhance faunal dispersal and thus maintain biodiversity by reducing the fragmentation of these highly humanized areas.

AB  - As part of the urban environment, urban water bodies, lakes and rivers consist in oxygenating surfaces that support and simplify the functions of the urban landscape. Our research, undertaken for the first time in Romania, aims to establish the place and role of lacustrine water bodies and the manner we define the structure and functions of urban oxygenating surfaces, for the quality of natural capital and urban biodiversity. We used cartographic sources which we corroborated with field data in order to calculate quantitative indicators. We obtained a hierarchy of existent urban lakes in cities located in the South-West Oltenia Development Region. Also, to highlight the importance and role of urban lakes in the structure and ecological, social and economic functions of oxygenating surfaces, we calculated a series of indicators: the surface share of urban lakes to the administrative-territorial unit and oxygenating surfaces; the lakes' surface per capita and per administrative-territorial unit population; the distance between urban lakes and residential areas, the centrality level of lakes within a city; the level of accessibility; the share of urban lakes within the constructed surface; the social diversity on the proximity of urban lakes (number and type of housing - private, collective; number of schools, kindergartens or cultural institutions) and sensitive urban areas. We also established a hierarchy of the analyzed cities by the way urban lakes are valued (for recreation, water sports, sport fishing, water transportation or educational activities). Our main results consist in an extensive database that will help decision-makers implement solutions for a better urban planning and manage the natural capital in a sustainable way. Our study will be continued and improved with results on the topo-phobia and topo-philia of urban oxygenated surfaces and urban lakes. We also consider important to establish the role of water bodies as ecological corridors, for increasing urban biodiversity.

AB  - Aim Understanding the drivers of speciation within islands is key to explain the high levels of invertebrate diversification and endemism often observed within islands. Here, we propose an insular topoclimate model for Quaternary diversification (ITQD), and test the general prediction that, within a radially eroded conical island, glacial climate conditions facilitate the divergence of populations within species across valleys. Location Gran Canaria, Canary Islands. Taxon The Laparocerus tessellatus beetle species complex (Coleoptera, Curculionidae). Methods We characterize individual-level genomic relationships using single nucleotide polymorphisms produced by double-digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq). A range of parameter values were explored in order to filter our data. We assess individual relatedness, species boundaries, demographic history and spatial patterns of connectivity. Results The total number of ddRAD-seq loci per sample ranges from 4,576 to 512, with 11.12% and 4.84% of missing data respectively, depending on the filtering parameter combination. We consistently infer four genetically distinct ancestral populations and two presumed cases of admixture, one of which is largely restricted to high altitudes. Bayes factor delimitation support the hypothesis of four species, which is consistent with the four inferred ancestral gene pools. Landscape resistance analyses identified genomic relatedness among individuals in two out of the four inferred species to be best explained by annual precipitation during the last glacial maximum rather than geographic distance. Main conclusions Our data reveal a complex speciation history involving population isolation and admixture, with broad support for the ITQD model here proposed. We suggest that further studies are needed to test the generality of our model, and enrich our understanding of the evolutionary process in island invertebrates. Our results demonstrate the power of ddRAD-seq data to provide a detailed understanding of the temporal and spatial dynamics of insular biodiversity.

AB  - Variation in the size of home range of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) has broad implications for managing populations, agricultural damage, and disease spread and transmission. Size of home range of deer also varies seasonally because plant phenology dictates the vegetation types that are used as foraging or resting sites. Knowledge of the landscape configuration and connectivity that contributes to variation in size of home range of deer for the region is needed to fully understand differences and similarities of deer ecology throughout the Midwest. We developed a research team from four Midwestern states to investigate how size of home range of deer in agro-forested landscapes is influenced by variations in landscape characteristics that provide essential habitat components. We found that for resident female deer, annual size of home range in Illinois (mean = 0.99 km(2)), Michigan (mean = 1.34 km(2)), Nebraska (mean = 1.20 km(2)), and Wisconsin (mean = 1.47 km(2)) did not differ across the region (F (3,175) = 0.42, P = 0.737), but differences between agricultural growing and nongrowing periods were apparent. Variables influencing size of home range included: distance to forests, roads, and urban development from the centroid of deer home range, and percent of crop as well as four landscape pattern indices (contrast-weighted edge density, mean nearest neighbor, area-weighted mean shape index, and patch size coefficient of variation). We also identified differences in model selection for four landscapes created hierarchically to reflect levels of landscape connectivity determined from perceived ability of deer to traverse the landscape. Connectivity of selected forested regions within agro-forested ecosystems across the Midwest plays a greater role in understanding the size of home ranges than traditional definitions of deer habitat conditions and landscape configuration.

AB  - Green corridors are an attempt to mitigate negative effects of the built environment of cities and towns. The corridors act as conservation for rapidly extreme intervention and development of the urban environment. Most importantly, it enables dispersal movement of animals within city areas. Issues relate to wildlife conservation in urban areas has been studied for many years and thus, the research makes a review for how the green corridors contribute to the conservation of urban wildlife. This study reviews groups of articles in disciplines of urban landscape planning and biology conservation to discuss the relationship between elements of green corridors and urban wildlife dispersal movement behaviour in Malaysian context. Accordingly, this research is purposely studied to give understanding on how green corridors contribute to the animals' ability of moving and dispersing within the built-up areas. In advance, it is found that there are three factors contribute to the capability of colonization among urban wildlife which are individual, physical and social factor. Green corridor has been defined as one of the physical factor that influence urban wildlife behaviour movement. Consequently, safety area indicating to animals species for traversing in any time such as at night can be defined as the primary potential corridor.

AB  - Recent interest in converting abandoned railroad lines to public recreation trails holds the potential to conserve and restore wildlife habitat along these corridors, but questions emerge about wildlife use and how best to manage for the multiple interests of wildlife and people. We evaluated the use by birds of 2 abandoned railroad rights-of-way in southeast Nebraska, one a partially converted 42-km urban-rural corridor and the other a converted urban recreational trail. We surveyed birds from 1992 to 1994 in 22 400-m transects (14 rural, 8 urban) that had either continuous woody vegetation (woody) or a more open mixture of grasses and forbs with scattered trees or shrubs (mixed). Of the 112 bird species (99 rural, 77 urban) observed, 47% were neotropical migrants, 38% short-distance migrants, and 15% permanent residents. Overall abundance was generally greater in rural woody and urban mixed transects, but there was no clear urban versus rural difference. Overall mean species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity index were generally greater in urban transects during autumn and winter but shifted to greater in rural woody transects during spring and rural during summer. Abundance, richness, and diversity for permanent residents were generally greater in urban transects than in rural through all seasons, but for neotropical migrants they were greater in rural woody (spring) or rural (summer). Richness and diversity of short-distance migrants were generally greater in rural transects during spring and summer, but abundance did not differ. For some species, abundance in urban versus rural transects changed seasonally and such patterns in mourning dove (Zenaida macroura) numbers support the concept that doves may behave as migrants in rural segments but as permanent residents in urban. Within the rural right-of-way, woody transects, compared to mixed, had greater total mean bird abundance during spring, summer, and winter and greater species richness and diversity during all seasons. However, these differences did not hold in urban transects, probably because of influences from surrounding suburban landscaping. We found 5 species to be more abundant overall in woody transects and one in mixed during one or more seasons, and within rural transects an additional 7 species more abundant in woody and 2 in mixed. Management along such rights-of-way should consider potential differences among migratory guilds and species in their response to right-of-way vegetation and urban versus rural surrounding land use.

AB  - Human interventions, i.e. settlement and construction activities, in the agricultural landscape including farmland but also natural and semi-natural habitats are a major driver of biodiversity loss. Consequently, their impacts on nature and landscape have to be compensated by no net loss policies in many countries around the world. However, their practical implementation often poses challenges with regard to the optimal spatial coordination and assessment of measures, especially in the case of eco-accounts or other habitat banking approaches.Against this backdrop, different approaches to offset biodiversity loss at regional level are analysed with due consideration of indicators of economy, ecology, landscape aesthetics and food production. We used an interdisciplinary modelling approach based on estimates for offsetting demand until 2030. In the integrated land use model, we associated a biophysical crop growth model with an economic optimisation model. The Stuttgart Region - an area with stiff competition amongst anthropogenic land use patterns in Germany - served as the study area. Our main focus was on arable land that has a high potential for nature conservation enhancement. In this context, farmers are deemed to be a major stakeholder group.We observed differing economic and ecological outcomes for the offsetting scenarios we considered. In urban areas with high population density and low biodiversity (e.g. Stuttgart city), compensation close to the site of intervention (on-site) may be more expensive than off-site compensation. However, further added value can be generated by on-site compensation in terms of visual landscape quality enhancement and habitat connectivity, provided that the measures lend themselves to establishing connectivity. Consequently, spatially unrestricted markets for eco credits may exacerbate ecological polarisation between urban and rural areas. Therefore, we concluded that offset site selection should not be driven solely by economics, as this may not optimise overall welfare from a societal perspective, resulting in the need for legal constraints.Our results show the trade-offs between the political goals of spatial planning approaches and compensation strategies. They can, therefore, thus provide valuable information that enables political decision-makers to more clearly weigh up the effects of policy measures in this area.

AB  - Anthropogenic land transformation, especially agriculture and urban development, are the leading causes of natural land cover loss and ultimate decline in environmental functionality and connectivity in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. However, recent developments in the form of housing estates with conservation and environmental management intentions (termed eco-estates) have increased. These eco-estates generally improve species and functional diversity in urban regions of coastal KwaZulu-Natal and improve connectivity for biodiversity between urban green spaces and existing natural landscapes. To provide the first comprehensive development and management guidelines for eco-estates, we reviewed and assessed research into the effects of eco-estate development on environmental functionality and connectivity using case studies from coastal KwaZulu-Natal. We suggest suitable regions for eco-estate establishment and provide detailed guidelines for ecoestate development, environmental rehabilitation and conservation, and eco-estate flora and fauna management. These guidelines will hopefully facilitate biodiversity conservation and improve current and future eco-estate management and, ultimately, the ecosystem health of coastal KwaZulu-Natal. They are applicable for ecoestate development and management in similar tropical and sub-tropical mixed land-use matrices.

AB  - We applied an intermediate disturbance-complexity approach to the land-use change of cultural landscapes in the island of Mallorca from c. 1850 to the present, which accounts for the joint behaviour of human appropriation of photosynthetic capacity used as a measure of disturbance, and a selection of land metrics at different spatial scales that account for ecological functionality as a proxy of biodiversity. We also delved deeper into local land-use changes in order to identify the main socioeconomic drivers and ruling agencies at stake. A second degree polynomial regression was obtained linking socio-metabolic disturbance and landscape ecological functioning (jointly assessing landscape patterns and processes). The results confirm our intermediate disturbance-complexity hypothesis by showing a hump-shaped relationship where the highest level of landscape complexity (heterogeneity connectivity) is attained when disturbance peaks at 50-60 %. The study proves the usefulness of transferring the concept of intermediate disturbance to Mediterranean cultural landscapes, and suggests that the conservation of heterogeneous and well connected land-use mosaics with a positive interplay between intermediate level of farming disturbances and land-cover complexity endowed with a rich bio-cultural heritage will preserve a wildlife-friendly agro-ecological matrix that is likely to house high biodiversity.

AB  - A recent issue highlights the need for a wildlife corridor to mitigate habitat fragmentation and biodiversity degradation caused by intensive urbanization in the country, such as the development of infrastructure, roads, and highways. Indeed, the issues of frequent road and vehicle-animals collisions are ever-increasing in urban corridors. As a result, flora and fauna populations can become isolated, leading to an unbalanced ecosystem. This study developed the Wildlife Corridor Design and Conservation (WCDC) index, assessment model. The study has investigated the wildlife corridor design and conservation features through a systematic literature review, clustered them into three criteria (biophysical, structural, and environmental designs) and twenty-one sub -criteria. The study applied the Analytic Network Process method to measure the weights of features; habitat preservation (WC1.1 = 0.280), species varieties control (WC1.2.=0187), and conduit for movement (WC1.3. = 0.100) play critical roles in wildlife corridor design and conservation. The Weighted Sum Method verified the WCDC model through a case study (Red Earth overpass, Canada). The model assigns certification labels (Gold, Silver, Bronze, or not-certified); accordingly, it ranked the evaluated site as Gold, which means the Red Earth overpass performs intimately in biophysical, structural, and environmental preservation of mammal habitat. The study conducted regression analysis for model validation, determining a significant association between the base and case-study models.

AB  - Landscape fragmentation and exotic species invasions are two modern-day forces that have strong and largely irreversible effects on native diversity worldwide. The spatial arrangement of habitat fragments is critical in affecting movement of individuals through a landscape, but little is known about how invasive species respond to landscape configuration relative to native species. This information is crucial for managing the global threat of invasive species spread. Using network analysis and partial Mantel tests to control for covarying environmental conditions, we show that forest plant communities in a fragmented landscape have spatial structure that is best captured by a network representation of landscape connectivity. This spatial structure is less pronounced in invasive species and exotic species dispersed by animals. Our research suggests that invasive species can spread more easily in fragmented landscapes than native species, which may make communities more homogeneous over time.

AB  - The visual imaginary of the future city is increasingly dichotomized between visions of hyper-technological digital urbanism and the city in a state of ruin, without people, overtaken by nature. These alternating imaginaries key into concerns over urban futures, as questions of sustainability and rising inequality come to bear on urban life. Such binary imaginaries produce volumes of visual material, lauding and critiquing philosophies of newness, endless progress and the city without decline. This article uses an inventive visual methodology to ask how these imaginaries become situated in the everyday ecologies of living. This methodology focuses on several so-called 'brownfield' sites in Salford, UK, and the 'smart' Oxford Road Corridor in neighbouring Manchester, to playfully and visually map the entanglement of digital urban ecologies through the themes of wilderness, play and compost. These three themes relate to the pleasure of urban wilderness described by Rose Macaulay, reflecting on London's wild ruins after the Second World War; the playful contrast between smart urbanism and urban wastelands, understood through interdisciplinary visual methods; and Haraway's notion of compost as the fertile ground of collaboration that marks a material-semiotic entanglement between place, people and nature. The authors investigate how these frameworks reflect the diversity of urban ecology (animals, plants and humans) and might provide an alternative vision of how the city could be, a vision built from how the city currently is.

AB  - The fragmentation of landscapes, induced by the growing urbanisation, is a major cause of biodiversity loss. Ecological corridors are landscape elements that make up for the negative effects of habitat fragmentation in agricultural or natural landscapes. However, their effectiveness have been rarely assess in an urban context. To do so, we analysed shrews in woodlots, corridors and domestic gardens that are connected or disconnected from a corridor. Indeed, these mammals are very sensitive to fragmentation and could play an important ecological role even in small and isolated areas such as domestic gardens. Ninety-seven shrews, from three species were trapped. In our study, Sorex coronatus, Sorex minutus and Crocidura russula were not widely distributed and mainly occurred in woodlots, corridors and connected gardens. In gardens, shrew occurrences were mainly determined by landscape configuration with negative effects of the distance to the corridor and the distance to the woodlot, stronger for C.russula than Sorex species. At the local scale, garden management and vegetation showed a positive effect mainly for Sorex species. The quality of gardens seems good enough to permit the co-occurrence of several species of shrews and thus competition was not identified as a major process for determining the occurrence. We showed that, as in other ecosystems, ecological corridors in urban context can play an effective role for the distribution of organisms with low dispersal capabilities and should be develop in planning strategies.

AB  - 1. This paper introduces key messages from a number of papers emanating from the Second International Symposium on Riverine Landscapes held in August 2004 in Sweden, focusing on river restoration. Together these papers provide an overview of the science of river restoration, and point out future research needs.
   2. Restoration tests the feasibility of recreating complex ecosystems from more simple and degraded states, thereby presenting a major challenge to ecological science. Therefore, close cooperation between practitioners and scientists would be beneficial, but most river restoration projects are currently performed with little or no scientific involvement.
   3. Key messages emanating from this series of papers are: The scope, i.e. the maximum and minimum spatial extent and temporal duration of habitat use, of species targeted for restoration should be acknowledged, so that all relevant stages in their life cycles are considered. Species that have been lost from a stream cannot be assumed to recolonise spontaneously, calling for strategies to ensure the return of target species to-be integrated into projects. Possible effects of invasive exotic species also need to be incorporated into project plans, either to minimise the impact of exotics, or to modify the expected outcome of restoration in cases where extirpation of exotics is impractical.
   4. Restoration of important ecological processes often implies improving connectivity of the stream. For example, longitudinal and lateral connectivity can be enhanced by restoring fluvial dynamics on flood-suppressed rivers and by increasing water availability in rivers subject to water diversion or withdrawal, thereby increasing habitat and species diversity. Restoring links between surface and ground water flow enhances vertical connectivity and communities associated with the hyporheic zone.
   5. Future restoration schemes should consider where in the catchment to locate projects to make restoration most effective, consider the cumulative effects of many small projects, and evaluate the potential to restore ecosystem processes under highly constrained conditions such as in urban areas. Moreover, restoration projects should be properly monitored to assess whether restoration has been successful, thus enabling adaptive management and learning for the future from both successful and unsuccessful restorations.

AB  - Traditional methods for Chagas disease prevention are targeted at domestic vector reduction, as well as control of transfusion and maternal-fetal transmission. Population connectivity of Trypanosoma cruzi-infected vectors and hosts, among sylvatic, ecotone and domestic habitats could jeopardize targeted efforts to reduce human exposure. This connectivity was evaluated in a Mexican community with reports of high vector infestation, human infection, and Chagas disease, surrounded by agricultural and natural areas. We surveyed bats, rodents, and triatomines in dry and rainy seasons in three adjacent habitats (domestic, ecotone, sylvatic), and measured T. cruzi prevalence, and host feeding sources of triatomines. Of 12 bat and 7 rodent species, no bat tested positive for T. cruzi, but all rodent species tested positive in at least one season or habitat. Highest T. cruzi infection prevalence was found in the rodents, Baiomys musculus and Neotoma mexicana. In general, parasite prevalence was not related to habitat or season, although the sylvatic habitat had higher infection prevalence than by chance, during the dry season. Wild and domestic mammals were identified as bloodmeals of T. pallidipennis, with 9% of individuals having mixed human (4.8% single human) and other mammal species in bloodmeals, especially in the dry season; these vectors tested >50% positive for T. cruzi. Overall, ecological connectivity is broad across this matrix, based on high rodent community similarity, vector and T. cruzi presence. Cost-effective T. cruzi, vector control strategies and Chagas disease transmission prevention will need to consider continuous potential for parasite movement over the entire landscape. This study provides clear evidence that these strategies will need to include reservoir/host species in at least ecotones, in addition to domestic habitats.

AB  - Dispersal is a key element of the invasion process for introduced species, and is influenced by landscape connectivity. The red-bellied squirrel (Callosciurus erythraeus) was introduced to Argentina in 1970. Suitable forest habitat for this arboreal species is highly fragmented in a rural-urban matrix, but despite this, the squirrel population has spread. Squirrels disperse into new habitat patches using connective features such as forest corridors. They may also cross gaps but up to what extent is not known. Gap crossing success is influenced by perceptual range, which is the distance from which animals can perceive suitable habitat. Perceptual range has been previously estimated for vulnerable species, but not for introduced species. We used a model relating perceptual range to body mass to predict the perceptual range of the red-bellied tree squirrel in Argentina. We then tested our prediction of 202-221 m by releasing squirrels in an unfamiliar arable field at different distances (300, 200, 100 and 20 m) from woodland habitat. We assumed that if woodland could be perceived, squirrels would orientate toward it. We estimated perceptual range to be between 20 and 100 m, considerably lower than predicted. Our results indicate that squirrels can potentially cross small habitat gaps, but dispersal over greater distances lacking connectivity is less likely. Incorporating this information when modelling the spread of exotic squirrels in the Pampas Region can yield more accurate prediction of the invasion process and guide management practices to minimise their expansion.

AB  - Birds in urban landscapes primarily occupy parks (forest fragments), wooded streets (linear strips connecting fragments), or the urban matrix. I studied the effects of street location in the landscape, vegetation structure, and human disturbance (pedestrian and automobile load) within wooded streets on bird species richness, temporal persistence, and density of feeding and nesting guilds, and on the probability of street occupation by individual species in Madrid during two consecutive breeding seasons. The number of species recorded increased from the least suitable (control streets without vegetation) to the most suitable habitats (urban parks), with wooded streets being intermediate landscape elements. Fourteen species, belonging to four of the eight guilds identified in this system, were recorded in wooded streets in both years. Streets that connected urban parks, along with vegetation structure, positively influenced the number of species within wooded streets, species persistence, guild density, and probability of occupation of streets by individual species. Human disturbance exerted a negative influence on the same variables. Wooded streets potentially could function as corridors, allowing certain species-particularly those feeding on the ground and breeding in trees or tree holes-to fare well by supporting alternative habitat for feeding and nesting. Local improvements in corridor quality, through increased vegetation complexity and reduced human disturbance, could exert a positive influence on the regional connectivity of the system. Because of differential use of corridors by species with different habitat requirements, however, corridor implementation should also take into account the target species of management.

AB  - Urbanization and agriculture growth are some of the major causes of natural ecosystems depletion and biodiversity loss. Conservation efforts can be developed through the prioritization of areas for forest conservation in order to minimize this process. Here, we establish conservation strategies based on a spatial analysis of forest fragments in an urban landscape at the transition between two important Brazilian biodiversity hotspots: Atlantic Forest and Cerrado. A high-resolution mapping of forest patches was used to quantify forest cover and to provide spatial analysis. We developed a Forest Conservation Priority Index (FCPI) derived from landscape metrics to select priority areas for forest conservation efforts. We used area, shape and proximity metrics as landscape structure indicators. Landscape metrics were classified and we attributed a rank and weights for them to calculate the FCPI. Forest covers 17% of the study area. 60% of the forest patches comprise less than one hectare, 95% less than 10 ha and only 1% more than 50 ha. The largest fragments (> 100ha) are all long and narrow. Also, fewer than half the patches are connected to others. Regions classified as high and very high priority for forest conservation are localized at greater slopes, along rivers and on private lands. Our index allowed the prioritization of forest fragments in an urban landscape, directing efforts of conservation. Creating protected areas and restoration plans are necessary for the better situation of the natural ecosystem. Land-use planning must resolve human demands and conservation of this important ecosystem.

AB  - The area of semi-natural grasslands has decreased dramatically causing many grassland specialist species to persist in small habitat fragments. Furthermore, ecological communities once shaped by disturbances related to traditional agriculture now face the impacts of modern agriculture and urbanization. Many of the species have become endangered due to the combined effects of habitat destruction and degradation. We studied the responses of vascular plants and bryophytes to present and past connectivity in semi-natural grasslands, while accounting for the effects of local environmental conditions. We conducted vegetation surveys in 33 fragmented, unmanaged dry grasslands in Southwest Finland. A total of 191 vascular plant species and 60 bryophyte species were recorded. Higher vascular plant diversity was associated with higher historical connectivity, whereas bryophyte diversity declined with increasing current connectivity. Edaphic conditions, microclimate and disturbances were found to structure both vascular plant and bryophyte communities, but the responses to individual environmental variables were very different. The contrasting responses could be explained by the differences between the typical life-history strategies in vascular plants and bryophytes as well as resource competition between the two groups. These results highlight the need to consider different species groups when planning conservation measures. Vascular plant richness may best be conserved in connected grasslands whereas bryophyte richness in isolated ones. The results also indicated that trampling by humans could result in positive disturbance and to some extent help maintain richness of grassland specialist species.

AB  - Increased heat in urban environments, from the combined effects of climate change and land use/land cover change, is one of the most severe problems confronting cities and urban residents worldwide, and requires urgent resolution. While large urban green spaces such as parks and nature reserves are widely recognized for their benefits in mitigating urban heat islands (UHIs), the benefit of urban golf courses is less established. This is the first study to combine remote sensing of golf courses with Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) of vegetation cover. Using ArborCam(TM) multispectral, high-resolution airborne imagery (0.3 x 0.3 m), this study develops an approach that assesses the role of golf courses in reducing urban land surface temperature (LST) relative to other urban land-uses in Perth, Australia, and identifies factors that influence cooling. The study revealed that urban golf courses had the second lowest LST (around 31 degrees C) after conservation land (30 degrees C), compared to industrial, residential, and main road land uses, which ranged from 35 to 37 degrees C. They thus have a strong capacity for summer urban heat mitigation. Within the golf courses, distance to water bodies and vegetation structure are important factors contributing to cooling effects. Green spaces comprising tall trees (>10 m) and large vegetation patches have strong effects in reducing LST. This suggests that increasing the proportion of large trees, and increasing vegetation connectivity within golf courses and with other local green spaces, can decrease urban LST, thus providing benefits for urban residents. Moreover, as golf courses are useful for biodiversity conservation, planning for new golf course development should embrace the retention of native vegetation and linkages to conservation corridors.

AB  - Management practices, environmental and social factors shape complex agricultural landscapes. In turn, the structure of such landscapes impacts biodiversity conservation, for instance, by mediating wildlife migration between agricultural and habitat patches and thus determining the persistence of metapopulations. Landscape ecology has used heterogeneity metrics and has systematically examined how they change with grain size and landscape extent to formally characterize a landscape, its structure and potential role in the persistence of wild metapopulations. These metrics provide valuable information regarding the landscape connectivity, patch diversity and shape. However, heterogeneity metrics have rarely been applied to tropical or subtropical, peasant-managed landscapes, even though this type of landscape occupies most of the agricultural surface in or near biodiversity hotspots. We focus on a peasant-managed agricultural landscape in Oaxaca, Mexico. For this landscape we mapped and quantified the land-use classes (48 % for agricultural land use, with kappa = 88.85 %). We also calculated heterogeneity metrics and examined their response to changes in grain and extent scales. This allowed us to further understand the structure and conservation potential of the agricultural matrix in this type of landscape, in comparison with other agricultural landscapes in Eastern North America. Our results also enabled us to recommend specific landscape metrics such as Largest Patch Index, Shape Index, and Interspersion & Juxtaposition Index, for different types of studies involving the link between agricultural matrices and conservation. We conclude that this type of agricultural matrix is ideal to pursue joint agricultural and conservation strategies in an integrated landscape.

AB  - Many studies have refuted the opinion that urban floras are poor in total species number and characterized primarily by neophytes. Also, it has been proved that urban flora differs from its surroundings, and at the same time reflects its richness. Our study focused on urban flora, structure and similarities, and the possible correlation with the urban attributes. Therefore, we selected 11 cities in Southeast Europe, which differ in the development of transportation networks (roads, rails and inland waterways) and population size. Next, we compared two sets of data (structure of urban flora and urban attributes) to define the correlation patterns. Analyzed urban floras were primarily distinguished by a total number of species, number of unique species and neophytes. Belgrade is a city with the highest urbanization level, the most species and the highest number of unique species and neophytes as well. Kosovska Mitrovica, Grocka and Pozarevac stand out by floristic richness. These cities have a high number of species, yet a small proportion of neophytes. Other cities are characterized by similar floristic structure, with a relatively similar proportion of neophytes and approximately similar number of unique species in relation to the total number. It can be concluded that other factors beside the chosen urban attributes have additional effects on floristic structure, except for the factor - the presence of neophytes. This is in accordance with predefining subjects, since urban attributes were chosen based on knowledge about important corridors for invasive species.

AB  - Background: Rivers and their associated vegetation are considered highly complex natural systems representing high biodiversity areas that work as biological corridors. Nevertheless, riparian vegetation of the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve (MBBR) has not been studied nor considered in the reserve's management program.
   Questions: Which is the composition, structure, diversity, and state of conservation of the riparian vegetation of the MBBR? Study site and dates: The Senguio Microbasin, part of Sierra Chincua Priority Terrestrial Region, within the MBBR, in central Mexico. 20162017.
   Methods: Using high-resolution imagery from 2014, we identified five joint categories in relation to the protection status (Core Zone, Buffer Zone, and Influence Area) and land use (conserved forest, highly disturbed forest, and farmland). We sampled three sites per category (N = 15) to analyze the composition, richness, and alpha and beta diversity of the riparian communities.
   Results: We registered 108 species, 46 genera, and 18 families, of which 98 % are native and 2 % exotic. Richness and alpha-diversity were not significantly different among sites, but the composition and beta-diversity showed significant differences depending on land use. The riparian vegetation is well conserved both in the Reserve ' s Core and Buffer zones, and preserves high coverage, species richness, and individuals' abundance.
   Conclusions: The riparian vegetation of the Senguio Microbasin hosts a biodiversity richness critical for the ecosystem's health and evidences the relevance of considering the human use of the riparian systems to succeed in the conservation strategies.

AB  - Landscape metrics represent powerful tools for quantifying landscape structure, but uncertainties persist around their interpretation. Urban settings add unique considerations, containing habitat structures driven by the surrounding built-up environment. Understanding urban ecosystems, however, should focus on the habitats rather than the matrix.
   We coupled a multivariate approach with landscape metric analysis to overcome existing shortcomings in interpretation. We then explored relationships between landscape characteristics and modelled ecosystem service provision.
   We used principal component analysis and cluster analysis to isolate the most effective measures of landscape variability and then grouped habitat patches according to their attributes, independent of the surrounding urban form. We compared results to the modelled provision of three ecosystem services. Seven classes resulting from cluster analysis were separated primarily on patch area, and secondarily by measures of shape complexity and inter-patch distance.
   When compared to modelled ecosystem services, larger patches up to 10 ha in size consistently stored more carbon per area and supported more pollinators, while exhibiting a greater risk of soil erosion. Smaller, isolated patches showed the opposite, and patches larger than 10 ha exhibited no additional areal benefit.
   Multivariate landscape metric analysis offers greater confidence and consistency than analysing landscape metrics individually. Independent classification avoids the influence of the urban matrix surrounding habitats of interest, and allows patches to be grouped according to their own attributes. Such a grouping is useful as it may correlate more strongly with the characteristics of landscape structure that directly affect ecosystem function.

AB  - How best to optimize the biodiversity gain from agri-environment schemes (AES) has recently been identified as a key policy-relevant question. Here. the effects of two features of lowland agricultural landscapes on the abundance and diversity of larger moths are contrasted. Although both features bring about positive effects, hedgerow trees have a larger impact than 6 m wide grassy field margins. Whilst AES payments are given to create and maintain grass margins, no financial reward is currently offered for the retention of hedgerow trees. Furthermore, it was only in areas where the amount of land under AES was experimentally increased, by targeting farmers, that the presence of hedgerow trees resulted in a substantially higher abundance (+60%) and diversity(+38%) of moths. Thus, by using larger moths as bio-indicators of landscape-scale quality, it is demonstrated that improvements to the cost-effectiveness of AES could be achieved, firstly, by providing more appropriate financial rewards to farmers for different landscape features, and secondly, through landscape-scale targeting of farmers to encourage participation in AES.

AB  - Urbanization involves the conversion of natural habitats into human-modified ecosystems and is known to reduce the diversity and abundance of indigenous plant and animal communities. Urbanization may lead to the extinction of indigenous species or facilitate the establishment of non-indigenous communities in cities and towns. We analysed sighting records held in wildlife databases to infer the probability of persistence of reptiles and amphibians ('herpetofauna') within Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Throughout greater Melbourne, 81% (13) of the 16 frog species recorded had >= 95% probability of being extant in 2006, compared with 56% (22) of the 39 species of reptiles recorded. The number of frog species that had >= 95% probability of being extant in inner local government areas (LGAs) within 10 km of the centre of Melbourne was higher (86%) than in the outer LGAs (69%). Conversely, only 46% of reptile species had >= 95% probability of being extant in inner and outer LGAs. The proportion of reptile species with <50% probability of being extant in inner LGAs was higher than for frog species (25% and 7%, respectively), suggesting that reptiles have been negatively affected by urbanization to a much greater extent than frogs. Based on the probability of species being extant, frogs and reptiles exhibited variations in their response to urbanization between species that persisted (urban-adapters) and species that did not (urban-sensitive or urban-avoiders). These differences in response were likely related to individual species' life-history and their requirements for habitat, space and dispersal. To conserve herpetofauna in urban areas we need to maintain structural complexity in remnant habitat patches, and implement strategic policies and management actions that protect habitat remnants and habitat corridors.

AB  - Globally, as trends of urbanisation continue to intensify, there has been increasing concern over the impacts of urban expansion on biodiversity and greater attention towards addressing these impacts. Ecological infrastructure such as urban rivers and their catchments may enhance biodiversity, ecological functioning and ecosystem service delivery within cities. Birds are good indicators of urban habitat quality because their ecology is well-studied and they are habitat selective. This study assesses the ecological value of a small urban river catchment in Cape Town, South Africa, in terms of its effect on the taxonomic and functional diversity of birds. 178 bird counts were carried out at 89 sites and 95 species were recorded. The nine functional groups considered were present in equal proportions in the catchment and in the whole of southern Africa, making the catchment a microcosm of the region's avifauna in terms of functional composition. Using RLQ and fourth-corner analyses, we showed that the river was responsible for the occurrence of certain species and functional groups that would not otherwise occur in the suburbs. Nutrient movers, insectivores, scavengers and seed dispersers responded strongly to a gradient of distance from the river and the position on the river. Contrary to the homogenised assemblage that might be expected of an urban area, the catchment contains a taxonomically and functionally diverse bird assemblage. The combination of a river, a heterogeneous urban matrix and an adjacent national park makes this catchment an exemplar of the value of ecological infrastructure for urban biodiversity.

AB  - This study sought to identify critical areas for puma (Puma concolor) movement across the state of Arizona in the American Southwest and to identify those most likely to be impacted by current and future human land uses, particularly expanding urban development and associated increases in traffic volume. Human populations in this region are expanding rapidly, with the potential for urban centers and busy roads to increasingly act as barriers to demographic and genetic connectivity of large-bodied, wide-ranging carnivores such as pumas, whose long-distance movements are likely to bring them into contact with human land uses and whose low tolerance both for and from humans may put them at risk unless opportunities for safe passage through or around human-modified landscapes are present. Brownian bridge movement models based on global positioning system collar data collected during bouts of active movement and linear mixed models were used to model habitat quality for puma movement; then, a wall-to-wall application of circuit theory models was used to produce a continuous statewide estimate of connectivity for puma movement and to identify pinch points, or bottlenecks, that may be most at risk of impacts from current and future traffic volume and expanding development. Rugged, shrub- and scrub-dominated regions were highlighted as those offering high quality movement habitat for pumas, and pinch points with the greatest potential impacts from expanding development and traffic, although widely distributed, were particularly prominent to the north and east of the city of Phoenix and along interstate highways in the western portion of the state. These pinch points likely constitute important conservation opportunities, where barriers to movement may cause disproportionate loss of connectivity, but also where actions such as placement of wildlife crossing structures or conservation easements could enhance connectivity and prevent detrimental impacts before they occur.

AB  - Urban areas are expanding globally as a consequence of human population increases, with overall negative effects on biodiversity. To prevent the further loss of biodiversity, it is urgent to understand the mechanisms behind this loss to develop evidence-based sustainable solutions to preserve biodiversity in urban landscapes. The two extreme urban development types along a continuum, land-sparing (large, continuous green areas and high-density housing) and land-sharing (small, fragmented green areas and low-density housing) have been the recent focus of debates regarding the pattern of urban development. However, in this context, there is no information on the mechanisms behind the observed biodiversity changes. One of the main mechanisms proposed to explain urban biodiversity loss is the alteration of predator-prey interactions. Using ground-nesting birds as a model system and data from nine European cities, we experimentally tested the effects of these two extreme urban development types on artificial ground nest survival and whether nest survival correlates with the local abundance of ground-nesting birds and their nest predators. Nest survival (n = 554) was lower in land-sharing than in land-sparing urban areas. Nest survival decreased with increasing numbers of local predators (cats and corvids) and with nest visibility. Correspondingly, relative abundance of ground-nesting birds was greater in land-sparing than in land-sharing urban areas, though overall bird species richness was unaffected by the pattern of urban development. We provide the first evidence that predator-prey interactions differ between the two extreme urban development types. Changing interactions may explain the higher proportion of ground-nesting birds in land-sparing areas, and suggest a limitation of the land-sharing model. Nest predator control and the provision of more green-covered urban habitats may also improve conservation of sensitive birds in cities. Our findings provide information on how to further expand our cities without severe loss of urban-sensitive species and give support for land-sparing over land-sharing urban development.

AB  - Genetic connectivity is a key factor for maintaining the persistence of populations in fragmented landscapes. In highly modified landscapes such us peri-urban areas, organisms' dispersal among fragmented habitat patches can be reduced due to the surrounding matrix, leading to subsequent decreased gene flow and increased potential extinction risk in isolated sub-populations. However, few studies have compared within species how dispersal/gene flow varies between regions and among different forms of matrix that might be encountered. In the current study, we investigated gene flow and dispersal in an endangered marsupial, the southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus) in a heavily modified peri-urban landscape in South Australia, Australia. We used 14 microsatellite markers to genotype 254 individuals which were sampled from 15 sites. Analyses revealed significant genetic structure. Our analyses also indicated that dispersal was mostly limited to neighbouring sites. Comparisons of these results with analyses of a different population of the same species revealed that gene flow/dispersal was more limited in this peri-urban landscape than in a pine plantation landscape approximately 400 km to the south-east. These findings increase our understanding of how the nature of fragmentation can lead to profound differences in levels of genetic connectivity among populations of the same species.

AB  - This study sets up relations between spatial structure (i.e. landscape composition and physiognomy) and the diversity of vascular plants in a fragmented tropical area. The objective was to identify which parameters of landscape structure were more related with tree species diversity. The studied landscapes, located in the state of Sao Paulo (S.E. Brazil), are characterized by a high degree of forest fragmentation owing to the expansion of coffee plantations in the second half of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. Eleven fragments of semideciduous forest were studied in the riparian corridor of the Jacare-Pepira river. The neighbouring spatial structure and the tree species diversity of these fragments were evaluated and correlated. Forest connectivity (provided by forest corridors and matrix stepping stones) and landscape mosaic complexity (measured by boundary indices) were the main factors of spatial structure linked to the variations of tree species richness and evenness. These results suggest that the spatial arrangement of forest patches and the complexity of the matrix may be more important than the fragment area and isolation in controlling the survival of the studied species.

AB  - Ungulate-vehicle accidents accounted for approximately 60% of the total police reported traffic accidents in Sweden during the 1990s. While exclusion fences are effective at reducing such collisions, they create a new threat to wildlife by limiting individual movements and access to resources. To promote movements across fenced highways, wildlife crossing structures have been constructed in many countries. We used infrared remote cameras, track count surveys, and GPS telemetry to monitor the use of a highway overpass by moose (Alces alces) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in southwestern Sweden. Moose and roe deer used the overpass mostly during nocturnal hours (84 and 76%, respectively). Overpass use declined with increased traffic volume on the highway, indicating that highway traffic affected the frequency in which ungulates used the overpass. We calculated that 5-7 individual moose used the overpass annually which is enough to maintain gene flow between otherwise disjunct subpopulations. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The transformation of tropical ecosystems by humans have resulted in forest loss, which, in turn, have caused negative impacts on biodiversity and the provisioning of ecosystem services. There is an urgent need to plan the restoration of these human-modified landscapes, using methodological approaches that consider key processes occurring at different spatial scales while engage local community participation, offering them the best possibilities of tangible benefits. In this study, was evaluated the landscape spatial pattern and local conservation status of existing forest remnants, showing an analysis of possible restoration scenarios for a human-modified landscape in La Montana, an indigenous region in southwestern Mexico. Therefore, landscape and local scale approaches were linked to identify specific landscape elements where efforts to improve connectivity must be concentrated. Also, this approach allowed finding a set of species from reference sites that showed the best socioecological characteristics to be used in different restoration strategies. As expected, La Montana region showed a spatial pattern typical of highly human-modified landscapes, i.e., several small (<21 ha) and irregular forest remnants with strong forest edge effects. Furthermore, these small and irregular forest fragments displayed forest structure, diversity and composition characteristics similar to those communities disturbed by selective harvesting or in an early successional phase. However, about 100 of woody species were found inside the fragments, some with important potential to provide ecosystem services. The landscape connectivity was very low, and an analysis of possible restoration scenarios showed that is equally important to restore the productive areas as well as open forest, to recover up to 47% of landscape connectivity. In this sense, it was proposed a productive restoration strategy to enrich open forests and create biodiversity-friendly habitat in agricultural areas, using species with high socioecological potential. We believe that the same approach could be applied to other highly human-modified tropical landscapes with similar socioecological problems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Engineered soils provide numerous ecosystem services in urban landscapes, such as water regulation and plant growth. They are constructed to optimize soil physicochemical properties but their biological properties are given little consideration. In particular, earthworm communities may be highly impacted by soil engineering processes and soil isolation caused by asphalted surfaces separating soils, and in particular roadside soils, from pseudo-natural soils. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate (i) the effects of soil engineering processes applied to construct roadside soils, and (ii) the effects of soil isolation from pseudo-natural soils by asphalted surfaces on earthworm communities. The study was conducted in an urban landscape in the suburbs of Paris, France. We sampled earthworms in roadside soils from two distinct soil engineering processes: basic engineering (BER) associated with shallow stripping depth and advanced engineering (AER) associated with deep stripping depth and organic amendment. Within each soil engineering process, two levels of soil isolation were defined depending on the asphalted surface separating roadside soils from pseudo-natural soils: light isolation (LI) in case of a narrow cycle path, and high isolation (HI) in case of a wide road. Soil engineering did not affect the total earthworm abundance whereas the total species richness was negatively impacted in comparison to nearby pseudo-natural soils. High soil isolation differently impacted earthworm communities depending on the engineering process. Regarding AER, earthworm abundance and species richness were significantly lower in HI than in LI while no differences were observed between BER-LI and BER-HI. Overall, engineering processes define the soil's ability to host earthworms, and soil isolation defines soil ability to be colonized from nearby environments. Considering the contribution of earthworms to the provision of ecosystem services, both soil engineering and soil isolation should be taken into account in urban projects to optimize their development in urban landscapes.

AB  - Under climate change many species may need to shift polewards to track suitable bioclimatic conditions. This movement is likely to be impeded by intensively modified landscapes, but little is known in practice about how species undergo range expansion in these conditions. Using biological record data, this paper explores the occurrence of five butterfly species undertaking range expansion in the UK through an urbanised landscape to better understand the pathways' or landscape features used to expand their distributions. The findings demonstrate that the two most adaptable species were able to navigate well through the urban matrix. Significantly, the remaining three species used more rural pathways, with two using stepping stones of habitat patches and landscape corridors and the final, most specialised species using near-connected chains of woodland habitat. These findings emphasise the importance of retaining corridors of open land around hostile matrices and in this instance, a planning designation Green Belt' proved to be particularly effective in providing broad pathways of open land for range expansion through a heavily urbanised landscape.

AB  - Urbanization is increasing globally, with concomitant negative effects on biodiversity and human well-being. In urban areas, gardens may contribute to overall green space, bringing benefits to wildlife and residents. We used a community science approach to gather data and understand the role of urban gardens for wildlife and for residents in a developing country, where information on the subject is scarce. We evaluated how local characteristics and landscape quality influenced the presence of three native birds and two insect species as indicators of habitat conservation value, in a town immersed in an Argentinean National Park. We also estimated gardens' value during COVID-19 quarantine to assess whether owners appreciated them more when outdoor activities were not allowed, increasing awareness of the value of nature for well-being. We found that most respondents enjoy birdwatching in their gardens and consider birds as beneficial; however, the pleasure of observing insects is lower. The relevance of local garden characteristics differed according to the species in question, highlighting the importance of using different species as indicators to assess garden conservation value. The proportion of tree cover surrounding the gardens had a positive effect on the probability of finding birds and insects, while the proportion of built-up area had a negative effect. During COVID-19 lockdown, most respondents enjoyed their gardens equally or more than usual, and those that assigned a monetary value to gardens, chose the highest one. We encouraged initiatives that engage, inform and empower residents on wildlife-friendly gardening to favor the inclusion of gardens as part of wider conservation and urban planning strategies.

AB  - Due to increasing population and expansion of cities, urban planning issues are becoming more important worldwide. It is realized that biological methodologies ought to be coordinated into urban arranging activities. Particularly in European cities, creating greenways and green corridors is a very recent phenomenon. The advancement of green space along urban waterways could moderate urban warmth island impacts, improve the physical and mental prosperity of city occupants, improve flood resilience and could also sustain biodiversity. The Pedieos River is the longest river in Cyprus. Like most of streams on the island, it is a non-enduring waterway, of fleeting nature that for the most part streams during the blustery winter months or after overwhelming precipitation occasions. A literature review was undertaken to discover the importance of rivers within the urbanized areas. It is known that the Pedieos River is firmly connected to the historical backdrop of Nicosia as it is one reason for the city's presence at the site. The increase of impermeable areas as a result of urbanization is also one of the main causes for flooding in recent years. In this research, the current situation of the river was investigated and its possible rehabilitation discussed for more sustainable city. The aim of this study is to recommend a feasible proposition by examining green territory zones and reason green passages along the Pedieos River so as to improve the living condition of Nicosia city.

AB  - Urban areas are expanding globally with far-reaching ecological consequences, including for wildlife-pathogen interactions. Wildlife show tremendous variation in their responses to urbanization; even within a single population, some individuals can specialize on urban or natural habitat types. This specialization could alter pathogen impacts on host populations via changes to wildlife movement and aggregation. Here, we build a mechanistic model to explore how habitat specialization in urban landscapes affects interactions between a mobile host population and a density-dependent specialist pathogen that confers no immunity. We model movement on a network of resource-stable urban sites and resource-fluctuating natural sites, where hosts are urban specialists, natural specialists, or generalists that use both patch types. We find that for generalists, natural and partially urban landscapes produce the highest infection prevalence and mortality, driven by high movement rates at natural sites and high densities at urban sites. However, habitat specialization protects hosts from these negative effects of partially urban landscapes by limiting movement between patch types. These findings suggest that habitat specialization can benefit populations by reducing infectious disease transmission, but by reducing movement between habitat types it could also carry the cost of reducing other movement-related ecosystem functions, such as seed dispersal and pollination.

AB  - 1. Urbanisation and agricultural intensification cause the replacement of natural ecosystems but might also create novel habitats in urban and rural ecosystems promoting some insect communities by providing food and nesting resources.
   2. This study investigated how host natural enemy communities change in urban and rural landscapes and their transitional zone, the urban rural interface, by using trap nests for cavity-nesting Hymenoptera in gardens and rapeseed fields that were either isolated or paired in the urban rural interface.
   3. Host dynamics were important for natural enemy occurrence, species richness and parasitism rates, and landscape effects were evident for natural enemy variables except for the richness of bee natural enemies. The number of parasitised brood cells was at its highest in the urban rural interface, but the highest parasitism rates of bees were observed in isolated gardens. Parasitism rates of bees were negatively affected by host abundance, while parasitism rates of wasps were positively affected.
   4. Higher specialisation and lower connectivity of host natural enemy interactions were found in paired habitats than in isolated habitats. This indicates that paired habitats comprise more specific natural enemies and vulnerable interactions, while isolated habitats comprise more generalist natural enemies, and thus interactions appear more stable.
   5. These results confirm that host dynamics play an essential role in the abundance and richness of natural enemies and drive parasitism. However, high habitat heterogeneity found in the urban rural interface can also have an effect on host natural enemy communities. This highlights that the provisioning of resources in the urban rural interface can benefit insect communities in these areas.

AB  - While studies of how habitat patch dynamics structures avian communities in urban environments has received some attention, there is considerably less known of how the built environment and human population size may influence the structuring of urban bird communities. We investigated bird populations in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (U.S.A.) through replicated point count surveys of breeding birds in 50 parks and cemeteries of varying sizes. We counted 4,435 individual birds in 441 counts. Of the 61 species detected, 27 were rare (detected at < 8 points). Migratory species accounted for 46.1 % of all individuals, while 23.2 % of all individuals were of introduced species. Species richness increased significantly with green area size, as did the number of rare species. Species diversity decreased significantly with an increase in the proportion of individuals of introduced species; in particular, cavity nesters were less abundant when introduced species were present. Elements of the built urban environment including commercial development and transportation corridors were associated with significant reductions in park-wide species richness, mean number of species per point, and mean number of individual birds recorded per point. Human population size was positively related to increased numbers of individuals of introduced species, but a lower mean number of species per point. Ours is among the first to identify specific relationships between avian population characteristics and human population size, as few other studies have specifically incorporated human population size into a local, fine grain study design. Our data suggest that human population size is an important parameter that can be measured independently of characteristics of the built environment and the physical characteristics of the park itself as a correlate of avian diversity and abundance. Our study points to a variety of trade-offs needed to manage habitat for birds in urban settings.

AB  - Life on earth is remarkably diverse. Plants, animals, and microorganisms, in response to local and regional environmental conditions have created distinct adaptations that collectively form the interconnected "web of life." This biological diversity and its associated ecological processes represent the planets "natural capital" that underpins human activities, providing us with the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, the materials that clothe and shelter us, countless medical remedies, and the cathartic psychological relief green spaces provide for us. This biological diversity also helps shape our "sense of place."
   There is a growing awareness that the health of the planets biological diversity will to a large degree, determine our own destiny. There is also a growing sense of urgency that biodiversity requires substantially more protection than has occurred to date (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). The Convention on Biological Diversity (1992), adopted by over 150 countries, provided a strategy for addressing the decline in biodiversity around the world. The 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development identified the centrality of biodiversity and the importance of setting conservation targets. And the IUCNs Countdown 2010 program was established to help monitor progress toward stemming biodiversity loss.
   In terms of urban biodiversity the Curitiba Declaration on Cities and Biodiversity (2007) affirmed the importance of biodiversity within cities, signalling the need "to integrate biodiversity concerns into urban planning and development, with a view to improving the lives of urban residents..." Yet, while enhancing biodiversity within cities is a laudable goal, it is a daunting challenge. The scale and pace of urban growth is responsible for the radical transformation of the spatial configuration and ecological processes of local and regional landscapes around the world (Alberti 2005, Dale et al. 2000, McDonnell et al. 1997 Dramstad et al. 1996, McDonnel and Pickett 1990). Natural areas are fragmented. Indigenous fauna are marginalised and extirpated. Hydrologic cycles are irrevocably altered while impervious surfaces increase. Productive soils, centuries in the making, are contaminated compacted, and/or removed.
   One key challenge in addressing urban biodiversity is overcoming the misunderstanding that biodiversity conservation is an optional field of action, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Few local governments have dedicated resources to establishing planning frameworks and implementation strategies to explicitly address biodiversity. This complacency can he attributed, in part, to the complexity and abstraction as to what constitutes biodiversity. Consequently urban planners, elected officials, the development community, and the public continue to focus on land use, zoning, transportation, and infrastructure in isolation of their ecological consequences.
   Fortunately in North America some local governments have begun to engage the complexities of biodiversity conservation by developing regionally integrated spatial frameworks based in large part on Landscape Ecology's patch-corridor-matrix principles (Forman 1995). Simultaneously, proactive site planning and design practices at the neighbourhood and site scale are including biodiversity conservation as an essential program objective. Collectively these initiatives begin to illustrate bow urban design can conserve and enhance biodiversity across a region.

AB  - Urbanization has been cited as an important factor in worldwide amphibian declines, and although recent work has illustrated the important influence of broad-scale ecological patterns and processes on amphibian populations, little is known about the factors structuring amphibian communities in urban landscapes. We therefore examined amphibian community responses to wetland habitat availability and landscape characteristics along an urban - rural gradient in central Iowa, USA, a region experiencing rapid suburban growth. We conducted call surveys at 61 wetlands to estimate anuran calling activity, and quanti. ed wetland habitat structure and landscape context. We used canonical correspondence analysis ( CCA) to examine patterns in anuran community structure and identify the most important variables associated with those patterns. Urban density at the landscape scale had a signi. cant negative in. uence on overall anuran abundance and diversity. While every species exhibited a decrease in abundance with increasing urban density, this pattern was especially pronounced for species requiring post- breeding upland habitats. Anurans most affected by urbanization were those associated with short hydroperiods, early breeding activity, and substantial upland habitat use. We suggest that broad- scale landscape fragmentation is an important factor underlying anuran community structure in this region, possibly due to limitations on the accessibility of otherwise suitable habitat in fragmented urban landscapes. This study underscores the importance of a regional approach to amphibian conservation in urban and urbanizing areas; in fragmented landscapes, a network of interconnected wetland and upland habitats may be more likely to support a successful, diverse anuran community than will isolated sites.

AB  - The capacity of highly diverse systems to prevail has proven difficult to explain. In addition to methodological issues, the inherent complexity of ecosystems and issues like multicausality, non-linearity and context-specificity make it hard to establish general and unidirectional explanations. Nevertheless, in recent years, high order interactions have been increasingly discussed as a mechanism that benefits the functioning of highly diverse ecosystems and may add to the mechanisms that explain their persistence. Until now, this idea has been explored by means of hypothetical simulated networks. Here, we test this idea using an updated and empirically documented network for a coffee agroecosystem. We identify potentially key nodes and measure network robustness in the face of node removal with and without incorporation of high order interactions. We find that the system's robustness is either increased or unaffected by the addition of high order interactions, in contrast with randomized counterparts with similar structural characteristics. We also propose a method for representing networks with high order interactions as ordinary graphs and a method for measuring their robustness.

AB  - Graph theory is a body of mathematics dealing with problems of connectivity, flow, and routing in networks ranging from social groups to computer networks. Recently, network applications have erupted in many fields, and graph models are now being applied in landscape ecology and conservation biology, particularly for applications couched in metapopulation theory. In these applications, graph nodes represent habitat patches or local populations and links indicate functional connections among populations (i.e. via dispersal). Graphs are models of more complicated real systems, and so it is appropriate to review these applications from the perspective of modelling in general. Here we review recent applications of network theory to habitat patches in landscape mosaics. We consider (1) the conceptual model underlying these applications; (2) formalization and implementation of the graph model; (3) model parameterization; (4) model testing, insights, and predictions available through graph analyses; and (5) potential implications for conservation biology and related applications. In general, and for a variety of ecological systems, we find the graph model a remarkably robust framework for applications concerned with habitat connectivity. We close with suggestions for further work on the parameterization and validation of graph models, and point to some promising analytic insights.

AB  - Biodiversity is vital for the integrity and stability of ecosystems and sustainable development. Karst regions of Southwest China is featured for undulating and broken karst terrain as well as high plant diversity. Land use changes induced by the growing population and expanding human settlement have threatened biodiversity preservation in this region. However, the impact of urban expansion on plant diversity remains unclear here. This study focuses on how expanding countryside landscapes affect the recovery rate of plant diversity and demonstrate how urban expansion affects plant diversity conservation in karst regions of Southwest China. In situ biodiversity investigations and multisource remote sensing images were combined to analyze the role of human settlement evolution in the conservation of plant diversity using descriptive statistics and regression analysis. Unmanned vehicle images, historical aerial photographs, and long-term remote sensing images were used to observe the human settlement pattern changes over 40 yr and found that plant diversity is restored faster in countryside ecosystems than in island ecosystems restricted by water. Forests, however, contribute the most to plant diversity conservation in both ecosystems. While the forest area is stable during urban expansion, massive forest patches play an essential role in plant diversity conservation. Arable lands and grasslands shrank but with a fragmenting trend, which was conducive to preserving plant diversity, whereas increased and regularized large patches of built-up areas were not beneficial to plant diversity. Accordingly, forest protection should be prioritized to coordinate future socioeconomic development and plant diversity conservation in karst and broader regions. Furthermore, large built-up patches should be limited, and the irregularity should be improved during urban expansion.

AB  - Landscape fragmentation and structural changes are associated with spatial ecological and social processes. Landscape fragmentation modeling and land use distribution analysis provide a framework within which landscape pattern and structure can be studied and quantified. The Greater Bay Area (GBA) is one of the fastest growing urban agglomeration in China and due to the speedy socioeconomic development and urban expansion, the landscape became more diverse, fragmented, and complex in land use, structure, and shape. This study analyses the spatiotemporal variations in landscape pattern and structure in the Greater Bay Area based on the 40 years' time-series remote sensing data (19802020), fragmentation modeling, and structure change analysis. We used the fragmentation analysis at category and patch level and analyzed the fragmentation over forest, cropland, and grassland. We further employed the economic model of spatial Lorenz Curve and Gini Index for estimating the distribution of land use land cover (LULC) categories and structure changes. The results indicated that the landscape pattern indices of Greater Bay Area as whole, and its eleven cities had an obvious variations and diversity during 1980 to 2020. However, the diffusion and coalescence processes in each city follow distinct patterns. Due to the anthropogenic modifications, the landscape pattern and structural complexity increased gradually during the study period.

AB  - Special conditions are required for genetic differentiation to arise at a local geographical scale in the face of gene flow. The Natal multimammate mouse, Mastomys natalensis, is the most widely distributed and abundant rodent in sub-Saharan Africa. A notorious agricultural pest and a natural host for many zoonotic diseases, it can live in close proximity to humans and appears to compete with other rodents for the synanthropic niche. We surveyed its population genetic structure across a 180-km transect in central Tanzania along which the landscape varied between agricultural land in a rural setting and natural woody vegetation, rivers, roads and a city (Morogoro). We sampled M. natalensis across 10 localities and genotyped 15 microsatellite loci from 515 individuals. Hierarchical STRUCTURE analyses show a K-invariant pattern distinguishing Morogoro suburbs (located in the centre of the transect) from nine surrounding rural localities. Landscape connectivity analyses in Circuitscape and comparison of rainfall patterns suggest that neither geographical isolation nor natural breeding asynchrony could explain the genetic differentiation of the urban population. Using the isolation-with-migration model implemented in IMa2, we inferred that a split between suburban and rural populations would have occurred recently (<150 years ago) with higher urban effective population density consistent with an urban source to rural sink of effective migration. The observed genetic differentiation of urban multimammate mice is striking given the uninterrupted distribution of the animal throughout the landscape and the high estimates of effective migration (2N(e)M = 3.0 and 29.7), suggesting a strong selection gradient across the urban boundary.

AB  - The landscape of rural America is changing. Wildlife habitats are being converted to agricultural uses, corridors (linear patches that differ from their surroundings) are removed to expand fields, and urban development spreads across farms, forests, and prairies. The result is a fragmented landscape with fewer, smaller, less-connected patches of wildlife habitat and increasingly-degraded water quality that stresses aquatic ecosystems. The landscape's capacity to sustain a diversity of plant, animal, and aquatic species is declining at an decelerating rate. The loss of biodiversity has become a national concern. Land use planners are increasingly advocating the use of conservation corridors, including riparian buffers, windbreaks/shelterbelts, filter strips, field borders, and grassed waterways to improve water quality and wildlife habitat Since many of the ecological functions of conservation corridors operate more efficiently at scales larger than an individual corridor, planning at the watershed scale offers the best opportunity to optimize these functions.

AB  - Seoul City, as the capital and largest metropolis of South Korea, has high population density, and its remaining forests are extremely fragmented as a result of intensive development. The purpose of this study is to analyze the distribution of the great tit (Parus major) and develop a habitat model. Tits have been known as forest birds that inhabit urban forests in Seoul City. A Seoul biotope map and land cover map were combined, and the urban forest areas were delineated on these maps. As factors affecting the distribution of the great tit, landscape indices were calculated by separating them into intrapatch indices, namely logged patch area (PA), area-weighted mean patch shape index (PSI), tree rate (TR), and tree area (TA), and interpatch indices, namely patch degree (PD), patch betweenness (PB), patch proximity (PP), and difference probability of connectivity (DPC), to analyze the internal properties of the patches and their connectivity by tit occurrence data. The results of a t test analyzing the differences of habitat variables by great tit presence/absence and distribution showed differences in PA (p < 0.05), PSI (p < 0.001), TR (p < 0.01), TA (p < 0.001), PD (p < 0.05), PB (p < 0.01), PP (p < 0.05), and DPC (p < 0.1). In the results of logistic regression modeling, in most cases, more than one model had Delta AICc less than 2.0, suggesting that multiple models may be the best model. In the comprehensive models, the TR, PB, and DPC metrics were the best predictors. Among all variables in the intrahabitat model, PSI was the best predictor of species occurrence. Within the interhabitat model, DPC was the best predictor and had a positive relationship with species occurrence, which is the most important of all the factors. In other words, the great tit is more likely to be found in a large circular forest patch than a small and long-shaped forest patch, and connectivity in the threshold distance is the most important factor in predicting great tit occurrence. These results suggest that ecological potential, not only "location potential" but also "supply potential," should be considered in fragmented urban forests.

AB  - On-going fragmentation of tropical forest ecosystems and associated depletion of seed dispersers threatens the long-term survival of animal-dispersed plants. These threats do not only affect biodiversity and species abundance, but ultimately ecosystem functions and services. Thus, seed dispersers such as the straw-coloured fruit bat, E. helvum, which traverse long distances across fragmented landscapes, are particularly important for maintaining genetic connectivity and colonizing new sites for plant species. Using high-resolution GPS-tracking of movements, field observations and gut retention experiments, we quantify dispersal distances for small-and large-seeded fruits foraged by E. helvum during periods of colony population low (wet season) and high (dry season) in an urban and a rural landscape in the forest zone of Ghana. Gut passage time averaged 116 min (range 4-1143 min), comparable to other fruit bats. Movements were generally longer in the urban than in the rural landscape and also longer in the dry than in the wet season. As the majority of seeds are dispersed only to feeding roosts, median dispersal distances were similar for both large (42-67 m) and small (42-65 m) seeds. However, small seeds were potentially dispersed up to 75.4 km, four times further than the previous maximum distance estimated for a similar-sized frugivore. Maximum seed dispersal distances for small seeds were almost twice as long in the rural (49.7 km) compare to the urban (31.2 km) landscape. Within the urban landscape, estimated maximum dispersal distances for small seeds were three times longer during the dry season (75.4 km) compared to the wet season (22.8 km); in contrast, distances in the rural landscape were three times longer in the wet season (67 km) compared to the dry season (24.4). Dispersal distances for large seeds during the dry season (551 m) in the rural landscape were almost twice that in the wet season (319 m). We found no influence of food phenology on dispersal distances. The maximum likelihood for seed dispersal beyond feeding roosts (mean distance from food tree 263 m) was 4.7%. Small seeds were dispersed over even longer distances, >500 and >1000 m, with a likelihood of 3.0 % and 2.3 % respectively. Our data show that E. helvum retains ingested seeds for very long periods and may traverse large distances, probably making it an important long distance seed disperser in tropical Africa. We suggest E. helvumis important for ecosystem functioning and urge its conservation. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We developed a tool, FragPatch (FP), to delineate habitat patches for highly fragmented landscapes from a user-defined suitability map and two landscape perception values for a species of interest.
   We wrote a Python script in ArcGIS to delineate habitat patch networks using the user inputs and ArcGIS tools such as Euclidean distance, focal maximum, and reclassify. We validated the tool from mapped locations of urban deer and classified imagery for Syracuse, New York, USA.
   FP successfully delineated salient patch networks and functional connectivity for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus borealis) in our fragmented study area, and complements a similar tool, PatchMorph (PM), developed for rural landscape with more uniform land cover.
   A trade-off exists when choosing to use FP or PM and the decision must rely upon a well-defined research question. FP is better suited for isolating patches of habitat when the surrounding matrix is of low quality and suitable areas are highly scattered on the landscape. PM is able to identify patches when the matrix is more uniform, and is better at identifying broader scale connectivity than FP. We expect species biologists and urban landscape planners to use FP to better define patch networks and to understand the implications of fragmentation on a range of species population concerns, including conflicts with human uses.

AB  - Studies have suggested that the heterogeneity and arrangement of landscape structures are influential to the faunal biodiversity of environments. How does the landscape structure in agricultural landscape arrangements improve the functions of the natural ecosystem? Previous research has uncovered a great amount of information on the relationships between landscape structure and wildlife; however, for landscape designers and planners, such information is site-specific and has limited utilization. Hence, this study aimed to organize and categorize the relationships between environments and biodiversity and transfer this information into design principles in agricultural landscapes. This study attempted to integrate aspects of previous research into a systematic framework. The current study searched literature between 2007 and 2016 from the following journals: Landscape Ecology, Landscape and Urban Planning, and Journal of Applied Ecology. In all, this study collected 58 empirical studies of agricultural environments similar to that of Taiwan and revealed the valuable relationship between wildlife and agricultural environments. The outcomes reviewed from the literature were categorized by semi-natural elements and divided into six sub-categories: forests, hedgerows, grasslands, flowers, water, and heterogeneity of the natural landscape. The landscape attributes that were frequently discussed included patch number, patch area, connectivity, species richness, edge area, distance from semi-natural elements, and complexity. The landscape attributes formed by these elements were organized into a table as a checklist for designers' convenience. The checklist will help landscape planners and designers to create agricultural landscapes with integral ecosystems.

AB  - Interaction between animals and plants is an important way to maintain terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem function, but little is known about the structure of reciprocal networks between fruit plants and frugivore birds in urban habitats. To explore the characteristics of the plant-frugivore network and network roles of species, we observed the fruit ripening phenology of 21 species of fruit plants and the interactions between these plants and 39 species of frugivore birds during the whole year in a large urban park. Then, we assessed the characteristics of the total plant-frugivore and seasonal networks, and analyzed the network roles of species and the relationship between their network roles and ecological traits. Fruit ripened mainly in autumn and winter, and interaction connections in the two seasons contributed 39.68% and 44.83% to the total network, respectively. The specialization (H-2 & PRIME;), connectance (C), nestedness, and interaction evenness (e(H2)) of the network were lower in autumn and winter, while the interaction diversity was higher. Compared with the networks (N = 1000) generated by the null model, the observed network exhibited higher nestedness and interaction diversity (E-2) and lower specialization (H-2 & PRIME;), connectance (C), and interaction evenness (e(H2)). A correlation analysis combining ecological traits and network roles showed that plants with black fruit had higher effective partners and partner diversity, while other traits of plants and birds were not significantly correlated with their network parameters. The important plants (N = 6) and birds (N = 3) contributed to 71.78% and 67.55% of the total network connection, they were mainly evergreen plants with black and red drupes and omnivorous generalist birds with medium and large sizes. Our research highlighted the seasonal differences in urban plant-frugivore network and the value of important species in maintaining network structures and providing ecosystem services.

AB  - Cities are characterized by dynamic interactions between socio-economic and biophysical forces. Currently more than half of the global population reside in cities which influence the global biogeochemical cycles and climate change, substantially exacerbating pressures on urban pollution, water quality and food security, as well as operating costs for infrastructure development. Goods and services such as aesthetic values, water purification, nutrient recycling, and biological diversity, that urban ecosystems generate for the society, are critical to sustain. Urban planners are increasingly facing the considerable challenges of management issues for urban ecosystems. Poor understanding of the complementary roles of urban ecology in urban infrastructure, and the functioning of ecosystems and ecological resilience of a complex human-dominated landscape has impeded effective urban planning over time, resulting in social disharmony. Here a complementary framework for urban ecology is proposed, in which ecosystems interact with land use, architecture and urban design - "E-LAUD"-affecting ecosystem and human health, and building on the concept that land uses in urban green areas, road-strips, wetlands, 'habitat islands' and urban architecture could synergistically benefit when clustered together in different combinations of urban landscapes. It is proposed that incorporation of the E-LAUD framework in urban planning forms the context of a new interdisciplinary research programme on ecological resilience for urban ecosystems and helps promote ecosystem services.

AB  - This paper assesses the response of four common species of forest dependant insectivorous birds to an urban-forest gradient. The presence or absence was recorded for each species in landscapes that varied in landscape and site level attributes. Landscapes were classified into three categories based on their level of urbanisation. Broad comparisons across the landscapes were used to determine species specific response to increasing levels of urbanisation. Site level attributes were modelled to predict the patch occupancy for each species in each of the landscape types. Two broad trends were identified: the superb fairy wren (Malurus cyaneus) and white-browed scrubwren (Sericornis frontalis) displayed a tolerance to urbanisation and the eastern yellow robin (Eosaltrica australis) and white throated treecreeper (Cormobates leucophaeus) demonstrated a threshold response to urbanisation. The density of roads (-ve) and the extent of tree cover (+ve) in a landscape were highly correlated with the occurrence of urban sensitive species while at the site level the density of roads and density of rivers were the strongest contributors to their presence. The marked differences in the isolation and connectivity of patches where the threshold for urban sensitive species ceases are the likely contributors to their decline and sensitivity to suburban habitats. Conservation and management of urban sensitive species is largely dependant on the way urban development is managed. Of critical importance is careful planning in urban-fringe environments.

AB  - The rapid and large-scale urbanization of peri-urban areas poses major and complex challenges for wildlife conservation. We used population viability analysis (PVA) to evaluate the influence of urban encroachment, fire, and fauna crossing structures, with and without accounting for inbreeding effects, on the metapopulation viability of a medium-sized ground-dwelling mammal, the southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus), in the rapidly expanding city of Perth, Australia. We surveyed two metapopulations over one and a half years, and parameterized the PVA models using largely field-collected data. The models revealed that spatial isolation imposed by housing and road encroachment has major impacts on I. obesulus. Although the species is known to persist in small metapopulations at moderate levels of habitat fragmentation, the models indicate that these populations become highly vulnerable to demographic decline, genetic deterioration, and local extinction under increasing habitat connectivity loss. Isolated metapopulations were also predicted to be highly sensitive to fire, with large-scale fires having greater negative impacts on population abundance than small-scale ones. To reduce the risk of decline and local extirpation of I. obesulus and other small-to medium-sized ground-dwelling mammals in urbanizing, fire prone landscapes, we recommend that remnant vegetation and vegetated, structurally-complex corridors between habitat patches be retained. Well-designed road underpasses can be effective to connect habitat patches and reduce the probability of inbreeding and genetic differentiation; however, adjustment of fire management practices to limit the size of unplanned fires and ensure the retention of long unburnt vegetation will also be required to ensure persistence. Our study supports the evidence that in rapidly urbanizing landscapes, a pro-active conservation approach is required that manages species at the metapopulation level and that prioritizes metapopulations and habitat with greater long-term probability of persistence and conservation capacity, respectively. This strategy may help us prevent future declines and local extirpations, and currently relatively common species from becoming rare.

AB  - There is little information on the spatiotemporal pattern of dispersal of juvenile cougars (Felis concolor) and no data on disperser use of habitat corridors.  I investigated dispersal of radio-tagged juvenile cougars (8 M, 1 F) in a California landscape containing 3 corridors (1.5, 4.0, and 6.0 km long) and several habitat peninsulas created by urban growth.  Dispersal was usually initiated by the mother abandoning the cub near an edge of her home range.  The cub stayed within 300 m of that site for 13-19 days and then dispersed in the direction opposite that taken by the mother.  Mean age at dispersal was 18 months (range 13-21 months).  Each disperser traveled from its natal range to the farthest part of the urban-wildland edge.  Dispersing males occupied a series of small (<30% the area used by ad M in the same time span), temporary (10-298 days) home ranges, usually near the urban-wildland interface, and often with its longest border along that edge.  Each of the 3 corridors was used by 1-3 dispersers, 5 of the 9 dispersers found and successfully used corridors, and 2 dispersers entered but failed to traverse corridors.  Dispersing cougars will use corridors that are located along natural travel routes, have ample woody cover, include an underpass integrated with roadside fencing at high-speed road crossings, lack artificial outdoor lighting, and have <1 dwelling unit/16 ha.

AB  - Impervious surfaces in modern cities can be used for revegetation. However, the ecological quality of below-ground ecosystem components and constrained soil space are crucial factors that limit habitat restoration. The long-term development of Bonsai (Penjing) trees has resulted in mature theories and techniques that suggest optimal root-canopy ratios. Considering the similarities with constrained pot landscapes, some "enlightenments", or key findings, derived from Bonsai theory can also be applied to urban special revegetation (USR). In this study, we analyzed the root-shoot correlations of the different styles of Bonsai trees and provide and assessment on the relationships between Bonsai theory and USR. Using an on-site survey and biomass experiment, nine "enlightenments" from Bonsai theory are proposed: positive root-canopy correlation, environmental stress increasing the root-shoot ratio, connectivity of the tree bark "water line", rebalancing after disruption of the root-canopy balance, precise root and canopy design, artificial auxiliary fixation of the root, control of growth, horticultural reshaping skills, and plant diversity. In particular, for the successful establishment of urban rebuilt environments, it is essential to understand the mechanisms of root-canopy correlations. Therefore, we suggest that the four main types of USR (green roofs, vertical greening, container gardening, and street trees) should follow the core principle based on the root-shoot balance to effectively design both the root and canopy.

AB  - Urbanization is a complex process associated with environmental changes affecting many biotic and abiotic ecosystem components, which cause the alteration of biological communities, habitat features, connectivity and stability. In particular, the urbanization process is usually associated with a decrease in species richness that parallels a general increase in the overall abundance of individuals, mostly due to generalist and tolerant species taking advantage of the altered environmental conditions and outcompeting and excluding native species. We here adopted a hierarchically nested sampling design to investigate the response of ground arthropods to the combined effects of multiple facets of urbanization, namely increased impervious surface cover, temperature and patch isolation, measured at small, intermediate and large spatial scale. We studied 15 plots of 150 m in diameter located in the city of Turin (NW-Italy), along an urbanization-cover gradient ranging from suburbia to the city center. For each plot we considered the level of urbanization at three different scales (circular buffers with a 100, 400 and 1600 m radius). Within each plot, we identified a control and an isolated subplot, and in each subplot, we measured ground temperature using dataloggers and we sampled ground arthropods with pitfall traps. Firstly, by relating ground temperature and urbanization cover, we showed that temperature values reflected an Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, which indicates increasing values of temperature along the urbanization gradient. This trend was particularly evident at large scale regarding daily and diurnal temperature, and at small scale regarding nocturnal temperature. Secondly, we demonstrated that different groups of ground arthropods respond differently to urbanization cover, with major effects at the largest spatial scale. Finally, we extrapolated the differential contribution of urbanization cover, UHI-effect and patch isolation to the observed activity density of the investigated taxonomic groups: Coleoptera and Hemiptera were influenced by temperature, whereas Hymenoptera, Collembola, Acari and Araneae were mainly influenced by urbanization, especially in control subplots. Our results emphasize how a multitaxonomic approach can help unravel patterns of community assembly in urban areas.

AB  - Urbanization can promote the replacement of native species by exotic species resulting in an increase in community's similarity overtime. This process is called biotic homogenization, which is usually studied at large scale from species lists. Our paper addresses the effects of urbanization on plant community at local scale in areas where urban policies are implemented. We focus on private gardens as they are the most common components of green spaces in European urbanized areas. They are also a place where exotic species are introduced. Observations were made on spontaneous flora sampled from gardens in two study sites of the French Mediterranean: a large city and a village located in an urbanizing rural area. We evaluated how urban landscape influences floristic similarity and how exotic species affect homogenization. We divided each study site in three built-up density zones. As the urbanization process of both sites did not take place at the same time, we were able to assess the effect of time on floristic similarity. Results indicate that floristic similarity is less important in high dense built-up areas than in low dense ones. Exotic species tend to reduce floristic similarity in city centers and increase floristic similarity in low dense built-up areas in both sites. Landscape metrics calculated in built-up areas surrounding the gardens influence floristic similarity. Lastly, we found that urban planning in terms of built-up density affects biodiversity distribution and that private gardens can provide landscape connectivity within urban areas.

AB  - Invasive species have been causing important and irreversible impacts to native species and communities of ecosystems. They distort ecosystem functions by degrading forest lands, wetlands, and agricultural habitats and replace the native vegetation and reduce biodiversity, forest productivity, and suitable wildlife habitat. To address disturbances caused by invasive species occurrence, further information is needed regarding the occurrence, extent, and dispersal of invasive species and how land use may increase the spread of these species. The objective of this study was to find the frequency and dominance of three invasive species common to riparian areas of east Alabama: Ligustrum sinense (Chinese privet), Elaeagnus pungens (silverthorn), and Triadica sebifera (Chinese tallow tree). Surveys of these species in riparian forests in and around Auburn, Alabama were conducted to show the relative extent of these shrubs and their relation to urban land use. It was expected to see the highest levels of invasive species in the city center with decreasing levels radiating outward into rural areas. Another objective was how urban land use may affect the presence-absence and prevalence of these non-native plant species within study sites. The results showed that around the city center and suburban lands, cover of both Chinese privet and silverthorn tended to increase. In contrast, Chinese tallow tree density percent cover showed an opposite trend with landscapes close to city center often having slightly less cover. This study shows that urban land use may be an important association with distribution of invasive plant species.

AB  - Large cities in the tropics often comprise a myriad of manmade and natural elements that influence wildlife composition. Based on a citizen science-based project conducted in 2015, this study examined the combined effects of landscape factors on the bird assemblages in Kuala Lumpur and its conurbation, Peninsular Malaysia. A total of 48 species including 2,599 individual birds were recorded; the majority of which (>80%) were species of open habitat. Generalized linear mixed model indicated that the area of green cover had the strongest influence on number of individuals. Specifically, the abundance of individuals was increased by the presence of river corridors and roadside reserves. Areas located further away from water bodies and with less green cover had fewer birds. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating a varied landscape matrix into urban planning so as to maintain urban bird diversity and demonstrate the usefulness of citizen science in biodiversity monitoring.

AB  - The overall quality of the landscape is important for conserving biodiversity. In a fragmented landscape, movement and dispersal capacity are important factors in determining which species are able to persist. To examine the role of landscape structure and pattern on movement, we developed a simple model to predict the "least-cost" pathway a species would take through an agricultural landscape matrix between habitat fragments by assigning friction values to different habitat types. Our model was validated by using empirical data on inter-patch movement for two butterfly species: As a measure of the ecological distance between habitat patches, the least-cost path model was a better predictor of butterfly movement than Euclidean distance. Ranking several hypothetical management scenarios, illustrated the potential of the model :as a decision-support tool. Removal of all infrastructure from within arable fields would significantly reduce rates of inter-patch movement. However, if all boundaries between arable fields were restored to grassy banks this would significantly increase the connectivity between sub-populations. Planners widely recommend using corridors to connect fragments of remnant habitat despite relatively little empirical evidence to show that dispersal of individuals is enhanced by this practice. Our model showed that important aspects of species movement and, hence, survival,can be expressed in models suitable for area planning and management.

AB  - 1. Understanding the processes that structure community assembly across landscapes is fundamental to ecology and for predicting and managing the consequences of anthropogenically induced changes to ecosystems. 2. We assessed the community similarity of fish, macroinvertebrate and vegetation communities against geographic distances ranging from 4 to 480 km (i.e. distancedecay relationships) to determine the balance between local environmental factors and regional dispersal processes, and thus whether species-sorting (niche processes) or dispersal limitation (neutral processes) was more important in structuring these assemblages in Australias wet-dry tropics. We investigated whether the balance between niche and dispersal processes depended on the degree of hydrological connectivity, predicting that dispersal processes would be more important at connected sites, and also whether there was spatial concordance among these three assemblage types. 3. There was significant but weak spatial concordance among the study communities, suggesting limited potential for surrogacy among them. Distancedecay in community similarity was not observed for any study assemblage at perennial sites, suggesting dispersal was not limiting and assemblages were structured more strongly by local niche processes at these connected sites. At intermittent sites, weak distancedecay relationships for each assemblage type were confounded by significant relationships with environmental dissimilarity, suggesting that dispersal limitation contributed, albeit weakly, to niche processes in structuring our three study assemblages at disconnected sites. 4. Two environmental factors, flow regime and channel width, explained significant proportions of variation in all three assemblages, potentially contributing to the observed spatial concordance between them and representing local environmental gradients along which these communities re-assemble after the wet season, according to niche rather than dispersal processes.

AB  - Urban habitats are generally considered highly invaded by exotic species due to the frequency and extent of disturbance caused by human activities and development. Our previous study had demonstrated that forested wetlands within residential areas are more extensively invaded than wetlands within industrial-commercial areas. In this study, we investigate whether the structure of the forest edge and seed dispersal can explain the differential in the invasion of wetlands surrounded by industrial and residential land use. Our results indicate that edges of industrially bordered wetlands are denser, with vegetation concentrated at the boundary of tree growth, whereas the edges of residentially bordered wetlands are more open and diffuse. This difference influences the number of seeds and species capable of dispersing into the wetland. Less dense edges resulted in a higher number of seeds entering residential wetlands; however, there were no differences in the numbers of exotic seeds or exotic species in the seed rain residential and industrial wetlands. Although seed dispersal could not directly explain differences in the current extent of invasion of these sites, seed dispersal did follow corridor pathways, including ditches and trails that breach the edges and extend through the wetlands. These disturbances act as corridors for seed dispersal into both types wetlands and may play a role in introducing new species to the interior of the wetland, an outcome supported by a higher number of exotic species in the seed banks of residential sites. Our results suggest that both the type of adjoining land use and the provision of access to people on trails in urban wetlands can affect the composition of these communities.

AB  - This article had the main objective to identify Landscape Unities corresponding to the vegetation in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero area, in Minas Gerais. The study looks to contribute with the identification of homogeneous areas in the shape of territorial unities, for the composition of methods about the territorial strategic planning. For this, nuclear area landscape metrics were used, shape index and fractal connectivity, identified as the main metrics which depict quality and vegetation fractal embrittlement condition. Afterward, a Multicriterial Analysis by EvidenceWeight according to the priority level for each metric, for integration of the analysis and identification of the greater values fractal bearing in mind the three aspects. As a result, twomain unitieswere obtained: notable vegetation landscape; and vegetation with a higher vulnerability to transformation. Was observed a concentration of notable landscapes of vegetation on the central and southeast Quadrilatero's areas, mainly at the Serra do Gandarela, Serra da Moeda and Serra do Caraca. In counterpart, the areas corresponding to the south and north of the Quadrilatero, besides being closer to the urban centers, has shown to be more likely to be transformed due to the isolation of the fragments. Stem from this analysis, the importance of the ConservationUnits maintenance is bolstered, which are fundamental to the natural resource's protection. The landscape metrics is rated as an important tool of landscape analysis through pattern identification and the understanding of the dynamics of a geographic region. At last, the multicriteria analysis is understood as an important tool for supporting the decision making, being able to evaluate different variables to obtain interest rankings, in agreement with the demanded objectives.

AB  - The connectivity of protected area networks depends on key elements located in strategic positions within the landscape, which uphold the ecological fluxes and sustain the diversity and longterm viability of native biota. Landscape planning requires objective and quantitative approaches to identify those key elements and reinforce the spatial coherence of protected area designs and related conservation schemes. With this objective, we apply for the first time recent methodological developments that, deriving from the probability of connectivity index, allow evaluating the role of both individual protected areas and links in the intermediate landscape matrix as providers of connectivity between the rest of the sites in the network. We focus on a case study covering the forest protected areas from the Cantabrian Range to the Western Alps (N Spain, S France and NW Italy), considering different dispersal distances and the impact of highways. We show how the proposed approach is useful to identify those protected areas and links that most contribute to uphold functional connectivity in this transnational network, as well as those road sectors where the defragmentation and barrier effect mitigation measures should be prioritized. We compare our results with other more qualitative and expert-based approaches that have been reported in the same area. The methodological approach could be easily adopted in a variety of other related landscape planning applications at different scales, with the required quantitative tools being available as free and open source software packages.

AB  - The land-sparing/land-sharing debate remains an oversimplified framework to evaluate landscape management strategies that aim to reconcile food production and biodiversity conservation. Still, biodiversity-yield curves, on which the framework has relied, provide valuable qualitative information on biodiversity's sensitivity to agricultural practices, and much research has studied this relationship. But the potential effect of landscape configuration on biodiversity's response to intensification has rarely been considered; besides, studies have often taken yield as an indicator of agricultural management and have generalized conclusions from studying particular taxonomic groups. In this work we adapt a metacommunity model to analyze factors that shape biodiversity's response to agricultural intensification while addressing some of the simplifications of the sparing/sharing dichotomy. In particular, we study species richness decline in landscapes encompassing a combined gradient in matrix quality and configurational heterogeneity of habitat patches, and considering community dynamics. We found that species richness along an intensification gradient shifts from following a robust response to presenting an abrupt decline, as landscape heterogeneity increases, as minimum viable population increases or as habitat area decreases. Our work highlights the interdependent effects of heterogeneity, habitat availability and matrix quality on biodiversity and contributes to a nuanced understanding of ecological and landscape factors that enable a robust response of biodiversity in the face of spatiotemporal perturbations.

AB  - Communities that live in linear systems such as streams or riparian zones may be particularly sensitive to changes in habitat connectivity. I examined the relationship between environmental variables, the number of low-head dams downstream of each reach, and fish species richness in first-order streams in Wisconsin, USA. The analysis was based on an extensive database of 13 628 localities and similar to 180 000 individual collection records. The environmental variables included climate, elevation, distance from nearest town, and network-specific measures such as link number (the number of first-order tributaries upstream of the current reach), downstream link number, stream order, and fractal dimension. The link number of the downstream reach was the strongest broad-scale correlate of fish species richness in first-order streams. Path analysis of a simple directed graph suggested that, although downstream dams have a significant effect on fish species richness, this effect is small by comparison to the influence of water quantity and summer maximum temperatures. From a management perspective, the results imply that modifications of water volume and temperature are greater threats to fish communities than the decrease in connectivity that results from low-head dams.

AB  - The value of ponds in urban areas historically has been overlooked. While some recent studies have described considerable biodiversity in urban areas, it is unclear as to how far this extends to different urban habitats. The aims of this study were to determine the condition of 21 urban ponds in Bradford (northern England) and to quantify the connectivity of wetlands in the district. The study showed that macroinvertebrate and plant biodiversity was substantially lower than would be expected based on pristine reference sites. Of the 21 ponds surveyed, 15 were found to be classified as having very poor ecological quality, with 5 being classed as poor and just 1 was classed as moderate. The number of aquatic plant species found in the ponds ranged from 0 to 6 and the number of macroinvertebrate families found ranged from 4 to 13. It was suspected that the aquatic plant diversity was low due to management techniques such as the removal of emergent vegetation. The average distance to a wetland was found to be higher in urban areas (533 m) compared to rural areas (448 m) although this difference was small, which indicates that the low diversity found in urban ponds is likely due to habitat variables.

AB  - Patch-based graphs are widely used to display and quantify landscape connectivity. They are specially relevant for decision support in land planning and biological conservation. Matching connectivity analyses with practical actions in agricultural landscapes involves considering management units rather than habitat patches. However, at a local scale, the classical method for prioritizing graph elements (node removal) using connectivity indexes such as delta IIC could be viewed as a highly contrived approach with respect to the actual changes in land use. Here we address the relevance of this method compared to simulations likely to display these land-use changes in a more realistic way. Prioritization as determined by the removal method is tested here against simulated land use changes in four scenarios (e.g. replacing grasslands by croplands) for an agricultural area in the Jura massif (eastern France) where field actions are undertaken to combat the spread of grassland rodents. The results obtained by ranking all the parcels ("enumerative" approach) show that the removal method provides rankings similar to those obtained with the land-use change scenarios, except for the planting of hedgerows. However, defining a limited number of key parcels ("cumulative" approach) results in different rankings whatever the scenarios. This shows that when applying parcel-based graphs to practical actions, the reliability of the removal method depends on the way the connectivity analysis is conducted. Simulating land-use changes, which is more realistic but more time-consuming, proves relevant if only a few key parcels need to be identified for actions to be conducted in the field.

AB  - Ticks are increasingly reported in urban and peri-urban areas, such as city parks or peri-urban forests, across Europe. Land use changes, like the transformation of natural ecosystems into residential or recreational areas, and the restoration of natural areas connectivity for biodiversity purposes, facilitate human contact with these vectors. We evaluated the infestation by Ixodid ticks and their infection by zoonotic agents in two natural re-serves (La Mandria and Stupinigi) in the urban area of Turin, northwestern Italy, near to densely inhabited suburbs and consistently frequented by people. We monthly performed dragging in 15 sites during a three-year period (2012-2014).
   Over 4000 ticks were collected, belonging to the species: Ixodes ricinus, I. acuminatus, Dermacentor marginatus, D. reticulatus, and Haemaphysalis concinna. The tick burden in La Mandria, a park very rich in wildlife, was higher than in Stupinigi, which is surrounded by a grid of roads and cultivated fields. The occurrence of I. ricinus nymphs was mainly related to habitat diversity and seasonal variation but weakly influenced by wildlife presence. Conversely, the density of I. ricinus nymphs were effectively estimated by vegetation coverage, micro-climatic conditions, and the presence of large wildlife. Molecular analyses showed the infections by Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. (24.1 %), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (2.9 %), and Spotted Fever Group rickettsiae (30.4 %) in I. ricinus. Tick-borne encephalitis virus, that is considered so far absent in northwestern Italy, was not detected. In La Mandria, the risk of encountering one I. ricinus nymph infected by Borrelia burgorferi s.l. in 100 m(2) was 59.1 % (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 36.3-83.0), and 71.3 % (95%CI: 44.5-93.0) for Rickettsia spp.
   Educational programs on personal protection and surveillance on tick-borne diseases should be enhanced to face the threat posed by tick vectors in green urban landscapes.

AB  - The abundance of woodland birds in fragmented forest landscapes may depend on the properties of patch networks. Understanding the consequences of deforestation on woodland birds, therefore, necessarily requires determining which changes in landscape structure make a major contribution to the degradation and subdivision of patch networks. In this study, we addressed how accelerated deforestation in central Chile has modified the landscape structure and function for thorn-tailed rayaditos-a woodland specialist bird. Using a graphical approach based on the habitat use and movement patterns of rayaditos, we quantified the reduction of the internal connectivity of components (i.e., connected patch networks) in the last two decades and determined the main mechanisms responsible for this connectivity loss. Forest cover decreased 61.7 % between 1989 and 2009. The component size, the fraction of components with a parts per thousand yen1 occupied patches and the number of patches per component experienced a large decline during the study period. Over time, most forest cover (ca. 80 %) was contained in only two components. The connectivity of components decreased steeply by 90 %. Only the loss of large patches made a highly significant contribution to explaining changes in connectivity, while the removal of stepping stones was marginally significant. The conversion of forest both to shrubland and to peri-urban areas were the only land-use variables explaining connectivity change with effects that changed over time. Conservation measures to ensure persistence of rayaditos populations in central Chile should be focused on the retention of key elements for connectivity.

AB  - Selecting urban ecological patches is of great significance for constructing urban green infrastructure network, protecting urban biodiversity and ecological environment. With the support of GIS technology, a criterion for selecting sources of patches was developed according to existing planning Then ecological source patches of terrestrial organism, aquatic and amphibious organism were selected in Wuhan city. To increase the connectivity of the ecological patches and achieve greater ecological protection benefits, the green infrastructure networks in Wuhan city were constructed with the minimum path analysis method. Finally, the characteristics of ecological source patches were analyzed with landscape metrics, and ecological protection importance degree of ecological source patches were evaluated comprehensively. The results showed that there were 23 important ecological source patches in Wuhan city, among which Sushan Temple Forest Patch, Lu Lake and Shangshe Lake Wetland Patch were the most important in all kinds of patches for ecological protection. This study can provide a scientific basis for the preservation of urban ecological space, the delineation of natural conservation areas and the protection of biological diversity.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the agents that contribute most to habitat fragmentation and is therefore a threat to biodiversity conservation. Connectivity improvement is the adaptation strategy most often cited to address species conservation in a changing environment.
   Many studies of protection at local and regional level zones usually show separate portions of habitat, defining the protected area, but they do not provide guidance on where and how to act to preserve the habitat quality and connectivity of the populations, on a consistent scale with planning units.
   In this paper, the analysis of fragmentation-connectivity focuses on cereal steppes of the Jarama and Henares rivers (Spain) to study the habitat and connectivity of steppic birds populations into protected areas of the Natura 2000 network, quantifying the effect on this protected area and on the species of interest caused by the massive development of infrastructure and urbanization due to the expansion of Madrid metropolitan area. In this sense, the Great Bustard (Otis tarda) was used as a bioindicator, due to its high demand for habitat quality.
   The proposed methodology only needs to be based on data from wildlife sightings and land use. Once the variables (density, biophysics and urbanization) were defined, it was possible to determine the values of influence, applying them to generate the map of areas of probability of presence and movement of the Great Bustard. This can be used to support conservation plans based on habitat connectivity.

AB  - Cities have a major impact on Australian landscapes, especially in coastal regions, to the detriment of native biodiversity. Areas suitable for urban development often coincide with those areas that support high levels of species diversity and endemism. However, there is a paucity of reliable information available to guide urban conservation planning and management, especially regarding the trade-off between investing in protecting and restoring habitat at the landscape level, and investing in programmes to maintain the condition of remnant vegetation at the local (site) level. We review the literature on Australian urban ecology, focusing on urban terrestrial and aquatic vertebrate and invertebrate fauna. We identify four main factors limiting our knowledge of urban fauna: (i) a lack of studies focusing at multiple ecological levels; (ii) a lack of multispecies studies; (iii) an almost total absence of long-term (temporal) studies; and (iv) a need for stronger integration of research outcomes into urban conservation planning and management. We present a set of key principles for the development of a spatially explicit, long-term approach to urban fauna research. This requires an understanding of the importance of local-level habitat quality and condition relative to the composition, configuration and connectivity of habitats within the larger urban landscape. These principles will ultimately strengthen urban fauna management and conservation planning by enabling us to prioritize and allocate limited financial resources to maximize the conservation return.

AB  - Emergence of cities and road networks have characterised human activity and movement over millennia. However, this anthropogenic infrastructure does not develop in isolation, but is deeply embedded in the natural landscape, which strongly influences the resultant spatial patterns. Nevertheless, the precise impact that landscape has on the location, size and connectivity of cities is a long-standing, unresolved problem. To address this issue, we incorporate high-resolution topographic maps into a Turing-like pattern forming system, in which local reinforcement rules result in co-evolving centres of population and transport networks. Using Italy as a case study, we show that the model constrained solely by topography results in an emergent spatial pattern that is consistent with Zipf's Law and comparable to the census data. Thus, we infer the natural landscape may play a dominant role in establishing the baseline macro-scale population pattern, that is then modified by higher-level historical, socio-economic or cultural factors.

AB  - 1. Nature conservation and restoration traditionally focus on protecting individual sites. In parts of the world where the natural landscape has been severely altered for agricultural or urban use, individual patches are too small and isolated to ensure effective nature protection. Spatial processes, such as metapopulation dynamics, are disrupted and natural linkages in the landscape, such as water flows, are severed by modifications in the landscape and hydrology.
   2. We propose the identification of Operational Landscape Units (OLUs), which are defined as combinations of landscape patches with their hydrogeological and biotic connections, as a tool to facilitate wetland restoration in catchments with a high degree of fragmentation and strongly altered hydrology. The combined consideration of biotic (i.e. dispersal, transports of organisms) and hydrological connections (flooding events, groundwater flowpaths) is a new approach.
   3. We developed criteria for the delineation of OLUs in regional wetland restoration initiatives. The key elements for delineation are definition of the restoration objectives, identification of spatial landscape mechanisms and information on historic and present land uses and hydrologic management.
   4. As a case study, we delineated an OLU by applying these criteria in a restoration initiative for a large agricultural area that used to be a floodplain until the early 1950s in N.E. Twente, The Netherlands. The OLU encompassed not only the floodplain area to be restored but also a relatively remote nature reserve upstream as well as the stream connecting both areas. By restoring the historic water regime, flooding events would become a regular feature in the two areas and organisms including seeds would flow from the nature reserve to the restored floodplain.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Discussions of the proposed Operational Landscape Units with stakeholders (water authorities, nature conservation agencies, farmers) resulted in shared insights which will lead to modifications of the original management plan for the area. We believe the OLU approach will make natural resource managers aware of the importance of spatial processes and connectivity in landscapes and.. if properly applied, will lead to more natural and more successful restoration projects.

AB  - Local scale movement behavior is an important basis to predict large-scale bird movements in heterogeneous landscapes. Here we conducted playback experiments using mobbing calls to estimate the probability that forest birds would cross a 50-m urban area during three seasons (breeding, dispersal, and wintering seasons) with varying amounts of tree cover, building area, and electric wire density. We examined the responses of four forest resident species: Marsh Tit (Poecile palustris), Varied Tit (Sittiparus varius), Japanese Tit (P. minor), and Eurasian Nuthatch (Sitta europaea) in central Hokkaido, northern Japan. We carried out and analyzed 250 playback experiments that attracted 618 individuals. Our results showed that tree cover increased the crossing probability of three species other than Varied Tit. Building area and electric wire density had no detectable effect on crossing probability for four species. Seasonal difference in the crossing probability was found only for Varied Tit, and the probability was the highest in the breeding season. These results suggest that the positive effect of tree cover on the crossing probability would be consistent across seasons. We therefore conclude that planting trees would be an effective way to promote forest bird movement within an urban landscape.

AB  - As elements of green infrastructure, railway embankments are important corridors in urban environments connecting otherwise isolated habitat fragments. They are interrupted when railways cross major roads. It is not known whether dispersing animals use railway bridges to cross roads. We examined the function of a set-aside iron-steel railway bridge crossing a 12 m wide road with high traffic density in Basel (Switzerland) for dispersing animals. We installed drift fences with traps on a single-track, 32 m long and 6 m wide railway bridge with a simple gravel bed, and collected animals daily for 9 months. We captured more than 1200 animals crossing the bridge: small mammals, reptiles and amphibians as well as numerous invertebrates including snails, woodlice, spiders, harvestmen, millipedes, carabids, rove beetles and ants. For some animals it is likely that the gravel bed, at least temporarily, serves as a habitat. Many animals, however, were apparently dispersing, using the bridge to cross the busy road. We found season- and daytime -dependent differences in the frequency the bridge was used. Our findings indicate an important function of a set-aside railway bridges for connecting urban habitats. As most animal dispersal was recorded during the night, railway bridges with no (or little) traffic during the night may also contribute to animal dispersal. As important elements of green infrastructure, set-aside railway bridges should be considered in future urban planning.

AB  - Major roads cause barrier effect and fragmentation on wildlife habitats that are suitable places for feeding, mating, socializing, and hiding. Due to wildlife collisions (Wc), human-wildlife conflicts result in lost lives and loss of biodiversity. Geographical information system (GIS)-based multi criteria evaluation (MCE) methods have been successfully used in short-term planning of road networks considering wild animals. Recently, wildlife passages have been effectively utilized as road engineering structures provide quick and certain solutions for traffic safety and wildlife conservation problems. GIS-based MCE methods provide decision makers with optimum location for ecological passages based on habitat suitability models (HSMs) that classify the areas based on ecological requirements of target species. In this study, ecological passages along Motorway 52 within forested areas in Mediterranean city of Osmaniye in Turkey were evaluated. Firstly, HSM coupled with nine eco-geographic decision variables were developed based on ecological requirements of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) that were chosen as target species. Then specified decision variables were evaluated using GIS-based weighted linear combination (WLC) method to estimate movement corridors and mitigation points along the motorway. In the solution process, two linkage nodes were evaluated for eco-passages which were determined based on the leastcost movement corridor intersecting with the motorway. One of the passages was identified as a natural wildlife overpass while the other was suggested as underpass construction. The results indicated that computer-based models provide accurate and quick solutions for positioning ecological passages to reduce environmental effects of road networks on wild animals.

AB  - Urban expansion can fundamentally alter wildlife movement and gene flow, but how urbanization alters pathogen spread is poorly understood. Here, we combine high resolution host and viral genomic data with landscape variables to examine the context of viral spread in puma (Puma concolor) from two contrasting regions: one bounded by the wildland urban interface (WUI) and one unbounded with minimal anthropogenic development (UB). We found landscape variables and host gene flow explained significant amounts of variation of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) spread in the WUI, but not in the unbounded region. The most important predictors of viral spread also differed; host spatial proximity, host relatedness, and mountain ranges played a role in FIV spread in the WUI, whereas roads might have facilitated viral spread in the unbounded region. Our research demonstrates how anthropogenic landscapes can alter pathogen spread, providing a more nuanced understanding of host-pathogen relationships to inform disease ecology in free-ranging species. Nick Fountain-Jones et al. use genomic and spatial data to examine how urbanization affects the spread of the pathogen feline immunodeficiency virus in pumas from areas of varying anthropogenic development. Their results show that landscape variables and host gene flow explained significant amounts of variation in virus spread in a region bounded by urban development but did not in a more wild landscape, demonstrating how anthropogenic landscapes can alter pathogen spread.

AB  - Sustaining biodiversity depends on conservation actions coordinated at spatial extents large enough to maintain ecological processes. Numerous conservation prioritizations have been conducted resulting in gridded maps of pixels representing importance. However, it is not always clear how to move from priority pixels to landscape conservation designs, as pixels do not represent tangible, coherent landscapes for conservation attention. We attempted to move from pixels to landscapes by locating patches of high value pixels and overlaying level IV ecoregions from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to delineate 74 landscapes ranging from 2927 to 95,962 km(2). These landscapes were delineated to represent large areas of high wildland conservation value on which landscape conservation plans could focus, but where such plans would be embedded in national conservation priorities. After delineating landscapes, we assessed how well they represented the highest value areas with respect to ecological integrity, connectivity value, ecosystem representation priority, and biodiversity priority. We also assessed socio-economic condition of people within landscapes by evaluating economic and demographic data for counties within and adjacent to landscapes. Landscapes represented well high value lands with respect to ecological integrity, connectivity, and the composite wildland value, but poorly captured the highest value places with respect to ecosystem representation priority in the nation's protected area system. Land ownership and protected status of landscapes varied from <1% to 96% in federal ownership and <1% to 50% in existing highly protected areas. Counties intersecting our landscapes reflected the diversity of socio-economic conditions of the contiguous US. Our analysis and results represent a means of moving from priority pixels to delineated landscapes where conservation plans can be developed collaboratively.

AB  - Roads are a main cause of habitat fragmentation but mitigating the full road network is unfeasible. A key goal in the road mitigation planning process is to highlight, at the transportation network level, the most problematic roads, i.e. where mitigation measures are most required in order to maximize the benefits for biodiversity while keeping implementation costs as low as possible. Grounded on the concepts of habitat amount and accessible habitat, we prioritized roads for mitigation based on dual spatial graphs, where the land polygons delimited by roads are the nodes and the roads themselves are the links. The rationale was to identify those links (roads) that connect the nodes with higher potential biodiversity (as a proxy for quality habitat). We applied this approach to prioritize the defragmentation of the major road network of the Iberian Peninsula, targeting all native mammalian carnivores inhabiting this region. Our goal was to identify those roads that, by dividing areas with the best habitat quality and/or are major potential barriers for connectivity, should be prioritized in the mitigation process. We used two complementary metrics: Area Weighted Metric and the Integral Index of Connectivity. Highlighted roads bisect regions of high potential biodiversity for carnivores in northern Spain and along the Portugal-Spain border. Thirty-five roads were scored as high-priority by both metrics, suggesting that they have particular impact both in the amount of quality habitat and in overall landscape functional connectivity. This approach is completely scalable, allowing a fast assessment from local to continental scales.

AB  - Latin America is one of the world's most urbanised regions, with more than 80% of inhabitants living in urban areas and over 50 cities with at least 1 million inhabitants. The concept of urban structure types (UST) allows the dynamics of a growing urban environment to be captured in its quantity and quality. They are defined as areas of homogenous appearance in the urban matrix with a recognisable mixture of built-up areas and open spaces. We used the vegetation-impervious-soil (V-I-S) model approach to classify and monitor different types of USTs in Santiago (similar to 800 km2), Chile between 1985 and 2015. The V-I-S model is based on a simplification of the large diversity of urban land cover types in three general categories: vegetation, impervious surfaces and soil. These categories were obtained by processing Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI images. First, we applied standard radiometric calibration and co-registration methods to all datasets. Second, using a linear spectral unmixing algorithm we performed a soft classification of urban land cover types (end members): trees, shrubs, herbaceous plants, soils, buildings, roads and water bodies. All end members were validated using a combination of photointerpretation on high-resolution images (similar to 1 m) and field data collection (only for 2015). In each pixel we used the resulting probability scores, logically grouped, to obtain final values for each V-I-S component. Third, we used statistical clustering of V-I-S values to create a set of eight pixel groups, which we interpreted as USTs and mapped them for each date. The overall accuracy for V-I-S components in 1985 and 2015 were 78% and 82%, respectively, and errors did not exhibit any spatial correlation. The main sources of differentiation between USTs were the trade-off proportions between vegetation and impervious components, whereas soil proportions remained near 5% across the city in both dates. To analyse the change in UST spatial configuration between dates, we used a set of selected landscape metrics and discussed their use as indicators for sustainable urban development. These indicators relate to the dispersion pattern of urban growth, the connectivity of open green space and the complexity in the composition of the UST types within the different sectors of the city. We were able to identify, using the dynamics exhibited by the USTs, three main zones: (1) city centre, where USTs of high-intensity development predominate, (2) eastern high-income areas whose spatial structure is marked by a relatively high urbanisation intensity with a very large proportion of vegetated spaces, and (3) peripheral areas, with significant changes in composition and configuration of USTs, in recent decades, showing high rates of urbanisation, shifting from low-medium to high densities. We concluded that these patterns and their dynamics are mainly determined by the spatial socio-economic stratification of the population.

AB  - A wide body of research in recent years has studied either green infrastructures as providers of multiple ecosystem services, especially at the urban level, or ecological corridors and the issue of connectivity between landscape patches in the face of growing fragmentation. However, not many studies have analyzed how the two concepts can be combined to ground evidence-based policy and planning recommendations. In this study, a methodological approach for such a combination is proposed: after mapping a regional green infrastructure building upon the assessment of multiple ecosystem services and a network of ecological corridors through the resistance to movement of species, the two spatial layouts are combined so as to analyze correlations between the potential provision of ecosystem services and the resistance to movement. The methodology is applied in the case of the island of Sardinia, whose self-containment makes it possible to discard potential effects from surrounding areas, hence facilitating the implementation of the model. The outcomes of the regression model point out three ecosystem services as the most important factors that should be targeted by appropriate spatial policies if connectivity is to be increased: regulation of micro and local climate, forestry productivity, and cultural identity and heritage values.

AB  - Context Cities are a challenging habitat for obligate nocturnal mammals because of the ubiquitous use of artificial light at night (ALAN). How nocturnal animals move in an urban landscape, particularly in response to ALAN is largely unknown. Objectives We studied the movement responses, foraging and commuting, of common noctules (Nyctalus noctula) to urban landscape features in general and ALAN in particular. Methods We equipped 20 bats with miniaturized GPS loggers in the Berlin metropolitan area and related spatial positions of bats to anthropogenic and natural landscape features and levels of ALAN. Results Common noctules foraged close to ALAN only next to bodies of water or well vegetated areas, probably to exploit swarms of insects lured by street lights. In contrast, they avoided illuminated roads, irrespective of vegetation cover nearby. Predictive maps identified most of the metropolitan area as non-favoured by this species because of high levels of impervious surfaces and ALAN. Dark corridors were used by common noctules for commuting and thus likely improved the permeability of the city landscape. Conclusions We conclude that the spatial use of common noctules, previously considered to be more tolerant to light than other bats, is largely constrained by ALAN. Our study is the first individual-based GPS tracking study to show sensitive responses of nocturnal wildlife to light pollution. Approaches to protect urban biodiversity need to include ALAN to safeguard the larger network of dark habitats for bats and other nocturnal species in cities.

AB  - Dams are ubiquitous in coastal regions and have altered stream habitats and the distribution and abundance of stream fishes in those habitats by disrupting hydrology, temperature regime and habitat connectivity. Dam removal is a common restoration tool, but often the response of the fish assemblage is not monitored rigorously. Sedgeunkedunk Stream, a small tributary to the Penobscot River (Maine, USA), has been the focus of a restoration effort that includes the removal of two low-head dams. In this study, we quantified fish assemblage metrics along a longitudinal gradient in Sedgeunkedunk Stream and also in a nearby reference stream. By establishing pre-removal baseline conditions and associated variability and the conditions and variability immediately following removal, we can characterize future changes in the system associated with dam removal. Over 2?years prior to dam removal, species richness and abundance in Sedgeunkedunk Stream were highest downstream of the lowest dam, lowest immediately upstream of that dam and intermediate farther upstream; patterns were similar in the reference stream. Although seasonal and annual variation in metrics within each site was substantial, the overall upstream-to-downstream pattern along the stream gradient was remarkably consistent prior to dam removal. Immediately after dam removal, we saw significant decreases in richness and abundance downstream of the former dam site and a corresponding increase in fish abundance upstream of the former dam site. No such changes occurred in reference sites. Our results show that by quantifying baseline conditions in a small stream before restoration, the effects of stream restoration efforts on fish assemblages can be monitored successfully. These data set the stage for the long-term assessment of Sedgeunkedunk Stream and provide a simple methodology for assessment in other restoration projects. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Translocation is an important component of northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) recovery efforts, given the scale of their decline and inability to rapidly recolonize recently restored habitat. Repopulating sites in northern latitudes that are distant from reliable source populations may require long-distance trap and transport from southern locales, potentially compounding existing obstacles for this renascent population recovery technique. The landscape connectivity hypothesis predicts that site fidelity and survival would be lower if release properties are small and fragmented and home range sizes would be smaller and dispersal distances would be lower if habitat quality at the release site is perceived to be high and the surrounding matrix is of low permeability. We evaluated this hypothesis to determine if northern bobwhite survival, site fidelity, and resource selection following translocation differed between 2 contrasting landscapes in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. We translocated 508 radio-collared northern bobwhites from northern Florida and southern Georgia, to small, fragmented properties on the eastern shore of Maryland and large, contiguous properties in southern New Jersey, USA. We monitored northern bobwhites via radio-telemetry from approximately 1 April through 30 September, 2015-2018, 2-7 times a week. Breeding season (182 days after release) survival varied among sites, and was generally higher at the 2 New Jersey release sites than at the 2 Maryland sites, yet an acclimation period is ostensibly required to obtain reasonable breeding survival estimates to elicit population growth. Site fidelity, maximum dispersal distances, and home range sizes were lower at the smaller, fragmented Maryland properties than the larger New Jersey properties. These results support the landscape connectivity hypothesis such that reduced connectivity in our study decreased site fidelity and survival. Temporal variation in survival was potentially an artifact of translocation stress or maladaptive behavior during initial acclimation to the release sites, indicating that higher stocking rates may be needed to provide adequate founder abundance for translocation success. Northern bobwhites used early-successional cover at all sites, though selection varied based on scale of analysis and landscape context. These vital rate estimates and resource use patterns should be used to guide future translocations within the Mid-Atlantic, provide perspective for this population restoration technique range wide, and stimulate further investigation into limiting factors.

AB  - Accelerating pressures to accommodate rapidly increasing human populations in Australia pose major problems for insect conservation in urban and periurban regions from loss of natural habitats, alien species impacts and a variety of other causes. Several urban insects have become notable flagships for promoting wider conservation interests, leading to wider appreciation of environmental benefits of 'open spaces', urban forests, connectivity, 'green architecture' and other landscape features as relevant planning considerations in urban development. Their conservation, under a range of ecological contexts and threats, occurs in conjunction with energetic advocacy and educational programs that can emphasise the roles and diversity of Australia's unique insect fauna. Approaches to conserving native insects amidst urban intensification are discussed from selected case studies and citizen science projects that illustrate principles and complexities of single-species conservation, the values of indicator and diversity surrogate taxa and the implications of alien species on native insect diversity and its losses in urban environments. Important lessons and implications include the following: (1) recognition that taxonomic and ecological diversity of insects can be high in urban areas; (2) acknowledgment that insect diversity in urban environments is vulnerable to changes and a variety of threatening processes; (3) mitigation responses that involve reducing threats, preserving open spaces with natural vegetation, creating new open areas and promoting connectivity; (4) establishment of partnerships that enhance conservation values and prospects through individual people, local authorities and government agencies; and (5) increasing awareness of insects as integral components of ecological sustainability contributing to the wider values of urban environments.

AB  - Coastal dune systems are particularly fragile and threatened environments, which, however, provide fundamental ecosystem services to nearby urban areas acting for example as protective buffers against erosion. Correctly assessing their conservation status is a priority in order to manage them adequately and to plan urban development in coastal regions. In this paper we propose a practical multiscale method for the assessment of the conservation status of sandy coastal environment. The proposed method is articulated in two stages, one focusing on the landscape and the other on the plant community level. In the first phase mosaic structure and composition of the coastal landscape are analyzed using a series of indicators: natural coastal surface, richness of land cover typologies, landscape diversity and eveness, number and average size of habitat patches, and mean shape index. At a detailed scale, floristic, vegetational and structural aspects of the dune plant communities are analyzed along the main environmental gradient by measuring: spatial connectivity and richness of boundaries, species diversity, eveness and chorological index. In this work we apply and test the method in an experimental area on the Tyrrhenian coast of Italy (Latium region), comparing the conservation status of two study sites. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cities are hotspots of invasions, and this is particularly the case for urban rivers, which are known to serve as corridors for the spread of alien plant species to floodplain forests. Here, we present a case study on woody (shrubs, trees) species invasions across a gradient from a metropolis (Vienna) to rural regions along the Danube River in eastern Austria. In total, we identified 44 native and 25 alien woody species in 75 plots. Five alien woody species occur in at least 10 plots. The most wide-spread ones were species of floodplain forests (Acer negundo, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, and Populus x canadensis), while Ailanthus altissima and Robinia pseudoacacia-which prefer dry sites-were recorded substantially less often. The average level of invasion-i.e., the relative proportion of alien to native woody species in plots-was high across all three study regions. Still, there was a moderate decline of alien woody species richness along the urban-peri-urban-rural gradient. Generalized Linear Mixed Models showed that population density and the proportion of urban habitats in the environs of the plots is significantly positively correlated with the presence of Acer negundo and Ailanthus altissima. Conversely, the occurrence of Robinia pseudoacacia is negatively correlated with surrounding population density and urban habitats. Occurrence of Acer negundo is positively correlated with urban habitats. For Fraxinus pennsylvanica, we found no significant relationships. Our results confirm that gallery forests at river banks are highly susceptible to invasions. We argue that managing alien woody species in urban and peri-urban sites is not appropriate and useful, given that re-invasion is likely in most cases (from adjacent urban green spaces). We acknowledge that this recommendation entails the implicit recognition that gallery forests along urban sections of the Danube will contain a substantial-and likely further increasing-proportion of alien woody species.

AB  - The conversion of rural land to residential use is occurring rapidly as the global trend of city expansion continues. The impact of this land use change on riparian biodiversity was investigated by examining ant communities from 12 remnant riparian corridors in northwest Sydney, Australia. Ants were sampled from rural and urban catchments using pitfall traps. Data on vegetation floristics, habitat structure and stream water quality were also collected. No significant differences in ant diversity metrics or assemblage structure were found between urban and rural sites. Similarly, very few environmental variables revealed significant differences between land use types. One exception, however, was the percentage cover of exotic plants, which was related to ant assemblage structure. Small-leaved and broad-leaved privet (Ligustrum spp.) were highly correlated with total weed cover. The results suggest that ants respond mostly to small-scale habitat characteristics, especially those related to the dominance of exotic plants. As all sites had experienced some level of human impact, it is possible that all the sites have already transgressed an ecological threshold due to the earlier catchment land use change from natural to agricultural use. This apparent sensitivity may explain the failure to observe any significant differences between the urban and rural catchments examined in this study. It is recommended that managers looking to protect the integrity of riparian invertebrate communities should focus on addressing local habitat pressures in human-modified catchments.

AB  - 1. In poorly dispersing species gene flow can be facilitated when suitable habitat is widespread, allowing for increased dispersal between neighbouring locations. The Poweshiek skipperling [Oarisma poweshiek (Parker)], a federally endangered butterfly, has undergone a rapid, recent demographic decline following the loss of tallgrass prairie and fen habitats range wide. The loss of habitat, now restricted geographic range, and poor dispersal ability have left O. poweshiek at increased risk of extinction.
   2. We studied the population genetics of six remaining populations of O. poweshiek in order to test the hypothesis that gene flow was historically high despite limited long-distance dispersal capability. Utilising nine microsatellite loci developed by PacBio sequencing, we tested for patterns of isolation by distance, low population genetic structure and alternative gene flow models.
   3. Populations from southern Manitoba, Canada to the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, USA are only weakly genetically differentiated despite having low diversity. We found no support for isolation by distance, and Bayesian estimates of historical gene flow support our hypothesis that high levels of gene flow previously connected populations from Michigan to Wisconsin.
   4. Prairie grasslands have been reduced tremendously over the past century, but the low mobility of O. poweshiek suggests that rapid loss of populations over the past decade cannot be simply explained by fragmentation of habitat.
   5. As a species at high risk of extinction, understanding historical processes of gene flow will allow for informed management decisions with respect to head-starting individuals for population reintroductions and for conserving networks of habitat that will allow for high levels of gene flow.

AB  - Valuable habitats in various spatial configurations are essential for maintaining biodiversity across highly fragmented urban landscapes. In a large-scale study, we explored the value of human-made structures - river levees - as valuable habitats that support large populations of plants and butterflies and affects the spatial turnover of species within an urban landscape. The most significant environmental variables affecting plant and butterfly populations on levees were also examined. The richness of native plant species was about 25% greater on levee transects than on control grassland transects. However, the richness and abundance of butterflies on levees were the same as on grassland sites. Among environmental factors, urban area cover negatively affected the richness of native plant species. Shrub cover decreases the richness and abundance of butterfly species. In addition, high mowing intensity had a negative influence on abundance. Community dissimilarity of plants on levees was affected by spatial variables. Our study is the first to highlight levees as significant habitats for plant and herbivorous insect persistence, and their potential function for plant dispersal. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Because of its role in many ecological processes, movement of animals in response to landscape features is an important subject in ecology and conservation biology. In this paper, we develop models of animal movement in relation to objects or fields in a landscape. We took a finite mixture modeling approach in which the component densities are conceptually related to different choices for movement in response to a landscape feature, and the mixing proportions are related to the probability of selecting each response as a function of one or more covariates. We combined particle swarm optimization and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain maximum-likelihood estimates of the model parameters. We used this approach to analyze data for movement of three bobcats in relation to urban areas in southern California, USA. A behavioral interpretation of the models revealed similarities and differences in bobcat movement response to urbanization. All three bobcats avoided urbanization by moving either parallel to urban boundaries or toward less urban areas as the proportion of urban land cover in the surrounding area increased. However, one bobcat, a male with a dispersal-like large-scale movement pattern, avoided urbanization at lower densities and responded strictly by moving parallel to the urban edge. The other two bobcats, which were both residents and occupied similar geographic areas, avoided urban areas using a combination of movements parallel to the urban edge and movement toward areas of less urbanization. However, the resident female appeared to exhibit greater repulsion at lower levels of urbanization than the resident male, consistent with empirical observations of bobcats in southern California. Using the parameterized finite mixture models, we mapped behavioral states to geographic space, creating a representation of a behavioral landscape. This approach can provide guidance for conservation planning based on analysis of animal movement data using statistical models, thereby linking connectivity evaluations to empirical data.

AB  - Agricultural intensification has caused drastic declines in the area and species richness of semi-natural grasslands across Europe. Novel habitats, such as power line clearings, provide alternative habitats and niches for grassland species, and might therefore mitigate these declines. However, it is not fully understood which environmental factors determine the occurrence of grassland species in the clearings. Identifying the most important drivers for grassland species occurrence would help understand the value of the clearings for grassland conservation and target enhanced management into clearings with most potential as grassland habitat. We studied the effects of local environmental conditions, and past and present connectivity to semi-natural grasslands, on the species richness of grassland plants and butterflies in 43 power line clearings in Finland. The results of generalized linear models and hierarchical partitioning showed that increasing time since clear-cut and amount of clearing residue decreased the species richness of both species groups, while the cover of mesic habitats increased it. However, the two species groups showed also divergent responses. Present-day local environmental conditions appeared to be the sole driver of grassland butterfly species richness, whereas the richness of grassland plants was related both to current conditions and historical connectivity to grasslands in 1870-1880s. This suggests the presence of an extinction debt in the studied grassland plant communities, emphasizing the need for enhanced management to increase suitable grassland habitat in the clearings. This would diminish the potential future losses of grassland plant species in the clearings and create valuable habitat for grassland butterflies as well.

AB  - Urbanisation is a rapidly growing phenomenon that is affecting global biodiversity, but the integration of conservation goals into urban planning can minimise ecological damage. Conservation planning for birds can be informed by knowledge of species-habitat relationships, but opportunities for studying these relationships before urbanisation occurs are rare. Our study took place in the Molonglo Valley, southeastern Australia, where approximately 30% of the area will be developed for new human settlement over the next 30 years. We surveyed 80 sites for birds and used multiple regression to explore the role that land use, vegetation cover and structure play on total species richness, woodland species richness and prevalence (proportion of total species), and also on the presence of 10 woodland species. We found that total species richness was higher in river corridors and eucalypt woodland. Woodland species richness was higher in river corridors and eucalypt woodlands, and when leaf litter was present. Woodland species prevalence was higher in river corridors and when leaf litter and eucalypt regeneration were present. Individual woodland species showed a range of responses to five main structural and compositional categories: (1) land use, (2) tree cover and composition, (3) eucalypt regeneration, (4) shrub cover, and (5) ground cover attributes. We use these data on bird-habitat relationships to develop five recommendations on: (1) eucalypt woodland. (2) high quality riparian areas, (3) scattered trees, (4) eucalypt regeneration, and (5) structurally complex habitats, to aid policy makers, planners and developers to integrate conservation for woodland birds into their urban planning.

AB  - Urbanization exerts many pressures on species, yet little is known about how these pressures impact species interactions. Studies of urban plant-pollinator systems provide mounting evidence that urbanization impairs pollinator movement in fragmented urban landscapes, yet the consequences for pollinator-mediated plant reproduction remains unclear. In non-urban areas, habitat corridors can facilitate the movement of organisms including pollinators, but whether these corridors facilitate plant-pollinator interactions in urban areas remains understudied. To examine how urban environments and a green corridor influence plant-pollinator interactions, we measured reproductive success in the native plant common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), and the community structure of its pollinators, for two years along two urban-rural transects in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada, one of which followed a green corridor. We found that urbanization decreased male fitness (i.e., pollen removal), increased fruit set (i.e., mean no. of follicles per inflorescence), and inconsistently affected female fitness (i.e., no. of follicles) in A. syriaca. Urbanization simultaneously decreased pollinator abundance but increased pollinator richness. Proximity to a green corridor inconsistently affected male fitness but increased reproductive effort (i.e., no. of inflorescences) in A. syriaca, while pollinator diversity and richness was lower in the corridor. Notably, there were no consistent relationships between pollinator community structure and reproductive success in A. syriaca in both the presence, and absence, of a green corridor. These results demonstrate the complexity with which urbanization, a green corridor, and pollinator communities can shape the reproductive investment and fitness of native plant populations.

AB  - The proximity to transportation hubs and the large movement of goods and people in cities make trees especially prone to invasive insect pests. Urban tree arrangements, in isolated tree sites or in forest patches, may alter their susceptibility to insect herbivory. Surprisingly little is known about how urban tree spatial arrangements influence pest abundance and top-down regulation by natural enemies. We sampled the abundance of an invasive pest of Eucalyptus, the psyllid Glycaspis brimblecombei, and of two of its natural enemies, the specialist exotic parasitoid Psyllaephagus bliteus and the generalist native predator Anthocoris nemoralis over two years. We measured insect abundances in isolated trees versus monospecific planted forest patches in 17 pairs of sites, each within a Portuguese city. The abundance of the exotic pest was three-fold higher in forest patches than in isolated trees. The parasitism rate was similar to 30 times higher in forest patches (11.5 %) than in isolated trees (0.4 %). The interdependence among insect species abundances also differed between spatial arrangements. In isolated trees, predator and parasitoid abundances depended markedly on prey abundance. In forest patches, we found a marked dependence of the predator on the composition of the surrounding landscape. Our study adds empirical data indicating that urban tree isolation matters for pest abundance and regulation by its enemies. In similar systems, avoiding dense monospecific patches of exotic trees and increasing the compositional heterogeneity of the landscape are promising paths to maintain the sustainability of urban trees and their environmental and societal benefits.

AB  - Since the Chinese government carried out the reform and opening up policy, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture has experienced rapid urbanization and dramatic land use change. This research aims at analyzing urban expansion in Xishuangbanna and its impact on the land use pattern using combined methods, including radar graph, the gradient-direction method and landscape metrics. Seven land use maps from 1976 to 2015 were generated and analyzed, respectively. The results showed that urban and rubber expanded rapidly, while forest decreased during the last 40 years. The city proper, the county town of Menghai and the county town of Mengla showed the most significant and fastest urban expansion rates. In response to rapid urban expansion, land use types outside urban areas changed dramatically. In Jinghong and Mengla, urban areas were usually surrounded by paddy, shrub, rubber and forest in 1976, while most areas were dominated by rubber by 2015. With the development of Xishuangbanna, landscape diversity increased along urban-rural gradients, but decreased in some key urban areas. Urban expansion slightly reduced the connectivity of forest and increased agglomeration of rubber at the same time. Based on the analyses above, we moved forward to discuss the consequences of urban expansion, rubber plantations and land fragmentation.

AB  - The negative impact of habitat fragmentation due to human activities may be different in different species that co-exist in the same area, with consequences on the development of environmental protection plans. Here we aim at understanding the effects produced by different natural and anthropic landscape features on gene flow patterns in two sympatric species with different specializations, one generalist and one specialist, sampled in the same locations. We collected and genotyped 194 wood mice (generalist species) and 199 bank voles (specialist species) from 15 woodlands in a fragmented landscape characterized by different potential barriers to dispersal. Genetic variation and structure were analyzed in the two species, respectively. Effective migration surfaces, isolation-by-resistance (IBR) analysis, and regression with randomization were used to investigate isolation-by-distance (IBD) and the relative importance of land cover elements on gene flow. We observed similar patterns of heterozygosity and IBD for both species, but the bank vole showed higher genetic differences among geographic areas. The IBR analysis suggests that (i) connectivity is reduced in both species by urban areas but more strongly in the specialist bank vole; (ii) cultivated areas act as dispersal corridors in both species; (iii) woodlands appear to be an important factor in increasing connectivity in the bank vole, and less so in the wood mouse. The difference in dispersal abilities between a generalist and specialist species was reflected in the difference in genetic structure, despite extensive habitat changes due to human activities. The negative effects of fragmentation due to the process of urbanization were, at least partially, mitigated by another human product, i.e., cultivated terrains subdivided by hedgerows, and this was true for both species.

AB  - The growing wildland-urban interface is a frontier of human-wildlife conflict worldwide. Where natural and developed areas meet, there is potential for negative interactions between humans and wild animals, including wildlife-vehicle collisions. Understanding the environmental and anthropogenic factors leading to these collisions can inform transportation and habitat planning, with an objective of reducing animal mortality and human costs. We investigated spatial, temporal, and species-specific patterns of roadkill on Interstate-280 (I-280) in California, USA, and examined the effects of land cover, fencing, lighting, and traffic. The highway is situated just south of San Francisco, dividing a large wildlife refuge to the west from dense residential areas to the east, and therefore presents a major barrier to wildlife movement. Areas with a higher percentage of developed land east of I-280 and areas with more open space on the west side of I-280 were associated with an increase in overall roadkill, suggesting that hard boundaries at the wildland-urban interface may be zones of high risk for dispersing animals. This pattern was especially strong for raccoons (Procyon lotor) and black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus). The presence of lighting correlated with increased roadkill with the exception of coyote (Canis latrans). Contrary to our expectations, we found weak evidence that fencing increases roadkill, perhaps because animals become trapped on roadways or because fencing is not sufficient to block access to the road by wildlife. Finally, we found strong evidence for roadkill seasonality, correlated with differences in movement and dispersal across life-history stages. We highlight the value of citizen-science datasets for monitoring human-wildlife conflict and suggest potential mitigation measures to reduce the negative effects of wildlife-vehicle collisions for people and wildlife.

AB  - The pursuit of urban agriculture as part of a city's green infrastructure is often a challenge, particularly within compact cities, where there is a limited amount of space between buildings for urban farming and gardening. Instead, such high-rise urban developments present often under-utilized spaces on the vertical surfaces of buildings. A key unknown is the adequacy of light for plant growth. Many leafy vegetables that require high amounts of light form a significant proportion of the staple diet in many Asian countries. We report on the assessment of sunlight adequacy for growing leafy vegetables in a compact tropical city, based on the high-rise and high-density residential environment of Singapore. Leaf physiological traits of seven leafy vegetables were assessed and used to estimate plant light requirements. A survey of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) along exposed corridors showed that the daily light integral (DLI) value ranged from 2 to 35 mol m(-2) d(-1) under relatively ideal weather conditions during days with abundant solar insolation, and facades that experienced a minimum of half-day direct insolation matched the light requirements of vegetables within the moderate to very high-light categories. With regard to the building form, PAR increased gradually with height, but remains highly influenced by facade orientation and configuration. Owing to the annual north-south oscillation of the sun's path, reduced annual PAR variability and higher total annual PAR at facades, buildings with an east-west orientation will better support continuous vegetable cultivation, especially for basic building typologies without self-shading configurations. However, excessive PAR and temperatures during mid-day hours may hinder plant growth. By highlighting such patterns in levels of PAR, this study confirms the potential for high-rise and high-density conditions in the tropics to support farming using typically under-utilized vertical spaces of residential buildings.

AB  - Biodiversity is declining through human activities and urbanisation is often seen as a particular concern. Urban settings, however, provide diverse microclimatic conditions for plants and pollinating insects, and therefore may be significant habitats for the conservation of solitary and primitively eusocial bees, a major group of pollinators. This study analysed the interactions between these bees and the plants on which they forage, using a network approach. We compared urban habitats (gardens, roadsides, and open vegetation) in a large British town with nearby nature reserves. One native plant Taraxacum officinale (dandelion) was a core generalist species visited in all habitat types. Other core plant species restricted to particular habitats include species of Geranium, Bellis, Crepis, and Ranunculus. Two generalist bee species, Anthophora plumipes and Osmia bicornis were the core visitor species within the networks. The networks were comparatively more nested in urban habitat types than nature areas, suggesting more frequent interactions between generalist and specialist species in urban areas. Network connectance, network level specialisation (H-2' index), and plant generality (network level) were not significantly different in urban and nature areas. However, visitor generality was found to be significantly higher in urban gardens than in nature areas. Careful management of common urban vegetation would be beneficial for supporting urban wild pollinators.

AB  - Agri-environment schemes (AES) are widely used policy instruments intended to combat widespread biodiversity declines across agricultural landscapes. Here, using a light trapping and mark-release-recapture study at a field-scale on nine common and widespread larger moth species, we investigate the effect of wide field margins (a popular current scheme option) and the presence of hedgerow trees (a potential scheme option in England) on moth abundance. Of these, we show that wide field margins positively affected abundances, although species did not all respond in the same way. We demonstrate that this variation can be attributed to species-specific mobility characteristics. Those species for which the effect of wide margins was strongest covered shorter distances, and were more frequently recaptured at their site of first capture. This demonstrates that the standard, field-scale uptake of AES may be effective only for less mobile species. We discuss that a landscape-scale approach, in contrast, could deliver significant biodiversity gains, as our results indicate that such an approach (perhaps delivered through targeting farmers to join AES) would be effective for the majority of wider countryside species, irrespective of their mobility level.

AB  - Ponds are common features of the landscape and are considered important for freshwater biodiversity conservation. Although fish have a significant impact on the lentic ecosystems, the environmental factors that regulate fish assemblages in human-created water bodies, such as irrigation ponds, remain unclear. We evaluated the relationship between environmental factors and the fish assemblage structure in 31 ponds located in northern Japan. Species richness (range: 1-9) was positively correlated with the size of the inflow channel. Multivariate analyses revealed that the size of the inflow channel was a better predictor for species richness than lake morphology (surface area and maximum depth), vegetation coverage, water quality (turbidity, pH, DO, and EC), distance to the main channel, and distance to an adjacent pond. Species richness was significantly different between ponds with and without an inflow channel. Furthermore, three of the four most commonly observed species are thought to be relatively tolerant to low oxygen. Given that ponds have a relatively high local extinction rate resulting from exposure to stressful conditions, such as low oxygen and/or small population sizes, our results suggest that immigration from surrounding water bodies plays an important role in maintaining species richness of pond-dwelling fish.

AB  - A regional greenway network is proposed to reconnect ecologically the fragmented landscapes of south Florida. The natural landscapes of the region have been progressively fragmented on account of agricultural and urban development. It is proposed that the regional system of drainage canals and reservoir levees, which was originally developed to facilitate agriculture and urbanization, be ecologically reclaimed and managed to become a network of environmental restoration and cultural opportunity for south Florida. The existing regional system of drainage canals and reservoir levees is restrictively underutilized. Tn general, the value of utility and transportation corridors as natural and cultural resources has not been fully appreciated in south Florida. Their value as resources lies in the ample opportunity they offer for landscape revegetation, wetland reclamation, habitat restoration, and community education and recreation, In particular, the existing regional system of drainage canals and reservoir levees represents an extensive resource that can naturally and culturally link the fragmented landscapes of south Florida while maintaining flood control and water conservation.
   A tripartite method, based on the ecological principles of island biogeography theory and landscape network theory, is used to consider the geographical, morphological, and topological impact on natural diversity and cultural use. Respectively, the effects of network corridor area, network corridor width, and network connectivity and circuitry are described, analyzed, and evaluated for their potential effect on natural diversity and cultural use along the existing regional system of drainage canals and reservoir levees. Results indicate that the proposed regional greenway network is characterized by a large area, broad extent, morphological diversity, and topological connectivity. Variation in greenway structure and function along the regional network can accommodate a multitude of environmental concerns and cultural needs faced by the region. The regional greenway network affords ample flexibility, with three types of corridors (line, strip, and stream) within four types of context (urban, suburban, rural, and natural). Recommendations are made to appraise opportunities further at the regional level, conduct ecological corridor research at the landscape scale, and develop a greenway prototype at a specific community site.

AB  - Many grassland specialist plant populations in Europe have become restricted to remnant habitats. The performance of these populations depends on both species-specific traits and local and landscape level aspects of habitat quality. Understanding which specific local or landscape level conditions determine the performance of grassland species populations in remnant habitats would help design the restoration of the habitats and to detect the conditions that favour the long-term persistence of grassland species in them. Such information is especially needed in urbanised landscapes, where remnant habitats engulfed by urban land use types may experience increased erosion, higher temperatures and invasion by alien species. This study investigates the population performance determinants of Carex caryophyllea (VU), a grassland specialist, in 43 remnant grasslands in an urban-rural gradient in Finland. The population performance was assessed with metrics of persistence, establishment and reproduction, and related to environmental conditions with generalized additive models and redundancy analysis. The most important positive determinants for the performance of C. caryophyllea populations were disturbance through management or ground erosion, a warm microclimate, large habitat area and high historical connectivity to suitable grassland habitats. Present connectivity to other C. caryophyllea populations had a weak and near-significant positive relationship with population performance. Urbanisation of the surrounding landscape correlated with population performance as well, possibly due to the high historical cover of grasslands in presently urbanised landscapes. The results imply that the most effective restoration method of remnant C. caryophyllea populations would be reinstating disturbance regimes in overgrown habitats with warm microclimates close to suitable habitats and other existing populations, whether urban or rural. This would counteract the species future decline due to possible extinction debts and help the species persist in the study area in the long term.

AB  - Urbanization has been linked to amphibian population declines globally. Habitat fragmentation can negatively impact gene flow among populations but what role artificially constructed wetlands have in maintaining gene flow in urban amphibian populations remains uncertain. We assessed gene flow in a population of wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) inhabiting both constructed and natural wetlands located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. We genotyped 10 microsatellite loci in 182 frogs from eight wetlands and tested for genetic differentiation between wetlands. We tested if bottlenecks had occurred at constructed wetlands and if there were differences in allelic richness between natural wetlands and constructed wetlands. We found no evidence of bottlenecks, no differences in allelic richness among subpopulations, and no genetic structure within the population. Although significant differences in pair-wise comparisons of allele frequency distributions between wetlands were detected, all F-ST values were low (0.003-0.053) and Bayesian clustering indicated the presence of a single genetic cluster. Despite extensive urbanization within our study area, genetic homogeneity has been preserved indicating that it may be possible to use constructed wetlands to maintain amphibian populations and preserve gene flow among subpopulations living within urbanized landscapes.

AB  - Coordinated efforts by ecologists and natural resource managers are necessary to balance the conservation of biological diversity with the potential for sustained economic development. Because some amphibians have suffered world-wide declines during the last 20 years, it is important to consider biologically based management strategies that will preserve local and regional populations. This paper provides a brief overview of potential threats to local and regional populations, the state of knowledge on population and landscape processes, and the critical elements needed for an effective management plan for amphibians. Local population dynamics and ecological connectivity of amphibian metapopulations must be considered in effective management plans. There are 3 critical factors to consider in a management plan (1) the number or density of individuals dispersing from individual wetlands, (2) the diversity of wetlands with regard to hydroperiod, and (3) the probability of dispersal among adjacent wetlands or the rescue and recolonization of local populations. Wetland losses reduce the total number of sites where pond-breeding amphibians can reproduce and recruit juveniles into the breeding population. Loss of small, temporary wetlands (<4.0 ha) may be especially harmful to amphibians because of their abundance and high species diversity. Alteration of wetlands, particularly hydrologic cycles, can severely impair completion of larval metamorphosis through either early pond drying (if hydroperiod is shortened) or through increased predation (if hydroperiod is lengthened or connections made with. fish-infested lakes, rivers, or canals). Wetland loss also increases the distance between neighboring wetlands that is critical to metapopulation source-sink processes. Reduction in wetland density reduces the probablity that populations will be rescued from extinction by nearby source populations. Local populations cannot be considered independent of source-sink processes that connect wetlands at the landscape or regional level. Further, the fragmentation of natural habitats From timber harvesting, agriculture, roads, drainage canals, or urban development impedes or prevents dispersal and decreases the probability of wetland recolonization. If our goal is to maintain or enhance present levels of amphibian diversity, then resource managers must incorporate critical elements into plans that protect population and landscape processes thereby maintaining viable populations and communities of amphibians.

AB  - Urbanisation is a prominent and increasing form of land-use change, with the potential to disrupt the interactions between pollinators such as bees and the flowering plants that they visit. This in turn may cause cascading local extinctions and have consequences for pollination services. Network approaches go beyond simple metrics of abundance and species richness, enabling understanding of how the structure of plant-pollinator communities are affected by urbanisation. Here we compared pollination networks between native vegetation (bushland) remnants and residential gardens in the urbanised region of the southwest Australian biodiversity hotspot. Across fourteen sites, seven per habitat, plant-bee visitor networks were created from surveys conducted monthly during the spring-summer period over two years. Extinction slope (a measure of how extinctions cascade through the network), and network robustness and nestedness were higher for bushland remnants, suggesting that networks in bushland remnants had greater functional integrity, but if disrupted, more cascading extinctions could occur. In contrast, niche overlap between pollinators was higher in residential gardens, suggesting greater competition for resources. Most species-level properties did not differ between habitats, except for normalised degree, which was higher in bushland remnants. In conclusion, it appears that pollination networks in managed residential gardens are not structurally equivalent with those in bushland remnants. This has implications for conservation of wild bee assemblages in this biodiversity hotspot, and suggests removal of remnant native vegetation for residential development could disrupt the integrity of plant-pollinator assemblages.

AB  - Deficient dispersal ability due to habitat fragmentation adversely impact demographic connectivity and gene flow among population in a metapopulation, and therefore potentially leads to local extinction. A rich body of theoretical work provides distinct predictions regarding the distribution of dispersal abilities in relation to fragmentation gradient. Yet, empirical data remains elusive in general, and it is lacking for anthropogeni-cinduced landscapes in particular. We collected 9884 seeds of a wind-dispersed annual species Geropogon hybridus (Asteraceae) from 807 individual plants of 55 populations spanning three landscapes in a fragmented agroecosystem and measured four major dispersal-related traits at the landscape, population, plant and seed levels. Contrary to previous studies that were based on island or urban landscapes and where fragmentation was associated with reduced dispersal, we revealed increased seed dispersal ability in the more fragmented patches. However, the specific relationships between dispersal-related traits and fragmentation characteristics varied with ecological scale. The discrepancy between our results and those from previous studies may be explained by the milder contrast between the fragmented patches and the surrounding matrix in our system, which is a common feature in many agroecosystems. The findings add to the accumulating evidence that different selection pressures and constraints act on seed dispersal evolution under the global land use change.

AB  - The cognizing of connectivity among small mammal populations across heterogeneous landscapes is complicated due to complex influences of landscape and anthropogenic factors on gene flow. A landscape genetics approach offers inferences on how landscape features drive population structure. Through a landscape genetics approach, we investigated influences of geographical, environmental, and anthropogenic features on populations of Apodemus agrarius, the striped field mouse, the prime vector of hemorrhagic fever by a landscape genetic approach. We identified landscape features that might affect the population structure of striped field mice by analyzing microsatellite markers of 197 striped field mice from 21 populations throughout South Korea. We developed Maximum-likelihood population effects models based on landscape distances and resistance matrices and pairwise F-ST values for meta-populations of striped field mouse. We also conducted Mantel and partial Mantel tests to investigate geographic patterns of genetic similarities. In Mantel and partial Mantel tests, the F-ST was significantly correlated with all three models of movement; movement cost, Euclidian distance and least-cost distance, although the magnitudes of correlations varied. The 4 top-ranked models included three variables; temperature, precipitation and one human disturbance factor (population). We did not attain a significant effect for anthropogenic factors on genetic similarities among populations in the Korean striped field mouse, but we confirmed a significant association for genetic similarity with climatic features (temperature and precipitation).

AB  - Introduction: Migration of people from rural environments to cities has accelerated urbanization and modified the landscape as well as the ecological processes and communities in these areas. The Costa Rican endemic Cabanis's Ground-Sparrow (Melozone cabanisi) is a species of limited distribution restricted to the "Gran Area Metropolitana", which is the biggest urban settlement of the country. This area has experimented and still experiment an ongoing fragmentation and loss of habitat used by this species (coffee plantations, shrubs, and thickets). Objective: To determine the effects of urbanization on habitat abundance and spatial pattern for the occurrence of Melozone cabanisi. Methods: We modeled the area of potentially suitable habitat for this species in Costa Rica using occurrence and bioclimatic data. Then, we estimated the actual suitable habitat using land cover type layers. Finally, we analyzed the connectivity among the actual suitable habitat patches using single-patch and multi-patch approaches. Results: From the area of potentially suitable habitat estimated by the bioclimatic model, 74 % were urban areas that are unsuitable for Melozone cabanisi. The largest suitable patches within urban areas were coffee plantations; which also were crucial for maintaining connectivity between habitat patches along the species' range. Conclusions: To preserve and protect the Melozone cabanisi, these areas must be taken into consideration by decision-makers in the present and future management plans. We recommend avoiding change shrubs and thickets to urban cover to preserve the occurrence of Melozone cabanisi, and implement a program for the payment of environmental services to landholders, supported by the local governments, to protect those habitats in urban contexts.

AB  - Land-use changes often facilitate alien species invasion, impacting on biodiversity and ecosystem processes at the regional scale. Transport infrastructure is a potential corridor for biological invasion, but processes underlying invasion of alien species from human settlements along transport networks are uncertain. We surveyed alien and native plant species and their functional traits in roadside vegetation in Shiretoko National Park, Japan. The site is unique because there is a single invasion source (i.e., town). Vegetation, environmental and spatial factors were measured in 362 quadrats on two transects established along roads. Mean species richness within each quadrat (taxonomic alpha-diversity) was higher for alien assemblages, whereas mean functional richness (functional alpha-diversity) was higher for native assemblages. Alien species shared similar traits as generalists, which show lower functional diversity than specialists. Functional alpha-diversity of alien assemblages decreased with increasing distance from the source town, and the nestedness-resultant component of functional beta-diversity of alien assemblages accounted for a relatively high proportion of their total functional beta-diversity. Alien species with high dispersal ability were widely distributed, whereas other alien species were still limited to areas adjacent to the human settlement. Alien species showed a greater probability of having seed floss, lower percentage of perennial species, and lower seed dry mass than native species. Thus, alien species showed superior dispersal and competitive abilities compared with native species, and exclusion of all alien species is likely impractical. Consideration of functional traits may aid selection of alien species of particular concern for implementation of control and extermination measures.

AB  - Green roofs, which have become mandatory on new flat-topped buildings in many cities, increase habitat connectivity for wildlife and have contributed to a boom in urban beekeeping. The ecological benefits or risks of green roofs for wild bees (bee species other than the domesticated honey bee, Apis mellifera), however, have not been comprehensively analyzed. We therefore reviewed studies on insects caught on green roofs in Asia, Europe, or North America between 1992 and early 2017 and extracted information on wild bees. The resulting species list includes 236 Apidae identified in 35 studies, with thermophilic species probably overrepresented because roofs provide warm and dry habitats. The percentage of cavity-nesting bees on roofs is higher than that on nearby ground, while the percentage of pollen specialists is lower. Data are almost completely lacking on the reproductive success of bees on green roofs, the effect of roof age on bee diversity, and the genetic or demographic benefits of increased habitat connectivity. Our list of the bee species so far reported on green roofs will help in the selection and implementation of suitable soils, nesting aids, and plantings.

AB  - Landscape connectivity improves species' capacity to adapt to climate change. These models are increasingly needed and available for climate-change conservation planning. However, their relative strengths and weaknesses are unclear. We asked how well do the spatial outputs from four connectivity models intended to support climate change conservation agree? To understand the implications of selecting one or several approaches, we compared various combinations of four connectivity models for ecoregions in California, U.S.A. Two models are based on landscape structure, Land Facet Corridors and Omniscape, while two other models, Meta-Corridor Approach and Network Flow Analysis (NFA), use focal species' range dynamics to determine connectivity. We also describe how each approach integrates climate-adaptive connectivity concepts. Variation in modeling methods, objectives, inputs, and landscape representations strongly affects the modeled connectivity patterns. For the region where all four models were run, almost three quarters of the landscape was selected by one or more models, but three or more agree for only 9.5% of the area, all of which is riparian. This emphasizes the importance of riparian areas for climate adaptation. We found NFA prioritized connections close to protected areas, while Meta-Corridor avoided higher cost agricultural and developed areas. The structural models agreed in areas with low human impact but Omniscape avoided areas of low topographic diversity and Land Facet Corridors avoided connections in areas with no protected areas. Connectivity models should be selected based on the conservation objectives, such as spatial scale to be implemented, and a combination of models may be best.

AB  - Nairobi National Park (NNP) is unable to incorporate the spatial and temporal dynamics of many migratory mammals that rely on the area as a dry season refuge because of its small size. During the wet season, wildlife must be able to migrate to the south into the Kitengela dispersal area. This area is privately owned and rapidly undergoing land-use change, which affects the structure and function of the dispersal corridors, jeopardising the ecological sustainability of the park. Private landholders in Kitengela incur most of the costs of keeping the dispersal areas open, but do not receive any compensation or revenue from benefits derived from tourism in the park. Here we present an analysis of the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for Nairobi and Kitengela residents for a new land management scheme in the dispersal area, in which local pastoralists leave their land open to wildlife and, by not engaging in fencing, land subdivision or poaching activities, receive monetary compensation for the incremental costs derived from use of their properties as a wildlife dispersal area. The results suggest that the aggregated financial support of urban residents might represent around $1.2 million per year for 5 years. This amount exceeds the economic losses caused by wildlife in the dispersal area, and different financial schemes of fund investment and the prioritisation of conservation regions could be implemented to ensure payments and keep the dispersal corridors open in perpetuity.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation can have severe negative and irreversible effects on biodiversity. We investigated the effects of forest fragmentation on frog diversity in Singapore because of its high rates of deforestation and the demonstration that frogs are some of the most sensitive species to habitat degradation. We surveyed frog species in 12 forest fragments varying from 11 to 935 ha. We compared differences in species richness, abundance, and Shannon's index in relation to forest fragment size, connectivity (distance between fragments), and breeding habitat heterogeneity. A total of 20 species from 12 genera and five families were encountered in 12 fragments. Larger fragments and those closer to larger fragments had higher species richness. Abundance, however, was not correlated with forest area or connectivity, but we found fewer individual frogs in the larger fragments. We also found that breeding habitat heterogeneity best explained frog species diversity and abundance in forest fragments. Fragments with a high diversity of breeding habitats had more species. We found no evidence to suggest that abundance and diversity are strongly correlated, particularly in disturbed areas, but that breeding habitat heterogeneity is an under-appreciated factor that should be considered when prioritizing areas for anuran conservation. Enriching breeding habitat heterogeneity, creating corridors between fragments, and reforesting degraded areas are some of the most beneficial strategies for preserving urban frog biodiversity.

AB  - Invasive mammalian carnivores contribute disproportionately to declines in global biodiversity. In California, nonnative red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) have significantly impacted endangered ground-nesting birds and native canids. These foxes derive primarily from captive-reared animals associated with the fur-farming industry. Over the past five decades, the cumulative area occupied by nonnative red fox increased to cover much of central and southern California. We used a landscape-genetic approach involving mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and 13 microsatellites of 402 nonnative red foxes removed in predator control programs to investigate source populations, contemporary connectivity, and metapopulation dynamics. Both markers indicated high population structuring consistent with origins from multiple introductions and low subsequent gene flow. Landscape-genetic modeling indicated that population connectivity was especially low among coastal sampling sites surrounded by mountainous wildlands but somewhat higher through topographically flat, urban and agricultural landscapes. The genetic composition of populations tended to be stable for multiple generations, indicating a degree of demographic resilience to predator removal programs. However, in two sites where intensive predator control reduced fox abundance, we observed increases in immigration, suggesting potential for recolonization to counter eradication attempts. These findings, along with continued genetic monitoring, can help guide localized management of foxes by identifying points of introductions and routes of spread and evaluating the relative importance of reproduction and immigration in maintaining populations. More generally, the study illustrates the utility of a landscape-genetic approach for understanding invasion dynamics and metapopulation structure of one of the world's most destructive invasive mammals, the red fox.

AB  - A vegetation survey of road verges along an urban to rural gradient in the Potchefstroom Municipal Area was conducted. Important applications of these studies include understanding of the role of indigenous (native) and exotic species in the overall synanthropisation of vegetation. The present study forms part of a research programme on spontaneous vegetation in urban open spaces in the North-West Province of South Africa. A numerical classification technique (TWINSPAN) was used as a first approximation and the classification was refined using Braun-Blanquet procedures, The result is a phytosociological table from which 13 plant communities and seven sub-communities were recognised. Although some of these communities and subcommunities are similar to previously described vegetation types in natural and disturbed areas, most of them were not described before in South Africa. Two ordination scatter diagrams show the distribution of the plant communities along gradients which were related to the depth of the soil water table, habitat type, trampling, soil compaction and percentage of gravel in the soil surface. Similarities between roadside vegetation in this study and those overseas are discussed, as well as the possible role of road verges as dispersal corridors between natural and disturbed areas.

AB  - 1. Aquatic macrophyte diversity and water quality of 55 ponds in western Japan were related to land use and morphometric variables to identify the environmental factors that sustain biodiversity and the spatial extent at which these factors operate.
   2. The relevant spatial extent for floating-leaved macrophyte richness (500 m from pond edge) was larger than that for submerged macrophyte occurrence (10, 75 and 100 m), whereas emergent macrophyte richness was best explained at much larger extents (1000 m). Total macrophyte richness was explained at the extent of 500, 750 and 1000 m. The extents relevant for explaining the physicochemical condition of pond water (100 and 250 m) were similar to those for submerged and floating-leaved macrophytes, suggesting that these two growth forms are more sensitive to water quality compared to emergent macrophytes.
   3. Diversity of all three growth forms and that of total macrophytes collectively were inversely related to turbidity and nutrient concentration; among the three growth forms, submerged macrophytes were most affected by water quality.
   4. Negative relationships were found between the proportion of urban area and the diversity of the three growth forms and that of total macrophytes and water quality. Species richness of emergent, floating-leaved and total macrophytes decreased with depth and increased with surface area up to about 5000 m(2), above which it declined.
   5. Urbanisation and enlargement of ponds were the two main factors that decreased aquatic macrophyte diversity in irrigation ponds. To alleviate the adverse effects of urban areas on aquatic macrophyte diversity, our results suggest that management efforts should focus on the creation of buffer zones within the relevant spatial extent from the pond edge.

AB  - Dispersal is a central process in ecology and evolution. It strongly influences the dynamics of spatially structured populations and affects evolutionary processes by shaping patterns of gene flow. For these reasons, dispersal has received considerable attention from ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and conservationists. Although it has been studied extensively in taxa such as birds and mammals, much less is known about dispersal in vertebrates with complex life cycles such as pond-breeding amphibians. Over the past two decades, researchers have taken an ever-increasing interest in amphibian dispersal and initiated both basic and applied studies, using a broad range of experimental and observational approaches. This body of research reveals complex dispersal patterns, causations, and syndromes, with dramatic consequences for the demography and genetics of amphibian populations. In this review, our goals are to: redefine and clarify the concept of amphibian dispersal; review current knowledge about the effects of individual (i.e., condition-dependent dispersal) and environmental (i.e., context-dependent dispersal) factors during the three stages of dispersal (i.e., emigration, transience, and immigration); identify the demographic and genetic consequences of dispersal in spatially structured amphibian populations; and propose new research avenues to extend our understanding of amphibian dispersal.

AB  - Habitat loss and isolation associated with land conversion for human activities pose perhaps the most severe threat to the earth's biological diversity. Because the study of habitat fragmentation provides an important link between the concepts of landscape ecology and the practice of landscape architecture and planning, my dissertation research focused on the ecological consequences of changes in the spatial characteristics of native habitats. I completed two major field experiments with insects in a native grassland near Boulder, Colorado, USA, that directly tested ecological hypotheses regarding the influences of habitat spatial characteristics and patterns of land conversion on species loss, recolonization, and movement patterns. The first experiment focused on fragment size and connectivity, while the second experiment mimicked four sequences of land conversion that varied in size, connectivity and spatial arrangement of their remnant habitat patches. Both experiments yielded significant results that contribute to the ecological knowledge-base utilized in landscape architecture and planning projects. Specifically, the major findings of my field research were (1) fragment size influenced species loss; small fragments lost species at a higher rate than did larger fragments; (2) corridors reduced rates of species loss, but only in medium-sized fragments; (3) corridors enhanced recolonization of medium-sized fragments, (4) one of the three insect species examined moved preferentially in corridors; and (5) spatial configuration of land conversion sequences significantly influenced species richness.

AB  - Spectacled bears (SB) (Tremarctos ornatus) are the only bear species native to South America. This particular bear is the single species of its genus, and it is listed as vulnerable according to the IUCN red list. A critical SB conservation habitat is in the rural territories of the Peruvian Amazon, where anthropogenic land-use changes and landscape fragmentation threaten SB habitats. The following questions arise in this context: How much has land-use changed? How to design the establishment of ecological corridors (ECs) to support the conservation of SB?. We investigated the temporal land use and land cover changes for last 30 years (1990-2020) for a better projection of the ECs and to quantify the temporal landscape metrics. Furthermore, we integrated cloud computing, machine learning models with cost-effective techniques to delineate the ECs for SB within the rural territories. Ensemble Random Forest model associated with Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used to develop four land use and land cover (LULC) maps (for the years 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020). The least cost path (LCP) model based on Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm was assembled based on six variables (altitude; slope; distance to roads; distance to population centers; land use map; inventory map of SB). Then, we calculated the ECs based on the multidirectional origin-destination points, we found that forest patches increased by 57%& nbsp;between 1990 and 2020. Results showed statistically significant agreement (R-2 = 0.47; p < 0.05) between cost/ha* and percentage of forest cover. We observed that the higher the forest cover, the better the connectivity and the lower the cost of mobilization in the ECs. Our study outcomes validated through the images obtained from trap cameras that confirms that delineated routs for SB movements. The proposed model can be adopted for other parts of the global forest including other species of interest. To formulate a sustainable conservation action plan, we provided five recommendations that will support conservation practices, design cost-effective ECs for policy makers.

AB  - In most urban and agricultural landscapes, remnants of native vegetation are surrounded by an inhospitable matrix. Although vagile species come and go, many reptiles, amphibians and small mammals are effectively stranded and declining towards local extinction. In the same landscapes, other areas where these species are absent are improving in habitat quality, both through natural regeneration and active restoration efforts. So, for many species in many domesticated landscapes, there are too many individuals in some patches of decreasing quality and no individuals in patches of increasing quality. One solution to this situation is to move animals from those areas where there are plenty to suitable areas where there are none. These targeted translocations apply lessons learned from revegetation to dispersal-limited animals to in-fill distributional ranges, increase population size and improve both demographic and genetic connectivity, pushing nonequilibrial metapopulations away from extinction via an imposed mass effect. In contrast to conventional reintroduction schemes expensive, reactive interventions involving highly-trained specialists and captive-raised endangered species these inexpensive, proactive, community-driven initiatives aim to avert future declines by keeping common species common. Having introduced the wildlife restoration vision, we use two scenarios to illustrate the benefits of the approach to species, ecosystem function, ecological understanding, restoration practise and public engagement. As well as adhering to best-practise reintroduction techniques to ensure animal welfare is not compromised and avoid detrimental effects to source populations or release sites, we emphasize community participation, data quality and long-term accessibility as paramount to maximize learning opportunities.

AB  - Variation in species richness and density of native birds in urban parks and greenspaces ("parks") is often substantial. Understanding why differences exist, and whether all migratory guilds are equally affected, is poorly known. We surveyed breeding bird communities in 48 undeveloped forested parks in Portland, Oregon, USA, to determine the contributions of park area, shape, connectivity, landscape composition surrounding parks, and differences in structure/composition of local habitat to variation in richness and density of residents, long-distance migrants, and short-distance/partial migrants. Migratory guilds responded differently to environmental factors. Richness and density of long-distance migrants increased with park area and abundance of small (< 10 cm DBH), mostly native, tree species. Resident richness also increased with the abundance of small trees. However, resident and short-distance/partial migrant richness was independent of park area, and resident density declined with increasing area. Park shape, connectivity, and landscape composition did not influence richness or density of any migratory guilds, possibly because of relatively high tree cover in Portland's landscape. Separate analyses of forest-dependent species of all migratory guilds revealed that area was the primary contributor to variation in density of residents and long-distance migrants, structural habitat features contributed to variation in density of residents but not long-distance migrants, and that density of long-distance migrants declined with elongated park shape. Few forest-dependent species existed in parks below 10 ha, and their minimum area requirements for maintaining populations were estimated to be 30 to 40 ha. Without such parks most long-distance migrants would likely disappear from Portland's landscape.

AB  - Plant species and their pollinators are linked by their mutualistic interactions, which form the basis of pollination networks. The use of a network approach allows one to take into account all interactions between a group of plants and its animal pollinators, and to reveal the structure of these connections. We analysed pollination interactions for urban habitat fragments located within the Warsaw city environment. We compared two similar, ruderal communities (phytosociological order Onopordetalia acanthii) located in distant parts of the city of Warsaw (Poland) that differed with the surrounding ecosystems. The aim of this study was to define the structures and properties of flower-visitor (visitation) and pollen transport networks (based on analysis of pollen loads carried by insects) and to assess the differences between the studied sites. Although the sites differed in insect relative abundance (Diptera dominated one study site, whereas Hymenoptera dominated the other), network size and structure were similar for both communities. In both cases, networks contained moderately specialized species (based on H (2)' index); however, networks were dominated by apparently ecologically generalized insect taxa as well as those represented by a single specimen. Networks based on pollen transport indicated greater generality of insect species (more links) than those based on our samples of visitation. The most highly linked plant species represented were either the most abundant (Fabaceae) or phenotypically generalized taxa (Daucus carota). We conclude that plant-pollinator interactions in such highly disturbed and isolated habitats are composed mostly of ecologically generalised species. Moreover, we stress the usefulness of pollen load analysis in the development and verification of visitation data.

AB  - Hong Kong's urban environment has an extremely high development density pervasively filled by buildings and roads. Little ground-level space is left for amenity planting within and without town lots, resulting in a cramped city matrix with inadequate green cover. The community desires for more and better trees for cityscape enhancement and environmental amelioration. A city-wide roadside-tree census was conducted recently together with a survey of potential planting sites (PPS) with a view to augmenting tree biomass and diversity in the long run. Sites with a suitable plantable corridor were evaluated in detail in the field to glean data on growing-space geometry (configuration and dimensions) and qualitative attributes (adjacent land use, building setback, unpaved soil, and air quality). Some 1094 PPS with a total capacity for 12 063 trees had been studied. Most PPS are spatially scattered and small, each with <14 trees capacity. A suite of III species had been selected for suitable dimensional and amenity attributes to fit the harsh and tight roadside sites, and to avoid the currently rampant discordance between trees and habitats. Environmental conditions within and in the vicinity of individual PPS, with an emphasis on plantable-space geometry, were matched with species characters. A strategy was adopted to maximize final biomass, floristic variety and ornamental functions especially attractive flowers and seasonal changes. A 5 year master planting plan was designed with site-specific species recommendations and a schedule giving priority to tree-deficient and readily-available localities. The landscape in 398 more streets will be improved with congruous trees. A similar green-planning strategy could be applied to other cities with a congested urban morphology.

AB  - Mounting evidence suggests declines in the abundance and diversity of wild bees. Increasing habitat that provides forage and nesting sites could boost struggling populations, particularly in urban, suburban and agricultural landscapes. The millions of acres beneath aerial electric transmission lines, sometimes referred to as easements or rights-of-way, must be kept free of tall-growing vegetation and hence have the potential to provide suitable habitat for many native species. Prior work has demonstrated that bee communities in easements managed using alternatives to episodic mowing were more diverse than in nearby open areas, however true control sites within the easements were unavailable. In order to compare vegetation management protocols, we conducted a two-year study which enabled us to directly compare transmission line easements in three locations currently undergoing Integrated Vegetation Management-a dynamic form of management involving spot removal and herbicide treatment of unwanted species (treatment) with nearby sites undergoing standard management protocols of yearly or biyearly mowing (control). Results show that treatment sites had significantly higher abundance and species richness than controls. Seasonal differences were pronounced, with the spring fauna most affected by differences in vegetation management. In addition, the older treatment sites house more social bees, more parasitic species and a more even distribution of bees across nesting guilds. Finally, we established that treatment sites had distinct bee communities, further increasing their value as sources for native bee populations in the landscape. Overall, the data clearly show the value of implementing alternative active vegetation management in the land under powerlines to achieve an increase in the abundance and diversity of wild bees.

AB  - Globally, connectivity conservation projects exist across all inhabited continents. Typically created through Geographical Information Systems and modelling processes at regional and even continental scales, these projects are seldom evaluated or 'ground-truthed' for their potential application at the local level where land use is fully allocated and replete with human occupation. This article reviews the accuracy of one such continental-scale connectivity conservation network, the National Green Network, through assessment and redesign by a design charrette at the local scale in York, Western Australia. Breaking with traditional process, this research considered the National Green Network model not as a final plan, but as point of departure for an iterative adjustment and redesign process through the charrette and an additional detailed design stage. Commonplace in architecture and urban planning disciplines, the application of charrettes to connectivity conservation design offers the benefits of improving design accuracy and enhancing their potential for implementation through providing valuable feedback and iterative design adjustment. The fine-tuning conducted by this research enabled the design to factor in human land-uses and influences across complex landscapes, while considering in a critical manner cultural factors that could also influence the system's design and its success. The framing of the network as green infrastructure rather than as connectivity conservation in addition to further illustration by the landscape architect provided a spectrum of both ecological and cultural outcomes across the case study landscape, demonstrating potential impacts and opportunities offered through a series of spatially accurate and ground-truthed plans.

AB  - Using 5 years of patch occupancy data for 384 habitat fragments, we evaluated population and habitat dynamics of the black-tailed prairie dog in urban habitat remnants in the rapidly developing landscape of Denver, CO, USA. Specifically, we evaluated the landscape factors, including fragment area, age, and connectivity, that characterize the habitat fragments most likely to be colonized by prairie dogs, as well as those experiencing local extinctions. In addition, we determined which patch types were most often removed by land development. Sites in proximity to colonies were more likely to be colonized by prairie dogs. Local extinctions were most common on isolated colonies, and older and more isolated colonies were more likely to be extirpated by human activity. In general, smaller and older habitat patches were at the highest risk of being lost to land development. Our results provide observations of dynamic changes to the distribution of a potential keystone species in an urban area, which can be used to inform island biogeographic and metapopulation models for wildlife persistence in developing landscapes. Although populations are currently in decline, most local extinctions are the direct result of human activity, and we suggest that prairie dogs in this area can persist with appropriate management.

AB  - The oviposition level between ovitraps placed in human dwellings and on public paved areas for the monitoring of Aedes aegypti was compared, and proposes the best ovitrap installation sites on public paved areas in a neighborhood of Buenos Aires City, Argentina. A total of 60 randomly distributed ovitraps were placed in human dwellings (n=38) and public paved areas (n=22), and examined weekly over a ten-week period. The Ovitrap Positivity Index (OPI) and the Egg Density Index (EDI) were used as indicators of oviposition level. The indexes were calculated on a weekly basis. Environmental variables evaluated for public paved areas were type of corridor, tree height and dwelling height. OPI and EDI values were higher for dwellings than for public paved areas. There was a positive correlation between the infestation indices in dwellings and in public paved areas. In the latter there was a positive association between low OPT and EDI values and tall trees, avenue as type corridor, and dwellings with two stories or more, whereas there was a positive association between high values of these indices and short and medium trees, and a negative association with tall trees, avenue, and dwellings with two stories or more. Our results suggest that the sensitivity of ovitraps in monitoring of A. aegypti in public paved areas is lower than in dwellings, and this sensitivity would increase if considering some environmental variables

AB  - The overall aim in the development of the Local Ecological Footprinting Tool (LEFT) was to design a web-based tool that could provide quickly obtained quantitative data on ecological risk to assist landowners when making land-use change decisions. The Local Ecological Footprinting Tool works for almost any region in the world and uses freely available satellite imagery, biotic and abiotic data from existing global databases, models and algorithms to deliver a customised report for a selected area within one hour of job submission. Biotic data automatically obtained for a selected landscape includes terrestrial vertebrate and plant species occurrence data, information on their conservation status and remotely sensed vegetation productivity. Abiotic information obtained includes temperature, precipitation, water availability, insolation, topography, elevation, distribution of urban infrastructure and location of wetlands. The tool performs a number of analyses on the biotic and abiotic data to produce maps for the selected area at a 30m resolution depicting land cover type, numbers of globally threatened terrestrial vertebrate and plant species, beta-diversity of terrestrial vertebrates and plants, habitat intactness, wetland habitat connectivity, numbers of migratory species and vegetation resilience. Results are also aggregated to produce a summary map demonstrating areas of high and low ecological risk across the selected area. The Local Ecological Footprinting Tool has been designed to be intuitive to use, requiring no specialised software or user expertise. Input is extremely easy and requires the user to highlight the area of interest on a map or using grid co-ordinates. Output is delivered via the web application and comprises a customised PDF containing the maps and a zip file of geographical information system (GIS) data for the area requested. Users may run an unlimited number of LEFT analyses and download reports free of charge. In addition to the free tool described in this paper, there is also a paid service: individual LEFT analyses can be upgraded for a charge to allow access to the geographically subsetted datasets generated for each report. These data are supplied as a zip file containing raster datasets for the layers in the LEFT analysis in GeoTIFF format. These can be opened and queried in a GIS software package.

AB  - 1. In a region of south-eastern England, we investigated the hierarchical genetic structure of populations of two stream-dwelling caddisflies (Trichoptera: Polycentropodidae) with contrasting distributions: Plectrocnemia conspersa inhabits numerous small, patchily distributed seeps and streams, while the confamilial Polycentropus flavomaculatus is found in fewer but larger streams and rivers. We also contrasted the genetic structure of P. conspersa in the lowland south-east with that in an upland region in the north west.
   2. Microsatellite genotypes were obtained from samples of both species taken from a 'core area' and at sites 15, 40 and 100 km from this core (two regions for P. conspersa, totalling 45 sites and 1405 larvae; one region for P. flavomaculatus, totalling 10 sites and 269 larvae).
   3. The genetic structure of P. conspersa differed in the two regions. In the upland north-west, significant genetic differentiation was observed at a spatial scale of around 40 km from the core, while there was no structure in the lowland south-east up to around 100 km. Areas of high altitude did not appear directly to reduce gene flow, whereas other potential landscape barriers, including particular geological formations, large urban areas and the sea had a pronounced effect.
   4. Weak genetic differentiation in P. conspersa across large distances, particularly in the lowland south-east, suggests that it disperses strongly, facilitating gene flow within and between catchments. Conversely, for P. flavomaculatus we found strong genetic differentiation between almost all sites, suggesting that dispersal is much more limited.
   5. Greater dispersal in the patchily distributed P. conspersa than in P. flavomaculatus, which occupies larger and presumably more persistent habitats, could be a general feature of other similarly distributed aquatic insects. While higher relief is potentially a partial barrier to dispersal, P. conspersamust have effective gene flow through such apparently inhospitable terrain, perhaps attributable to dispersal between neighbouring small and ephemeral populations. Indeed, its exploitation of headwaters and seeps requires the ability to disperse between such sites. Apparently it cannot, however, overcome more continuous barriers, consisting of large tracts of landscape with few habitable larval sites. Such landscapes, including those created by humans, may have a stronger effect on population connectivity and colonization in the longer term.

AB  - Context Hydrological and land use changes for human purposes, have resulted in the increased fragmentation of river landscapes and the loss of aquatic habitats, leading to profound changes in fish diversity and productivity. Objectives In the fluvial Lake Saint-Pierre (St. Lawrence River, Canada), we studied how agricultural practices and water-flow regulation have impacted the area and connectivity of spawning habitats of northern pike (Esox lucius). Methods Northern pike spawning and nursery habitats were modelled over a 49-year period (1965-2013) to estimate effective spawning area under four contrasting hydrological conditions. Results Simulations coupled with land cover analyses revealed that natural flow conditions historically favourable for fish reproduction (high and stable water flows) have been lost due to human activities. The highest potential for reproduction and habitat connectivity have been lost due to (1) intensive agriculture and ploughing of natural vegetation in the upper floodplain that overlaps suitable spawning areas for northern pike, and (2) flow regulation that has lowered and shortened spring floods and dried spawning grounds more frequently. Conclusions To restore the St. Lawrence River functions, we propose to reconvert the portion of the floodplains that is vital to fish, but is currently used by intensive agriculture, into natural wetlands or perennial crops and to restore a more natural flow regime by extending the duration of floods between spawning and nursery periods. The highest priority for habitat restoration should target the most effective and recurrent spawning habitats, ditch and stream networks, and connected managed wetlands.

TI  - Saproxylic Beetle Biodiversity in Golf Course Habitats
T2  - CROP FORAGE & TURFGRASS MANAGEMENT
LA  - English
AB  - Saproxylic beetles are a diverse group of insects that use deadwood as food or habitat at some stage of their life. While a few species of saproxylic beetles are considered to be pests, the majority of species perform important ecological roles such as decomposition, nutrient recycling, pollination in the mobile adult form, or act as food sources for other organisms. Their diversity and variable responses make them good biological indicators. Promoting biodiversity in managed areas, such as golf courses, may be relatively easy by creating saproxylic habitat. We examined the influence on saproxylic beetle communities of habitat type, log type, and distance from a fairway. Sentinel logs were provided for colonization for one season, and emergence was monitored over the following 2 years. We found that beetle species richness increased with log volume but did not change with distance from the fairway playing surface. Our findings suggest that although species richness may be low compared with that in less fragmented habitats, a diverse assortment of saproxylic beetles can be supported in golf course wooded habitats. This may be accomplished by leaving fallen trees in place when they do not pose a hazard or interfere with play. In particular, the provision of large woody debris that is more difficult to remove may maximize the benefit to superintendents and the saproxylic beetle community. Findings also support the idea that golf courses containing woody patches may increase habitat connectivity for these insects, and possibly other organisms, in otherwise highly fragmented urban areas.

AB  - Green roofs have recently gained recognition for their potential contribution to urban ecosystems by providing, among other services, habitat for plants and animals, and stepping stones for mobile organisms, thereby enhancing permeability among habitat patches across densely built cities. In Switzerland, investigations over the past 20 years on more than one hundred distinct green roofs across six cities have provided an unprecedented dataset on ground beetles, albeit with information that is scattered across unpublished reports and local databases. We present here for the first time a synthesis of the state of knowledge of ground beetle communities from green roofs in Switzerland. We describe 91 ground beetles species (19,428 individuals) and highlight patterns of species occurrence and composition across green roofs and cities. Most of the roofs host ground beetle communities dominated by five common mobile species with quite diversified ecological requirements. In addition, we observed nine species (10% of all species collected) that are conservation concerns in Switzerland and Central Europe as well as numerous stenotopic species (from grasslands and pioneer vegetation). This indicates that, besides sustaining local populations of common species, green roofs can also offer suitable ecological conditions of high conservation interest. We suggest both improving the design of green roofs (composition and configuration of vegetation, as well as soil depth and substrate composition) to increase their ecological value for species with the most different ecological needs, and to integrate green roofs into urban planning to make them more efficient as biodiversity supports.

AB  - Most economic valuation studies of species derive from stated preferences methods. These methods fail to take into account biodiversity values that the general public is not (made) informed about or has no experience with. Hence, production function (PF) and replacement cost (RC) approaches to valuation may be preferable in situations where species perform key life support functions in ecosystems, such as seed dispersal, pollination, or pest regulation. We conduct an RC analysis of the seed dispersal service performed by the Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius) in the Stockholm National Urban Park, Sweden. The park holds one of the largest populations of giant oaks in Europe, and the oak (Quercus robur and Quercus petrea) represents a keystone species in the hemiboreal forests. The primary objective was to estimate the number of seed-dispersed oak trees that resulted from jays and to determine the costs of replacing this service though human means. Results show that depending upon seeding or planting technique chosen, the RC per pair of jays in the park is SEK 35,000 (USD 4900) and SEK 160,000 (USD 22,500), respectively. Based on the park's aggregated oak forest-area, average RC for natural oak forest regeneration by jays is SEK 15,000 (USD 2100) to SEK 67,000 (USD 9400) per hectare, respectively. These estimates help motivating investments in management strategies that secure critical breeding and foraging habitats of jays, including coniferous forests and jay movement corridors. The analysis also illustrates the need for detailed ecological-economic knowledge in a PF or RC analysis. The continuous temporal and spatial oak dispersal service provided by jays holds several benefits compared to a man-made replacement of this service. PF and RC approaches are particularly motivated in cases of known functional ecological relationships, and critically important in estimating management measures where mobile link organisms and keystone species form key mutual relationships that generate high biodiversity benefits. In relation to obtained results, we discuss insights for conducting valuation studies on particular species. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Network theory increasingly informs wildlife conservation in disturbed landscapes, but with concern increasingly expressed about its application to real-world situations. The theory predicts that the connectivity of scale-free networks should be particularly sensitive to the disturbance of highly connected nodes (i.e. hubs). This expectation relies on complete patch removal, thus restraining its application to the last of several steps involved in habitat fragmentation, and overlooks potential reconnection of patches after disturbance (i.e. rewiring). We performed a landscape-scale experiment to evaluate the robustness of scale-free spatial networks of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) to logging activity. We built caribou networks before and after disturbance using a mechanistic model of inter-patch movements and differentiated networks disturbed in their hubs and non-hubs. We applied a reaction-advection-diffusion model to networks before and after disturbance to account for the spatio-temporal dynamics of caribou movement within the networks and anticipate their space use. We validated network and space-use predictions using empirical estimates from GPS relocations of caribou. Using the validated predictions, we compared topological network measures before and after disturbance to quantify changes in connectivity within the networks according to the type of disturbed nodes (i.e. hubs or non-hubs) and assessed space-use reorganization. We used control networks, for which no disturbance occurred in the before-after timeframe of the study, in the latter analysis to get a baseline rate of change. Disturbances due to logging activity typically resulted in fragmentation and shrinkage instead of complete patch removal. Independently to the type of disturbed nodes, caribou rewired their network using remnant patches from the fragmentation process. Consequently, topological network measures generally did not differ between before and after disturbance, such that caribou networks displayed some robustness to logging activity due to the rewiring process. Space-use reorganization was greater, however, when hubs were disturbed in comparison with non-hubs and controls. Even though caribou rewired their networks, they revisited less patches after the disturbance of hubs. A naive application of network theory (i.e. without potential rewiring and using complete patch removal), to assess spatial network robustness, may be inappropriate during most steps of the fragmentation process because of the rewiring process. Indeed, network rewiring facilitated by the presence of remnant patches can enhance spatial network robustness, in comparison with no rewiring. In addition, species-specific functional connectivity should be accounted for when anticipating the rewiring process and animal space use within disturbed networks.

AB  - Plant diversity is critical to the stability of ecosystems. However, our knowledge about the plant diversity effect on the stability of belowground communities is limited. Here, we characterized soil fungal diversity and co-occurrence network across a plant diversity gradient in a diversity manipulation experiment. We found that higher plant diversity resulted in higher fungal diversity, network complexity and stability. The positive plant di-versity effect on fungal network stability was indirect via the increase of soil carbon and fungal keystone taxa richness based on structural equation modeling analysis. The model explained 44% variations of network stability when combining soil carbon and fungal keystone taxa richness, but explained approximate 30% variations of net-work stability when considering either one of the two factors, indicating that environmental filtering and biotic interaction processes play comparable roles in mediating the plant diversity effect on soil fungal network stabil-ity. The plant diversity-induced fungal network stability was significantly correlated with community-level func-tions including community resistance and enzyme activities. This study, from the view of networks, provides new insights into the plant diversity effect on the stability of soil microbial communities, which have implications for biodiversity conservation and policy development.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Marine reserves are widely used to protect species important for conservation and fisheries and to help maintain ecological processes that sustain their populations, including recruitment and dispersal. Achieving these goals requires well-connected networks of marine reserves that maximize larval connectivity, thus allowing exchanges between populations and recolonization after local disturbances. However, global warming can disrupt connectivity by shortening potential dispersal pathways through changes in larval physiology. These changes can compromise the performance of marine reserve networks, thus requiring adjusting their design to account for ocean warming. To date, empirical approaches to marine prioritization have not considered larval connectivity as affected by global warming. Here, we develop a framework for designing marine reserve networks that integrates graph theory and changes in larval connectivity due to potential reductions in planktonic larval duration (PLD) associated with ocean warming, given current socioeconomic constraints. Using the Gulf of California as case study, we assess the benefits and costs of adjusting networks to account for connectivity, with and without ocean warming. We compare reserve networks designed to achieve representation of species and ecosystems with networks designed to also maximize connectivity under current and future ocean-warming scenarios. Our results indicate that current larval connectivity could be reduced significantly under ocean warming because of shortened PLDs. Given the potential changes in connectivity, we show that our graph-theoretical approach based on centrality (eigenvector and distance-weighted fragmentation) of habitat patches can help design better-connected marine reserve networks for the future with equivalent costs. We found that maintaining dispersal connectivity incidentally through representation-only reserve design is unlikely, particularly in regions with strong asymmetric patterns of dispersal connectivity. Our results support previous studies suggesting that, given potential reductions in PLD due to ocean warming, future marine reserve networks would require more and/or larger reserves in closer proximity to maintain larval connectivity.

AB  - Landscape changes can result in habitat fragmentation and reduced landscape connectivity, limiting the ability of animals to move across space and altering infectious disease dynamics in wildlife. In this study, we develop and implement an agent-based model to assess the impacts of animal movement behavior and landscape structure on disease dynamics. We model a susceptible/infective disease state system applicable to the transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus in bobcats in the urbanized landscape of coastal southern California. Our agent-based model incorporates animal movement behavior, pathogen prevalence, transmission probability, and habitat fragmentation to evaluate how these variables influence disease spread in urbanizing landscapes. We performed a sensitivity analysis by simulating the system under 4200 different combinations of model parameters and evaluating disease transmission outcomes. Our model reveals that host movement behavior and response to landscape features play a pivotal role in determining how habitat fragmentation influences disease dynamics. Importantly, interactions among habitat fragmentation and movement had non-linear and counter-intuitive effects on disease transmission. For example, the model predicts that an intermediate level of non-habitat permeability and directionality will result in the highest rates of between-patch disease transmission. Agent-based models serve as computational laboratories that provide a powerful approach for quantitatively and visually exploring the role of animal behavior and anthropogenic landscape change on contacts among agents and the spread of disease. Such questions are challenging to study empirically given that it is difficult or impossible to experimentally manipulate actual landscapes and the animals and pathogens that move through them. Modeling the relationship between habitat fragmentation, animal movement behavior, and disease spread will improve understanding of the spread of potentially destructive pathogens through wildlife populations, as well as domestic animals and humans.

AB  - The landscape matrix is increasingly being recognized as important to biodiversity conservation. The nature of the matrix impacts the persistence of species in human-modified landscapes through its pervasive influence on adjacent habitat and through the habitat value of the matrix itself. However, previous studies have not isolated the effects of the matrix from the effects of other aspects of landscape modification, such as habitat loss and fragmentation, and much remains to be understood about the independent impact of the matrix on wildlife. We investigated the effects of the matrix on mammal abundance and landscape use in south-east Queensland, Australia. Mammals were surveyed in patch 'core', patch 'edge' and 'matrix' landscape elements along a rural-suburban gradient of matrix development intensity quantified by a weighted road-length metric, which was significantly correlated with housing density, while controlling for potentially confounding patch and landscape attributes. Response to increasing matrix development intensity was highly species-specific. Several native species declined in abundance; however, others were more resilient to moderate levels of matrix intensity, one species increased in abundance, and at least one species appeared unaffected by matrix intensity. Native species richness peaked at moderate levels of matrix development intensity. Exotic species richness and feral predators increased with matrix intensity and were negatively correlated with native species. Species response to matrix intensity appeared related to their use of edge or matrix habitat. An ability to use the matrix per se, however, may not translate into an ability to persist in a landscape where development substantially reduces the habitat or movement value of the matrix.

AB  - Spatio-temporal forest cover changes often cause a change of forest plant species diversity. Slow colonizing ancient forest plant species (AFS) can be negatively affected, as they depend to a certain degree on the continuity of the forest cover in space and time. The implementation of conservation and restoration strategies for AFS can be supported by a map that represents the actual AFS diversity of the current forest, as well as the potential AFS diversity that open land can achieve when converted to forest. To create such a map for Flanders (northern Belgium), an empirical model was constructed using spatially explicit data on habitat suitability and continuity. The model calculated a high AFS diversity for suitable mesophilous sites covered by forest in 1775 and in the early 20th century. Sites near a concave edge of a forest patch in 2000, either inside or outside forest, were also rated high. This is the first operational landscape model on AFS diversity that can be used to select hotspots of AFS diversity in the present-day forest and sites with a high restoration potential in the open landscapes. Application of the AFS diversity map on a local scale should include additional information on linear landscape elements, soil conditions and forest management, as we assume that these factors account for a high proportion of the unexplained deviance.

AB  - Although the vulnerability assessment of forest parks is used to determine the threats they face, a rapid and holistic framework has not been established well. The primary objective of this study is to adopt a framework for rapid assessment of forest parks vulnerability, examined in Lavizan forest park in Tehran (Iran) as the case study. The vulnerability assessment has been conducted, using the evaluation matrix on the basis of landscape and ecological values and threats. In this model, the most important values and threatening factors of the Lavizan forest park have been identified and assessed, based on the intensity of their effect as well as occurrence probability. Finally, this article proposes five strategies to reduce the vulnerability. Results from this research indicate that the most important values have been air purifcation, wildlife, flora and fauna species, environment regulation, mental health, and scientific resources and the most important threats have included reduction of habitat diversity, intensive exploitation of the resources, fire, woodcutting, and reduction of ecological connectivity. Based on these vulnerabilities, the most important strategies propose the use of affordance strategy formulation framework to preserve and enhance ecological and landscape values of the park.

AB  - Urbanization and exotic species are major threats to the conservation of forest-dependent wildlife species. Some emblematic species, indicators of habitat quality for the conservation of other species, might successfully be reintroduced within cities when habitat restoration and pest management programs are combined. We studied the landscape resource selection of juvenile kaka Nestor meridionalis tracked with Global Positioning System (GPS) units and released into the predator-free reserve of Zealandia in Wellington city, New Zealand. Kaka moved beyond the predator exclusion fence into urban suburbs. The home range size and areas of high use estimated using local convex hull (a-LoCoH) ranged from 20 to 240 ha and 2 to 21 ha, respectively. Using resource selection functions and model selection we found that native forest patches and urban areas close to the reserve were selected by kaka to establish their home ranges. At a lower scale of selection (i.e., selection of habitats within home ranges), kaka selected the same habitat, but not necessarily those close to the reserve. Native forest patches throughout the city can facilitate the dispersal of individuals, while the reserve provides protection and opportunities for supplementary feeding. Urban areas might have been selected due to the placement of feeders in private backyards. Survival of forest-dwelling species in cities requires careful urban planning and management to provide the necessary habitat patches, refugia, and food sources.

AB  - To counteract the threat of habitat loss and fragmentation for wildlife in Europe, planning processes need to incorporate basic requirements of wildlife populations. In several regions in Germany, the expansion of the wildcat (Felis silvestris, Schreber 1777) population is hindered by fragmented habitat and anthropogenic barriers. We developed a corridor plan for Lower Saxony, Germany, that can be used as a protocol for guiding species restoration to reconnect fragmented habitat patches based on a statistical habitat selection model. The model was transferred directly into a cost surface and we used least-cost path models to find the best potential corridors leading from source areas towards the north and connecting existing populations. We evaluated the habitat model and corridors with a dataset of more than 800 cases of wildcat sightings and road kills within the study area. 9500 km(2) of the area of Lower Saxony were identified as suitable wildcat habitat, of which only one third is populated by wildcats at the moment. Wildcat sightings and casualties were significantly more often near potential corridors identified by the least-cost path model than elsewhere. With the wildcat corridor network proposed here, areas can be defined which should have a high priority to be kept in a natural state as an aim of land use plans, which should be improved where necessary and where mitigation measures should be concentrated. We give practical advice on how to optimise and implement corridors for the purpose of land use planning. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Context. In Australia, various species of macropods (family Macropodidae) are known to occur within peri-urban areas, where they can be a source of human-wildlife conflict. Some species, such as the eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), have received considerable research attention over the past few years following demands from land managers for evidence-based management guidelines; however, the ecology of other macropod species found in peri-urban areas, such as the eastern wallaroo (Osphranter robustus robustus), remains poorly understood.
   Aims. The aims were to determine the home range of male and female eastern wallaroos and assess habitat selection in order to define whether wallaroos in a peri-urban environment should be viewed as thriving ('matrix-occupying'), persisting ('matrix-sensitive') or struggling ('urban-sensitive').
   Methods. Home range and habitat use of six adult male, five adult female and one subadult male eastern wallaroo were investigated using GPS telemetry between October 2017 and May 2018 in the south-west of Sydney.
   Key results. Home ranges (mean +/- s.e.) of males (63.1 +/- 10.2 ha) were significantly larger than those of females (31.1 +/- 3.3 ha). Every adult wallaroo had highly overlapping monthly home ranges, indicating strong site fidelity in all individuals. Eastern wallaroos selected habitats based on vegetation composition during the night and canopy cover during the day. Grassland and open native woodlands were preferred during foraging activities at night. By contrast, humanmodified habitats, including hard surfaces and lawns, were avoided at all times by all individuals.
   Conclusion. The results indicate that eastern wallaroos avoid human-modified features in the landscape, so they could be viewed as persisting ('matrix-sensitive') in peri-urban areas. Implications. Compared with matrix-occupying macropods, such as the eastern grey kangaroo, the eastern wallaroo is less likely to cause human-wildlife conflicts - a result of its avoidance of human-modified habitat. Land-use planning, involving green corridors linking remnant vegetation, should be implemented as part of urban planning to enable the persistence of diverse mammal populations in urban areas, particularly matrix-sensitive species.

AB  - Important natural environmental gradients, including the connectivity of off-channel aquatic habitats to the main-stem river, have been lost in many reaches of the upper Mississippi River system, and an understanding of the consequences of this isolation is lacking in regard to native fish communities. The objectives of this study were to describe patterns of fish species richness, evenness, and diversity among representative habitats and river reaches and to examine the relationship between fish species richness and habitat diversity. Each year (1994-1999) fish communities of main-channel borders (MCB), side channel borders (SCB), and contiguous backwater shorelines (BWS) were sampled using boat-mounted electrofishing, mini-fyke-nets, tyke nets, hoop nets, and seines at a standardized number of sites. A total of 0.65 million fish were collected, representing 106 species from upper Mississippi River Pools 4, 8, 13, and 26; the open (unimpounded) river reach; and the La Grange Reach of the Illinois River. Within pools, species richness based on rarefaction differed significantly among habitats and was highest in BWS and lowest in MCB (P < 0.0001). At the reach scale, Pools 4, 8, and 13 consistently had the highest species richness and Pool 26, the open-river reach, and the La Grange Reach were significantly lower (P < 0.0001). Species evenness and diversity indices showed similar trends. The relationship between native fish species richness and habitat diversity was highly significant (r(2) = 0.85; P = 0.0091). These results support efforts aimed at the conservation and enhancement of connected side channels and backwaters. Although constrained by dams, pools with high native species richness could serve as a relative reference. The remnants of natural riverine dynamics that remain in these reaches should be preserved and enhanced; conditions could be used to guide restoration activities in more degraded reaches.

AB  - Whilst there are a number of mapping methods available for determining important areas for conservation within protected areas, there are few tools available for assessing the ecological value of landscapes that are 'beyond the reserves'. A systematic tool for determining the ecological value of landscapes outside of protected areas could be relevant to any development that results in a parcel of land being transformed from its 'natural' state to an alternative state (e.g., industrial, agricultural). Specifically what is needed is a method to determine which landscapes beyond protected areas are important for the ecological processes that they support and the threatened and vulnerable species that they contain. This paper presents the results of a project to develop a method for mapping ecologically important landscapes beyond protected areas; a Local Ecological Footprinting Tool (LEFT). The method uses existing globally available web-based databases and models to provide an ecological score based on :five key ecological features (biodiversity, vulnerability, fragmentation, connectivity and resilience) for every 300 m parcel within a given region. The end product is a map indicating ecological value across the landscape. We demonstrate the potential of this method through its application to three study regions in Canada, Algeria and the Russian Federation. The primary audience of this tool are those practitioners involved in planning the location of any landscape scale industrial/business or urban (e.g., new town) facility outside of protected areas. It provides a pre-planning tool, for use before undertaking a more costly field-based environmental impact assessment, and quickly highlights areas of high ecological value to avoid in the location of facilities.

AB  - Fragmentation, degradation and loss of natural habitats are now recognised as major threats to wildlife conservation and mobile pastoralism in East African savannas. These processes are driven primarily by land tenure and policy, increasing human population, expansion of settlements and agricultural farms, road networks, urban development and fencing. To understand and characterise the forces driving habitat fragmentation, we analyse how biophysical (soils, slope, rainfall, rivers) and human-created (roads, towns, parks, quarries) features influence where people choose to fence the land in the Athi-Kaputiei ecosystem of Kenya. We also explore the consequences of land fragmentation through fencing on the abundance and distribution of wildlife and livestock populations. We show that fences are most highly concentrated along the major roads and around the major urban centres. Movements of migratory wildebeest and zebra between the Nairobi National Park and the pastoral Kitengela Plains adjoining the park on the south are getting increasingly impeded by increasing concentration of fences. Populations of wildebeest and other herbivores have collapsed to a small fraction of their former abundance largely owing to destruction of their habitats and obstruction of their movements between the park and the pastoral lands by fences and other land use developments. Conserving the key seasonal wildlife dispersal areas in the Athi-Kaputiei Plains is critical to ensuring the future viability of several key wildlife species in Nairobi National Park. Several initiatives, including a conservation land lease program has been launched, but their spatial coverage and funding levels would need to be greatly expanded to secure sufficient open spaces for both wildlife and livestock.

AB  - Background: Urbanization causes modification, fragmentation and loss of native habitats. Such landscape changes threaten many arboreal and gliding mammals by limiting their movements through treeless parts of a landscape and by making the landscape surrounding suitable habitat patches more inhospitable. Here, we investigate the effects of landscape structure and habitat availability on the home-range use and movement patterns of the Siberian flying squirrel (Pteromys volans) at different spatial and temporal scales. We followed radio-tagged individuals in a partly urbanized study area in Eastern Finland, and analysed how landscape composition and connectivity affected the length and speed of movement bursts, distances moved during one night, and habitat and nest-site use.
   Results: The presence of urban habitat on movement paths increased both movement lengths and speed whereas nightly distances travelled by males decreased with increasing amount of urban habitat within the home range. The probability of switching from the present nest site to another nest site decreased with increasing distance among the nest sites, but whether the nest sites were connected or unconnected by forests did not have a clear effect on nest switching. Flying squirrels preferred to use mature forests for their movements at night.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that the proximity to urban habitats modifies animal movements, possibly because animals try to avoid such habitats by moving faster through them. Urbanization at the scale of an entire home range can restrict their movements. Thus, maintaining a large enough amount of mature forests around inhabited landscape fragments will help protect forest specialists in urban landscapes. The effect of forested connections remains unclear, highlighting the difficulty of measuring and preserving connectivity in a species-specific way.

AB  - Context In human-dominated landscapes, habitat fragmentation and barriers to movement can interrupt gene flow. While often considered at a local extent, regional analyses are also needed to reveal broader landscape-mediated population processes. Objectives To explore the relationship between patterns of gene flow and fragmentation resulting from urbanization across southern California, we used the bobcat as an indicator species. We assembled data for a landscape level genetic analysis across southern California from both archived and new samples, including two northern Californian populations for comparison, to identify local and regional areas affected by isolation. Methods Our regional analyses focused on a dataset of 19 microsatellite loci for 118 individuals and a dataset of 422 individuals genotyped at 11 loci. We examined population genetic structure and examined how pairwise genetic distance of all population clusters aligned with geographic distance. We employed a landscape genetic analysis based on resistance to determine which features of the landscape likely play a role in determining the patterns of genetic structure we observed. Results Study populations generally exhibited a pattern of isolation by distance and localized areas of genetic isolation. The landscape genetic analysis suggested that, in southern California, these patterns are driven by overall landscape permeability. Conclusions Although local studies are key to examining the effects of urbanization and habitat fragmentation on populations, we demonstrate the importance of combining local and regional analyses for wide-ranging species to understand and maintain connectivity at local scales, while also improving and establishing sustainable linkages to habitats at the regional scale.

AB  - Roads in urbanized areas can impact carnivore populations by constraining their movements and increasing mortality. Bobcats (Lynx rufus) are felids capable of living in urban environments, but are sensitive to habitat fragmentation and, thus, useful indicators of landscape connectivity; in particular, bobcat habitat selection, movement, and mortality may be affected by roads. We analyzed movement patterns of 52 bobcats in southern California in three study sites and investigated: (1) how bobcats responded to two types of roads within their home ranges; (2) how they placed their home ranges with respect to roads within the study area; and (3) whether male and female bobcats differed in their behavioral responses to roads. Within home ranges, primary and secondary roads did not influence movements, but bobcats more frequently crossed secondary roads when road densities were higher within their home ranges, thus increasing mortality risk. However, road densities within each study site were several times higher than road densities within home ranges, suggesting bobcats selected against roaded areas in home-range placement. Male home ranges bordering roads were smaller than home ranges for other males, but male home ranges containing roads were larger than those without roads. Male bobcats also were more likely to cross roads than females, potentially reflecting larger male home range sizes. Our results suggest roads have important impacts on urban bobcats, with stronger effects on males than females, and continued efforts to mitigate the effects of roads on carnivores and other fragmentation-sensitive species would help promote connectivity conservation in urban systems.

AB  - Transportation infrastructure may be the most important driver of social and economic development, but it is a major cause of environmental change in landscapes. The main objective of this paper is to report road edge effects on isopods of Hungarian highway verges. We examined the isopod diversity along five highways (M0, M1, M3, M5, M7) while accounting for road edge proximity and the adjacent areas. Double-glass pitfall traps were set in a total of 15 sites and at three distances from the edge of the roads next to different types of adjacent areas. We found differences between ecological parameters of isopod communities in relation to adjacent areas as well as to road edge proximity. The highest diversity was observed near urban areas, while the lowest was near the arable fields. Isopod diversity increased with decreasing distance from a road. Species diversity of different types of verges based on adjacent areas varied strongly in relation to road edge proximity. A medium distance (40 m) from roads had a positive effect on species richness, while verges next to arable fields were the most species-rich habitats. The general conclusion of this study is that highway verges provided suitable environment conditions for generalist isopod species but may be a limiting factor for specialist isopods. Moreover, highway verges function as corridors for isopods. The proximity of roads and urban areas positively affected isopods, and verges close to roads and urban areas are considered as an attractive environment for isopods in heterogeneous roadside verges.

AB  - Bees provide a variety of ecological services for urban ecosystems, while green roofs can also be of high value to bees through providing habitats and foraging sites. In this study, four hypotheses about impacts on abundance and diversity of pollinators were proposed from the roof and the surrounding environment. The evidences revealed that the height of the building affected the diversity of some bee species; increasing proportions of surrounding green space helped to increase abundance of bees and wasps; the colonies of bees were significantly affected by habitat connectivity, a frequent movement of bees and other mobile insects between roofs and ground guaranteed pollination of plants; plentiful plants combination was better than a single species in roof ecosystem services, and native forbs were beneficial for pollinations and foraging of pollinators; using fine substrate on green roofs may have a greater ecological value than common soil.

AB  - Pacific chorus frog (Pseudacris regilla) populations have persisted despite urban and rural development throughout the species' range; yet it is possible thatP. regilla, like other anurans with which it historically co-occurred, will become extirpated from cities and suburbs if urbanization intensifies as predicted. An improved understanding of the conditions that enable this species to persist in developed landscapes is needed to identify and conserve suitable habitats. We investigated species-habitat relationships forP. regillain a mixed urban-rural landscape in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, to identify potential criteria for habitat suitability. We conducted repeat auditory surveys of chorusing males at 52 potential breeding wetlands and modeled occupancy at 26 of these sites using local and landscape variables representing competing hypotheses and spatial scales of influence. The models that best explainedP. regillaoccupancy included a combination of terrestrial habitat and connectivity factors and the presence of non-native predators. We found that the proportion of impervious cover within 250 m of a wetland had the strongest negative impact on occupancy. Our findings suggest that availability of terrestrial habitat adjacent to breeding sites is the primary driver of species presence in the developed landscape. Conservation efforts should seek to limit impervious cover to less than 20% within a 250-m buffer around breeding wetlands. Further, restored and created wetlands in urban and rural areas may be more likely to supportP. regillaif they are designed with a seasonal hydroperiod that excludes non-native aquatic predators and are placed in an area of high pond density.

AB  - The Detroit River and western Lake Erie, located in the heart of the Great Lakes basin, support a great diversity of fish and wildlife, and their habitats, despite the enormity of habitat losses due to urban development and industrialization. This ecosystem also links Canada and the U.S. who share a long history of cooperative conservation. The river and lake are: at the intersection of two major North American bird migration flyways (i.e., the Atlantic and Mississippi); a significant fish migration corridor; and well recognized for their unique biodiversity. Over the past three decades much has been done to improve environmental conditions and to restore and conserve habitats. This paper reviews habitat management efforts within the environs of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge and provides advice to improve such efforts in the future. Ecological improvements resulting from these habitat projects, as well as the cumulative effects of these changes, have yet to be quantified or evaluated against existing program goals or targets. Habitat management remains a fragmented responsibility among many agencies and interests, which is often an obstacle to realizing ecological improvements, recovery, and sustainability. Moreover, cumulative habitat modifications are not reviewed often enough with respect to their impacts on the goals and targets established in existing programs, as well as their impacts on ecosystem results (e.g., fish or wildlife productivity). Clearly, there is a need to share experiences, synthesize science, learn from mistakes and successes, coordinate activities, and transfer knowledge on best practices and ecological effectiveness of habitat management.

AB  - Dams, levees, and water withdrawals disrupt hydrologic regimes and associated floodplain forests. Because these forests are also responding to changes in land use, species invasions, and climate change, the relative effects of these factors are hard to disentangle. Most studies of floodplain forests lack historic data, requiring us to rely on recent data or contemporary spatial relationships to these drivers to infer those causes of vegetation dynamics. Here, we use survey data from the 1950s to reconstruct plant community changes across 40 floodplain forests in Wisconsin. We applied two partial least squares regression (PLS) models to evaluate how current site and landscape scale conditions and changes in these conditions since the 1950s influence contemporary patterns of community diversity and composition. Local site variables were among the most important in explaining current composition metrics and their changes, but historic landscape variables and changes in these were also important. Current local diversity () was the highest at sites prone to frequent flooding, even at sites in fragmented landscapes. Sites along sinuous rivers in large watershed areas with more contiguous forest had the highest abundance of wetland indicator plants in the re-survey and had the largest increases in diversity since the 1950s, despite having the highest presence of exotic species then. These same sites have converged in composition, reflecting increases in wetland indicator plants and common native species. These patterns of increasing diversity coupled with declines in community distinctiveness are uncommon among long-term studies. Increases in wetland plants may indicate that sites have become wetter with hydrologic changes, but these increases may also reflect improved colonization and establishment processes involving a robust regional pool of generalist wetland taxa. Woody and exotic plants typical of upland forests increased at rarely flooded sites in fragmented and urbanizing landscapes, indicating shifts towards a later-successional conditions and a dampened disturbance regime. This has reduced local species diversity and increased regional distinctness at some sites. As hydrologic connections appear to best maintain native species diversity and composition, even in fragmented landscapes, managers should seek to recreate these whenever feasible.

AB  - Purpose - Urban stream ecosystems have often been seen as channels of water flow rather than as the valuable parts of an urban green space system providing ecosystem services. The study seeks to address the importance of urban stream ecosystems from the perspective of urban ecology, human health and social well-being in the context of urban planning.
   Design/methodology/approach - The case study area is the Rekolanoja stream ecosystem in the City of Vantaa, southern Finland. The data from the case study area were gathered from existing ecological studies and by conducting semi-structured interviews, a resident inquiry and a writing contest.
   Findings - The results from the Rekolanoja case show that intense management of the streamside vegetation and treatment of the stream channel in construction projects have decreased species richness and diminished valuable streamside biotopes. However, the stream corridor can function as an important recreational and educational element within the local green space network and thereby become a symbol of local identity.
   Practical implications - Planners, decision-makers and other interest groups can use the findings from this study in determining the values of small urban stream ecosystems in urban development.
   Originality/value - The Rekolanoja case indicates that planners and residents see the value of such an aquatic element as increasingly important for urban biodiversity and ecological corridor functions, as well as for local human health and social well-being, e.g. recreation and stress relief. Future land-use decisions will show whether a genuine change in the values and thinking of planners and decision-makers is taking place.

AB  - Ecological restoration can promote biodiversity conservation in anthropogenically fragmented habitats, but effectiveness of these management efforts need to be statistically validated to determine 'success.' One such approach is to gauge the extent of recolonization as a measure of landscape permeability and, in turn, population connectivity. In this context, we estimated dispersal and population connectivity in prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster; N = 231) and meadow vole (M. pennsylvanicus; N = 83) within five tall-grass prairie restoration sites embedded within the agricultural matrix of midwestern North America. We predicted that vole dispersal would be constrained by the extent of agricultural land surrounding restored habitat patches, spatially isolating vole populations and resulting in significant genetic structure. We first employed genetic assignment tests based on 15 microsatellite DNA loci to validate field-derived species-designations, then tested reclassified samples with multivariate and Bayesian clustering to assay for spatial and temporal genetic structure. Population connectivity was further evaluated by calculating pairwise F-ST, then potential demographic effects explored by computing migration rates, effective population size (N-e), and average relatedness (r). Genetic species assignments reclassified 25% of initial field identifications (N = 11 M. ochrogaster; N = 67 M. pennsylvanicus). In M. ochrogaster population connectivity was high across the study area, reflected in little to no spatial or temporal genetic structure. In M. pennsylvanicus genetic structure was detected, but relatedness estimates identified it as kin-clustering instead, underscoring social behavior among populations rather than spatial isolation as the cause. Estimates of N-e and r were stable across years, reflecting high dispersal and demographic resilience. Combined, these metrics suggest the agricultural matrix is highly permeable for voles and does not impede dispersal. High connectivity observed confirms that the restored landscape is productive and permeable for specific management targets such as voles and also demonstrates population genetic assays as a tool to statistically evaluate effectiveness of conservation initiatives.

AB  - Persistence of sensitive wildlife in populated regions requires conservation strategies that address gradual expansion of development footprint and human activity. The project-based environmental assessment regime for municipal development is poorly suited to provide necessary strategic perspective, given its focus on local and short-term impacts. We used the ALCES cumulative effects model to strategically assess impacts to grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in the Bow Valley of Alberta, Canada. Landscape simulation mapped expansion of past and potential future development footprint in the region over multiple decades. Consequences to movement connectivity for grizzly bears were estimated by applying a least cost path analysis to the landscape simulation. An index of recreational activity was derived from fitness tracking data and integrated with the landscape simulation to model change in recreational activity through time. Maps of grizzly bear connectivity and recreational activity were combined to calculate human-bear conflict risk. The analysis suggests that connectivity has been altered through displacement to upslope areas by settlement expansion, such that surrounding natural areas have become important for grizzly bear connectivity. These areas are also popular for outdoor recreation, resulting in elevated human-bear conflict risk which can be expected to increase if development and human activity continue to expand in high connectivity areas. Conservation of wildlife in populated regions will be supported by broadening the scope of environmental assessment to address cumulative effects of development footprint and human activity over large spatial and temporal scales.

AB  - We introduce a new way of measuring and optimizing connectivity in conservation landscapes through time, accounting for both the biological needs of multiple species and the social and. nancial constraint of minimizing land area requiring additional protection. Our method is based on the concept of network. ow; we demonstrate its use by optimizing protected areas in the Western Cape of South Africa to facilitate autogenic species shifts in geographic range under climate change for a family of endemic plants, the Cape Proteaceae. In 2005, P. Williams and colleagues introduced a novel framework for this protected area design task. To ensure population viability, they assumed each species should have a range size of at least 100 km(2) of predicted suitable conditions contained in protected areas at all times between 2000 and 2050. The goal was to design multiple dispersal corridors for each species, connecting suitable conditions between time periods, subject to each species' limited dispersal ability, and minimizing the total area requiring additional protection. We show that both minimum range size and limited dispersal abilities can be naturally modeled using the concept of network. ow. This allows us to apply well- established tools from operations research and computer science for solving network. ow problems. Using the same data and this novel modeling approach, we reduce the area requiring additional protection by a third compared to previous methods, from 4593 km(2) to 3062 km(2), while still achieving the same conservation planning goals. We prove that this is the best solution mathematically possible: the given planning goals cannot be achieved with a smaller area, given our modeling assumptions and data. Our method allows for. exibility and re. nement of the underlying climate- change, species- habitat- suitability, and dispersal models. In particular, we propose an alternate formalization of a minimum range size moving through time and use network. ow to achieve the revised goals, again with the smallest possible newly protected area (2850 km(2)). We show how to relate total dispersal distance to probability of successful dispersal, and compute a trade- off curve between this quantity and the total amount of extra land that must be protected.

AB  - Exurban development, defined as residential development outside of cities and towns, occupies nearly five times more land in the United States than urban and suburban development combined. Understanding the effects of exurban development on biodiversity thus has important and wide-ranging implications for the planning, construction and stewardship of sustainable communities and surrounding rural lands. To assess the impact of exurban development on mammalian habitat use, wildlife cameras were placed along a unique gradient of landscape permeability through varying densities and configurations of housing development in a rapidly growing rural region of Colorado. Multiple-season species occupancy and relative activity levels were measured in summer and winter seasons. The impacts of exurban housing on mammals were species specific and varied along the development gradient. Bobcats (Lynx rufus), elk (Cervus canadensis), and coyotes (Canis latrans), showed decreased activity and occupancy levels in more developed areas, whereas red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) occurred more frequently in these areas. Other species did not show significant responses to exurban development. In addition, black bears (Ursus americanus) used embedded greenbelts more frequently in high-density exurban subdivisions. Using our development gradient provides ecologically relevant insight into how mammals respond to residential development, and our results demonstrate that some species respond positively to residential development, but that others decline or disappear as the development gradient intensifies. Incorporating well-designed and naturally vegetated open spaces into development projects and minimizing human disturbance could mitigate impacts to mid-large sized mammals in regions undergoing exurban expansion.

AB  - Powerline corridor management in Australia has traditionally focused on the complete removal of vegetation using short rotation times due to the perceived fire hazard associated with corridor vegetation. This study assessed vegetation recovery in a powerline corridor, following management, at three sites spanning corridor and forest habitat. Forest and corridor vegetation communities differed significantly between sites and over time. As vegetation recovered, the corridor community became a mix of plants common in the surrounding forest and open areas, changing within the 3-year study from a grass-fern to shrub-sedge community encroached by midstorey species. The current short rotations between management events unnecessarily maintain the corridor in a cycle of degradation, remove resources for native species and may allow introduced grasses and saplings to proliferate in the corridor. Maintaining a shrub layer would help avoid loss of species richness, encourage native species and limit colonisation opportunities of introduced species. Spot spraying emergent saplings and problem plants and mosaic slashing, would keep fire risk low and maintain biodiversity without increasing biomass to dangerous levels. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Roads facilitate access by deforestation agents, being relevant in studies approaching conservationist matters in rainforests. It is important to understand the relationship between road distribution, relief, land use, and forest coverage in order to evaluate where forests are more vulnerable. This study aimed at: 1) understanding the relationship between relief and density and road connectivity in three moments in time; and 2) evaluating the relationship between distance from roads and forest coverage, farmlands and rural and urban facilities in a fragmented Atlantic Forest landscape in three moments in time. Maps of roads, altitude, and land use and coverage were used. Chi-square tests showed that: 1) density and road connectivity did not present significant relationship with the relief; and 2) forest areas occupy areas distant from the roads, while farmlands and rural and urban facilities occupy areas nearer the roads. Roads and land use, regardless of relief, influence forest coverage distribution. Thus, we suggest that roads are taken into account in conservationist strategies and environmental planning.

AB  - Pollinators are among the first to be lost when natural habitat is reduced to small patches and this can have cascading effects on multiple plant species. Simultaneously, the loss of natural habitat cuts people off from nature and, when people are out of touch with nature they do not care for biodiversity, resulting in further losses. Theoretically, the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on pollinators can be mitigated by reconnecting isolated conservation areas with stepping stones and, if these are located in an urban matrix, they offer opportunities for people to reconnect with nature. Here we assess the effect of creating stepping stone habitats for nectar-feeding birds across Cape Town, South Africa. With the help of pupils, we planted gardens of indigenous, bird-pollinated plants at eight schools in the urbanized matrix between two conservation areas. To test for change in the bird community on school grounds we conducted 398 bird observation sessions over a seven-year period. Changes in attitudes and knowledge were assessed with questionnaires distributed to 176 pupils. We found that, as gardens matured, nectar availability increased and the probability of observing a Southern Doublecollared Sunbird (Cinnyris chalybeus) on school grounds during a 30 min period increased from 10% to 50%. Bird species richness increased from -5 to -7 species. Questionnaire scores increased by 30% in participating pupils versus 8% in non-participating pupils. Although effects were small, the results suggest that it is possible to restore the bird-pollination mutualism in cities and in the process reconnect people with nature.

AB  - A growing literature in the field of road ecology suggests that vehicle/wildlife collisions are important to biologists and transportation officials alike. Roads can affect the quality and quantity of available wildlife habitat, most notably through fragmentation. Likewise, vehicular traffic on roads can be direct sources of wildlife mortality and in some instances, can be catastrophic to populations. Thus, connectivity of habitat and permeability of road systems are important factors to consider when developing road mortality mitigation systems. There are a variety of approaches that can be used to reduce the effects of roads and road mortality on wildlife populations. Here, we briefly review wildlife-crossing structures, summarize previous wildlife road mortality mitigation studies, describe common mitigation measures, and discuss factors that influence the overall effectiveness of mitigation strategies. Because there are very few road mortality studies "before" and "after" the installation of wildlife-crossing structures, their efficiency is nearly impossible to evaluate. However, simple and relatively inexpensive measures reviewed herein can almost certainly reduce the number of collisions between wildlife and automobiles. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The increasing number of visitors to wetland parks has caused varying degrees of impact on wetland life. How to reduce the damage to wetland biodiversity caused by recreational activities in parks, improve tourists' recreational experience, and balance the relationship between the two are urgent problems that need to be solved. Therefore, four urban wetland parks were selected as subjects for this study. The present study utilized social media data to study the diversity of urban wetland habitats and tourists' wetland landscape preferences from the spatial dimension and explore the relationship between the two. This is a practice different from the traditional ecological research (survey, measurement, monitoring, questionnaire survey) of wetland habitat diversity assessment. The research revealed the following findings: (1) There was a significant positive correlation between habitat saturation and positive artificial elements, such as landscape structures and aerial walkways; (2) Landscape complexity is negatively correlated with landscape instantaneity and wilderness degree; (3) Habitat diversity was negatively correlated with landscape instantaneity but positively correlated with naturalness and positive artificial elements. This study proposes wetland habitat construction as a strategy to optimize the management of habitat diversity in urban wetland parks and enhance its ecological education function.

AB  - Understanding stability across ecological hierarchies is critical for landscape management in a changing world. Recent studies showed that synchrony among lower-level components is key to scaling temporal stability across two hierarchical levels, whether spatial or organizational. But an extended framework that integrates both spatial scale and organizational level simultaneously is required to clarify the sources of ecosystem stability at large scales. However, such an extension is far from trivial when taking into account the spatial heterogeneities in real-world ecosystems. In this paper, we develop a partitioning framework that bridges variability and synchrony measures across spatial scales and organizational levels in heterogeneous metacommunities. In this framework, metacommunity variability is expressed as the product of local-scale population variability and two synchrony indices that capture the temporal coherence across species and space, respectively. We develop an R function 'var.partition' and apply it to five types of desert plant communities to illustrate our framework and test how diversity shapes synchrony and variability at different hierarchical levels. As the observation scale increased from local populations to metacommunities, the temporal variability of plant productivity was reduced mainly by factors that decreased species synchrony. Species synchrony decreased from local to regional scales, and spatial synchrony decreased from species to community levels. Local and regional species diversity were key factors that reduced species synchrony at the two scales. Moreover, beta diversity contributed to decreasing spatial synchrony among communities. We conclude that our new framework offers a valuable toolbox for future empirical studies to disentangle the mechanisms and pathways by which ecological factors influence stability at large scales.

AB  - By the end of 2020, 75% of the Swiss population will live in cities. The urban densification will result in habitat and biodiversity loss. One solution to mitigate this loss in urban environments is the implementation of green roofs that are now recognised as a tool for the maintenance of epigeal and aerial arthropods. Green roofs can provide various services such as pollination and food supply for insects and various arthropods (e.g. arachnids) and animals (e.g. birds). The objective of this study was to evaluate the diversity of pollinating insects emerging from urban green roofs. Wild bees (Hymenoptera) and hoverflies (Diptera) were sampled using emergence traps on six extensive green roofs in the urban area of Geneva (Switzerland), from March to August 2017. Five species of wild bees and two species of hoverflies were identified: Lasioglossum morio (Halictidae) and Sphaerophoria scripta (Syrphidae) are the only two species considered as emerging from green roofs in our study. Ecological traits of these two species indicated generalists, well adapted to xero-thermophilic conditions.

AB  - Question: When did vegetation assemblages that occupy modern central Mexico appear within the context of the late Quaternary?
   Location: Central Mexico.
   Methods: We used modern and fossil pollen data sets from central Mexico to explore the evolution of regional vegetation through the late Quaternary. A total of 1397 samples (1357 fossil samples distributed in 17 records and 40 modern samples) were analysed through detrended correspondence analysis to evaluate the degree of analogy between modern and past vegetation assemblages, and regional vegetation compositional turnover through time.
   Results: There was a high degree of analogy between modern and glacial vegetation, whereas the early and mid-Holocene were characterized by a high frequency of no-modern-analogue pollen assemblages. Vegetation turnover during the glacial time was characterized by both pulses of abrupt change and episodes of stability. In contrast, vegetation turnover was high through most of the Holocene. Both vegetation turnover and past vegetation analogy to modern were not synchronous in altitudinal zones, except for the past 2000yrs, when pollen assemblages suggest a high vegetation analogy to modern-day throughout the region.
   Conclusions: Human impacts on central Mexico regional vegetation were consistently evident during the last 2000yrs, suggesting that biodiversity expressed in the modern vegetation assemblages incorporates a high anthropogenic imprint. High resemblance of glacial and modern landscapes suggests that the effect of human occupation on the landscape is similar to that exerted by glacial time environmental stress. However, loss of ecosystem connectivity under the modern pattern of landscape homogenization represents an unprecedented threat for regional biodiversity.

AB  - Deforestation around large urban centers usually creates a fragmented landscape with reduced natural areas. Biodiversity studies in these forest remnants provide useful tools for designing conservation strategies that maximize the persistence of local diversity and promote their connectivity. Inventories focused on particular taxa have been proposed as a useful mechanism that allows a better knowledge of the state of biodiversity in a given area, the butterflies are one of the taxonomic groups more frequently used for these studies. In this paper, we study the diversity and composition of the butterfly community in the cloud forest of the reserve El Romeral located southwest of the Medellin City in the Aburra Valley, Colombia. We recorded 75 species belonging to 5 butterfly families, more than recorded for similar forests associated with periurban areas. El Romeral shares only 50% of the species with the main periurban forest located east of the valley, indicating that each of the surrounding forest remnants of the city may have a unique composition of species being complementary and useful for regional conservation.

AB  - Exploring the impacts of landscape pattern on ecosystem services (ESs) and their trade-offs could provide a new way to improve ESs without largely altering land use types. Using the City Belt along the Yellow River in Ningixa (CBYN) as a case study, we quantified five critical ESs (one provision service of crop production, three regulating services of carbon sequestration, nutrient retention and sand fixation, and one cultural service of recreational opportunity) in 1989-2019 through CASA model, InVEST model and empirical equations. Then we calculated landscape pattern metrics at landscape and class level through Fragstats 4.3 across multiple scales and quantified their impacts on each ES and ES trade-offs through random forest analysis, self-organizing mapping analysis and multivariable regression tree. The results suggested that 3 km is more suitable for analyzing the impacts of landscape pattern on ESs in the CBYN. The nonlinear relations between landscape pattern metrics and each ES were fitted with adjusted R2 ranging from 0.26 to 0.51, indicating the significant but limited impacts of landscape pattern on ESs. Specially, landscape-level metrics of CONTAG, SHDI and FRACMN have higher impacts on ESs than class-level ones. Significant synergies existed among agricultural production, carbon sequestration and nutrient retention, except in mountain region with higher or lower fragmentation. Sand fixation has synergy relations with the former three ESs, which would be altered in situations with higher or lower diversity. Our results provide a new direction for land use management to achieve high-quality development without largely altering existing land use situation.

AB  - Urban river walls represent some of the most common habitat available to riparian species within heavily engineered urban river corridors, but research into the characteristics and diversity of river walls is very rare. In this study, the flora of urban river walls was surveyed at 16 sites (92 walls) along 32 km of the river Thames through central London to determine the characteristics and habitat origins of species found on these walls, whether these species indicated an urban cliff effect occurring on wall habitats and whether plant species richness varied between different wall types. A total of 90 species were found on the walls, with the majority of species associated with disturbed areas and riparian habitats, supporting the idea of a mass effect occurring, whereby the flora is maintained by propagule pressure from remnant or introduced habitats within urban or peri-urban areas, rather than walls selecting for cliff/rock species. There was an increased incidence of plants from cliff/rock habitats found in the flora however, suggesting that an urban cliff effect does still occur. Species were organized along the river walls based on riparian/terrestrial gradients and stress tolerance, probably reflecting a gradient of wall height above river flows. Plant species richness was significantly higher on brick walls than that on sheet piling, indicating key differences between materials probably based on surface integrity. Large areas of connected river walls (wallscapes) through heavily engineered urban rivers represent potential sites for the enactment of reconciliation ecology via habitat improvement in urban ecosystems.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a primary driver of wildlife loss, and establishment of biological corridors is a common strategy to mitigate this problem. A flagship example is the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC), which aims to connect protected forest areas between Mexico and Panama to allow dispersal and gene flow of forest organisms. Because forests across Central America have continued to degrade, the functioning of the MBC has been questioned, but reliable estimates of species occurrence were unavailable. Large mammals are suitable indicators of forest functioning, so we assessed their conservation status across the Isthmus of Panama, the narrowest section of the MBC. We used large-scale camera-trap surveys and hierarchical multispecies occupancy models in a Bayesian framework to estimate the occupancy of 9 medium to large mammals and developed an occupancy-weighted connectivity metric to evaluate species-specific functional connectivity. White-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), jaguar (Panthera onca), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and tapir (Tapirus bairdii) had low expected occupancy along the MBC in Panama. Puma (Puma concolor), red brocket deer (Mazama temama), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), and collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), which are more adaptable, had higher occupancy, even in areas with low forest cover near infrastructure. However, the majority of species were subject to >= 1 gap that was larger than their known dispersal distances, suggesting poor connectivity along the MBC in Panama. Based on our results, forests in Darien, Donoso-Santa Fe, and La Amistad International Park are critical for survival of large terrestrial mammals in Panama and 2 areas need restoration.

AB  - Amphibians are declining worldwide and land use change to agriculture is recognized as a leading cause. Argentina is undergoing an agriculturalization process with rapid changes in landscape structure.
   We evaluated anuran response to landscape composition and configuration in two landscapes of east-central Argentina with different degrees of agriculturalization. We identified sensitive species and evaluated landscape influence on communities and individual species at two spatial scales.
   We compared anuran richness, frequency of occurrence, and activity between landscapes using call surveys data from 120 sampling points from 2007 to 2009. We evaluated anuran responses to landscape structure variables estimated within 250 and 500-m radius buffers using canonical correspondence analysis and multimodel inference from a set of candidate models.
   Anuran richness was lower in the landscape with greater level of agriculturalization with reduced amount of forest cover and stream length. This pattern was driven by the lower occurrence and calling activity of seven out of the sixteen recorded species. Four species responded positively to the amount of forest cover and stream habitat. Three species responded positively to forest cohesion and negatively to rural housing. Two responded negatively to crop area and diversity of cover classes.
   Anurans within agricultural landscapes of east-central Argentina are responding to landscape structure. Responses varied depending on species and study scale. Life-history traits contribute to responses differences. Our study offers a better understanding of landscape effects on anurans and can be used for land management in other areas experiencing a similar agriculturalization process.

AB  - This study utilized a finite mixture distribution model (FMDM) to identify the distribution of bird diversity in urban and suburban areas of the Taipei basin. The spatial patterns of Shannon's diversity index were estimated using Sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS) with bird investigation data. To validate the results of FMDM, bird groups were classified by two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) based on bird presence-absence records. The probabilities exceeding FMDM's cut-off values for suburban bird communities were obtained from SGS realizations. The results showed that bird diversity in the Taipei basin could be comprised of two-component mixture distributions for urban and suburban bird communities, respectively. The FMDM bird diversity classifications fit the TWINSPAN groups of urban and suburban species. The spatial maps of bird diversity in the study area provide evidence that a metropolis can cause changes in the spatial characteristics of bird communities at the landscape level. Furthermore, the bird diversity and land use maps could be useful for future conservation and urban planning in Taipei Basin, particularly urban green spaces and wetlands. The maps could also be utilized in network planning of green belts or corridors for ecological conservation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Linear plant compositions establish a connection between rural and urban landscapes. The green fields, which are abundant in rural areas, are diminished in urban spaces due to rapid urbanization. This problem can be solved by using linear planting techniques in urbanized places. Nearby establishing green corridors in cities, linear planting serve as very nice visual compositions and provide functionalities. Linear plant compositions, which are quite important for the city, were examined owing to 3 different purposes. The first is the identifying of the plants having been used in linear green compositions. The second is the determining of the functional differences while the last one is preference and visual perception differences depending on users. In this study, totally 32 species were identified. Ligustrum japonicum, Biota orientalis and Hydrangea macrophylla were recorded as the most common species. The se linear compositions were used as barrier with the rate of 78% in residential areas and 50% in open green spaces, as border with the rate of 40% in public spaces, as curtain with the rate of 86 in public areas, as separator with the rate of 87% in transportation areas. Visual quality of linear compositions was assessed by using chi(2) analysis. Statistically reliable (%95) P<0.005 results were found between user and visual quality As a result, linear plant compositions in Trabzon possess evergreen plant species by 70%. In addition, the linear plant compositions looking aesthetic were identified to be preferred more according to Semantical Differential Technique.

AB  - Maintenance of genetic variation is of critical importance for wild populations since low levels limit the species' ability to respond to different threats (diseases, predators, environmental changes) in both the long and the short term. Human activities could impact the genetic variation of wild species in multiple ways, including via fragmentation and harvesting. We used an individual-based landscape genetics approach to describe the impact of landscape elements and trapping pressure on the spatial genetic structure of a large sample (n = 370) of the stone marten (Martes foina) in central-eastern France (Bresse). An analysis of isolation-by-resistance using a causal modeling approach showed an influence of landscape cover and/or trapping pressure on gene flow according to age and sex class. Overall, the connectivity in the study area is provided mainly by vegetation cover, while roads and open areas partially impede it. Unexpectedly for this "urban adapter" species, buildings could reduce gene flow. We also emphasized the sex-dependent effect of trapping on gene flow. Genetic differentiation in males was influenced by trapping pressure and landscape structure while only the latter influenced genetic differentiation in females. A stronger isolation by distance in males than in females suggested that at the scale of the study area, males are more exposed to trapping pressure, which reduces effective dispersal. Overall, the combination of both landscape and trapping costs might create an 'ecological trap' that could disrupt gene flow, leading to a north-south division in the study area.

AB  - The urban functional zone (UFZ) is the basic unit of urban planning, which is defined as an area of similar social and economic functions. Despite the importance of UFZs, the stability of their annual temperature between winter and summer has seldom been investigated. With an understanding of the thermal impacts that planning decisions can have, it is essential to know how UFZs can be designed to regulate temperatures in the urban environment. 690 UFZs were identified using ALOS images in 2009 in Beijing. Land surface temperature (LST) was extracted from daytime Landsat TM (2002) and ASTER (2009) images. The regional LST variation of 31 district-sized sub-regions was correlated to the types of UFZs in the region and structural features of the region such as area, size, diversity, complexity and connectivity. Results showed that: (1) UFZ types, in order from highest to lowest LST variation, were commercial, campus, high density residential, water, recreational, low density residential, road, preservation, and agricultural zones; (2) the regional LST variation was positively correlated with the area of campus, commercial, high density residential, water, and road zones, but negatively correlated with the area of agricultural and low density residential zones; (3) increased connectivity and complexity decreased regional LST variations. The results indicated that the stability of annual temperatures was determined not only by the UFZ type and size but also by the connectivity and complexity. These results are clearly useful and essential pieces of information that can be applied in urban planning to improve climate adaptability. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Goricko Landscape Park is a well-preserved example of typical Central-European agricultural landscape. We used modified PHYSIS typology to describe and classify different habitat types (HT), especially the riparian stream corridors and patches (RSCP)-habitats of riparian woody stands occurring outside the closed woodland. The RSCP of Goricko were categorized into 107 HT, which cover 1.35% of the 45,000 ha in Goricko. The ash-alder vegetation is the most widespread riparian HT. For the detailed analysis, we compared two similar areas that differ only in land-use intensity. RSCP showed slightly higher fractal dimension and significantly higher elongation index in more intensified area B. The analysis of RSCP types on these areas showed a shift, accompanying increased agricultural impact, from pure stands to mixed, from trees to scrub, from ash-alder and white willow stands to mixed riverine willow stands. The course of the intensification produced two results: arable HT were united into large, homogeneous polygons, while less usable land was abandoned. We can conclude that some of the landscape characteristics we used can be applied to detect the level of preserved traditional cultural landscape. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rapid climate change poses complex challenges for conservation, especially in tropical developing countries where biodiversity is high while financial and technical resources are limited. The complexity is heightened by uncertainty in predicted effects, both for ecological systems and human communities that depend heavily on natural resource extraction and use. Effective conservation plans and measures must be inexpensive, fast-acting, and able to increase the resilience of both the ecosystem and the social-ecological system. We present conservation practitioners with a framework that strategically integrates climate change planning into connectivity measures for tropical mountain ecosystems in Costa Rica. We propose a strategy for doubling the amount of habitat currently protected in riparian corridors using measures that are relatively low cost and fast-acting, and will employ and expand human capital. We argue that habitat connectivity must be enhanced along latitudinal gradients, but also within the same elevational bands, via a lattice-work corridor system. This is needed to facilitate range shifts for mobile species and evolutionary adaptation for less mobile species. We think that conservation measures within the elevational bands must include conservation-friendly land uses that improve current and future human livelihoods under dynamic conditions. Key components include community involvement, habitat priority-setting, forest landscape restoration, and environmental services payments. Our approach is fundamentally adaptive in that the conservation measures employed are informed by on-the-ground successes and failures and modified accordingly, but are relatively low risk and fast-acting. Our proposal, if implemented, would satisfy tenets of climate-smart conservation, improve the resilience of human and ecological communities, and be a model for other locations facing similar challenges.

AB  - AimUnderstanding the relationships between species turnover, environmental features and the geographic distance between sites can provide important insights into the processes driving species diversity. This is particularly relevant where the effective distance between sites may be a function of the habitat or topographic features of the landscape and the means of dispersal of the organism. River networks, in particular in human-modified landscapes, are a striking example of such a situation. Here, we use data for both aquatic and terrestrial organisms across an urban river network to examine patterns of species turnover and to determine whether these patterns differ between different taxonomic groups.
   LocationSheffield area, UK.
   MethodsAquatic (macroinvertebrates, diatoms) and terrestrial (birds, plants, butterflies) organisms were surveyed at 41 sites across an urban river network. We assessed the relationship between turnover and three alternative geographic distance measures (Euclidean, network and flow distance), whilst also taking into account the environmental distance between sites, using Mantel and partial Mantel tests.
   ResultsTurnover of all taxonomic groups apart from butterflies was significantly correlated with at least one measure of geographic distance. The aquatic taxonomic groups showed the strongest correlations with the geographic distance measures, and in particular with network distance. Terrestrial taxa were more closely associated with environmental than any of the geographic distance measures, although network distance remained significant for birds and some plant groups after removing the effect of environmental distance. Water-dispersed and neophyte plant groups were significantly related to network and flow distance.
   Main conclusionsThe results suggest that aquatic communities are strongly influenced by spatial processes occurring within the river network. Terrestrial taxa have a more complex relationship with distance, with different components of these communities displaying different responses. Nevertheless, it is clear that connectivity along the river corridor is important for both aquatic and terrestrial communities.

AB  - We introduce a conceptual model of the urban forest patch as a complex social-ecological system, incorporating cross-scale interactions. We developed this model through an interdisciplinary process engaging social and ecological scientists and urban land management decision makers, with a focus on temperate forest social-ecological systems. In this paper, we place the production and management of urban forest patches in historical perspective, present a conceptual model of urban forest patches within a broader regional context, and identify a series of research questions to highlight future directions for research on urban forest patches. This conceptual model identifies how spatial and temporal social-ecological drivers interact with patch-level conditions at multiple scales. Our integrative approach can provide insights into the role of social-ecological drivers in shaping forest health, biodiversity, and benefits forest patches provide to people in urban and urbanizing regions, with direct implications for decision-making to improve management outcomes.

AB  - Context Increasing human populations in urban areas pose a threat to species' persistence through habitat loss and fragmentation. It is therefore essential that we develop methods to investigate critical habitat loss thresholds and least detrimental landscape configurations.
   Objectives We develop a framework to assess how the pattern of habitat loss impacts the ecological and social characteristics of a landscape and how this varies depending on the species and criteria by which it is judged.
   Methods We use a scenario-based approach to test six propositions in which habitat is lost preferentially based on patch characteristics. We use eight bird and two amphibian species as indicator species. To compare scenarios, we present a method combining the output from a metapopulation model with measures of social impacts of land-cover change in a multiple criteria decision analysis. We also determine whether a habitat loss threshold exists, below which small loss of habitat can lead to large loss of species' occupancy.
   Results We found that, of the scenarios presented, preferentially losing common habitats and smaller patches was least detrimental for both ecological and social factors. Threshold effects were found for all but the generalist bird species.
   Conclusions We have outlined a workflow which allows for transparent, repeatable comparison between landscapes. This workflow can be used to compare urban landscape plans, or to develop general understanding of the impacts of different forms of habitat loss. Reassuringly, the recommendations based on the scenarios presented are in keeping with received conservation wisdom: to prioritise larger and/or rarer patches.

AB  - Background Global increases in human activity threaten connectivity of animal habitat and populations. Protection and restoration of wildlife habitat and movement corridors require robust models to forecast the effects of human activity on movement behaviour, resource selection, and connectivity. Recent research suggests that animal resource selection and responses to human activity depend on their behavioural movement state, with increased tolerance for human activity in fast states of movement. Yet, few studies have incorporated state-dependent movement behaviour into analyses of Merriam connectivity, that is individual-based metrics of connectivity that incorporate landscape structure and movement behaviour. Methods We assessed the cumulative effects of anthropogenic development on multiple movement processes including movement behaviour, resource selection, and Merriam connectivity. We simulated movement paths using hidden Markov movement models and step selection functions to estimate habitat use and connectivity for three landscape scenarios: reference conditions with no anthropogenic development, current conditions, and future conditions with a simulated expansion of towns and recreational trails. Our analysis used 20 years of grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) and gray wolf (Canis lupus) movement data collected in and around Banff National Park, Canada. Results Carnivores increased their speed of travel near towns and areas of high trail and road density, presumably to avoid encounters with people. They exhibited stronger avoidance of anthropogenic development when foraging and resting compared to travelling and during the day compared to night. Wolves exhibited stronger avoidance of anthropogenic development than grizzly bears. Current development reduced the amount of high-quality habitat between two mountain towns by more than 35%. Habitat degradation constrained movement routes around towns and was most pronounced for foraging and resting behaviour. Current anthropogenic development reduced connectivity from reference conditions an average of 85%. Habitat quality and connectivity further declined under a future development scenario. Conclusions Our results highlight the cumulative effects of anthropogenic development on carnivore movement behaviour, habitat use, and connectivity. Our strong behaviour-specific responses to human activity suggest that conservation initiatives should consider how proposed developments and restoration actions would affect where animals travel and how they use the landscape.

AB  - An accurate description of spatial urban growth is a prerequisite step in order to implement appropriated policies to improve the ecosystem service performance of green spaces in a city. Such information is, however, absent in Lubumbashi, the second metropolis of the Democratic Republic of Congo, despite its high demographic growth rate and an unplanned spatial urban growth. This study was designed to characterize the spatial pattern of green spaces and the extent of changes driven by the urbanization along the urban-rural gradient using a combination of landscape metrics and floristic plots. Our results revealed that the number of patches was directly proportional to the degree of urbanization of the city, whereas the area of the green spaces and the index of the largest patch showed an inverse relationship with the urbanization degree. Urban green spaces were dominated by attached and roadside spaces that are more equipped and present a higher occurrence of cultivated plants. By contrast, peri-urban green spaces were characterized by buffer zones, fields, abandoned areas, and informal spaces, with an elevated proportion of invasive species and natural vegetation. Moreover, it was found that the number of exotic species increased with the degree of urbanization, reaching values considered a threat to the indigenous flora. The current results underline the need for urgent measures oriented both toward increasing the spatial connectivity between green spaces (e.g., by creating new green spaces planted with indigenous species) while reducing the spread of invasive species in the city.

AB  - In the last 50-60 years, agricultural intensification and later urban development have threatened the rare and valuable gully landscape formed on marine clay. We studied landscape changes in eastern Akershus county in south-east Norway, which has one of the world's largest concentrations of marine gullies. Interpretation of aerial photos showed that about 25% of the gully area has been lost. Only 39.5% of the remaining area is original gullies, and 60.5% of the area has been affected by landscape change. The largest loss of gully area was between 1955 and 1991, mainly through land levelling and transformation to intensively managed agricultural landscape. The most densely populated areas also lost gullies to residential areas and industry. Gullies support high plant and animal diversity, and future management should be based on landscape ecological principles. Gully fragments should also be preserved to maintain connectivity between the many different habitats belonging to the gullies.

AB  - Global wildlife populations are in decline, in part, due to habitat loss resulting from urbanization. Urban green roofs may mitigate such habitat loss by providing supplemental habitat for wildlife, including bats, which are more active over urban green roofs than nearby traditional roofs. To better understand bat activity over urban green roofs, we surveyed bats and arthropods on a 27,316-m(2) green roof planted with Sedum spp. in New York City from June to August 2017. We found that Lasiurus borealis (Eastern Red Bat), a species with a diet consisting mainly of moths, accounted for 88% of identified bat calls. We collected over 15,000 arthropods of 16 taxa and found that moth abundance, while a relatively small proportion of green roof arthropods, correlated positively with bat activity. Our findings suggest that urban green roofs provide useable habitat for moths and other arthropods and, consequently, bats may forage on green roofs when prey are available.

AB  - Today, most wild tigers live in small, isolated Protected Areas within human dominated landscapes in the Indian subcontinent. Future survival of tigers depends on increasing local population size, as well as maintaining connectivity between populations. While significant conservation effort has been invested in increasing tiger population size, few initiatives have focused on landscape-level connectivity and on understanding the effect different landscape elements have on maintaining connectivity. We combined individual-based genetic and landscape ecology approaches to address this issue in six protected areas with varying tiger densities and separation in the Central Indian tiger landscape. We non-invasively sampled 55 tigers from different protected areas within this landscape. Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian genetic assignment tests indicate long-range tiger dispersal (on the order of 650 km) between protected areas. Further geo-spatial analyses revealed that tiger connectivity was affected by landscape elements such as human settlements, road density and host-population tiger density, but not by distance between populations. Our results elucidate the importance of landscape and habitat viability outside and between protected areas and provide a quantitative approach to test functionality of tiger corridors. We suggest future management strategies aim to minimize urban expansion between protected areas to maximize tiger connectivity. Achieving this goal in the context of ongoing urbanization and need to sustain current economic growth exerts enormous pressure on the remaining tiger habitats and emerges as a big challenge to conserve wild tigers in the Indian subcontinent.

AB  - Transfrontier wildlife corridors can be successful conservation tools, connecting protected areas and reducing the impact of habitat fragmentation on mobile species. Urban wildlife corridors have been proposed as a potential mitigation tool to facilitate the passage of elephants through towns without causing conflict with urban communities. However, because such corridors are typically narrow and close to human development, wildlife (particularly large mammals) may be less likely to use them. We used remote-sensor camera traps and global positioning system collars to identify the movement patterns of African elephants Loxondonta africana through narrow, urban corridors in Botswana. The corridors were in three types of human-dominated land-use designations with varying levels of human activity: agricultural, industrial and open-space recreational land. We found that elephants used the corridors within all three land-use designations and we identified, using a model selection approach, that season, time of day and rainfall were important factors in determining the presence of elephants in the corridors. Elephants moved more slowly through the narrow corridors compared with their movement patterns through broader, wide-ranging corridors. Our results indicate that urban wildlife corridors are useful for facilitating elephants to pass through urban areas.

AB  - The first inventory of the flora of Appia Antica Regional Park (Italy), one of the largest protected urban areas in Europe (4580 ha), its biological, ecological and biogeographical composition, and notes of the vegetation physiognomies and landscape are presented; physical characteristics of the territory (geomorphology, lithotypes, and phytoclimate) are also given. The landscape is defined by an agricultural matrix with natural and seminatural areas as patches, and riparian vegetation communities as corridors. The vegetation physiognomies are represented by types linked to the Mediterranean climate (mixed, Mediterranean, and riparian forests; scrubby, rocky, aquatic, and helophytic vegetation; anthropogenic communities). The floristic list includes 714 taxa (104 families and 403 genera). Therophytes prevail over hemicryptophytes; woody flora comprises about 30% of alien species. As regards chorotypes, together with a considerable number of Mediterranean species, there are many exotic species with wide distribution areas testifying to a long-lasting anthropic impact. Floristic novelties (european, national, and regional levels) for 21 taxa are reported. The extraordinary species diversity discovered (43% of flora of Rome and 20% of regional flora) is linked to the landscape heterogeneity, the characteristics of which are: (1) persistence of residual natural patches, (2) occurrence of quite well-preserved aquatic habitats and humid meadows, (3) a rich anthropogenic flora, (4) an interesting flora of archeological sites, (5) occurrence of species not common in Latium, (6) occurrence of populations of aliens in crops (which cause economic impact), (7) presence of aliens on archeological ruins (which cause economic-social impacts). The extensive set of data provided represents a general base framework for guiding future research efforts and landscape action plans consistent with environmental sustainability.

AB  - Connectivity is a vital component of metapopulation and landscape ecology, influencing fundamental processes such as population dynamics, evolution, and community responses to climate change. Here, we review ongoing developments in connectivity science, providing perspectives on recent advances in identifying, quantifying, modelling and analysing connectivity, and highlight new applications for conservation. We also address ongoing challenges for connectivity research, explore opportunities for addressing them and highlight potential linkages with other fields of research. Continued development of connectivity science will provide insights into key aspects of ecology and the evolution of species, and will also contribute significantly towards achieving more effective conservation outcomes.

AB  - The world is rapidly urbanizing, and many previously biodiverse areas are now mostly composed of impervious surface. This loss of natural habitat causes local bird communities to become dominated by urban dweller and urban utilizer species and reduces the amount of habitat available for migrating and breeding birds. Green roofs can increase green space in urban landscapes, potentially providing new habitat for wildlife. We surveyed birds and arthropods, an important food source for birds, on green roofs and nearby comparable conventional (non-green) roofs in New York City during spring migration and summer breeding seasons. We predicted that green roofs would have a greater abundance and richness of both birds and arthropods than conventional roofs during both migration and the breeding season for birds. Furthermore, we predicted we would find more urban avoider and urban utilizer bird species on green roofs than conventional roofs. We found that both birds and arthropods were more abundant and rich on green roofs than conventional roofs. In addition, green roofs hosted more urban avoider and utilizer bird species than conventional roofs. Our study shows that birds use green roofs as stopover habitat during migration and as foraging habitat during the breeding season. Establishing green roofs in urban landscapes increases the amount of habitat available for migrating and breeding birds and can partially mitigate the loss of habitat due to increasing urbanization.

AB  - Landscape fragmentation due to urban development, transportation infrastructure, and agriculture poses a threat to environmental integrity. There is a need to quantify the level of landscape fragmentation in an ecologically meaningful way for inclusion in planning and decision-making. Effective mesh size (m(eff)) is an ecologically relevant metric that quantifies landscape fragmentation based on the probability that two randomly chosen points in a region are located in the same non-fragmented patch. We investigated variation in meff measured by transportation districts, municipal counties, and six spatial levels of watersheds within the state of California. Four fragmentation geometries were developed by overlaying highways, roads, urbanized areas, agricultural areas, and natural fragmenting features. Two m(eff) calculation methods were compared: one where planning unit boundaries fragment the landscape (CUT), the other allowing for cross-boundary connections (CBC). The CUT procedure always produced lower m(eff) values than CBC, with greater differences occurring in smaller planning units, confirming the bias introduced using boundaries with landscape metrics. Calculated m(eff) values varied from 0 to 20 885 km(2) across 6994 units in California. Roads contributed the most to fragmentation, while agriculture contributed little, as California's agricultural areas are already heavily fragmented by roads. This paper provides a systematic, quantitative, and intuitive method for transportation, land use and environmental planners to analyze cumulative impacts of multiple fragmenting features across a range of spatial scales within a variety of planning units. This approach could be used for analyzing the impact of future land development scenarios, and integrated into regional planning processes. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ponds and the adjacent green spaces are an important part of urban blue-green Infrastructure (BGI) and contribute to a number of ecosystem services, including alleviation of flood risk, amelioration of climatic fluctuations, and improvement of runoff water quality, as well as biodiversity and amenity values. Multiple benefits associated with urban ponds have only recently started to be appreciated, and examples of in-depth interdisciplinary insights remain rare. This paper gives an account of the ecosystem services provided by Blackford Pond, a semi-natural water body located within a nature reserve and nominated as a site globally important for scientific research. Despite elevated levels of polluting substances and eutrophication, the overall species richness of the site is high and the biodiversity of the locality is enhanced by the ecotone effect. The diversity of available plant hosts and substrates appears to benefit the fungal community and the abundance of aquatic invertebrate fauna appears to benefit the higher trophic levels. Hydrological modelling clearly shows that the pond increases the flood resilience of the surrounding area, despite not having been designed as a drainage feature. The application of the Natural Capital Planning Tool (NCPT) also reveals higher values (in relation to the values of amenity grassland) of such ecosystem services categories as biodiversity (+4.76 per hectare), aesthetic values (+4.67), flood risk regulation (+0.41), air quality (+0.28), local (+0.6) and global (+0.14) climate regulations. The discussion highlights a number of trade-offs among different ecosystem services (e.g. water quality vs. diatom research value, flood resilience vs. air quality and carbon capture, biodiversity of ectomycorrhizal vs. lichenised fungi), and considers which of the multiple benefits provided by the site may have not been fully reflected in NCPT calculations or the economic estimates obtained using contingent valuation (e.g. effects on hydrology, water quality, wildlife corridors, education and research value). The simultaneous consideration of biodiversity, hydrology, water chemistry and amenity, education, research and other values presented in this paper contributes towards a better understanding of the ecology and overall functioning of urban ponds, and helps to increase appreciation of their benefits and promote their public acceptability and further implementation.

AB  - Human-mediated dispersal along the road network is a crucial process in the population dynamics of roadside vegetation and during plant invasions. The potential for a species to be dispersed by vehicles is, however, difficult to quantify. The predictive power of categorical classification schemes of human-mediated dispersal is limited as many species that are usually attributed to particular primary dispersal vectors may become subject to very different secondary dispersal vectors owing to human activity. Analysing seed traits that promote seed transport by human dispersal vectors could overcome these limitations. However, the analysis has to account for the divergent chance of seed transport that results from different propagule pressures along the transport corridor.
   To reveal the effects of seed traits and their interplay with propagule pressure on the chance and magnitude of human-mediated dispersal by vehicles, we compared traits and regional frequencies of a set of species that were dispersed by vehicles to a control set not dispersed but present in the same study area. We then used the same traits for a comparison of intentionally and unintentionally introduced species with the flora of Berlin.
   Different traits influenced the chance of vehicle dispersal and its magnitude. While propagule pressure was most important for determining the magnitude of seed transport, small seed mass and size best predicted the absolute chance of species dispersal by vehicles. The dispersal of nonnative species was least dependent on propagule pressure.
   Seed traits that were important in vehicle dispersal were similarly reflected in unintentionally introduced species in the Berlin flora. Mean seed size of these species was lower compared to the entire Berlin flora, whereas it was higher for intentionally introduced species. This suggests that unintentional introduction of nonnative plant species pre-selects for seed traits that promote further spread by human-mediated adhesive dispersal.
   Probability and magnitude of adhesive seed transport by vehicles can be predicted by dispersal-related plant traits. However, the effect size of plant traits on dispersal strongly depends on regional propagule pressure. This highlights the need to analyse interactions between species traits and propagule pressure.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the key landscape structures of migratory bird habitats that affect abundance of migratory birds to promote resilient coastal green infrastructure planning on the Yellow Sea coast. We classified coastal areas into four watersheds of South Korea and conducted multivariate regression analysis between migratory bird populations and landscape structures including total class area (CA), patch area distribution (MN), patch density (PD), and edge density (ED). At the national level, sandbank MN, sandbank CA, water ED, and grasslands were derived as key landscape structures affecting the abundance of migratory birds. At the watershed level, key landscape structures were determined as follows: Urban area_MN for the Han River watershed, rice paddy MN for the Asan watershed, rice paddy CA for Saemangeum, and grassland MN for the Youngsan River watershed. Considering the multifunctionality, redundancy, and connectivity of the resilience strategy, we provide specific coastal infrastructure planning recommendations at the national and watershed scales.

AB  - To be effective in promoting the conservation of migratory wildlife, recipients of payment for ecosystem services (PES) most be willing to accept payment along the entire migratory corridor. This paper investigates spatial variation in willingness to accept. (WTA) payments made by the Wildlife Conservation Lease Program in the Athi-Kaputiei plains of Kenya. The program, designed as an incentive to keep land open for wildlife and livestock, offers land owners 10 US$ per ha per year, irrespective of location. We model the relation between WTA and distances to roads, towns and rivers, annual precipitation arid slope and display the predicted spatial variation in WTA. The results reveal significant spatial variation in willingness to accept payments for availing land for conservation, with higher WTA concentrated away from roads and also in the Southeast of the plains. The results further suggest that wildlife movement will be blocked due to low WTA in the proximity of towns and tarmacked roads. We conclude that an effective strategy to keep the land open for migratory wildlife should consider spatial variation in WTA payment for land lease. It is suggested to consider stratifying the lease rates geographically to reflect the underlying spatial variation in WTA. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Landscape-level variables operating at multiple spatial scales likely influence wetland amphibian assemblages but have not been investigated in detail. We examined the significance of habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as selected within-wetland conditions, affecting amphibian assemblages in twenty-one glacial marshes. Wetlands were located within urban and agricultural regions of central and southwestern Minnesota, USA and were distributed across two ecoregions: tallgrass prairie and northern hardwood forest. We surveyed amphibian assemblages and used a geographic information system to quantify land-use variables at three scales: 500, 1000, and 2500 m. Ten species of amphibians were detected, the most abundant being Rana pipiens, Ambystoma tigrinum, and Bufo americanus. Amphibian species richness was lower with greater wetland isolation and road density at all spatial scales in both ecoregions. Amphibian species richness also had a negative relationship with the proportion of urban land-use at all spatial scales in the hardwood forest ecoregion, and species richness was greater in wetlands with fish and Ambystoma tigrinum. These biotic relationships are less consistent and more difficult to interpret than are land-use relationships. The data presented here suggest that decreases in landscape connectivity via fragmentation and habitat loss can affect amphibian assemblages, and reversing those landscape changes should be an important part of a regional conservation strategy.

AB  - ContextAlthough the edge effect is known to be an important factor influencing the recruitment of trees in temperate forests, little is known of its synergistic relationships with landscape and fragment attributes.ObjectivesWe investigated how the edge effect on regeneration of oaks (Quercus spp.) varies with respect to fragment geometry, connectivity and landscape composition.MethodsWe recorded oak sapling density along edge-interior gradients in 29 forest fragments at the periphery of Mexico City and examined the data with Generalized Additive Models.ResultsA nonlinear and landscape-mediated edge effect was supported by data, including the interactions of the edge distance with patch connectivity, shape and size. Saplings were more abundant at a distance of ca. 50m from the edge of small, large and connected patches, but large patches also exhibited reduced recruitment towards the interior of the patch. Conversely, sapling density in simple-shaped or connected patches was lower at the edge, exhibiting linear and concave-down increase trends towards the interior of patches, respectively.ConclusionsBoundary conditions could be interacting with interior forest conditions, making regeneration more frequent at 50m from the edge. Shady and cooler sites in large patches may be inhibiting oak regeneration. The activity of acorn-dispersing animals and oak predators may increase in unconnected patches, thus increasing the likelihood of edge effects. These results provide insights into the restoration of temperate forest patches in heterogeneous fragmented landscapes.

AB  - The rates at which sediment from the landscape is recruited to channel networks reflect lateral geomorphic connectivity and have significant implications for biophysical river systems. By strongly influencing sediment supply regime, such inputs control the dynamics and characteristics of the channel as well as the associated habitat and biota. The main objective of this research was to disentangle the relative importance of geomorphic and biological factors which define spatial patterns in lateral connectivity by promoting or restricting bank erosion, avulsions, and slope failures. Focusing on a forested, formerly glaciated mountain basin in the interior Pacific Northwest, wecombined extensive field surveys with remote sensing data (LiDAR, aerial imagery) to obtainmetrics representing this complex suite of landscape characteristics. The interpretation of evidence yielded by correlations between these variables, a regime model, and qualitative observations, suggest that, at a multi-decadal timescale between major landscape disturbances, lateral connectivity patterns in Sullivan Creek may be, to a large extent, governed by a combination of biotic factors and glacial legacies. In particular, forest canopy metrics were key predictors of hillslope stability as well as bank and valley floor resistance, suggesting a pivotal influence of root reinforcement. On the other hand, instream large wood abundance was closely related to channel splitting, which reflects its role in promoting channel avulsions. More extensive bank erosion in reaches dominated by drift deposits appeared to indicate glacial legacies. Furthermore, a strong association between bank erosion and colluvial inputs suggested a close coupling within the channel-hillslope system. Lateral confinement - defined as the proportion of the channel length abutting against bedrock, terraces, fans and roads - was negatively associated with channel braiding; the relationships linking confinement with bank erosion and the magnitude of colluvial inputs (negative and positive association, respectively) were relatively weak. Taken together, findings emerging from this research suggest that better understanding of lateral geomorphic connectivity patterns in mountain river basins similar to our study site requires that both channel processes and broader, biophysical landscape system be considered.

AB  - Understanding the link between species traits and how they use various elements in a heterogeneous agro-natural landscape is essential for conservation planning. Land-use and season affect the availability of resources for herbivorous insects such as grasshoppers. Also, the level at which these herbivores utilise these resources on the landscape depend on their traits. We focus here on the Cape Floristic Region biodiversity hotspot, which is rich in both endemic plants and narrow-range grasshoppers. We assessed dispersion patterns and abundance of the grasshopper species across the agro-natural mosaic, while specifically focusing on species traits and how they change over two seasons (spring and summer). We found that land-use and species traits played major roles in grasshopper spatial dispersion across the landscape, with season a highly significant variable. Not surprisingly, highly mobile, generalist feeders were abundant and widely dispersed across the landscape. Importantly however, this was especially the case in late season, when they could take advantage of high plant productivity in the vineyards. In contrast, low mobility, specialist feeders were limited to occupying only natural fynbos vegetation in both seasons. Generally, the highly mobile generalists benefitted in two ways: occupation of transformed areas, and receiving a population boost late season. This was not the case for the low-mobility specialists, which were doubly disadvantaged: not able to move far, and lacking their specific host plants in the transformed areas. From a conservation perspective, our results indicate the importance of improving functional connectivity using natural fynbos for conservation of the endemic specialists, while the generalists can largely look after themselves across this agro-natural mosaic.

AB  - The conversion of natural areas to human-dominated land uses results in loss, degradation, and fragmentation of wildlife habitat which often lead to species endangerment and local extinction. The risk of endangerment may be particularly acute for species that exist as metapopulations in which viability of the species is contingent upon dispersal of individuals among local sub-populations. This paper uses an optimization framework to investigate the problem of conserving metapopulations residing in areas at the urban-rural fringe. We compare the optimal allocation of preservation to outcomes of four other policy alternatives including the reserve-site-selection option that fully preserves habitat patches while allowing full development of the intervening dispersal matrix. In general, the optimal allocation includes some amount of preservation in both habitat patches and dispersal matrix, with the level of protection typically greater in habitat patches. The reserve-site-selection conservation option is optimal in only a few cases. Heterogeneity in terms of land use and landscape structure adds complexity to the optimal solution such that no one policy works well across all land units and in situations where the landscape structure is skewed, full protection of some land units and full development of others becomes more common.

AB  - Genetic data are increasingly used to describe the structure of wildlife populations and to infer landscape influences on functional connectivity. To accomplish this, genetic structure can be described with a multitude of methods that vary in their assumptions, advantages and limitations. While some methods discriminate distinct subpopulations separated by sharp genetic boundaries (i.e. barrier detection or clustering methods), other methods estimate gradient genetic structures using individual-based genetic distances. We present an analytical framework based on individual ancestry values that combines these different approaches and can be used to a) test for local barriers to gene flow and b) evaluate effects of landscape gradients through individual-based genetic distances that account for hierarchical genetic structure. We illustrate the approach with a data set of 371 cougars Puma concolor from a 217 000 km(2) study area in Idaho and western Montana (USA) that were genotyped at 12 microsatellite loci. Results suggest that cougars in the region show a complex, hierarchical genetic structure that is influenced by a local barrier to gene flow (an urban population cluster connected by high traffic volumes), different landscape features (the Snake River Plain, forested habitat), and geographic distance. Our novel approach helped to elucidate the relative influence of these factors on different hierarchical levels of population structure, which was not possible when using either clustering methods or standard genetic distances. Results obtained with our analytical framework highlight the need for multi-scale management of cougars in the region and show that landscape heterogeneity can create complex genetic structures, even in generalist species with high dispersal capabilities.

AB  - 1. Spatially explicit landscape models have revealed the importance of spatial arrangement of habitat patches in the behaviour of mobile organisms. Such models fail to account for creation and destruction of habitat, which may interrupt the movement of slowly migrating species such as forest herbs.
   2. To explore the interaction of habitat turnover and population migration, we present a dynamic landscape model inhabited by a dispersing species. The landscape is represented as a square lattice in which individual cells may be either habitat or non-habitat, and a hypothetical species may spread among habitat cells. Rate of species spread, habitat frequency and habitat clearance and regeneration are allowed to vary.
   3. In static landscapes, the fraction of the landscape occupied by the species is limited by connectivity among habitat patches and rate of population migration. Slow species often cannot reach all available habitat despite the presence of continuous paths to it.
   4. In dynamic landscapes, slow-moving species show reduced map-scale frequency and high risk of extinction due to the cumulative effects of habitat patch destruction and the failure to colonize newly created habitat. Such species decline cannot be predicted based on static descriptions of habitat connectivity or migration rate.
   5. Fast-moving species may be reduced in dynamic landscapes by the cumulative effect of numerous local isolation events. Fast-moving species may also experience a modest range expansion in low-connectivity landscapes due to the cumulative effects of short-lived patch adjacency.
   6. These results suggest a novel mechanism that could account for species impoverishment in fragmented landscapes. They emphasize the importance of maintaining habitat connectivity on a time-scale that accommodates slow-migrating species such as forest herbs.

AB  - Large tracts of natural habitat are being replaced by agriculture and urban sprawl in Mediterranean regions worldwide. We have limited knowledge about the effects of human activities on native species in these landscapes and which, if any, management practices might enhance the conservation of native biodiversity within them. Through a citizen volunteer bird-monitoring project, we compared bird abundance and species richness in northern Californian riparian zones surrounded by vineyards, urban areas, and natural areas. We assessed both local and landscape-level variables that may enhance native bird diversity in each land use type. We also demonstrate a new statistical approach, generalized estimating equations, to analyze highly variable data, such as that collected by volunteers. Avian abundance was highly correlated with both landscape context and local habitat variables, while avian richness was correlated with local habitat variables, specifically shrub richness, and percent of tree cover. In particular, shrub species richness has a strong positive correlation with riparian-preferring bird species. This suggests that active local management of riparian zones in human-dominated landscapes can increase our ability to retain native bird species in these areas.

AB  - Simple Summary The Far-Eastern Himalayan Landscape, a global biodiversity hotspot spread across parts of India, Myanmar, and China, holds great potential for the long-term conservation of tiger populations. National-level efforts aimed at tiger conservation, such as the creation of protected areas, have been critical for the survival of key tiger populations. However, for tigers to continue to survive into the future, it is important that these key populations remain connected with each other, particularly in this transboundary landscape. This requires greater regional and cross-border co-operation in conservation research, monitoring, and planning to protect habitats and corridors. Here, we review and synthesize the available literature on two decades of conservation efforts aimed at the study and conservation of tigers, their co-predators, and prey in the landscape to understand research trends, identify knowledge gaps, and suggest priority areas for future research and conservation interventions. This review could be useful for formulating conservation plans and actions that could help in the recovery of tiger populations; for identifying, restoring, and securing connectivity between key tiger habitats; and for addressing other key threats, such as habitat loss, poaching, and trade in wildlife parts. Addressing the effects of human-caused habitat destruction on free-ranging threatened large carnivores requires actions that go 'beyond borders' in conserving and protecting their habitat and prey base. In this review, we compiled information from available literature on 20 years of conservation efforts aimed at tigers, co-predators, and their prey in the Far-Eastern Himalayan Landscape that is situated at the confluence of three global biodiversity hotspots covering parts of India, Myanmar, and China. The vast area of the proven biodiversity-rich forested landscape is highly suitable for long-term survival of carnivores, such as tigers. Habitat loss, ritual hunting, commercial exploitation, and poaching are the prevailing threats that have resulted in low tiger, co-predator, and prey population densities. Studies suggest that tiger presence is confined to a few areas, while other tiger populations have been extirpated across most parts of the landscape. Past research also suggests that the landscape holds low abundance of diverse prey species richness (n = 22), and urgent conservation measures are required to improve their habitat and numbers. This calls for greater regional and transboundary co-operation on research and knowledge sharing, conservation awareness programs for locals, and cross-border co-operation on wildlife monitoring. Strict policies are also required to enable PA managers to develop strategic plans to conserve large predators and protect their habitats and corridors.

AB  - In 1996, a coalition of diverse and determined organizations launched a new initiative in the Chicago region. Our vision? Chicago Wilderness: a thriving mosaic of natural areas, connected by greenways and wildlife corridors, embedded in the nation's third largest metropolis. In this vision, the region's human communities reclaim a cultural tradition of protecting and restoring the globally outstanding natural communities that enrich our lives. Today, more than 170 organizations join forces to transform this vision into reality. A regional biodiversity recovery plan, the result of 3 years of assessment and planning by scientists, land managers, educators, and policy strategists, sets priorities and determines the lines of action for the coalition. This regional agenda stems from our vision and recovery goals for each ecological community; it encourages targeted research initiatives that focus on characterizing our native biological diversity and on analyzing elements critical to its recovery. Ultimately, though, the long-term survival of our natural wealth rests on the support from the public. Although the challenges to conservation educators and communicators are many, Chicago Wilderness allows us to work together in understanding our audiences, channeling our resources, and creating novel approaches to engage the widest public in our conservation efforts.

AB  - Presence of the Slender-footed Tyrannulet, Zimmerius gracilipes (Birds: Tyrannidae) in urban areas in the Metropolitan Area of Recife, State of Pernambuco, Brazil. We recorded the Slender-footed Tyrannulet in several urban parks and woodlots in the cities of Recife and Olinda, northeastern Brazil, between 2004 and 2006. All those areas are relatively close to Atlantic Forest fragments. We observed that the species is common in some of those places, apparently being well adapted to urban environments with abundant tree cover. This might be interpreted as an indication that such wooded places work as ecological corridors for this species, connecting forest fragments.

AB  - Edges are ecologically important environmental features and have been well researched in agricultural and urban landscapes. However, little work has been conducted in flammable ecosystems where spatially and temporally dynamic fire edges are expected to influence important processes such as recolonization of burnt areas and landscape connectivity. We review the literature on fire, fauna, and edge effects to summarize current knowledge of faunal responses to fire edges and identify knowledge gaps. We then develop a conceptual model to predict faunal responses to fire edges and present an agenda for future research. Faunal abundance at fire edges changes over time, but patterns depend on species traits and resource availability. Responses are also influenced by edge architecture (e.g., size and shape), site and landscape context, and spatial scale. However, data are limited and the influence of fire edges on both local abundance and regional distributions of fauna is largely unknown. In our conceptual model, biophysical properties interact with the fire regime (e.g., patchiness, frequency) to influence edge architecture. Edge architecture and species traits influence edge permeability, which is linked to important processes such as movement, resource selection, and species interactions. Predicting the effect of fire edges on fauna is challenging, but important for biodiversity conservation in flammable landscapes. Our conceptual model combines several drivers of faunal fire responses (biophysical properties, regime attributes, species traits) and will therefore lead to improved predictions. Future research is needed to understand fire as an agent of edge creation; the spatio-temporal flux of fire edges across landscapes; and the effect of fire edges on faunal movement, resource selection, and biotic interactions. To aid the incorporation of new data into our predictive framework, our model has been designed as a Bayesian Network, a statistical tool capable of analyzing complex environmental relationships, dealing with data gaps, and generating testable hypotheses.

TI  - THE RAVINES OF PUEBLA CITY, MEXICO: AN UNTAPPED RESOURCE IN A METROPOLIS WITH A DEFICIT OF GREEN AREAS
T2  - INTERCIENCIA
LA  - Spanish
AB  - International organizations recommend a minimum green area per person in urban facilities, as well as the areas being no more than 15 min walk from home. The city of Puebla, Mexico, does not comply with these recommendations, as it has only 2.8 m(2) per capita of green areas and a highly heterogeneous distribution. Within the urban sprawl there is no space to enable green areas since everything is occupied by buildings. However, there is a system of ravines that crisscrosses the city and, if it is revalued and recovered, can help to reduce this deficiency. The ravines are geographical depressions caused by volcanic activity and water erosion of the rainwater drains of the La Malinche mountain. They are currently used as open-air sewers, garbage dumps, irregular human settlement sites and some of them have been filled. However, such spaces provide ecosystem services to the city, such as being ecological corridors where native flora and fauna find refuge. Hence the need to develop lines of research and a comprehensive policy of recovery and management of ravines, in order to enhance their services such as becoming new green areas.

AB  - Prior to the arrival of Dutch elm disease to the United States in 1930, American elm (Ulmus americana) had become one of the most beloved and commonly planted urban trees throughout the country, especially in the Northeastern United States. The trees were revered for their beauty, hardiness, and the corridor-like shade provided to city streets. Syracuse, NY stands as an example of this popularity: in 1951, when the disease first arrived in the city, over 50,000 elms grew in the city. But over the course of twenty years, nearly all elms in the city had become infected and succumbed to the disease. Although efforts to control the fungus in Syracuse ultimately failed to stop elm loss, the case study can be used to better inform contemporary urban forest management practices today by highlighting the effects of mixed property ownership in cities and its effects on pest management.

AB  - Farming, including family farming, is now dominated by vertically controlled operations that deplete the soil, pollute water, and produce food designed more to satisfy marketing requirements than human nutritional needs. Agricultural practices today are a result of abdicating control over our lives to a thoroughly industrialized culture, in which institutions are governed by the single criterion of efficiency--finding least-cost solutions. Standardization is a major part of that process. But living systems cannot be standardized. They require diversity and some degree of redundancy to adapt to changing environmental conditions. In the cultural contest between the machine and the garden, the machine has definitely won, but if we do not make room for the garden again, our victory will be our own funeral. New Agrarianism seeks to encourage diversity of species on each farm and across farms within entire landscapes. But farmers cannot carry out the restoration of ecologically-oriented agriculture on their own. They need support from cities: 1) in the form of markets to sell locally-grown produce at prices that will support their work, 2) in a new understanding of ecosystems that focuses on inhabited spaces and not just wilderness, and 3) in an orientation that questions whether efficiency should be the paramount value of our culture. Finally, the transition to more biologically-diverse human settlements can come about only if economic incentives are modified to remove the unrelenting pressure on farmers to expand their operations or go out of business.

AB  - We reviewed literature describing the potential for freshwater anthropogenic waterbodies to act as refuges from disturbance. We identified research related to the refuge potential of a wide range of waterbodies, using waterbody names as keywords along with 'artificial' and 'freshwater'. Potential freshwater anthropogenic refuges were more often standing than running waters. Agricultural ponds, rural and urban drainage ditches and transport canals were the most diverse for all aquatic taxa, whereas irrigation infrastructure was least diverse. Comparatively little is known about the refuge role of fire dams, urban artificial ponds, golf course lakes, disused industrial ponds and retaining walls. Local-scale attributes associated with high biodiversity were: presence of macrophytes (for animals), absence of fish (for amphibians, invertebrates), natural bed materials and hydroperiod (all biota). Landscape variables associated with high biodiversity were proximity to and connectivity with other waterbodies and to natural terrestrial vegetation. Moderate levels of management intervention were also associated with higher biodiversity. Many knowledge gaps about the function of anthropogenic refuges within landscapes exist and require further research. One of the most important limitations to the provision of refuges for freshwater biodiversity by anthropogenic waterbodies is the lack of recognition of their actual or potential biodiversity value. Anthropogenic waterbodies need to be recognised for their potential to support biodiversity conservation and climate change adaptation for freshwater species, while being managed to prevent the spread of invasive species.

AB  - The impact of traditional even-aged forest management on landscape age structure, tree composition, and connectivity has been well documented. Very little, however, is known about the impact on stand structural diversity. This study aims to compare the structural and abiotic characteristics of forest stands disturbed by clearcut logging and by stand-replacing fire in Quebec's boreal landscapes. We hypothesized that unlike fire, logging specifically targeted stands having a higher economic value, i.e., merchantable volume, leaving altered forest characteristics on post-harvested landscapes. We compared two aerial forest surveys of a 2200 km(2) study area, one survey completed before any logging activity (preindustrial survey; 1980s), and the second survey collected > 10 years after logging activity (modern survey; 2000s). Forest stands at the time of the preindustrial survey were primary forests. We identified stands as either burned, logged, or left aside after forest management of the area (remaining stands) between the two surveys and compared their structural and abiotic characteristics using logistic regression. The structural and abiotic characteristics of burned and logged stands differed significantly. Relative to the burned stands, logged stands were older, denser, and marked by poorer drainage and a higher proportion of black spruce; therefore post-harvest and post-burn landscapes differed in terms of their structural diversities. Traditional even-aged forest management has significantly altered the boreal forest landscape by targeting specific stands having higher economic value and leaving behind stands of lower economic value. Remaining high economic stands should be protected, and a more balanced approach to harvesting must be used in the context of ecosystem-based management.

AB  - Intra-city natural structures have always had a key role in creating sustainable urban greenspaces. Adapting to natural features and relating the intra-city greenspaces to such natural structures as river-valleys, hillsides, lakes and forests, guarantee the endurance, sustainability and longevity of the natural quality of city. This paper looks at intra-city natural structures which have undergone wholesale changes and been ruined, and considers the lives of these invaluable natural structures which have been endangered due to gross human interference and pressure, regardless of physical and biological features. River-valleys in Tehran have always had a significant role in offering valuable bio-environmental services to the city From the time of Qadjar era, villages enjoying favorable climate were built outside the city, and the villa of the governors and affluent people were built near hillsides across river-valleys because of the abundance of running water, cool weather in the summer and natural plant life. Little by little green corridors of Shemiranat were built near river-valleys, which formed the axes of the development of the city at the time Pahlavi dynasty. From then, the development of the city towards hillsides, regardless of these natural structures, increased and the destruction of these urban natural spaces have posed serious problems nowadays. Familiarity with these natural structures, their preservation and organization, and making the optimum use of them seem to be a very critical issue. Taking an ecological approach in this paper, is an attempt to look at the intra-city river-valleys. To do so, the data collected from a natural river-valley is used as evidence to back up any claims made in this regard.

AB  - Spatially explicit urban forest carbon estimation provides a baseline map for understanding the variation in forest vertical structure, informing sustainable forest management and urban planning. While high resolution remote sensing has proven promising for carbon mapping in highly fragmented urban landscapes, data cost and availability are the major obstacle prohibiting accurate, consistent, and repeated measurement of forest carbon pools in cities. This study aims to evaluate the uncertainties of forest carbon estimation in response to the combined impacts of remote sensing data resolution and neighborhood spatial patterns in Charlotte, North Carolina. The remote sensing data for carbon mapping were resampled to a range of resolutions, i.e., LiDAR point cloud density - 5.8, 4.6, 2.3, and 1.2 pt s/m(2), aerial optical NAIP (National Agricultural Imagery Program) imagery - 1, 5, 10, and 20 m. Urban spatial patterns were extracted to represent area, shape complexity, dispersion/interspersion, diversity, and connectivity of landscape patches across the residential neighborhoods with built-up densities from low, medium-low, medium-high, to high. Through statistical analyses, we found that changing remote sensing data resolution introduced noticeable uncertainties (variation) in forest carbon estimation at the neighborhood level. Higher uncertainties were caused by the change of LiDAR point density (causing 8.7 -11.0% of variation) than changing NAIP image resolution (causing 6.2-8.6% of variation). For both LiDAR and NAIP, urban neighborhoods with a higher degree of anthropogenic disturbance unveiled a higher level of uncertainty in carbon mapping. However, LiDAR-based results were more likely to be affected by landscape patch connectivity, and the NAIP-based estimation was found to be significantly influenced by the complexity of patch shape.

AB  - High-resolution animal movement data are becoming increasingly available, yet having a multitude of empirical trajectories alone does not allow us to easily predict animal movement. To answer ecological and evolutionary questions at a population level, quantitative estimates of a species' potential to link patches or populations are of importance.
   We introduce an approach that combines movement-informed simulated trajectories with an environment-informed estimate of the trajectories' plausibility to derive connectivity. Using the example of bar-headed geese we estimated migratory connectivity at a landscape level throughout the annual cycle in their native range.
   We used tracking data of bar-headed geese to develop a multi-state movement model and to estimate temporally explicit habitat suitability within the species' range. We simulated migratory movements between range fragments, and calculated a measure we called route viability. The results are compared to expectations derived from published literature.
   Simulated migrations matched empirical trajectories in key characteristics such as stopover duration. The viability of the simulated trajectories was similar to that of the empirical trajectories. We found that, overall, the migratory connectivity was higher within the breeding than in wintering areas, corroborating previous findings for this species.
   We show how empirical tracking data and environmental information can be fused for meaningful predictions of animal movements throughout the year and even outside the spatial range of the available data. Beyond predicting migratory connectivity, our framework will prove useful for modelling ecological processes facilitated by animal movement, such as seed dispersal or disease ecology.

AB  - Ticks of small mammals pose a significant risk to public health but these hazards are poorly understood in the tropics due to the paucity of information on the disease ecology of ticks in these regions. Mapping and quan-tifying the diversity of small mammal/tick networks and the effects of habitat on these medically important systems is key to disease prevention. Singapore represents a microcosm of much of tropical Asia as it has a diverse, though poorly studied, community of ticks and small mammals. Singapore also has a range of terrestrial habitats exhibiting a gradient of degradation. Small mammals and their ticks were sampled across the island in four main habitat types (old secondary forest, young secondary forest, scrubland, urban) across 4.5 years. Four tick species were collected (Amblyomma helvolum, Dermacentor auratus, Haemaphysalis semermis, Ixodes gran-ulatus) from 10 small mammal species. Habitat was found to have a significant effect on both the abundance and structure of tick communities on small mammals. Old secondary forest communities had the highest tick abundance, comparatively high connectance, niche overlap (among ticks), linkage density, and were the preferred habitat of the zoonotic tick I. granulatus. Therefore, future disease spillover is likely to emerge from small mammal-tick communities in old secondary forests.

AB  - The extreme fragmentation of natural habitats due to urbanisation can influence the evolution of dispersal strategies in species persisting in cities. The brown garden snail Cornu aspersum is an anthropophilic species, capable of maintaining its populations in highly fragmented habitats despite a high cost of movement. In this species, we studied the variation of dispersal-related behaviours and traits along an urbanisation gradient characterised at two biologically relevant spatial scales (10 and 50 m), in order to identify the effects of habitat fragmentation on movement. The olfactory perceptual range was low, between 1 and 2.5 m, meaning that snails should perceive a large range of landscapes as fragmented. In line with previous results, subadults were more prone to explore than adults in the least urbanised populations. The boundary-crossing behaviour of subadults was not affected by urbanisation, while exploration propensity of adult snails increased with urbanisation at the 50 m (long-distance dispersal) scale, to reach subadult levels in more urban sites. Foot mass (a correlate of movement speed) and perceptual range were not affected by urbanisation. These results are interpreted in relation to the different levels of competition snails are likely to experience in different environments, the high risk of local extinction in urban fragmented landscapes, and the available opportunities for reproduction. They indicate that benefits of dispersal still need to be considered even in situations where movement costs are extremely important. The maintenance of relatively high mobility and its extension to the adult stage in response to anthropogenic changes may thus play a major role in the success of Cornu aspersum in urban habitats.

AB  - Agroforestry is an alternative kind of land use where the native vegetation is surrounded or intercalated by crops of economic interest. This system may maintain species richness by promoting the habitat heterogeneity or serving as ecological corridors. The aim of this study was to describe the gastrointestinal helminth fauna and to analyse the parasitological parameters of the helminth communities of six sigmodontine rodents in a cocoa agroforestry system in the municipality of Ilheus, state of Bahia, Northeast Brazil. This is a novel study of helminth fauna in this kind of agroforestry. Rodents were captured in live-traps and euthanised for helminth recovery. Specimens were counted and identified to the species level whenever possible. Helminth abundance, intensity, and prevalence were calculated for each species and each host. The total abundance and prevalence of helminths were compared among localities and three attributes of the host: species, gender and age using generalised linear models. Considering all rodents, 52.14% of them were parasitised with at least one helminth species. Eight nematode species were identified and another seven morphospecies were identified to the genus level. The most abundant species were Hassalstrongylus epsilon, Stilestrongylus eta, Guerrerostrongylus zetta, and Syphacia alata. The opportunistic host species Oligoryzomys nigripes and Akodon cursor, besides the water rat Nectomys squamipes, were the most infected species for helminth parasites. Hylaeamys seuanezi was also an important host with the highest helminth species richness. This is the first report of the helminth fauna for this host. The locality most distant from the native vegetation and closest to the city had the highest helminth prevalence and mean species richness. The species richness in the helminth communities of Euryoryzomys russatus, N. squamipes and O. nigripes in these Cabruca agroforestries were within the range found in studies carried out in Atlantic Forest areas.

AB  - The physical structure and the identity of the city are formed over a long period of time. The best examples reflecting the spatial and structural characters are, without doubt, the historical city centers. Today, these historical areas, which are under rapid construction and population pressure, are becoming less perceptible and their relationship with the whole city is gradually decreasing. This research aims to reveal the value of accessibility by examining the change in Trabzon Kaleici and its immediate surroundings in the process since its establishment. In this respect, the present maps containing different periods of the city were used as a base, and maps showing integration levels and topological accessibility were created. By comparing these maps, the change in the accessibility level of the historical city center over time was revealed. At the end of the study, it was determined that the relation of the historical city center to the whole city decreased and the street network formed over the years negatively affected the access to the historical city center.

AB  - One of the greatest challenges for Latin America and the Caribbean, the most biologically and culturally diverse region in the world, is to halt the loss of species caused by habitat destruction and land degradation. Up to now, setting aside protected natural areas is considered the most effective alternative to conserve biodiversity. Protected areas. however, are under increasing assault by agricultural. silvicultural, and industrial development that surround and isolate them, reducing their habitat quality at the landscape scale. Among the different types of protected areas that have been proposed, biosphere reserves stand out for their attempt to compatibilize social development and conservation. Their management is the most amenable to integration of natural and human disturbance, inclusion of traditional management techniques, and participation by social and economic sectors in the administration. Biosphere reserves have proliferated all over the world, and today there are 53 1 of them located in 105 countries. where they protect vast ecological and Cultural diversity. Even though the design of biosphere reserves is based on the landscape concept. it has vet to take into account ecosystem scales, possible long-term effects of disturbances, and better integrate and give higher consideration to the knowledge and experience of numerous ethnic groups that live within them. However, doing so requires a transformation of the function of the core, buffer. and transition areas. The Current design of biosphere reserves is centripetal because the main function of the buffer zone is to protect biodiversity in the core. We propose a centrifugal model. where biodiversity of the core spreads freely toward the area of greater human influence with the buffer zone functioning as a connector. This connectivity can promote land-use practices that are in alignment with both ecosystems functioning and biodiversity conservation in natural. semi-natural. urban and industrial landscapes.

AB  - Background and Research One noteworthy element found throughout the tropical anthropogenic mosaic is the live fence, which is established within agricultural matrices and its structure within the landscape retains ecological processes, but few are recognized as elements of biological and cultural conservation. Methods In this study, we have researched plant diversity and anthropic management of live fences in five sites surrounded by contrasting vegetation references: Tropical evergreen forest; tropical deciduous forest; cloud forest; and pine-oak and pine forests. We recorded the type of management by interviews with peasants. We established thirty 2 x 50 m transects within each site and sampled two strata: trees and saplings. Also, we documented seed dispersal mechanism, life form, local use, and origin of each species. Importance Value Index and diversity metrics were estimated for each site. Results 253 plant species were registered (181 genera/74 families). While fences associated with the tropical deciduous forest showed the greatest species richness (109 species), the pine forest fences showed the lowest richness (21 species). Zoochory was the main type of seed dispersal mechanism. Conclusions Independent to the site and the altitude, the configuration of living fences is structured by three processes: the selection of the initial trees, the availability of the arrival of zoochory species, and the tolerance of the owners for the plant species. Implications for Conservation Based on our results, live fences can be considered important tools for landscape management in Mexico.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are the major causes of biodiversity loss, and, increasingly, habitat is fragmented by urbanization. Yet, the degree to which urbanization creates barriers to animal dispersal remains poorly understood. We used population genetic techniques to determine whether urbanization and/or natural landscape features are dispersal barriers to a butterfly, Atrytonopsis new species 1, throughout its range on coastal sand dunes that are increasingly threatened by development. Using AFLP markers that produced 89 polymorphic loci, we found significant population structure across the range of Atrytonopsis sp1. We found no indication that existing levels of urbanization were barriers to Atrytonopsis sp1 dispersal. Rather, two natural barriers, an ocean inlet and maritime forest, explained the genetic structure. Even in areas with long histories of urbanization, we found no significant isolation-by-distance relationship, and there was very low genetic differentiation between sampling locations. Consequently, conservation strategies for Atrytonopsis sp1, and potentially for other mobile insects that use open-structured habitats, should not focus explicitly on habitat corridors through urban areas, but rather should seek to preserve and restore as much habitat as possible across the butterfly's range.

AB  - Urban development has major impacts on connectivity among wildlife populations and is thus likely an important factor shaping pathogen transmission in wildlife. However, most investigations of wildlife diseases in urban areas focus on prevalence and infection risk rather than potential effects of urbanization on transmission itself. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a directly transmitted retrovirus that infects many felid species and can be used as a model for studying pathogen transmission at landscape scales. We investigated phylogenetic relationships among FIV isolates sampled from five bobcat (Lynx rufus) populations in coastal southern California that appear isolated due to major highways and dense urban development. Divergence dates among FIV phylogenetic lineages in several cases reflected historical urban growth and construction of major highways. We found strong FIV phylogeographic structure among three host populations north-west of Los Angeles, largely coincident with host genetic structure. In contrast, relatively little FIV phylogeographic structure existed among two genetically distinct host populations south-east of Los Angeles. Rates of FIV transfer among host populations did not vary significantly, with the lack of phylogenetic structure south-east of Los Angeles unlikely to reflect frequent contemporary transmission among populations. Our results indicate that major barriers to host gene flow can also act as barriers to pathogen spread, suggesting potentially reduced susceptibility of fragmented populations to novel directly transmitted pathogens. Infrequent exchange of FIV among host populations suggests that populations would best be managed as distinct units in the event of a severe disease outbreak. Phylogeographic inference of pathogen transmission is useful for estimating the ability of geographic barriers to constrain disease spread and can provide insights into contemporary and historical drivers of host population connectivity.

AB  - Phytosociological research of the vegetation of Kyiv railways has been completed. Based on the analysis of 379 releves using modified TWINSPAN and PC-ORD algorithms, it was found that the syntaxonomical structure of the study area includes 7 classes (Artemisietea vulgaris, Festucetea vaginatae, Galio-Urticetea, Plantaginetea majoris, Polygono-Poetea annuae, Robinietea, Stellarietea mediae), 12 orders, 18 alliances, 35 associations, 13 derivate and basal communities. The development of vegetation in man-made habitats leads to its significant complexity. It is manifested by changes in plant associations, their fragmentation and the formation of overgrowth type coenoses dominated by individual plant species. A significant degree of synanthropization, and in particular adventization, of the studied phytocoenoses was established. The participation of highly invasive species reduces local plant diversity and destroys their floristical and phytocoenotic structure. On the other hand, fragmented railway landscapes can function as new habitats or distribution corridors for local natural species. Trends of anthropogenic changes in the vegetation of the railways of Kyiv are the transformation and reduction of areas of natural vegetation, a decrease in its productivity, as well as an increase in the number of derivate plant communities, which are the successive stages of ecosystem development. The ecological features of the vegetation of the railways of the Kyiv urban area are discussed in comparison with the ruderal vegetation outside the railways. Comparative ordination analysis of these phytocoenoses shows that communities on the railways develop in extreme conditions of ecotopes poor on soil moisture and nitrogen content. The results of our research can be used for effective management of biodiversity on railways, and for the monitoring and development of control measures for the spread of non-native species. They can also be useful for sustainable planning and management of urban landscapes.

AB  - At present, the sharp decline in urban biodiversity worldwide is severe. Conducting biological perspective analysis and proposing space construction solutions during urban regeneration can greatly alleviate the contradiction between urban construction and biodiversity conservation. In this study, birds were taken as biological representatives, and a certain area in Shenzhen with strong conservation needs was used as an example. Based on a thorough analysis of bird status, the minimum resistance model was applied to establish a resistance surface describing the real flight movement of the indicator species and to construct a bird conservation pattern from the flight process of birds. The results show that: (1) bird flight resistance is the lowest in the southern green space and northern woodland around the reservoir in the research region, and the resistance is higher in the central part, but the path of least resistance therein has the potential to become a corridor. (2) From the perspective of the community structure of green space vegetation, the sparse woodland and shrubland in the research region have low resistance and high richness, which are the most ideal green space forms for birds; from the perspective of architecture, bird flight resistance shows a negative correlation with building height and a positive correlation with building density. The final urban regeneration design plan is thus derived, and the validity of the method is verified based on the biodiversity index. This study reveals the possibility of applying bird flight resistance analysis based on the minimum resistance model to small and medium-scale urban regeneration areas, and also provides insight into the correlation between flight resistance and spatial design elements, which can assist decision-makers, planners and developers in spatial design and planning from a biological standpoint.

AB  - Although the bird communities of some urban habitats have received considerable research attention, the bird fauna of wooded streets have been little studied despite the fact that wooded streets constitute a distinct feature of the urban landscape. In order to examine the effects of vegetation structure and floristic attributes on bird species richness and bird abundance, 216 wooded streets in the city of Valencia (Spain) were surveyed during three consecutive seasons in the year 2000. During the survey 1,378 individuals of 14 bird species were recorded. With the exception of the House Sparrow (Passer domesticus) and the Collared Dove (Streptopelia decaocto), most of these species had very low abundances. Depending on the season, the species recorded in wooded streets represented between 19-25% of the species recorded in the nearby urban habitats. Across seasons, tree species richness, tree abundance and tree height were the main factors influencing bird species richness and bird abundance. 34 tree species out of 41 were used by birds. Some large tree species like the Box Elder (Acer negundo), the Siberian Elm (Ulmus pumilla) and the White Poplar (Populus alba) were preferred. A substantial change in the design and management of wooded streets in order to improve their suitability for bird fauna is suggested.

AB  - Human-modified landscapes (HMLs) are composed by small, isolated and defaunated forest fragments, which are surrounded by agricultural and urban areas. Information on species that thrives in these HMLs is essential to direct conservation strategies in local and regional scales. Since HMLs are dominant in the Atlantic Forest, we aimed to assess the mammalian diversity in a HML in southeastern Brazil and to propose conservation strategies. We collected data of terrestrial (small-, medium-and large-sized) and volant mammals in three small forest fragments (10, 14 and 26 ha) and adjacent areas, between 2003 and 2016, using complementary methods: active search, camera trapping, live-traps, mist nets and occasional records (i.e., roadkills). In addition, we used secondary data to complement our species list. We recorded 35 native mammal species (6 small-sized, 16 medium- and large-sized, and 13 bats) and seven exotic species in the HML. The recorded mammal assemblage (non-volant and volant), although mainly composed of common and generalist species, includes three medium-and large-sized species nationally threatened (Leopardus guttulus, Puma concolor and Puma yagouaroundi) and two data deficient species (Galictis cuja and Histiotus velatus), highlighting the importance of this HML for the maintenance and conservation of mammal populations. Despite highly impacted by anthropogenic disturbances, the study area harbors a significant richness of medium-and large-sized mammals, being an important biodiversity refuge in the region. However, this biodiversity is threatened by the low quality of the habitats, roadkills and abundant populations of domestic cats and dogs. Therefore, we stress the need of conservation strategies focusing on the medium-and large-sized mammals as an umbrella group, which could benefit all biodiversity in the landscape. We recommend actions that promotes biological restoration, aiming to increase structural composition and connectivity of the forest fragments, reducing roadkills and controlling the domestic cats and dogs' populations, in order to maintain and improve the diversity of mammals in long-term.

AB  - Isolation by distance and landscape connectivity are fundamental factors underlying speciation and evolution. To understand how landscapes affect gene flow and shape population structures, island species provide intrinsic study objects. We investigated the effects of landscapes on the population structure of the endangered frog species, Odorrana ishikawae and O. splendida, which each inhabit an island in southwest Japan. This was done by examining population structure, gene flow and demographic history of each species by analyzing 12 microsatellite loci and exploring causal environmental factors through ecological niche modeling (ENM) and the cost-distance approach. Our results revealed that the limited gene flow and multiple-population structure in O. splendida and the single-population structure in O. ishikawae were maintained after divergence of the species through ancient vicariance between islands. We found that genetic distance correlated with geographic distance between populations of both species. Our landscape genetic analysis revealed that the connectivity of suitable habitats influences gene flow and leads to the formation of specific population structures. In particular, different degrees of topographical complexity between islands are the major determining factor for shaping contrasting population structures of two species. In conclusion, our results illustrate the diversification mechanism of organisms through the interaction with space and environment. Our results also present an ENM approach for identifying the key factors affecting demographic history and population structures of target species, especially endangered species.

AB  - Wave- and current-protected shallows have been constructed in the heavily modified, urban River Spree to create a littoral habitat with reduced hydrodynamical disturbances by navigation. Five years after construction and an initial planting of various macrophytes, abiotic conditions were measured and the establishment of aquatic and riparian vegetation was assessed. This study aimed to quantify the effective reduction of hydrodynamic disturbances and to assess the rehabilitation of aquatic plants and the improvement of the macrophytes-based ecological status by means of the reference index (RI).
   Wave stress has been successfully reduced and a diverse, abundant community of aquatic and riparian plants developed resembling the vegetation of natural oxbows. Most of the planted species were still present after five years, and in addition, several new species became established. The aquatic plants at the rehabilitated site indicated a "good" ecological status and even the "high" status if planted species were excluded from the RI. In contrast, the control site remained largely unvegetated indicating a "bad" status.
   Abiotic conditions other than wave action confirmed low hydrological connectivity and the ecosystem-engineering capabilities of vegetation. Low oxygen saturation and the accumulation of organic material limit the habitat suitability for other biota. Principally, wave-protected shallows are well suited to improve aquatic macrophytes in urban waterways. They will be rapidly naturally colonized, while planting of macrophytes, especially of species typical for advanced stages of succession should be omitted. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Throughout the long history of landscape ecology, scientists have devoted substantial efforts to understand potential forest patch size and isolation effects on the abundance and diversity of woodland species. Which bird species flourish or perish as a response to forest fragmentation may compose fundamental information for the reserve design and landscape management in a region. Here, we designed a bird survey of the urban forest areas in Dangjin city located on South Korea's west coast to test (1) if bird species richness follows the pattern predicted by species-area relationship and (2) if there is seasonal variation in the pattern. As expected, patch area was the most significant variable explaining patch occupancy of resident and summering woodland birds in every season. Our data about the number of dominant vegetation suggest that larger areas contain greater habitat heterogeneity and more diverse niches. About half of the resident species did not appear to be area-sensitive and were categorized as edge species. On the other hand, many summering species showed strong area-sensitivity, potentially avoiding small patches that are almost entirely edge habitats in urban landscape. Our results suggest that lots of contemporary forest edges, fragmented by agricultural or urban development, do not any more function for feeding or nesting places for those species.

AB  - A comparative study of butterfly communities in 15 urban/suburban remnants of tropical semideciduous forest in Campinas (Sao Paulo state, SE Brazil; 24 degrees S, 47 degrees W), with areas from 1.0 to 252 ha and widely varying histories and environments, shows that the most significant factors, besides area and sampling time, distinguishing the sites and influencing their diversity (80-702 species) and composition are connectivity, permanent water, vegetation, flowers, and human impact (negative, including pollution). The diversified Nymphalidae butterflies (38-213 species) and especially two fermented-bait-attracted groups (Satyrinae, 2-30 species, and Biblidini, 9-44 species), are among the more useful indicators of the quality and diversity of the environments in these fragments. Effective conservation of butterfly communities in tropical cities may be achieved by maintenance of arboreal green corridors along streets and watercourses between moderately large (>10 ha) humid areas, not near to the most built-up or polluted city centre(s), and the inclusion within these areas of ponds or streams, diversified native forest, and open vegetation including abundant nectar-rich flowers.

AB  - Forested natural areas in cities provide a range of social, ecological, economic, and health benefits. Ensuring the delivery of these benefits requires an understanding of current and potential future forest conditions, yet urban forest dynamics are not well-understood. Here, we address this knowledge gap by examining forest structure and composition in 126 plots distributed across three forest patch sizes (large [95-126 ha], medium [1-19 ha], and small [0.05-0.65 ha] patches) in the city of New Haven, CT. We detected significant shifts in forest structure and composition suggesting a suite of distinct successional trajectories within each patch size. Large patches comprised 95% native tree species in the canopy (>5 cm dbh), sapling (1-5 cm dbh), and seedling (<1 cm dbh) layers, suggesting that these large patches will continue to be native-dominated in the future-a primary objective for urban forest management. Moreover, in these large patches, shifts in the dominant species in each stratum suggest that as large patches move through succession they will transition from moderately shade-tolerant forest types (i.e., oaks) to shade-tolerant types (i.e., American beech)-a similar successional trajectory to surrounding second-growth forests in the region. Medium patches were the most heterogeneous patch size sampled. Despite this heterogeneity, they generally resembled large patches in the canopy and sapling layers but diverged in the seedling layer. In medium patches, the invasive Norway maple replaced American beech as primary seedling species suggesting a future shift toward non-native-dominated forest in the future. Small patches were the most compositionally and structurally distinct patch size sampled. Only 36% of the canopy trees and saplings in small patches were native species; however, this increased to 71% native in the seedling layer. Additionally, the most important seedling species included those that are bird-dispersed highlighting the potentially valuable role that these small, non-native, forest fragments play as wildlife corridors. Collectively, our study demonstrates that multiple forest types, dynamics, and conditions can be found within a single city and that forest patch size offers a helpful framework to begin to parse out these differences.

AB  - Increases in particulate matter in cities threaten both public health and ecosystems. Street trees, which are a corridor-type green infrastructure capable of absorbing particulate matter, have been promoted as one possible solution to this problem. However, planting selected trees solely with the goal of reducing particulate matter may adversely affect street tree ecosystem resilience by inhibiting species diversity. This study aims to investigate urban street tree planting strategies that reduce particulate matter while maintaining ecosystem resilience. To this end, a study site in Suwon, South Korea was selected, and street tree planting scenarios were developed based on the selected site information. A scenario analysis was conducted using a system dynamics model. The model simulated the long-term trends under each scenario regarding the amount of particulate matter absorbed by the trees and the changes in species diversity. The analysis results clearly show that strategic planting of street trees while focusing on only a specific purpose-reducing particulate matter-can adversely affect ecosystem resilience. The scenario analysis also revealed that increasing the number of street trees while maintaining a balance among various species is the best option for reducing particulate matter without degrading species diversity. Additionally, the results support the need to plant evergreen species to consider the winter season.

AB  - What is the future for livestock agriculture in the world? Consumers have concerns about sustainability but many widely used livestock production methods do not satisfy consumers' requirements for a sustainable system. However, production can be sustainable, occurring in environments that: supply the needs of the animals resulting in good welfare, allow coexistence with a wide diversity of organisms native to the area, minimize carbon footprint and provide a fair lifestyle for the people working there. Conservation need not just involve tiny islands of natural vegetation in a barren world of agriculture, as there can be great increases in biodiversity in farmed areas. Herbivores, especially ruminants that consume materials inedible by humans, are important for human food in the future. However, their diet should not be just ground-level plants. Silvopastoral systems, pastures with shrubs and trees as well as herbage, are described which are normally more productive than pasture alone. When compared with widely used livestock production systems, silvopastoral systems can provide efficient feed conversion, higher biodiversity, enhanced connectivity between habitat patches and better animal welfare, so they can replace existing systems in many parts of the world and should be further developed.

AB  - The paper presents a method that addresses the problem of site-selection for habitat creation involving spatial processes on the landscape scale. It interprets landscape ecological principles, with focus on population dynamics, to specific information required to support a particular decision at each stage of the process. The approach focuses on deciduous woodland with the redstart Phoenicurous phoenicurous as an umbrella species for woodland birds and is illustrated within the fragmented landscape of the east midlands area of England. The method requires the use of a Geographic Information System (GIS) to estimate the connectivity of habitat patches. Each patch is assigned a "cost" value that represents the cost of dispersal over a friction surface. The sites are ranked accordingly and, in combination with the spatial context and size, are prioritised in terms of their potential for forming cores for habitat creation. Habitat patches with low cost values, a large area of surrounding habitat and small size were identified as potential sites for expansion in order to satisfy the minimum requirements of the species. The approach is generic, applicable to any species, and despite its limitations it can be a useful aid in conservation planning. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many landscape genetic studies promise results that can be applied in conservation management. However, only few landscape genetic studies have been used by practitioners. Here, we identified scientific topics in landscape genetics that need to be addressed before results can more successfully be applied in conservation management. For each topic, weaknesses of common practice in landscape genetic analysis are described by presenting examples from current studies and further recommendations for improvements are outlined. First, we suggest matching the extent of the study area with those of conservation management units and the study species' dispersal potential when designing landscape genetic studies. Second, the quality of the underlying statistical models should be optimised, and models should include variables that are useful for management implementation. Third, to further improve the applicability of landscape genetic studies, thresholds for landscape effects on gene flow should be identified. Fourth, landscape genetic models could be used for the development of conservation planning tools, which ideally also incorporate the above described thresholds. Fifth and as discussed in earlier studies, the use of multiple species and replication at the landscape scale is recommended. Although it appears that only few landscape genetic studies have been applied in practical management until now, examples presented in this article show that landscape genetic methods can provide important information to formulate concrete management implications. Thus, addressing the above-mentioned scientific topics in landscape genetic studies would enhance the benefits of their results for practitioners.

AB  - Anthropogenic pressures can affect the distribution of species and elicit the appearance of spatial patterns that provide insights into the species' responses to environmental filtering, mediated by their functional traits. Due to the functional redundancy in ecological communities, the spatial variations of species and functional traits can occur at different scales, but little is known on this topic, especially for soil arthropods with limited dispersion capabilities and highly dependent on environmental characteristics. The present research aims at shedding light on the spatial ecology of both the taxonomic and functional biodiversity of collembolan communities colonizing urban parks, adopted as model taxa for their functional traits, diversity and sensitivity to environmental drivers. To this end, the spatial patterns and scales of collembolan communities from 8 parks in Naples (Italy) and 14 in Montpellier (France) were investigated through an approach based on Moran eigenvector maps, modified to allow for evaluating the community spatial connectivity and the scales underpinning the spatial variation of each species and functional trait. The obtained findings demonstrate a limited spatial connectivity of collembolan communities in terms of both taxonomic and functional diversity, with mostly species-specific micro-scale variations that may be shaped by environmental constraints.

AB  - Ecosystem conservation in Mesoamerica, one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, is a top priority because of the rapid loss of native vegetation due to anthropogenic activities. Riparian forests are often the only remaining preserved areas among expansive agricultural matrices. These forest remnants are essential to maintaining water quality, providing habitats for a variety of wildlife and acting as biological corridors that enable the movement and dispersal of local species. The Acome river is located on the Pacific slope of Guatemala. This region is heavily impacted by intensive agriculture (mostly sugarcane plantations), fires and grazing. Most of this region's original forest is now restricted to forest remnants concentrated along the riverbank. However, the botanical composition and species diversity of the riparian communities has not been characterized. This baseline information is essential to develop restoration strategies and management plans. This study aimed to characterize the riparian tree communities along the Acome riverbank by systematically collecting herbarium specimens and photographic material for trees over 10 cm DBH (diameter at breast height). Cluster analysis was used to identify the main riparian communities, and diversity indices were calculated for each community. A total of 115 tree species were identified, belonging to 91 genera and 43 families. The cluster analysis suggested the presence of four riparian tree communities along an altitudinal gradient. Rhizophora mangle, Cecropia obtusifolia, Guazuma ulmifolia, and Brosimum costaricanum were the dominant species of the identified communities. This research will support ongoing restoration efforts and biological connectivity plans in this region.

AB  - Urbanisation is increasing throughout the range of the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) and has contributed to the decline of koala populations in many areas. In urban landscapes where koalas may need to travel considerable distances to access resources, they face increased risks of predation by domestic dogs and vehicular collision. Understanding how koalas navigate this risky landscape is key to developing effective conservation strategies. We used GPS data collected from 20 koalas to examine koala habitat use and movements in an urbanised area of the Mornington Peninsula, Victoria, Australia. Koala home ranges were large (males = 9.1 ha, females = 4.3 ha) and covered up to 153 properties. Analysis of GPS tracks showed that koalas moved frequently (median number of different locations per week: 14 [males], 8 [females]), usually over short distances (median distance: 69 m [males], 50 m [females]), and often crossed roads (average crossings per week: 9.4 [males], 2.7 [females]). Despite this movement behaviour placing koalas at risk of vehicular collision and predation by dogs, we recorded only three deaths during the one-year study period; two were due to old age and one of unknown cause. Our low mortality rate may be due to movements occurring at night when risks may be lower, and high awareness in the community about koalas that mitigates threats. Our results suggest that effective conservation of urban populations of koalas requires a landscape-scale approach with participation by the community and public land managers to maintain and establish koala habitat and connectivity, and to encourage koala-friendly driving behaviour.

AB  - Cities contain only a low representation of natural and semi-natural habitats, existing in fragments surrounded by built-up areas. In 2003-2004, we surveyed butterflies and Zygaenidae moths in 21 reserves and 4 parks within the city of Prague, Czech Republic, situated from the periphery to city centre. A total of 85 species (47% of the Czech fauna of the study groups) was detected, 22 of them being of conservation concern. Ordination analyses of the local assemblages revealed that the richest sites were large, situated far from the city centre, on alkaline bedrocks, south- to southwest oriented, and hosting high numbers of vegetation types and vascular plant species. We then used generalised linear models to fit responses of individual species to the main ordination gradient, corresponding to increasing urbanisation. Out of 60 species that met criteria for the modelling, none responded positively to urbanisation. Twenty displayed negative linear response; these urban avoiders contained a surplus of mesophilous species presumably preferring rural landscapes. Further 29 species (suburban adaptable) responded in domed manners, peaking at the city periphery. Prevailing among them were xerophilous specialists inhabiting large grassland reserves at the Prague outskirts. Finally, eleven urban tolerant species did not respond to urbanisation at all, containing three highly mobile species, three xerothermophilous specialists, and five species utilising shrubs or trees and finding suitable conditions even in urban parks. Suburban adaptable butterflies apparently benefit from such suburban environments as gardens, road or railway verges, collectively increasing the connectivity of remnants of seminatural habitats. The fact that arboreal species persist even in urban parks, whereas common grassland species are absent there, implies that the quality of urban habitats might be increased by a more sensitive management of urban green spaces, such as leaving aside small temporary fallows or adapting lawns mowing schemes.

AB  - Bees provide essential pollination services that are potentially affected both by local farm management and the surrounding landscape. To better understand these different factors, we modelled the relative effects of landscape composition (nesting and floral resources within foraging distances), landscape configuration (patch shape, interpatch connectivity and habitat aggregation) and farm management (organic vs. conventional and local-scale field diversity), and their interactions, on wild bee abundance and richness for 39 crop systems globally. Bee abundance and richness were higher in diversified and organic fields and in landscapes comprising more high-quality habitats; bee richness on conventional fields with low diversity benefited most from high-quality surrounding land cover. Landscape configuration effects were weak. Bee responses varied slightly by biome. Our synthesis reveals that pollinator persistence will depend on both the maintenance of high-quality habitats around farms and on local management practices that may offset impacts of intensive monoculture agriculture.

AB  - Many authors have concluded that habitat loss has a greater influence on biodiversity than habitat fragmentation per se. Yet, several animal species have been shown to be reluctant to move across inhospitable landscape matrices, a phenomenon that would be expected to exacerbate fragmentation effects. In this study, we tested the ability of a forest songbird (Ovenbird, Seiurus aurocapilla) to move across two contrasting landscapes whose matrix (intensively managed forest) would be expected to be relatively permeable compared to agricultural or urban matrices. We hypothesized that males would be less likely to return to their territory in a landscape dominated by forest generally unsuitable for breeding (spruce plantations) than in another dominated by potential breeding habitat (deciduous forest). The probability of resighting translocated males (n = 48) on their territory was significantly lower in the plantation landscape and this relationship was consistent over two successive years. Neither translocation time nor body mass, time of capture, or structural size were significant predictors of probability of resighting. Although this species is sufficiently vagile to return quickly to its territory (e.g. one male returning in less than 2 h), these results indicate that even a forested matrix may impose a resistance to the movements of a forest bird species when its structure or composition differs from that of breeding habitat. Matrix resistance to movements potentially restricts the ability of individuals to detect and colonize suitable habitat fragments. Less vagile species would be even more affected and, therefore, we submit that a more inclusive perspective on effects of landscape change is warranted. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Culex pipiens L. (Diptera Culicidae) is of medical and veterinary importance as vector of various bacterial, filarial and arboviral disease pathogens, and is a major pest in urban areas. Understanding the population structure and gene flow among populations is critical for public health issues such as local dispersion pattern and spread of insecticide resistance. To determine the dispersion pattern of the Cx. pipiens samples across the southern part of the Pannonian Plain of Central Europe (testing Isolation by distance model), and at fine-scale level, between ecologically different larval habitats (testing Isolation by ecology model), we studied hexokinase (HK) genes. Because the polymorphism of HK genes is independent of insecticide use, spatial variation at HK loci provided valuable information on population connectivity of Cx. pipiens. Implementing STRUCTURE statistical analysis, a lack of structuring at individual level of "urban" and "rural" samples was observed. Landscape study rejected both ecological and isolation models which implies that different selection regimes of larval habitats and geographic distance do not influence on genotype portioning at HK system. Observed high genetic connectivity among samples throughout urban and rural environments indicated that gene flow is an important factor underlying genetic structure. This study pointed out that control measures restricted to urban areas are unlikely to be effective due to high gene flow between treated and untreated populations. Hence, designing a sustainable vector control strategy for the species with detectable gene flow, such as Cx. pipiens, must remain a regional effort.

AB  - Within urban landscape planning, debate continues around the relative merits of land-sharing (sprawl) and land-sparing (compaction) scenarios. Using three of the ten districts in Greater Manchester (UK) as a case-study, we present a landscape approach to mapping green infrastructure and variation in social-ecological-environmental conditions as a function of land sharing and sparing. We do so for the landscape as a whole and in a more focussed approach for areas of high and low urbanity. Results imply potential trade-offs between land-sharing-sparing scenarios relevant to characteristics critical to urban resilience such as landscape connectivity and diversity, air quality, surface temperature, and access to green space. These trade-offs are complex due to the parallel influence of patch attributes such as land-cover and size and imply that both ecological restoration and spatial planning have a role to play in reconciling tensions between land-sharing and sparing strategies.

AB  - Understanding the ranging behavior and habitat selection of understory tropical birds is important for corridor design and enhancing functional connectivity in fragmented tropical landscapes. Here we report on the ranging behavior and habitat selection of three terrestrial insectivorous bird species, the spot-throat Modulatrix stictigula, Usambara thrush Turdus roehli and orange ground thrush Zoothera gurneyi, in the East (EUM) and West (WUM) Usambara Mountains in north-east Tanzania. Based on 5945 locations and 3676 bird radio-tracking hours conducted between 2001 and 2008 at four study sites in the EUM and WUM, we determined that the 95% kernel home range and 50% kernel core range for the spot-throat, Usambara thrush, and orange ground thrush are similar yet large (aggregate mean home range=10.3 +/- 1.1 ha; aggregate mean core range 1.5 +/- 0.4 ha); that these species are adverse to crossing non-forested openings - no bird was recorded over the course of the study to cross a non-forested opening > 15 m; and that the most extinction-prone species in our study system, the spot-throat and Usambara thrush, preferentially used slightly disturbed and primary forest, respectively. These results indicate that maintaining continuous forest cover and minimizing forest disturbance in corridors in the Eastern Arc Mountains is important for enhancing their habitat suitability for these species.

AB  - The remaining historical forests are crucial for maintaining biodiversity in urban areas. However, the integrity and stability of historical forests are affected by land-use/cover change. A better understanding of these impacts can help prioritize protection and restoration. In this study, we estimated the loss of area and levels of threats and analyzed the importance of critical areas for historical forests in the built-up area of a rapidly urbanizing city-Guiyang, China. We used the threat indicator, morphological spatial pattern analysis, and probability of connectivity based on InVEST, GuidosToolbox, and Conefor software. The results based on remote sensing image classification showed that 1988.46 ha of historical forestlands was transformed into other land-use/cover types. The mean value of the threat index of all the historical forest patches increased by 33% compared to the baseline year. The area of cores and bridges, considered as key nodes and links for the connectivity of forest networks, decreased by 193.32 and 353.61 ha, respectively. Most of the critical areas with high importance values for connectivity were located in the central part of the city and were severely threatened by the surrounding areas. We recommend that effective measures be implemented to control the further loss of historical forests and to increase the connectivity and buffering capacity of the remaining forests by creating tree belts and corridors in key locations.

AB  - Connectivity is currently a central issue in landscape management and planning for the conservation of wildlife species occupying scarce habitat patches. In recent years, this issue has increasingly been addressed using methodologies based on spatial network analysis. Here, we propose a hybrid approach based on network analysis tools and empirical habitat suitability models to integrate connectivity on decision-making. The study is focused on a pond system used by the European pond turtle, Emys orbicularis, in a coastal area in southwestern Iberia. The main objective of the study was to illustrate how the output of graph models may be useful to guide habitat management and planning. We assessed ponds according to three complementary structural and functional properties derived from a graph model: (1) pond importance as measured by the sensitivity of the overall connectivity to each pond loss, (2) pond coreness, used to identify the most cohesive pond subsystems and (3) pond betweenness, which measure the importance of ponds as stepping stones. The graph model took into account a resistance-to-movement surface, the maximum traveled distance and a habitat suitability model based on field sampling. Pond importance and coreness were shown to be positively related to occupancy, especially by turtle's youngest age classes, suggesting an important contribution of connectivity attributes for turtle populations. We discuss the ways these pond connectivity-related attributes may be helpful to assist and optimize management efforts for the conservation of the European pond turtle in the study area.

AB  - Animal-mediated pollination is essential for the maintenance of plant reproduction, especially in tropical ecosystems, where pollination networks have been thought to have highly generalized structures. However, accumulating evidence suggests that not all floral visitors provide equally effective pollination services, potentially reducing the number of realized pollinators and increasing the cryptic specialization of pollination networks. Thus, there is a need to understand how different functional groups of pollinators influence pollination success. Here, we examined whether patterns of contemporary pollen-mediated gene flow in Heliconia tortuosa are consistent with the foraging strategy of its territorial or traplining hummingbird pollinators. Territorial hummingbirds defend clumps of flowers and are expected to transfer pollen locally. In contrast, traplining hummingbirds forage across longer distances, thereby increasing pollen flow among forest fragments, and are thought to repeatedly visit particular plants. If trapliners indeed visit the same plants repeatedly along their regular routes, this could lead to a situation where neighboring plants sample genetically distinct pollen pools. To test this hypothesis, we genotyped 720 seeds and 71 mother plants from 18 forest fragments at 11 microsatellite loci. We performed TwoGener analysis to test pollen pool differentiation within sites (among neighboring plants within the same forest fragment: Phi(SC)) and between sites (among forest fragments: Phi(CT)). We found strong, statistically significant pollen pool differentiation among neighboring mother plants (Phi(SC) = 0.0506), and weaker, statistically significant differentiation among sites (Phi(CT) = 0.0285). We interpret this pattern of hierarchical pollen pool differentiation as the landscape genetic signature of the foraging strategy of traplining hummingbirds, where repeatable, long-distance, and high-fidelity routes transfer pollen among particular plants. Although H. tortuosa is also visited by territorial hummingbirds, our results suggest that these pollinators do not contribute substantially to successful pollination, highlighting differences in realized pollination efficiency. This cryptic reduction in the number of realized pollinators potentially increases the vulnerability of pollination success to the decline of populations of traplining hummingbirds, which have been shown to be sensitive to forest fragmentation. We conclude that maintaining habitat connectivity to sustain the foraging routes of trapliners may be essential for the maintenance of pollen-mediated gene flow in human-modified landscapes.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of landscape on the distribution of Japanese hares Lepus brachyurus Temminck, 1845 hares along a rural-urban gradient. We surveyed the presence of hares in 62 forest patches in the Tama Hills, which spreads from forested mountains to the urban core, and found signs of hares in 23 patches. We evaluated the effects of habitat patch size, connectivity, and land cover of the surrounding area (forest, residential and few agricultural area) by logistic regression. To select the most appropriate spatial scale and time period, we conducted a variable selection for all combinations of buffer size (250-, 500-, 1000- and 2000-m radius), and year (1974, 1984 and 1994). We calculated Akaike weight for the best model to measure the importance of each variable. The model for the best combination of buffer size and year was 500 m in 1994. We conclude that recent landscape determines the occurrence of hares. Forest patch size and percentage of forest cover were important variables in the best model. To protect the wild hare population in suburban areas, it is important to conserve areas of forest that have at least 500 m radius. These areas must be continuously maintained, as hares respond rapidly-to changes in landscape.

AB  - Nowadays, the processes of deforestation and loss of habitats represent a major threat to many species of mammals. These processes cause changes in natural landscapes by decreasing area, connectivity, and fragment size, and increasing edge effects and number of fragments. Understanding which and how many species persist in disturbed fragments may indicate the species' minimum requirements and might contribute to their conservation. Here we show how the mammalian fauna of medium and large size (higher than 1 kg) are structured in a semideciduous seasonal forest fragment of 36.5 ha in the urban area of Jatai, Goias. We performed the sampling with 30 sand track plots (1 x 1 m). We analyzed the relative record frequency and built a collector's curve to demonstrate the sampling effort. With a total effort of 600 track plots x days, we recorded twelve species of mammals with our tracks sampling method, from which only the wild mammals were included in the analyzes (11 species). The estimated species richness reached 13 species (SD (Standard Deviation) = +/- 1, CI (Confidence Interval) = +/- 2 (11 - 15 species). The species with the highest relative record frequency was Didelphis albiventris and the species with the lowest was Tamandua tetradactyla. The fragment size must be a limiting factor to the richness and to the occurrence of species, as it may not be sufficient to allow the persistence of a population or an individual. Disturbances that originated from houses, like domestic animals and movement of people, also contributed to the removal and extinction of species. To conserve the species in the fragment, we suggest the prevention of entrance of people and of domestic animals. We also recommend increased connectivity of the fragment with the landscape external to the urban area in order to allow the movement of the currently present species.

AB  - The potential of linear strips of vegetation to net as corridors to facilitate dispersal is examined for three taxa of insects in lowland rain forest in northeastern Australia. The taxa selected were ants, butterflies and dung beetles, all of which are taxonomically well known and could be considered bioindicator groups. The sampling design encompassed four habitats, namely rain-forest interior; rain-forest edge, rain-forest linear strip (corridor), and arable land. Ants and dung beetles were sampled using baited pitfall traps, and visual surveys were used to census butterflies. Potential increase in dispersal was examined by first identifying those species that specialized on the rain-forest interior habitat and then determining whether these species were present in the linear strips as opposed to the surrounding arable land. Two species of butterfly and two species of dung beetle were identified as milt-forest interior specialists, and two of these species were found in the linear strips but not in the arable habitat. This result supports the concept that the presence of corridors can increase the potential for dispersal of these species. But the remaining rain-forest interior species did not occur in the linear strips, which suggests that corridors will not increase dispersal for these species.

AB  - The immense concentrations of vertebrate species in tropical mountains remain a prominent but unexplained pattern in biogeography. A long-standing hypothesis suggests that montane biodiversity hotspots result from endemic species aggregating within ecologically stable localities. Here, the persistence of ancient lineages coincides with frequent speciation events, making such areas both 'cradles' (where new species arise) and 'museums' (where old species survive). Although this hypothesis refers to processes operating at the scale of valleys, it remains supported primarily by patterns generated from coarse-scale distribution data. Using high-resolution occurrence and phylogenetic data on Andean hummingbirds, we find that old and young endemic species are not spatially aggregated. The young endemic species tend to have non-overlapping distributions scattered along the Andean treeline, a long and narrow habitat where populations easily become fragmented. By contrast, the old endemic species have more aggregated distributions, but mainly within pockets of cloud forests at lower elevations than the young endemic species. These findings contradict the premise that biogeographical cradles and museums should overlap in valley systems where pockets of stable climate persist through periods of climate change. Instead, Andean biodiversity hotspots may derive from large-scale fluctuating climate complexity in conjunction with local-scale variability in available area and habitat connectivity.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation due to urbanization are the most pervasive threats to biodiversity in southern California. Loss of habitat and fragmentation can lower migration rates and genetic connectivity among remaining populations of native species, reducing genetic variability and increasing extinction risk. However, it may be difficult to separate the effects of recent anthropogenic fragmentation from the genetic signature of prehistoric fragmentation due to previous natural geological and climatic changes. To address these challenges, we examined the phylogenetic and population genetic structure of a flightless insect endemic to cismontane southern California, Stenopelmatus 'mahogani' (Orthoptera: Stenopelmatidae). Analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequence data suggest that diversification across southern California began during the Pleistocene, with most haplotypes currently restricted to a single population. Patterns of genetic divergence correlate with contemporary urbanization, even after correcting for (geographical information system) GIS-based reconstructions of fragmentation during the Pleistocene. Theoretical simulations confirm that contemporary patterns of genetic structure could be produced by recent urban fragmentation using biologically reasonable assumptions about model parameters. Diversity within populations was positively correlated with current fragment size, but not prehistoric fragment size, suggesting that the effects of increased drift following anthropogenic fragmentation are already being seen. Loss of genetic connectivity and diversity can hinder a population's ability to adapt to ecological perturbations commonly associated with urbanization, such as habitat degradation, climatic changes and introduced species. Consequently, our results underscore the importance of preserving and restoring landscape connectivity for long-term persistence of low vagility native species.

AB  - Questions
   Changes in land use, altered flow regimes, invasions by pests and pathogens, and climate change are, separately and together, altering ecological dynamics of floodplain forests. The complex changes these forces impose often go unnoticed due to a lack of reliable baseline data. Using historical data from the 1950s and re-survey data on floodplain forest understories, we ask: (1) what is the direction, magnitude and nature of changes in local and regional diversity; (2) have these floodplain communities become more homogenous in composition due to losses of native species and increases in non-natives; (3) has the relationship between the ground layer and overstorey community weakened over time; and (4) are changes in local and regional diversity among these floodplain forests more or less pronounced than in nearby upland forests?
   Location
   Floodplain forests throughout southern Wisconsin, USA.
   Methods
   We quantified composition of vegetation in the understorey and overstorey of 40 sites and compared these data with data from the 1950s using a combination of uni- and multivariate analyses. We focus on changes in local vs regional diversity.
   Results
   Although average site-level diversity has increased by 18.5%, sites are now 30% more similar to each other, reflecting a pronounced decline in among-site (beta) diversity. Although exotic species have increased in site occupancy and abundance, increases in native woody plants (+30%), graminoids (+24%) and forbs (+16%) drive most of these changes in local and regional diversity. Sites have experienced an average species turnover rate of 39% since the 1950s, and understories are now 39% more correlated with canopy composition than in the 1950s. Biotic homogenization among these floodplain forests since the 1950s is 23.3% higher than the increase in similarity observed in nearby upland forests.
   Conclusions
   Vegetation changes in floodplain understories differ from changes previously documented in nearby upland forests. Floodplain forests have experienced a faster rate of biotic homogenization. Unlike upland forests the homogenization trend in these floodplain forests is accompanied by increases in site-level diversity. These may reflect widespread colonization by certain native species. Both trends may also reflect relatively high connectivity among floodplain forests and control of hydrologic fluctuations via dams.

AB  - Rights-of-way provide greenway linkages between fragments of natural areas. Within an urban context, rights-of-way provide connectivity between parks and other protected areas, creating larger breeding populations, better gene flow, larger food webs and greater opportunities for plants and animals to help each other reproduce. Managing rights-of-way to increase biodiversity produces a more effective natural network. The Green Links Project, started in 1995, focuses on strengthening ecological connectivity within Greater Vancouver. This urban area is on the Fraser River Estuary and delta, a major stopover point along the Pacific Flyway for migratory birds. The Fraser River itself is home to the world's largest salmon run. Biological conservation here is of international importance. BC Hydro and BC Gas have worked in partnership on the Green Links Project to take a regional approach to biological conservation through plantings of native vegetation and putting up bird and bat boxes with student and community participation in utility corridors, backyards, and balconies. Issues and problems that had to be addressed included ownership of lands, trees under power lines, and city maintenance crews cutting new plantings.

AB  - The consequent deforestation of urban sprawl is one of the causes of the decline of wild bee communities. In this context, urban green areas (UGA) may play an important role and constitute refuge areas for bees. This study analyzed the influence of UGA conditions and their surroundings in bee guilds' responses in a medium-sized Brazilian city (Campos dos Goytacazes, RJ). The bees were sampled for 12 months (2017-2018) in 12 UGAs, and bee abundance and species richness were evaluated in guilds considering: nesting behavior, nesting site, and trophic specialization. We used as explanatory variables conditions of UGAs-the number of trees (NT), diameter at breast height (DBH), flower cover (FC), plant richness (PR), percentage of paving (PV)-and of their surroundings-paving (SPV) and the number of buildings (NB). Results showed 80% of eusocial bees, 82% nest in cavities, and 99% were generalists. FC, DBH, and NB mainly explained the responses of different guilds in study areas from all explanatory variables. Thus, this study confirms different responses associated with bee guilds' attributes. In order to conserve bee diversity, city planning must include more green areas with large flower covers and avoid long corridors of high buildings that can impact bee dispersion.

AB  - Species movement and occupancy of habitat patches are dependent on landscape permeability. Some land-use types (e.g., roads) may be barriers to animal movement. Analyses of the effect of landscape structure on patch occupancy usually use circular buffers around focal patches. The main assumption of this methodological approach is that species are affected by a particular landscape element equally in every direction from a given patch. This assumption is likely not to hold if animal movement is restricted by barriers because barriers reduce movement patterns and reshape the ideal circular buffer into a noncircular buffer. We developed a method to determine the effect of landscape variables oil the distribution of two amphibian species that explicitly takes dispersal barriers into account. We extracted landscape variables within (i) circular buffers (CB) and (ii) barrier-based buffers (BBB). BBB were produced by reducing the boundaries of CB according to major impassable barriers. The BBB approach almost doubled the explained deviance of multiple regression models in comparison with the CB approach. Moreover. CB and BBB models included different predictor variables. We Suggest that the BBB approach is more Useful than the traditional CB analyses of species-habitat relationships because ecological barriers are explicitly taken into account..

AB  - Public and our observations during 1999-2004 suggested that tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae) visited the city of Hamilton during March to October only, outside the nesting season. From 2004 onwards, we captured and banded 51 adult tui and fitted radio transmitters to 41 in Waikato urban areas to locate nests. We directly observed 15 nests to determine nesting success and gather evidence of any predation events. Tui moved 5-23 km from urban areas to surrounding native forests at the onset of nesting, but only four (29%) of 14 unmanaged nests fledged young, due mostly to predation by ship rats (Rattus rattus), swamp harriers (Circus approximans), and brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula). Subsequent effective pest mammal control in forests around Hamilton was associated with greatly increased year-round tui abundance and nesting in Hamilton. These results confirm previous findings that tui move widely in winter; that they readily cross pasture in the absence of forest corridors, and that they will permanently inhabit urban areas. Provided adequate food is available, effective control of ship rats and possums can rapidly (1-4 years) increase tui visits and nesting within 20 km of managed sites, enabling recolonisation of proximate urban habitats by this iconic endemic taxon, despite previous evidence for natal philopatry.

AB  - Cities harbour considerable biodiversity and there has been an increased concern about the conservation of pollinators in urban environments. Here, we evaluated how urbanization affects plant-hummingbird interactions at two spatial scales. First, in a medium-sized city from southeastern Brazil ( > 600,000 inhabitants), we contrasted interaction networks from urban and natural areas, and used artificial nectar feeder stations to evaluate changes in the composition of hummingbird assemblages across an urbanization gradient. Second, we compiled data on six urban plant-hummingbird interaction networks from south and southeastern Brazil to identify the characteristics associated with the most important plants. Locally, urbanization affected hummingbird communities by promoting higher generalization and dominance by more aggressive hummingbirds. Notably, specialized long-billed hermits were absent both in the urban interaction network and at feeder stations from more urbanized areas. Across networks, trees were more important for hummingbirds than shrubs/herbs as were specialized ornithophilous flowers in relation to non-ornithophilous flowers. Plant origin (native or exotic) did not matter. Our results indicate that urban plant-hummingbird communities are organized differently than their counterparts from natural areas, which usually feature key hermits and few trees. Since hermits provide important pollination services, especially for specialized ornithophilous plants, initiatives such as green corridors and preference for native plants with specialized hummingbird-pollinated flowers in urban landscaping may contribute to community restoration and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - The Isthmus of Panama, part of the planet's third largest megadiversity hotspot, and connecting the faunas of North and South America, has lost more than half of its forest due to agriculture and economic development. It is unknown to what degree the remaining forest, which is fragmented and subject to poaching, still supports the wildlife diversity found in intact forests. Here, we use camera-trap surveys to assess whether forests in Central Panama, the narrowest and most disturbed portion of the Isthmus, still have intact communities of medium- and large-bodied terrestrial mammals. During 2005-2014, we collected camera-trap survey data from 15 national parks and forest fragments on both sides of the Panama Canal, and compared these to similar data from two sites in the intact Darien National Park in Eastern Panama, the nearest available reference. We found that most sites in Central Panama - including some of the national parks - had lower mammal species richness and evenness than the reference sites, and less structurally-complex mammal communities. Forests in Central Panama had little or no apex predators and large terrestrial frugivores, with the exception of two sites directly connected to the reference site. Our results indicate that the terrestrial mammal community in forests of Central Panama is currently degraded, even inside national parks. These data provide a baseline for evaluating the success of conservation efforts to prevent the Panamanian Isthmus to become a bottleneck for movement of animals. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - In the 1940s, Aldo Leopold took extensive notes on birds and their sounds near his iconic shack in Baraboo, Wisconsin, USA. His observations, along with his land management techniques, helped frame his seminal book, A Sand County Almanac. After his death, two interstate highways were built near his property and subjected this historically significant area to traffic noise. While highways currently represent vital transportation corridors, their observed and potential impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services are cause for concern. As the area including Leopolds shack is now an Important Bird Area, we sought to evaluate the impact of these highways on the bird community and its related acoustic diversity. In 2011, 150 avian point counts were conducted in the three main habitats composing the landscape-upland deciduous forest, floodplain forest, and herbaceous wetland. In 2012, soundscape recordings were collected in seven floodplain forest sites using automated passive acoustic recorders. We described the local bird communities and measured their acoustic diversity. Linear models accounting for additional factors including land cover and vegetation structure characteristics showed that as the distance from highways increased, bird community descriptors (overall abundance and species richness) and acoustic diversity increased (when relationships were significant). On the species level, forest interior specialists were negatively affected by the presence of the highways, contrary to edge specialists. In addition to the direct effects of the edges produced by the highway structure, this difference might be due to the masking effect of traffic noise on interior specialists low-frequency vocalizations and their reliance on acoustic, as opposed to visual, communication. We conclude that while habitat structure is a principle driver of bird diversity on a broader scale, highway-induced changes in both habitat structure and soundscapes may affect bird communities.

AB  - Due to the intensified land use in transformed landscapes, grassland biodiversity is often restricted to habitat fragments inadequate for arable use or for urban development. In continental parts of Eurasia, the similar to 600,000 ancient burial mounds (called "kurgans") built by nomadic tribes of the steppes are amongst the most widespread landmarks providing refuge for dry grassland species. In our study by using plant functional groups and functional traits, we aimed at gaining insight into the ecological and evolutionary processes shaping the structure and the composition of assemblages of grassland specialist plant species on kurgans embedded in the agricultural landscapes of East-Hungary. As a comparison, we also studied roadside verges and pristine extensive grasslands in the same region. We found that despite their small size, due to the lack of human disturbances and high microhabitat diversity kurgans can maintain a high species richness and percentage cover of specialists, especially when compared to verges. We revealed that assemblages of specialist plants on kurgans are characterized by traits typical to terrestrial habitat islands such as self-compatibility, large seed mass and tall stature. Kurgans and extensive grasslands were characterized by higher functional diversity (both at the level of single traits and multi-trait based functional dispersion) which is probably due to the higher level of environmental heterogeneity compared to the homogeneous environment in verges.

AB  - Identifying the plant traits that determine the outcome of facilitation interactions is essential to understand how communities are assembled and can be restored. Plant facilitation networks are phylogenetically structured but which traits are behind such a pattern is unknown. We sampled plant interactions in stressful ecosystems from south-eastern Spain to build seedling and adult facilitation networks. We collected 20 morphological and ecophysiological traits for 151 species involved in interactions between 879 nurse individuals benefiting 24 584 seedlings and adults. We detected a significant phenotypic signal in the seedling facilitation network that was maintained in the adult network, whereby functionally similar nurses tended to facilitate functionally similar species whose traits differ from those of their nurses. We provide empirical evidence to support a long-lasting theoretical postulate stating that facilitation networks are phenotypically structured. Trait matching through which nurse and facilitated species avoid phenotypic overlap, and consequently competition, is the main linkage rule shaping plant facilitation networks.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation results in landscape configuration, which affects the species that inhabit it. As a consequence, natural habitat is replaced by different anthropogenic plantation types (e.g. pasture, agriculture, forestry plantations and urban areas). Anthropogenic plantations are important for biodiversity maintenance because some species or functional groups can use it as a complementary habitat. However, depending on plantation permeability, it can act as a barrier to the movement of organisms between habitat patches, such as forest fragments, reducing functional connectivity for many species. Anthropogenic plantations are becoming the most common land use and cover type in the Anthropocene and biodiversity conservation in fragmented landscapes requires information on how different plantation types affect the capacity of the species to move through the landscape. In this study, we evaluated the influence of the type and structure of plantations on the movement of two forest-dependent understory bird species - plain antvireo (Dysithamnus mentalis) and flavescent warbler (Myiothlyps flaveola) - within a highly fragmented landscape of Atlantic Forest hotspot. Knowing that forestry plantation is assumed to be more permeable to dependent forest bird species than open ones, we selected six study areas containing a forest fragment and surrounding plantation: three with sugarcane plantation and three with Eucalyptus sp. plantation. We used playback calls to stimulate the birds to leave forest fragments and traverse the plantations. Control trials were also carried out inside the forest fragments to compare the distances crossed. We observed that individuals moved longer distances inside forest than between plantation types, which demonstrate that plantations do constrict the movements of both species. The two plantation types equally impeded the movements of the species, suggesting the opposite of the general assumption that forestry plantations are more permeable. Our results indicate that, for generalist species, plantation type does not matter, but its presence negatively impacts movement of these bird species. We highlight that plantations have negative influences on the movements of common bird species, and discuss why this is important when setting conservation priorities.

AB  - Patterns of genetic differentiation within and among animal populations might vary due to the simple effect of distance or landscape features hindering gene flow. An assessment of how landscape connectivity affects gene flow can help guide management, especially in fragmented landscapes. Our objective was to analyze population genetic structure and landscape genetics of the native wild boar (Sus scrofa meridionalis) population inhabiting the island of Sardinia (Italy), and test for the existence of Isolation-by-Distance (IBD), Isolation-by-Barrier (IBB), and Isolation-by-Resistance (IBR). A total of 393 Sardinian wild boar samples were analyzed using a set of 16 microsatellite loci. Signals of genetic introgression from introduced non-native wild boars or from domestic pigs were revealed by a Bayesian cluster analysis including 250 reference individuals belonging to European wild populations and domestic breeds. After removal of introgressed individuals, genetic structure in the population was investigated by different statistical approaches, supporting a partition into five discrete subpopulations, corresponding to five geographic areas on the island: north-west (NW), central west (CW), south-west (SW), north-central east (NCE), and south-east (SE). To test the IBD, IBB, and IBR hypotheses, we optimized resistance surfaces using genetic algorithms and linear mixed-effects models with a maximum likelihood population effects parameterization. Landscape genetics analyses revealed that genetic discontinuities between subpopulations can be explained by landscape elements, suggesting that main roads, urban settings, and intensively cultivated areas are hampering gene flow (and thus individual movements) within the Sardinian wild boar population. Our results reveal how human-transformed landscapes can affect genetic connectivity even in a large-sized and highly mobile mammal such as the wild boar, and provide crucial information to manage the spread of pathogens, including the African Swine Fever virus, endemic in Sardinia.

AB  - Landscape connectivity is essential to conserving resilient wildlife populations in the Anthropocene. Maintaining connectivity requires preserving or restoring patches of habitat, accounting for the behavioral factors that determine movement between patches and mitigating threats. We measured natural and anthropogenic features that influence movement and mortality for bobcats (Lynx rufus) in a system threatened with complete isolation by urbanization. Our overarching objective was to inform local land acquisition and restoration to maintain two last-chance wildlife corridors. We collected five-minute movement data from 36 bobcats in central California to assess features of road-crossing hotspots and model habitat selection, including functional responses to housing densities and vegetation. We collected opportunistic mortalities and assessed rat poison exposure to evaluate edge effects as acute threats. Bobcats strongly selected for natural vegetation, evident at the level of a single tree or shrub. Individuals selected low-density housing (<5 houses/ha) yet avoided high-density housing development and monoculture agriculture. Narrow (<25 m wide) riparian strips were critical to connectivity. Bobcats successfully crossed the busiest highway in the landscape but frequently died when crossing a less-trafficked road with a high median barrier. Vehicles and disease were dominant sources of mortality, while 94% of bobcats were exposed to rat poisons despite California's 2014 regulations implemented to reduced wildlife exposure. Maintaining landscape connectivity requires conserving key habitats, mitigating the effects of infrastructure, and sustaining populations of highly mobile, healthy individuals. Our findings have driven conservation action through land acquisition. We demonstrate how robust, rapid data collection can facilitate real-world conservation outcomes.

AB  - We explored how a woody plant invader affected riparian bird assemblages. We surveyed 15 200-m-long transects in riparian zones in a much-changed landscape of eastern Victoria, Australia. Abundance, species-richness, foraging-guild richness and composition of birds were compared in transects in three habitat types: (i) riparian zones dominated by the invasive willow Salix rubens; (ii) riparian zones lined with native woody species; and (iii) riparian zones cleared of almost all woody vegetation. We also measured abundance and richness of arthropods and habitat structure to explore further the effects of food resources and habitat on the avifauna. We observed 67 bird species from 14 foraging guilds. Native riparian transects had more birds, bird species and foraging guilds than willow-invaded or cleared transects. Habitat complexity increased from cleared to willow-invaded to native riparian transects, as did abundance of native and woodland-dependent birds. Native shrub and trees species had more foliage and branch-associated arthropods than did willows, consistent with a greater abundance and variety of foraging guilds of birds dependent on this resource. Willow spread into cleared areas is unlikely to facilitate greatly native bird abundance and diversity even though habitat complexity is increased. Willow invasion into the native riparian zone, by decreasing food resources and altering habitat, is likely to reduce native bird biodiversity and further disrupt connectivity of the riparian zone.

AB  - Simple Summary The continuous intensification of urbanisation has led to severe degradation and loss of bird habitats, directly affecting the diversity of birds. In this study, we focused on seven representative river wetlands around Chaohu Lake (China) to analyse the impact of urbanisation on bird diversity. The species richness at sections of the lake entrance was higher than in the middle sections of the river, and the Shannon-Wiener index during autumn was higher than that during winter. Urbanisation was an important driving factor that changed land use types near rivers and the structure of bird communities. The response model of river ecological indicators to the intensity of urbanisation shows a negative exponential correlation between the waterbird diversity index and the urbanisation intensity. Our research is of great significance for future urban landscape planning and bird community diversity protection. Urbanisation is known to result in 'urban stream syndrome', which poses a huge threat to the river health. Birds, which are an important part of the river ecosystem, are sensitive to environmental changes in the basin. The ratio of the impervious surface area is a macroscopic indicator of urbanisation intensity in river basins. In this study, we combined the results of a year-round field survey of seven river wetlands around Chaohu Lake (China) with satellite remote sensing image data from the same period. The species richness at sections of the lake entrance was higher than in the middle sections of the river, and the Shannon-Wiener index during autumn was higher than that during winter. The waterbird diversity index declined exponentially with increases in the intensity of urbanisation. The changes in the land use patterns around river wetlands associated with urbanisation resulted in the loss of food resources and habitats. Therefore, the intensity of urbanisation was an important driving factor that leads to changes in the bird community structure of river wetlands, so it had a significant impact on the diversity of river wetland birds in all four seasons combined with a variety of influencing factors. Our research could be a guide for urban landscape planning and bird diversity protection. For example, the results suggested that it is necessary to identify river wetlands as an important part of the urban ecosystem, reduced building area, increased vegetation coverage, and retained slope protection and river beach land.

AB  - Black-headed Gulls Larus ridibundus (BHGs) in urban areas are a public nuisance. The aim of this study is to investigate the factors affecting the occurrence and abundance of the BHG foraging in urban areas in winter. The study was conducted in the city of Krakow (southern Poland) in four easily identifiable urban habitats: (1) areas with blocks of flats, (2) areas with congested housing, (3) detached single-family housing and (4) green areas. In each of these four habitats, 60 small (1-ha) plots were randomly chosen, and the bird's presence and abundance were noted. Results revealed that birds occurred most frequently and in the largest numbers in plots with blocks of flats and green areas as well as plots located close to rivers and water reservoirs. This highlights the importance of ecological corridors and stepping-stones for the presence of this species in the city. Food resources had no effect on the presence of the gulls but the abundance of the species was positively correlated with the number of litter-bins. This indicates that local food resources could be more important than large landfills for this species in urban habitats during winter. No human disturbance indices had an effect on the occurrence and abundance of the BHG. Higher temperature and lack of snow cover positively affected utilization of the urban habitats by the species that indicates that global warming may speed up synurbanization of the BHG. To control the number of BHGs in urban areas, we suggest preventing access to local food resources by placing litter bins with waste baskets that are inaccessible to animals. Also, the public should behave appropriately towards gulls and refrain from feeding them intentionally.

AB  - Stormwater retention ponds in urbanizing catchments are constructed to collect and treat runoff from impervious surfaces. Amphibians often inhabit retention ponds, which may partly offset the loss of natural wetlands resulting from urbanization. We investigated the use of retention ponds by frogs in a rapidly-urbanizing region of south-eastern Australia to (1) determine the habitat attributes associated with individual species, and (2) recommend specific wetland design criteria to enhance populations of frog species in the region and in other urbanizing areas throughout their distribution. We detected nine species of frogs during calling surveys at 30 retention pond sites in Greater Melbourne, 2008-2010. There were contrasting differences in habitat associations among five species for which we produced regression models of abundance or occurrence. The mean abundance of Crinia signifera increased with site area, whereas Limnodynastes dumerilii was associated with smaller sites. The occurrence of L. dumerilii was positively associated with waterbody shore depth, whereas L. peronii and L. tasmaniensis were associated with shallow shores. Two species were positively associated with time since construction or since dredging of a site, whereas the occurrence of L. dumerilii decreased with site age. Aquatic vegetation at a site was important for the occurrence of L. peronii and Litoria ewingii. There was evidence for a positive effect of aquatic connectivity on the occurrence of Limnodynastes peronii, which emphasizes the importance of riparian corridors in urban settings. These results highlight the contrasting differences in habitat associations among species in the region. We recommend that retention ponds in our region and elsewhere be constructed or enhanced to include specific habitat attributes that were found to be associated with different amphibian species. We recommend long-term monitoring at sites to determine whether retention ponds augment existing frog populations or contribute to declines.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict is increasing as urbanization expands and wildlife species adjust to living near people. Translocation is often used to manage human-wildlife conflict because it is considered to be humane, yet fates of translocated animals are largely unknown. As an urban adapter, woodchucks (Marmota monax) are a common source of human-wildlife conflict due to their burrowing, foraging, and scent-marking behavior. We examined survival and movements of 27 nuisance woodchucks captured by a nuisance wildlife operator in the Chicago metropolitan area, radiomarked with internal transmitters, and translocated to exurban release sites mimicking typical practices. We also captured and radiomarked 16 resident woodchucks from the release landscape for comparison. Translocated woodchucks moved farther than residents immediately post release with no evidence of homing and most left the release site. Annual survival did not differ between translocated and resident woodchucks. However, survival was extremely low (0.18) compared to previous estimates for woodchucks, primarily due to high predation by coyotes (Canis latrans). Translocation should be used only when other nonlethal methods are ineffective (e.g., exclusion, removing food sources, selecting unpalatable plants for gardens). When necessary, the practice of translocation could be improved by reducing predation risk for translocated animals, either by selecting release sites with low predation risk, or by using soft-release methods, such as acclimation enclosures or artificial burrows.

AB  - The Amazon has a long history of disturbance under subsistence agriculture, but slash-and-burn agriculture is small in scale and has relatively low impact on resident avifauna. More recently, the Amazon has suffered extensive deforestation in favor of cattle ranching and other modern systems of agriculture. Cattle pastures, mechanized agriculture, and even tree plantations have detrimental effects on bird communities, greatly lowering diversity, especially that of primary forest interior specialists. A rising threat to the Amazon is the spread of oil palm plantations that retain few bird species and are not viable alternatives to forest. Embedded within the expanding agropastoral mosaic are forest fragments that have experienced a well-documented loss of diversity. Yet, the matrix can mitigate the recovery of fragmented bird communities depending on the type of secondary regrowth. Connectivity via matrix habitats or forest corridors is critical for the maintenance of forest avifauna. With so many types of land use developing across the Amazon, the "tropical countryside" has potential value for bird diversity. However, evidence suggests that the agropastoral mosaic harbors a small, more homogenized avifauna with few forest species, especially when primary forest is absent from the landscape. For the Amazon Basin's bird life to be conserved into the future, preservation of large tracts of well-connected primary forest is vital. Tropical countryside dominated by agriculture simply cannot sustain sufficient levels of biodiversity.

AB  - Forest fragmentation constitutes one of the main consequences of land cover change worldwide. Through this process gaps in habitat coverage are created and the ability of populations in the remaining fragments to maintain themselves is put in doubt. Hence, two options need to be considered: conserving the remaining forest fragments, and restoring habitat in some deforested patches with the aim of reestablishing the connections among the fragments. We established a mathematical index (SIR) that describes the suitability of individual habitat patches for restoration within a landscape. The index considers classes of distances among fragments and categories of habitat quality in the areas surrounding the fragments to assess habitat quality in terms of probability of dispersal and survival of propagules (especially seeds and cutting). In the present study, we created detailed maps depicting SIR values for two periods (1988 and 2011) for Sorocaba region (Sao Paulo State, Brazil). We derived land cover maps from satellite images for the two years of our study, and then surveyed the transition of land cover categories and landscape metrics between years. A model for the SIR was created using a map of distance classes among fragments and also a map of habitat quality established according to each land cover category. For both 1988 and 2011, pasture was the predominant land cover category. The main land cover transitions were from pasture to urban (10.6%) and from pasture to forest fragments (13.4%). Although the land cover class "wood sites" increased, the data of SIR revealed that the areas of habitat categorized as excellent and good both decreased, while habitat classes categorized as poor and very poor increased. Our model has the potential to be applied to other regions where the forest is fragmented. Hence, local policy makers will be able to use this model to determine local patches of high value for conservation and also the most ideal locations for restoration projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Urbanization changes bird community structure during the breeding season but little is known about its effects on migrating birds. We examined patterns of habitat use by birds at the local and landscape level during 2002 spring migration at 71 riparian plots along an urban gradient in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. Using linear regression, we examined variation in relative density, species richness, and evenness of four migratory guilds associated with natural land covers and building area at four scales (50, 100, 250, 500 m radial buffers). We also examined the influence of local vegetation using multiple regression models. As building area increased, riparian forests tended to be narrower and have fewer native trees and shrubs. In general, native birds were positively associated with tree cover (within 250500 m of stream) and native vegetation, and negatively with building area (within 250 m); exotic species responded inversely to these measures. Short-distance migrants and permanent residents displayed the weakest responses to landscape and vegetation measures. Neotropical migrants responded strongest to landscape and vegetation measures and were positively correlated with areas of wide riparian forests and less development (>250 m). Resident Neotropical migrants increased with wider riparian forests (>500 m) without buildings, while en-route migrants utilized areas having a wide buffer of tree cover (250500 m) regardless of buildings; both were positively associated with native vegetation composition and mature trees. Consequently, developed areas incorporating high native tree cover are important for conserving Neotropical migrants during stopover. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) maps are a key input in environmental evaluations for the sustainable planning and management of socio-ecological systems. While the impact of map spatial resolution on environmental assessments has been evaluated by several studies, the effect of thematic resolution (the level of detail of LU/LC typologies) is discordant and still poorly investigated. In this paper, four scenarios of thematic resolutions, corresponding to the four levels of the CORINE classification scheme, have been compared in a real case study of landscape connectivity assessment, a major aspect for the biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service provision. The PANDORA model has been employed to investigate the effects of LULC thematic resolution on Bio-Energy Landscape Connectivity (BELC) at the scale of the whole system, landscape units, and single land cover patches, also in terms of ecosystem services. The results show different types of impacts on landscape connectivity due to the changed spatial pattern of the LULC classes across the four thematic resolution scenarios. Moreover, the main priority areas for conservation objectives and future sustainable urban expansion have been identified. Finally, several indications are given for supporting practitioners and researchers faced with thematic resolution issues in environmental assessment and land use planning.

AB  - The use of Trojan Y chromosomes (TYC) for controlling invasive species involves manipulating the sex chromosomes of captive-raised individuals. Following release, the offspring of these individuals consist of only one sex, thereby skewing the sex ratio of the invasive population and potentially leading to eradication. Simulation models are needed that can inform managers about how to maximize the likelihood of invasive species eradication, since implementation of this novel management approach in the field is still rare.
   Here, we present the first spatially explicit, mechanistic simulation model of a real-world TYC program for invasive species eradication. Using a brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis system model, we investigated the effects of competitive and reproductive fitness of the captive-raised YY males, dispersal behaviour upon their release and landscape heterogeneity on eradication success.
   Likelihood of eradication was dependent on both the competitive and reproductive fitness of the Trojan individuals. Competitive fitness (i.e. survival) had a higher threshold for eradication, below which the invasive populations were not eradicated.
   Movement ecology of both the wild and YY male populations was important for eradication. Under a restricted dispersal scenario for YY males following their release, the wild population was not extirpated but maintained a stable, yet reduced, population size. Analysis of landscape configuration indicated that time to eradication of local patches increased with greater connectivity within the stream network.
   In addition to sex ratio distortion, density-dependent mortality resulting from outplantings made an important contribution to population decline and therefore may also affect native competitors.
   Synthesis and applications. The use of Trojan sex chromosomes to skew population sex ratios is a novel method for the suppression and eradication of aquatic invasive species. Results from our modelling work indicate that while eradication is possible, maximizing its likelihood requires an understanding of the fitness and movement ecology of both the wild and YY male populations of the invasive species. Both our model and the principles derived from this study related to fitness and behavioural landscape ecology can be broadly applied to other invaded species and systems.

AB  - Kucukcekmece, is one of the important districts to define the city of Istanbul at the international level with its historical, cultural, and natural values. In this study, the parks in Kucukcekmece District were examined in terms of ecological quality, principles, and standards. Ecological quality is a composite of the structural and functional features determining the habitat values of a landscape. An objective evaluation on the ecological quality of parks is important from the point of rehabilitation from an existing situation, and providing areas which will have high habitat value in the future. Recovery in the existing park area will generate a livable urban atmosphere. In line with this basic comprehension, the ecological quality of the parks in Istanbul's Kucukcekmece District was examined. There are four principles determining ecological quality of an area: vegetative production, water, permeability (soil), and natural vegetation cover (biological diversity). This research was done in two phases regarding the permeability and natural vegetation cover using ecological quality principles.
   In the first phase of the study, a vegetation list was provided by the Park and Garden Department of the Kucukcekmece Municipality, The park names and size were acquired from the "Kucukcekmece District green corridor Transformation Project". The space where the soil surface is covered by soil material, or is suppressed because of overuse and can not sustain plant growth is accepted as an impermeable soil surface. Whether there is a relation between park areas and permeable surface areas was examined using the Spearman correlation test. Whether permeability ratio of parks changes according to their location was analyzed using the Chi-Square test.
   In the second stage of the study, the existing vegetation cover was analyzed on-site. Existing vegetation cover analysis is made according to trees, shrubs, bushes, flowers, and trailings.
   Findings of, this study show that the average permeability ratio is 35.19% and the naturality ratio is 52% in the 63 parks under examination. This study shows that the permeable land surfaces of the parks remain incapable of sustaining vegetative growth and therefore the habitat values of the park areas, which can have an economic, social and ecologic contribution to the urban environment, will reduce.
   Result of this study will contribute to the sampling used for the ecological quality principles in other parks in other districts. The study reveals the importance of the ecological quality factors that need to be taken into consideration in the design and planning of parks.

AB  - The availability of pollen in urban-rural landscapes is an essential factor that influences the population dynamics of insect pollinators. The amount and diversity of pollen play a pivotal role in the foraging ecology of pollinators for their growth and health, but investigations on the spatio-temporal patterns of foraged plants remain rare, especially in cities as neo - ecosystems. Here, we explored the temporal foraging habits of a highly pollinator (Apis mellifera L.) in Tokyo, including different landscape classes from rural to urban areas. Mixed-pollen samples in each month and each location (N = 17) were analysed using DNA meta-barcoding to identify plants visited by honeybees. The results showed that the landscape class (rural, suburban and urban areas) explains spatial variations in pollen source-plant composition foraged by honeybees, but not in taxa richness. Furthermore, pollen diversity and pollen source-plant composition showed a strong seasonal dependence. A higher plant richness and foraged woody taxa was found to occur in spring, which was mainly dominated by the genera Prunus and Acer. In summer and autumn, the genera Trifolium and Plantago of the herbaceous stratum were the most visited plants. The Fabaceae, Rosaceae, Brassicaceae, Plantaginaceae, and Onagraceae plant families were the most frequently observed in all combined samples. The present study contributes to a deeper understanding of the foraging ecology of A. mellifera colonies across urban-rural gradient surrounding mega-cities such as Tokyo.

AB  - Wildlife crossing structures (WCS) are widely used to allow for safe animal movement across roads, promoting both human safety and wildlife conservation. These structures are expensive to build and maintain, and therefore cost-effective design is essential. Although there has been much research to date on the factors affecting the usage of WCS by wildlife, no attempt has been made to synthesize these results and assess the current state of knowledge. We conducted a systematic review of the scientific and profes-sional literature to assess the state of empirical evidence on WCS and a meta-analysis to explore the factors that influence their effectiveness. We identified a total of 270 studies that reported empirical results span-ning four decades of research. Most studies (161) measured the number of crossing events without moni-toring approaches to the structure, thus limiting the ability to assess WCS effectiveness. Only 77 studies measured the proportion of successful crossings to approaches, which was the type of data used for meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis results show that viaducts are the most effective type of WCS for large mammals. For example, the odds of ungulates crossing through a viaduct are 2.9 times that of an overpass, and 3.6 times that of an under-pass. WCS built specifically for wildlife are used significantly more than those built for dual use by humans and wildlife. For large carnivores, the odds of using a dedicated WCS are 15.9 times that of a structure used concur-rently by humans. We additionally found that natural materials and round shapes are preferable in the design of effective WCS. Altogether, these results highlight the importance of adopting large-scale monitoring of wildlife crossing structures. More broadly, we conclude that further research focusing on under-studied species and structure characteristics is needed to facilitate cost-effective mitigation efforts that reduce wildlife-vehicle colli-sions and promote wildlife conservation.

AB  - Multi-tenure reserve networks aim to connect areas managed for biodiversity conservation across public and private land. This paper seeks to determine to what extent multi-tenure reserve networks improve the reserve design and connectivity of the public protected area estate, using three networks in southeastern Australia as case studies. Network configuration varied considerably and those networks with generally larger parcels tended to be better connected. On average, public land components were larger than private land components in all networks. Two networks had 18 components physically adjoining other network components while another had only 6 components adjoining. Importantly for two of the networks, the average distance between the nearest neighbouring component was significantly less than average distances between public protected areas in the subregion. Thus these multi-tenure reserve networks acted to enhance the existing public protected area estate by increasing the potential linkages in the landscape and therefore the viability of individual public protected areas.

AB  - This study examines the potential for ecological engineering to enhance the beneficial ecosystem services provided by birds in tropical rice fields. Bird activities were monitored at six sites in the Philippines with high-diversity vegetation patches (HDVPs) established as an ecological engineering approach to restore ecosystem services. Adjacent plots of conventional rice were monitored as controls. Predatory birds (shrikes, Lanius spp., grassbirds, Megalurus palustris, and kingfishers, Halcyon spp.) were more active in the ecological engineering fields where they foraged for arthropods and snails among the rice plants. Pied trillers, Lalage nigra, and yellow vented bulbuls, Pycnonotus goiavier, foraged more in the HDVPs than in rice. These birds mainly responded to the availability of bamboo for perching in the HDVPs, although patch vegetation beneath the bamboo was also used for perching by some species. Aerial hunters such as swallows, Hirundo spp., avoided HDVPs likely because the tall vegetation and bamboo stakes represented an obstacle for their flight. Small changes in the design of HDVPs could avoid any negative effects on foraging by swallows and swifts. The results indicate that ecological engineering of rice paddies can have multiple benefits for farmers and the environment, including improved nutrition for farming communities, the creation of habitat for wildlife, and the enhancement of regulatory ecosystem services provided by insectivorous and snail-eating birds.

AB  - Evaluating the influences of LUCC (Land Use/Land Cover Change) on landscape pattern is significant for understanding and improving ecological environment system management. This study used landscape pattern as an important indicator to estimate the impacts of the LUCC in the Yangtze River Basin from 2001 to 2019. Based on the remote sensing images of LULC (Land Use/Land Cover) in the Yangtze River Basin in 2001-2019, the dynamic attitude and transfer matrix of LULC, and landscape pattern indices were employed to analyze the LUCC and the impact of LULC on the landscape pattern of the Yangtze River Basin. The results of LUCC show that the main LUCC in the Yangtze River Basin during 2001-2019 is mainly manifested by the increase of water body, forest, wetland, crop/natural vegetation mosaic (NVM) and urban, among which the forest increased the most by 62,635 km2. The areas of grassland and cropland are decreasing, with the grassland decreasing the most. Forest, crop/NVM and cropland are transformed into grassland, which complements the lack of grassland to some extent. LUCC in the Yangtze River Basin is most intense between grassland and forest. Landscape pattern shows: Grassland occupies an important advantage in the whole landscape structure. Forest, grassland and urban landscapes are seriously fragmented, and their LSI (Landscape Shape Index) is more complex than others. The connectivity between various landscape types is weakened, and the degree of landscape fragmentation is increased, but the LULC structure is becoming more and more abundant. The areas with high landscape fragmentation value have richer landscape diversity and diverse LULC types. There is a strong correlation between grassland and the four landscape pattern indices. The change of landscape pattern in the Yangtze River Basin is influenced by natural factors and LUCC in the Yangtze River Basin, and the change caused by human activities is the main driving factor of LUCC.

AB  - The biodiversity loss resulting from rising levels of human impacts on ecosystems has been extensively discussed over the last years. The expansion of urban areas promotes drastic ecological changes, especially through fragmentation of natural areas. Natural grassland remnants surrounded by an urban matrix are more likely to undergo disturbance events. Since grassland ecosystems are closely related to disturbances such as fire and grazing, grassland plant communities, pollinators, and their interaction networks may be especially sensitive to urban expansion, because it promotes habitat fragmentation and modifies disturbance regimes. This work evaluated the effect of the level of urbanization and recent history of fire disturbance on grassland plants communities and plant-floral visitor mutualistic networks. We sampled plant communities and floral visitors in 12 grassland sites with different levels of urbanization and time since the last fire event. Sites with higher levels of urbanization showed higher values for plant species richness, floral visitor richness, and network asymmetry. All sampled networks were significantly nested (with one exception), asymmetric, and specialized. In addition, all networks presented more modules than expected by chance. The frequency of fire disturbance events increased with the level of urbanization. Since grassland ecosystems depend on disturbances to maintain their structure and diversity, we inferred that the history of fire disturbance was the mechanism behind the relationship between urbanization and our biological descriptors. Our findings highlight the importance of small and isolated grassland remnants as conservation assets within urban areas, and that the disturbance events that such sites are submitted to may in fact be what maintains their diversity on multiple levels.

AB  - Conserving biodiversity in an era of rapid climate change requires understanding the mechanisms that influence dispersal, gene flow and, ultimately, species persistence. This information is becoming critical for conserving key species in rapidly warming places such as the Arctic. Arctic freshwater fish not only face warmer conditions, but also the drying of tundra streams due to climate change. Here, we examined population structure, gene flow, and the influence of landscape features on the neutral genetic variation of the Arctic grayling on Alaska's North Slope. We estimated the number of genetically distinct clusters and determined effective population sizes for and patterns of gene flow among geographic regions. We predicted that river distance, river drying, distance to the coast, and elevational gradient would influence genetic differentiation for Arctic grayling. Bayesian clustering and discriminant analysis of principal components found support for five or six genetic clusters roughly corresponding to downstream and headwater subwatersheds. Estimates of gene flow revealed asymmetric downstream bias. River distance and river dry zones were significantly associated with increasing genetic differentiation among sampling locations despite this species' high dispersal capability and the temporary nature of dry zones. Isolation and downstream-biased dispersal could contribute to high levels of inter-population genetic variation among the headwaters of the North Slope Arctic grayling metapopulation, which might be particularly important for species conservation during rapid climate change. More generally, small, isolated populations might drive particular alleles to higher frequencies due to selection or drift, thus promoting the genetic potential for rapid evolutionary changes under future climate change.

AB  - Variations in spatial and temporal availability of fruits and seeds in oases are important not only for animal seeking resources, but also for palm population dynamics. We explored spatial association patterns between avian frugivores and blue fan palms in two natural palm patches of Baja California. Spatial patterns were analyzed at the individual tree and at 2 ha patches. We evaluated seed predation by vertebrates and invertebrates, and vertebrate seed dispersal around palms. Birds responded to fruit aggregation at the individual tree and the patch scales, but responses varied between patches. Palm fruit variables-the quantity and the phenological phase-and avian visits showed strong spatial aggregation and association at both scales in one patch, but not in the other. The intensities of seed predation and seed dispersal were significantly higher directly below palms than at >3 m away from them. Patches differed in the intensity of seed predation around palms and in the diversity of mammalian dispersers, but not in the intensity of seed dispersal, Blue fan palms function as important resources' focuses for a great number of animals that use palm oases as corridors, bringing seeds as they move and connecting isolated populations of palms.

AB  - The text analyzes the landscape relations defined over an approach to the study area in the urban perimeter axis situated between Colonia Valentina Sur and Balsa Las Perlas. The space was approached in detail because of its characteristics and the dynamic in the transformation of the agriculture production system and the natural coastal ecosystem to urban uses. Satellite images CBERS - 2B were analyzed and processed with ENVI and restitutions of the ex Enterprise HIDRONOR SE. A non supervised classification ISODATA was made, adopting the MUC classes and field data. Four metrics of landscape were stated in different scales as measure of the relation of different components that form complexity.
   The results allow us to establish that special processes of different scales merge in a synchronic way and favour the invasion conditions of exotic species that heighten the structural heterogeneity of the ecosystem. The abandon of productive lands and windbreaker curtains, the control of flows incurred by the presses up Limay and the refunction of the lands for Real Estate speculation configure the space conditions of the formation of new vegetation patches and functional types of the coastal and urban perimeter neo ecosystem. The distribution of ruderal and arvense vegetation, the invasions that domain the most of the shrub stratum and the coastal woods and secondary in abandon farms, express a measure of the connectivity established by the nets of water fluxes. The geometry of fluvial geoforms and the irrigation system favoured the invasions directed by Populus nigra and Salix alba. The indexes of complexity of landscape explain the diversity and dominant covertures. The patches distributions that increase the global diversity of the system correspond to abrupt gradients of wood pastureland, depending on how surface and irregular geometries are distributed.

AB  - Dispersal distance of bobcats (Lynx rufus) can be affected by many factors: age and sex, bobcat density, prey abundance, and landscape permeability. Female offspring typically remain near their natal range, whereas males travel farther distances. Studies report dispersal distances between 10 and 85 km, with distances >= 80 km being rare. We report dispersal distances of two male bobcats in the Southern High Plains of Texas, and one male bobcat from the Rio Grande Plains of South Texas. The two male bobcats of Southern High Plains traveled 63 and 133 km and the male bobcat of Rio Grande Plains traveled 100 km. Severe droughts occurred in both regions during dispersal, which may have influenced distance traveled. In all cases, it is likely that nearby available territories were occupied by older resident bobcats, thus eliciting the need for longer-distanced dispersal to secure a permanent home range.

AB  - Facing increasing human demands on Earth, understanding how endangered species may survive in isolated remnants of natural habitat within heavily transformed landscapes is key to contemporary conservation biology. Against this background we here investigate the factors affecting pond occupancy in the endangered European tree frog (Hyla arborea L.) within an urban landscape, being located in north-eastern Germany where the species is still fairly common. Our survey revealed that 58 out of 122 ponds were occupied by H. arborea. Ponds with a higher percentage of floating vegetation, being deeper and surrounded by higher percentages of crop fields and forests were more likely to be occupied, while factors associated with urbanization such as the percentage of built-up area were strongly detrimental. Habitat requirements of H. arborea were complex as occurrence was simultaneously affected by different spatial scales, including the landscape scale, the immediate surroundings of ponds and the ponds themselves. H. arborea avoided highly urbanized areas, but occurred frequently in agricultural areas surrounding the city. The latter suggests that this species is fairly tolerant towards human-induced transformations, and that vast arable fields yielded positive rather than negative effects on H. arborea occurrence. We conclude that the most important conservation issues for supporting H. arborea populations at the periphery of urbanized areas are (1) maintaining an open (agricultural) landscape structure, (2) providing undisturbed overwintering habitats, and (3) maintaining pond quality by halting shrub and tree encroachment.

AB  - Landscape connectivity is important for conserving wildlife in spaces shared with humans. Yet, differences in human attitudes and behaviors within movement corridors can lead to spatial variation in the risks humans pose to wildlife. Mapping the spatial pattern of attitudes toward wildlife provides a useful tool for measuring this variation and promoting connectivity. We surveyed ranchers (n = 505) in the High Divide region in eastern Idaho and western Montana (United States) about their attitudes toward grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) - a species that can pose risks to livestock and human safety. We assessed spatial variation in rancher acceptance of grizzly bears by combining survey and spatial predictors. Ranchers surrounded by more conservation easements and wildland-urban interface reported more positive attitudes toward grizzlies. Ranch size, experience with bears, and off-ranch income sources helped to further explain relationships between predictors and ranchers' acceptance of grizzlies. Our predictive map of acceptance provides spatially explicit information for targeted, pre-emptive conflict mitigation and a baseline for examining spatiotemporal changes in human attitudes as grizzly bear populations expand in the region. Integrating human social factors into spatial connectivity planning may better inform how organizations approach landowners and allow for a more strategic, sustainable approach to connectivity and conservation decision-making.

AB  - Riparian corridors promote dispersal of several species of exotic invasives worldwide. Dispersal plays a role in the colonization of exotic invasive species into new areas and this study was conducted to determine if the invasiveness of Dioscorea oppositifolia L. (Chinese yam) is facilitated by secondary dispersal of vegetative diaspores (bulbils) by water. Since seed production of this plant has not been observed in the United States, bulbils represent the only means of dispersal to new habitats. Dispersal was monitored by placing aquatic traps, tethered bulbils, and painted bulbil caches in a tributary of Drury Creek, Giant City State Park, Illinois. Results indicate that high-energy flow in the creek accelerated secondary dispersal of bulbils downstream and onto the floodplain. The longest recorded dispersal distance was 206.2 in downstream. Dispersal distance of tethered bulbils was not related to rainfall or flow velocity in the creek; however the total number of bulbils trapped was positively related to flow velocity. We conclude that secondary dispersal by water in streams can facilitate dispersal of vegetative bulbils of this exotic species.

AB  - Historically ubiquitous throughout the state, Florida's only two extant large carnivores, the federally endangered Florida panther and black bear, are now geographically restricted with small populations. Rapid human population growth and sea level rise (SLR) threaten to diminish these species' habitats. To aid landscape-scale conservation efforts, we estimated changes in habitat across a set of alternative future land-use and SLR projections. Intermediate-high (0.9 m) to extreme (1.8 m) SLR projections inundated 2.2-4.8% of panther and 3.3-5.4% of bear habitat by 2070. Unmitigated urban sprawl with minor protection policies (a Trend 2070 land-use projection) eliminated 8.8% of panther and 11.3% of bear habitat but increased protected habitat by 3.3%. In contrast, increased urban densities coupled with extensive land protection policies (an Alternative 2070 land-use projection) eliminated 4.1% of panther and 7.3% of bear habitat, and it increased protected habitat 52.1% for panther and 64.1% for bear. In combination, the Trend 2070 and extreme SLR projections reduced protected habitat 3.4% for panther and 6.6% for bear. However, the Alternative 2070 projection offset habitat area lost to extreme SLR, increasing protected habitat 45.3% for panther and 51.6% for bear. Protecting land along the Caloosahatchee River may accommodate panther dispersal to large habitat patches in northern Florida, while protecting inland habitat corridors may compensate for black bear habitat connectivity lost to inundation along the Gulf Coast. These alternative future projections prognosticate the impacts of climate and land-use change on the viability of Florida's two large carnivores.

AB  - Terrestrial mammalian carnivores are generally sensitive to urbanization. Yet, some mesocarnivores have adapted to the urban and suburban environment. The response of small carnivores to urbanization is poorly studied, partly due to methodological difficulties. We assessed the impact of urbanization on a representative of small carnivores - the least weasel Mustela nivalis. Data from 254 trapping sessions of monitoring small mammals (27 810 trap-days) conducted in different urbanized and non-urbanized habitats (Poland, Central Europe) were used and analysed in a logistic regression model. The probability of occurrence of weasels was tested in relation to the land cover type, abundance of rodents (weasel's food base), proportion of a built-up area (on the 500 m radius buffer) and trapping effort. The weasel avoided urban areas and if the percentage of a built-up area was higher than 32% the probability of occurrence of the weasel was low (P < 0.5). Within urbanized areas, least weasel were only detected on the outskirts of a city or in the valleys of large rivers. Conversely, habitat type did not predict the presence of least weasel in non-urbanized areas. The possible reasons for the lack of the weasel in urban green areas are narrow food specialization (mainly rodents as prey; no use of anthropogenic food sources), high energetic demands, and fragmentation and isolation of green areas. Despite the high ecological plasticity of this species, the strong negative response of the least weasel to urbanization causes that their occurrence can be an indicator of well-planned urban greenery. The occurrence of the least weasel indicates both the functional connectivity of green areas in the city and the abundance and availability of the prey base - ground-dwelling animals from lower trophic groups.

AB  - Network analysis has revealed several whole-network properties hypothesized to be general characteristics of ecosystems including pathway proliferation, and network non-locality, homogenization, amplification, mutualism and synergism. Collectively these six properties characterize the impact of indirect interactions among ecosystem elements. While ecosystem networks generally trace a thermodynamically conserved unit through the system, there appear to be several model classes. For example, trophic (TRO) networks are built around a food web, usually follow energy or carbon, and are the most abundant models in the literature. Biogeochemical cycling (BGC) networks trace nutrients like nitrogen or phosphorus and tend to have more aggregated nodes, less dissipation, and more recycling than TRO. We tested (1) the hypothesized generality of the properties in BGC networks and (2) that the properties tend to be more strongly expressed in BGC networks than in the TRO networks due to increased recycling. We compared the properties in 22 biogeochemical and 51 trophic ecosystem networks from the literature using enaR, and evaluated the robustness of these results with an uncertainty analysis. The results generally support the hypotheses. First, five of the properties occurred in varying degrees in all 22 BGC models, while network mutualism occurred in 86% of the models. Furthermore, these results were generally robust to a +/- 50% uncertainty in the model parameters. Second, the average network statistics for the six properties were statistically significantly greater in the BGC models than the TRO models. These results (1) confirm the general presence of these properties in ecosystem networks, (2) highlight the significance of different model types in determining property intensities and (3) provide a set of indicator benchmarks for future systems comparisons. Furthermore, this work highlights how indirect effects distributed by network connectivity can transform species relationships, making them more mutualistic, and changing whole-ecosystem development and functioning.

AB  - River areas are undoubtedly among the most valuable territorial areas in Europe, not only in terms of their eco-landscape and use but also, culturally. However, there is currently a sharp reduction in the extension and increase of deterioration of riverbanks around the world. A substantial part of losses and deterioration are associated with the artificialization of the territories, derived mainly from a less than respectful urbanization around these landscapes. Urban and peri-urban riverbanks are landscapes in expansion due to the continuous growth of built-up spaces. Therefore, they should be areas of preferential consideration, especially in territories with a marked tendency to dryness, like the centre of the Iberian Peninsula. This article aims to contribute to our understanding of these spaces through the study of four distinct cases in the centre of the peninsula, in particular: the river Manzanares running through the city of Madrid, the river Tagus in Toledo and running through Talavera de la Reina, and the river Henares in Guadalajara. Three of the four urban water courses analyzed are zones of special interest for waterfowl: they sustain a winter population that varies between 745 and 1529 birds and they provide a home to some globally threatened species. The density of the riparian birds is also very high during winter, these values oscillating between a mean of 141.16 and 240.12 birds/10 ha. It should be noted that the diversity of this group of birds in the four regions studies is also high (H > 2.4 nats). The article also examines the interventions and the urban planning criteria applied to these urban and peri-urban river spaces, inferring the need to reassess urban planning in river areas to ensure it is compatible with their operation, values and possible uses.

AB  - Computational methods for marine reserve design are frequently used as decision-support tools for the identification of conservation areas. Most reserve-selection algorithms minimise the cost of the reserve system whilst aiming to meet specified biodiversity objectives. Here, we extend a widely-used selection algorithm, Marxan, to incorporate several important considerations related to biodiversity processes and management. First we relax the scorched earth assumption to allow conservation features in non-reserve zones to contribute explicitly to conservation objectives. To achieve this, we generate conservation targets at landscape scales rather than focusing purely on the representation of features within reserves. Second, we develop the notion of spatial dependencies further to incorporate spatial heterogeneity in the value of individual conservation features such as habitat types. We use the example of ontogenetic migrations of fish from mangroves to coral reefs because it nicely demonstrates how spatial ecological processes generate predictable heterogeneity in habitat value that should be considered in the reserve design process. Lastly, we show how habitat value can be disaggregated into ecosystem processes and services. Using it case study for the Belize Barrier Reef we compare reserve networks generated using our new approach with the results of traditional analyses. Consideration of the contribution of different protection zones, connectivity among habitats and more complex management goals resulted in up to a 52% increase in the mean biomass of commercially and ecologically-important fish species represented in the landscape, Our approach strengthens the ecological basis of reserve-design algorithms and might facilitate the uptake of ecosystem-based management into reserve design.

AB  - Powerline corridors through forested ecosystems have been criticised due their potential to fragment the landscape and facilitate the intrusion of undesirable species into natural areas. This study investigates the effects of vegetation management (slashing), on: (1) timing of small mammal recolonisation; (2) vegetation characteristics that drive small mammal responses; and (3) the point where corridor resources are sufficient to provide functional habitat for native species. Small mammal trapping was undertaken within Bunyip State Park, Australia, across three sites, once a month from January 2001 to May 2002 and every 2 months thereafter until January 2004. Changes in vegetation around each trap station were assessed annually in the forest and bi-annually in the corridor. Principal components analysis on the vegetation structural complexity values produced factors for use in species abundance models. Native small mammal species recolonised the corridor 1.5-3.5 years after management and the corridor supported a breeding population of small mammals around 2.5 years post-management. Males however, generally recolonised the corridor first, resulting in a sex-biased population in these areas. Species corridor habitat models for five native and one introduced species suggested cover and shelter were more important in determining corridor use than plant species per se. Powerline corridors have the potential to create a mixture of different successional stages, enhancing habitat availability for many species. However, the intensity of current management needs to be reduced and an integrated approach to management needs to be undertaken if powerline corridors are to continuously provide habitat for native small mammal species.

AB  - Many studies have underlined the fact that once forest continuity is broken, communities of wood-inhabiting organisms may never be restored to their original status. However, only a few studies have actually presented results from sites that have current old-growth structure, and where the history of human interventions is known. In this study we compared the species richness, nestedness, beta diversity, and composition of bryophytes from living trunks and dead logs of beech (Fagus sylvatica) in seven forest stands in the Czech Republic with old-growth structure and various histories of past human impact. Our analysis showed that these communities are nested and that their beta diversity is lower than random. There was a significant proportion of shared species, and rare species were present only in the most heterogeneous and the least man affected habitats. We found that bryophyte communities of forests with more intensive past management were significantly impoverished in terms of both species richness and composition. Beta diversity was not related to management history and reflected current habitat heterogeneity. The effect of decay stage on species richness and beta diversity was stronger than the site effect. Our results demonstrate that the protection of current natural beech-dominated forests and improvements to their connectivity in fragmented landscapes are crucial for the survival and restoration of the diversity of wood-inhabiting bryophytes.

AB  - This study focuses on the avian ecology and management of a 43.5 ha remnant hind-dune and estuary ecosystem in suburban Wollongong (population 200 000). In total, 62 land-bird species and 24 water-bird species were present between July 1984 and February 1987 (32 months). During area searches (n = 12) in each calendar month, an average of 427 individuals of 31 species was recorded with an average species diversity of 70%. The avian population was characterised by a small number of species with high abundance and vice versa. Five species were migratory. Resident species ranged in abundance from the Eastern Whipbird Psophodes olivaceus (maximum population eight birds) to the New Holland Honeyeater Phylidonyris novaehollandiae (maximum population 200 birds). Numbers of the latter species increased markedly in autumn and winter when banksia and coral trees were rich with nectar. Most terrestrial species were habitat specialists, linked to the various microhabitats for food, nesting or protection. Recommendations to preserve the bird community are as follows: (1) the catchment should be managed to control siltation and contamination of the wetland, rather than dredging the estuary itself, (2) wetland diversity should be maintained by allowing water levels to vary naturally; (3) terrestrial microhabitats should be preserved by maintaining their structural and floristic diversity; (4) refuge areas should be established to minimise the impact of human-related disturbance; (5) a network of corridors should be provided to facilitate movement of birds into the reserve; (6) a buffer zone should be maintained around the reserve to shield the birdlife from suburban disturbance and domestic animals.

AB  - Orchid bees are important pollinators in tropical forests. Although studies have already detected effects of habitat loss and forest fragmentation on bee assemblages, little is known about orchid bees in urban forest fragments. The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of forest fragments (size and edge index) and landscape features (forest cover area and built-up area around the forest fragments, connectivity and spatial distance from the urban center) on the abundance, richness and composition of orchid bees. Male bees were attracted by odoriferous baits and collected in ten forest fragments of different sizes. In total, we collected 3166 male bees belonging to 4 genera and 38 species. The increase of the built-up area and the reduction of the forest cover area around the forest fragments decreased the abundance and richness of bees. We recorded a smaller number of bees in areas closer to the urban center. We failed to find a significant relationship between abundance/richness of bees and forest fragment area, edge index, and connectivity. We observed that the faunistic dissimilarity was positively correlated with the geographic distance between forest fragments. The forest fragments that presented greater landscape dissimilarity also presented greater faunistic dissimilarity. Our results suggest that the matrix structure around the forest fragments is an important factor that influences the Euglossini bee assemblages inside these forest fragments. Based on our results, we believed that the conservation of fragments with a larger forest cover area and smaller built-up areas around them contribute to the maintenance of the diversity of orchid bees and their pollination services.

AB  - Metacommunity ecology provides a basis for understanding how ecological communities are assembled. Metacommunity theory can be applied to assess the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on freshwater communities. However, few studies have examined how species-specific responses to environmental covariates can generate broader patterns in freshwater metacommunities. I determined occupancy patterns in an amphibian metacommunity to identify important predictors of reproduction at wetland sites. I conducted surveys at 49 wetlands for tadpoles with fish traps and dip netting in an urbanising region in southeastern Australia. The larvae of seven frog species were detected. There were negative relationships between the probabilities of reproduction at a site and the relative abundance of the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) and wetland electrical conductivity. There was a positive relationship between tadpole occupancy and the proportion of accessible habitat within 1000 m of a site, a measure of the combined effects of roads and habitat amount. These results highlight the negative effect of predatory Gambusia on frog communities and illustrate the importance of the species-sorting and mass-effect perspectives of metacommunity theory at multiple spatial scales. Habitat restoration projects for amphibians should remove exotic fish or prevent their establishment in managed wetlands and maintain habitat connectivity to facilitate dispersal.

AB  - Human activity continues to impact global ecosystems, often by altering the habitat suitability, persistence, and movement of native species. It is thus critical to examine the population genetic structure of key ecosystemservice providers across human-altered landscapes to provide insight into the forces that limit wildlife persistence and movement across multiple spatial scales. While some studies have documented declines of bee pollinators as a result of human-mediated habitat alteration, others suggest that some bee species may benefit from altered land use due to increased food or nesting resource availability; however, detailed population and dispersal studies have been lacking. We investigated the population genetic structure of the Eastern carpenter bee,Xylocopa virginica,across 14 sites spanning more than 450 km, including dense urban areas and intensive agricultural habitat.X. virginicais a large bee which constructs nests in natural and human-associated wooden substrates, and is hypothesized to disperse broadly across urbanizing areas. Using 10 microsatellite loci, we detected significant genetic isolation by geographic distance and significant isolation by land use, where urban and cultivated landscapes were most conducive to gene flow. This is one of the first population genetic analyses to provide evidence of enhanced insect dispersal in human-altered areas as compared to semi-natural landscapes. We found moderate levels of regional-scale population structure across the study system (GMODIFIER LETTER PRIMEST = 0.146) and substantial co-ancestry between the sampling regions, where co-ancestry patterns align with major human transportation corridors, suggesting that human-mediated movement may be influencing regional dispersal processes. Additionally, we found a signature of strong site-level philopatry where our analyses revealed significant levels of high genetic relatedness at very fine scales (<1 km), surprising givenX. virginica'slarge body size. These results provide unique genetic evidence that insects can simultaneously exhibit substantial regional dispersal as well as high local nesting fidelity in landscapes dominated by human activity.

AB  - Human developments have detrimental effects on wildlife populations globally with carnivores being particularly sensitive. The bobcat (Lynx rufus) is often considered an adaptable mesocarnivore that occurs throughout varied landcover types within its wide distribution and may be less susceptible to the negative effects of development. Our objectives were to investigate the landscape occupancy dynamics of bobcats in a highly developed and densely populated region of the northeastern United States to evaluate the sensitivity of bobcat occurrence to natural and anthropogenic landscape features. We established a large-scale camera trapping survey throughout Rhode Island, USA, sampling from 2018 to 2020. Using dynamic occupancy models, we found initial site occupancy was positively influenced by the amount of forested wetland habitat, while increasing road density and shrub cover negatively influenced the probability of site colonization. Surprisingly, we found no hypothesized variables to influence site-level extirpation probability, or any seasonal effects on dynamic parameters. Lastly, we found that forest cover and road density negatively influenced the probability of detection. The probability of occupancy was high, >0.8, throughout much of the study area (49%), but we also found relatively high site transients, with the probability a site would change occurrence status from season to season at approximate to 0.27 in the majority of the study area (70%). Our results show that although bobcats can persist in human-dominated landscapes, they require contiguous natural areas to do so. Future expansion of road infrastructure may reduce habitat connectivity and increase road mortalities, thus jeopardizing the population.

AB  - 1. There is a growing concern that artificial light might affect local insect populations and disrupt their dispersal across the landscape. In this study, we investigated experimentally the effect of artificial light on flying insects in the field, with an emphasis on aquatic insects. We asked whether lights prevented the ability of insects to disperse across the landscape, a process that is crucial in colonising restored habitats.
   2. We set up six, c. 3.5m high downward facing high-pressure sodium streetlights along a permanently connected oxbow in the Spree River of eastern Germany. We collected insects using 12 flight intercept traps, each with trays at three different heights (0.5, 1.5 and 2.5m), placed at distances 0, 3, 40 and 75m from the lights and 5, 8 and 80m from water. The number of emerging aquatic insects in the study area was measured with six emergence traps. We emptied the traps 22 times between June and September 2010; the lights were on for 11 of these nights and off for the other 11.
   3. In total, we caught almost 27 times as many insects at traps 0m from the lights when the lights were on than when they were off. Most insects caught when the lights were on were aquatic, with Diptera being the most common order. Furthermore, the proportion of aquatic insects caught at traps 0, 3 and 40m from the lights when they were on was significantly higher than when they were off. On lit nights, more aquatic insects were captured per hour and m(2) (area in which flying insects were intercepted) at traps 0m from the lights than emerged from per square metre per hour from the Spree River.
   4. Our results suggest that adult aquatic insects can be negatively affected by artificial light and that city planners should take this into account when designing lighting systems along rivers.

AB  - Riparian forests are increasingly threatened by urban expansion and land use change worldwide. This study examined the relationships between landscape characteristics and woody plant diversity, structure, and composition of small order riparian corridors along an urban-rural land use gradient in the Georgia Piedmont, US. Riparian plant diversity, structure, and composition were related to landscape metrics and land use. Species richness was negatively associated with impervious surfaces and landscape diversity, and positively associated with forest cover and largest forest patch index. Shannon species diversity was strongly related to the biomass of non-native species, especially for the regeneration layer. Urban sites were characterized by high richness of non-native and pioneer species. Developing sites were dominated by the non-native shrub, Ligustrum sinense Lour., and several native overstory trees, mainly Acer negundo L. While agricultural and managed forest sites were composed of ubiquitous species, unmanaged forest sites had a structurally distinct midstory indicative of reduced disturbance. Urban and agricultural land uses showed decreased native stem densities and signs of overstory tree regeneration failure. Results from this study highlight the impact of the surrounding landscape matrix upon riparian forest plant diversity and structure.

AB  - Anthropogenic environmental change is often implicated in the emergence of new zoonoses from wildlife; however, there is little mechanistic understanding of these causal links. Here, we examine the transmission dynamics of an emerging zoonotic paramyxovirus, Hendra virus (HeV), in its endemic host, Australian Pteropus bats (fruit bats or flying foxes). HeV is a biosecurity level 4 (BSL-4) pathogen, with a high case-fatality rate in humans and horses. With models parametrized from field and laboratory data, we explore a set of probable contributory mechanisms that explain the spatial and temporal pattern of HeV emergence; including urban habituation and decreased migration-two widely observed changes in flying fox ecology that result from anthropogenic transformation of bat habitat in Australia. Urban habituation increases the number of flying foxes in contact with human and domestic animal populations, and our models suggest that, in addition, decreased bat migratory behaviour could lead to a decline in population immunity, giving rise to more intense outbreaks after local viral reintroduction. Ten of the 14 known HeV outbreaks occurred near urbanized or sedentary flying fox populations, supporting these predictions. We also demonstrate that by incorporating waning maternal immunity into our models, the peak modelled prevalence coincides with the peak annual spill-over hazard for HeV. These results provide the first detailed mechanistic framework for understanding the sporadic temporal pattern of HeV emergence, and of the urban/peri-urban distribution of HeV outbreaks in horses and people.

AB  - Wildlife crossing structures are commonly used to mitigate the barrier and mortality impacts of roads on wildlife. For arboreal mammals, canopy bridges, glider poles and vegetated medians are used to provide safe passage across roads. However, the effectiveness of these measures is unknown. We investigate the effect of canopy bridges, glider poles and vegetated medians on squirrel glider movement across a freeway in south-east Australia. We monitored structures directly using motion-triggered cameras and passive integrated transponder (PIT) scanners. Further, post-mitigation radio-tracking was compared to a pre-mitigation study. Squirrel gliders used all structure types to cross the freeway, while the unmitigated freeway remained a barrier to movement. However, movement was not restored to the levels observed at non-freeway sites. Nevertheless, based on the number and frequency of individuals crossing, mitigation is likely to provide some level of functional connectivity. The rate of crossing increased over several years as animals habituated to the structure. We also found that crossing rate can be a misleading indicator of effectiveness if the number of individuals crossing is not identified. Therefore, studies should employ long-term monitoring and identify individuals crossing if inferences about population connectivity are to be made from movement data alone. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The coastal lowlands of the Western Cape (CLWC) form part of the fynbos biome, an area renowned for its high levels of plant diversity and endemism. The vegetation of the CLWC has been severely reduced and fragmented, and is currently impacted on by agricultural, pastoral, coastal resort and urban development, as well as alien plant spread. Furthermore, most of the vegetation communities are under-represented within existing protected areas. In response to this urgent need for increased conservation efforts, an initiative to establish a UNESCO-MAB biosphere reserve in the area has been launched. The aim of this project was to use biological criteria to identify areas that could potentially contain the core areas and buffer zones of a biosphere reserve. A reserve selection algorithm was chosen which provides a flexible tool for selecting representative areas for protection. The algorithm is a step-wise heuristic, which has rules for including mandatory polygons, forcing adjacency, including desirable (e.g. Red Data Book plant species) and excluding undesirable features (e.g. bisection by major roads). Farm boundaries (cadastral units) were used as selection units, resulting in a total of 1717 parcels. The selection process was conducted three times with target areas set at 10%, 25% and 50% of the original extent of each vegetation type within the study area. Areas of 62 834 ha, 121 199 ha and 242 397 ha, respectively, or 36% 49% and 76% of the available land in the study area being selected. It is recommended that the area identified as the 50% target area be considered the future site of core areas and buffer zones for the proposed biosphere reserve. The algorithm successfully maintained a high degree of connectivity between selected areas. This is important considering the high levels of plant beta diversity associated with edaphic gradients. Rather than presenting a definitive reserve system, this study provides a tool allowing biological criteria to be included explicitly within the negotiation process. As the biosphere reserve is assembled, priorities can be re-assessed.

AB  - Purpose - Functioning as space connectors, path structures in urban parks may rarely present social interaction opportunities, although centralized activity spaces are available. This paper investigated the interrelationships between the visual and physical accessibility attributes of path structure and their impacts on passive social interaction intensity across urban parks in Kuala Lumpur.
   Design/methodology/approach - The concept of social interaction has been studied elsewhere in social cohesion, social affiliation and sense of communication. Still, it has not been studied in the context of urban park design. This study employed mixed methods using an adaptive and unique combination of qualitative and quantitative data collections to analyze urban parks with a bit of visual vegetation barrier. The experiential landscape method was applied to determine visual accessibility by interpreting experiential landscape maps. The space syntax method based on quantitative analysis is considered to measure physical accessibilities and vigorous activities along the designated paths by conducting integration analysis and gate observation. The data were crossed-analyzed using a Geographic Information System (GIS) classification technique, correlation analysis and Microsoft combo-charts to generate the relationship between patterns of activities and their accessibilities.
   Findings - The results suggested that designated paths with higher accessibility attributes, impressively more elevated than other tracks, could influence the intensity of passive social interactions. The findings supported the understanding that activity nodes and active areas adjoining designated routes could make accessibility attribute areas more critical. These findings verify that visually enriching the spaces along the path structure toward activities is a pivotal contributor to urban planners and designers to enhance the paths' local integration (LI) and visual accessibility to predict more passive eye contact among park visitors.
   Research limitations/implications - The proposed interrelationship among variables in this study has limitations because of not considering other qualitative methods and techniques like cognitive maps and interview simultaneously. These techniques could discover why some paths generate more passive eye contact among park users (Mohammadi Tahroodi, 2018).
   Practical implications - Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan 2020 emphasizes Kuala Lumpur's unique image as a tropical garden city via preserving and developing the iconic historical urban parks in the city center (CHKL, 2004, pp. 3-3). The latest Draft Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan 2040 has outlined the strategy to achieve a conducive, good-quality neighborhood that encourages social interaction. The findings could assist urban planners and designers better public parks by considering accessibility and permeability aspects of design. This research endorses the appropriateness of interrelationship between accessibility attributes of path structure and social interaction in urban design research, which local urban designers have not fully considered until now. Evaluating the visual convenience of designated paths and assessing LI of the axial lines constructing each designated route of urban parks during the primary stage could enable urban designers to estimate to what extent the paths are accessible and respond to passive social interaction. Then they could enrich with salient landmarks, views and activity nodes to make them attractive. The considerable number of designated paths connections, specifically while they shape the sides of activity nodes, could increase the connectivity and integration of spaces within the parks. These patterns of positioning the activity nodes make the designated routes more legible and provide ease of movement. As a result, it will give urban park users more information about the activities. Allowing people to use the paths will increase people's presence and, subsequently, passive social interaction. One way is to locate accessible lands that provide social activities at direct visual access paths within urban parks for legibility.
   Social implications - The socially responsive urban design enhances the quality of life and provides life satisfaction, happiness and society's overall health. Being in urban social parks in any passive and active situations has psychological benefits. It facilitates relief and rests from a stressful modern lifestyle that significantly impacts their mental health and well-being. The framework applied in this research integrates the social, spatial and physical aspects of parks design. With this regard, principles and indicators facilitate physically and socially attractive urban parks for Kuala Lumpur city center and applicable to similar contexts elsewhere.
   Originality/value - The concept of social interaction has been studied elsewhere in social cohesion, social affiliation and sense of communication. Still, it has not been studied in the context of urban park design. This study employed mixed methods using an adaptive and unique combination of qualitative and quantitative data collections to analyze urban parks with a bit of visual vegetation barrier.

AB  - Context. Brazil has one of the richest biodiversity and one of the most extensive road networks in the world. Several negative impacts emerge from this interaction, including wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC), which may represent a significant source of non-natural mortality in several species. The understanding of the main drivers of WVC is, therefore, crucial to improve the safe coexistence between human needs (transportation of goods and people) and animal populations.
   Aims. We aimed to (1) evaluate the relative influence of land-cover patterns on the distribution of WVC, (2) assess whether WVCs are clustered forming hotspots of mortality, and, if so, (3) evaluate the benefits of mitigating only hotspot sections.
   Methods. We collected WVC data involving medium-large mammals (4-260 kg) along three road transects (920 km), fortnightly over 1 year (n = 1006 records). We used boosted regression trees to relate the WVC locations with a set of environmental variables including a roadkill index, reflecting overall habitat suitability and landscape connectivity, while accounting for spatial autocorrelation effects. We identified hotspots of mortality using Ripley's K statistic and testing whether data follow a random Poisson distribution correcting for Type I error.
   Key results. We found a strong association between WVC probability and roadkill index for all focal species. Distance to riparian areas, tree cover, terrain ruggedness and distance to urban areas were also important predictors, although to a lesser extent. We detected 21 hotspots of mortality, yet with little spatial overlapping as only four road sections (2%) were classified as hotspot for more than one species.
   Conclusions. Our results supported that WVC mainly occur in road sections traversing areas with more abundant and diverse mammal communities. Hotspots of mortality may provide important information to prioritise road sections for mitigation, but this should be used in complement with roadkill indexes accounting for overall mortality.
   Implications. The results support focusing on hotspots and habitat quality and landscape connectivity for a better assessment of road mortality. At the local scale, a larger number and improved road passages with exclusionary fencing of appropriate mesh size in riparian areas may provide safe crossings for many species and constitute a promising mitigation measure.

AB  - Urbanisation threatens species through habitat loss, isolation and fragmentation. Greenspace in urban landscapes often provides connectivity and habitat for wetland-dependent species. Accessible greenspace measures the combined effects of movement barriers (e.g., roads) and the total amount of greenspace on populations. I determined whether accessible greenspace was a better predictor of amphibian occupancy at ponds than the total amount of greenspace, and at what spatial scale. I also assessed the relative importance of habitat variables at the local pond-scale. Frog surveys were conducted at 65 ponds distributed along an urban-rural gradient over two breeding seasons in the greater Melbourne region, Australia. Accessible greenspace was mapped around ponds at varying spatial scales (250 m - 2000 m) using potential barriers to amphibian movement. The best-ranked multi-species occupancy model included the proportion of total greenspace within a 1000-m radius of a pond and four local-scale covariates (presence of mosquitofish, pond permanence, vertical pond walls and water conductivity). There was no support for models containing accessible greenspace. There was a positive relationship between the probability of community and species-level occupancy and total greenspace within 1000 m of a pond. There was a negative relationship between mean community occupancy and the presence of a vertical pond wall at a site. There was no apparent effect of barriers on occupancy, indicating that urban areas may be more permeable for movement by some species than predicted. Individual species responses demonstrated that management actions are required at fine and broad spatial scales to benefit amphibian communities in urban landscapes.

AB  - Context. The Baudin's cockatoo is one of three black cockatoo species endemic to Western Australia and is listed as Endangered by state and federal governments. Although there is a Recovery Plan in place for this species, conservation efforts are hindered by gaps in knowledge regarding the species movement ecology.
   Aims. To identify key foraging and roosting habitat for Baudin's cockatoos and to determine differences in flock movements, including the spatial extent of movement, in Urban, Peri-urban and Forest regions using telemetry data.
   Methods. Wild Baudin's cockatoos that had been injured and undergone rehabilitation were equipped with satellite PTT (platform transmitter terminal) and GPS tags and released back into wild flocks. The study birds, and the flocks into which they integrated, were tracked in the field to collect telemetry and observational data. Satellite data were used to define the types of movement behaviour (resident, ranging, migratory), and GPS data were analysed to determine key foraging and roosting habitat, and to calculate home range area estimates.
   Key results. There was a significant difference in flock movement between the Urban/Peri-urban regions and the Forest region in terms of daily distances moved and distances between roosts, with these parameters being far greater for the Forest region. Additionally, flock sizes were larger in the Forest region compared with the Urban and Peri-urban regions. In Urban and Peri-urban regions, key habitat comprised remnant vegetation in urban green space (nature reserves, parks and private property), and roadside and riparian vegetation, which served as movement corridors in the landscape.
   Conclusions. The research shows that it is important to maintain vegetation connectivity in the landscape. This enables Baudin's cockatoos to utilise key patches of remnant vegetation in their non-breeding wintering grounds in Urban and Peri-urban regions of the Perth Peel Coastal Plain. Further research on the movement ecology of Baudin's cockatoos should focus on habitat suitability modelling, which, in combination with the identified key habitat sites, will benefit the decision-making process in relation to conservation management of this endangered black cockatoo species.
   Implications. This research has benefited the conservation management of Baudin's cockatoos by providing information on key habitat through satellite tracking and outlining the importance of the connective features of remnant vegetation. We advocate for further telemetry studies combined with habitat suitability modelling to preserve the necessary habitat for the persistence of this species in the Western Australian landscape.

AB  - Ditches are common in landscapes influenced by agricultural, forestry, and peat mining activities, and their value as corridors remains unassessed. Pond-breeding amphibians can encounter hostile environments when moving between breeding, summering, or hibernation sites, and are likely to benefit from the presence of ditches in the landscape. Within a system consisting of ditch networks in bogs mined for peat in eastern New Brunswick, Canada, I quantified the breeding, survival, and movements of green frogs (Rana clamitans melanota) in drainage ditches and also surveyed peat fields. Frogs rarely ventured on peat fields and most individuals frequented drainage ditches containing water, particularly in late summer. Though frogs did not breed in ditches, their survival rate in ditches was high (88%). Ditches did not hinder frog movements, as frogs moved independently of the current. Results indicate that drainage ditches containing water enable some movements between habitats isolated by peat mining, in contrast to peat surfaces, and suggest they function as amphibian movement corridors. Thus, such drainage ditches may mitigate the effects of peat extraction on amphibian populations. At the very least, these structures provide an alternative to hostile peat surfaces. This study highlights that small-scale corridors are potentially valuable in population dynamics.

AB  - Recent withdrawal of the US. military from the Republic of Panama has exposed 64,000 ha of lowland forest in the former Canal Zone to possible development. The forests form a 16-km-wide strip reaching 65 km from the Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean and function as the water supply for the canal and as home to one of the world's richest terrestrial biotas. We present an overview of the distribution of bird diversity in the forests of the canal area based on 10 years of inventories. A total of 498 terrestrial species has been recorded, of which 177 occur only in lowland forests. More species reside in Caribbean- than in Pacific-slope forests and in the largest forest tracts. The Panamanian government, recognizing the importance of the forests for protection of biodiversity and for proper functioning of the canal, has created two national parks and a national monument in the canal area. One large park, Soberania National Park, currently contains 92% of the region's forest-dwelling species. Two large tracts on the Caribbean coast, the Achiote Road forest and the Fort Sherman forest, are not designated as national parks but are recognized as important forest areas. Those two forests harbor species found nowhere else in the canal corridor Extensive fragmentation, disconnection of forested corridors between foothills and lowlands, and anthropogenic degradation of forests near towns have altered regional bird-community dynamics. Some dynamics occur on large spatial scales, such as the poorly understood movements of elevational and transisthmian migrants. Long-term maintenance of bird species diversity in the canal area will require preservation of the large forest tracts and reestablishment of a forested connection from the canal corridor lowlands to the Chagres lowlands and foothills in the east. Such conservation activities will be challenging to execute given the region's growing human population and desires for a stronger national economy. We recommend protection of remaining forests and active enforcement of protection laws to reduce hunting and further intrusions.

AB  - Edge effects play a key role in forest dynamics in which the context of the anthropogenic matrix has a great influence on fragment connectivity and function. The study of the interaction between edge and matrix effects in nature is essential to understand and promote the colonization of some functional groups in managed ecosystems. We studied the dynamics of 7 species of frogs and salamanders occurring in 8 ecotones of tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) which interact with adjacent managed areas of coffee and corn plantations in Guerrero, southern Mexico. A survey effort of 196 man/hours along 72 transects detected 58 individuals of 7 amphibian species and 12 environmental and structural variables were measured. The diversity and abundance of amphibians in the forest mostly depended on the matrix context adjacent to the forest patches. The forest interior provided higher relative humidity, leaf litter cover, and canopy cover that determined the presence of some amphibian species. The use of shaded coffee plantations was preferred by the amphibians over the corn plots possibly due to the maintenance of native forest arboreal elements, low management rate and less intensity of disturbance in the coffee plantations than in the corn plots. Shaded coffee plantations reduce the edge effects in TMCF, improve the connectivity between TMCF fragments and increase habitat quality for the forest interior amphibian species. Future wildlife management research should take into account edge and matrix effects to understand species dynamics which move along anthropogenic-natural ecotones in managed ecosystems, thus prioritizing sites to buffer edge effects and increase habitat quality in remaining natural ecosystems.

AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) is considered as a major threat to biodiversity, especially to nocturnal species, as it reduces availability, quality and functionality of habitats. However, its effects on the way species use landscape elements such as rivers are still largely understudied, especially the effect of crossing infrastructure lighting on bridges. These elements are nevertheless key commuting and foraging habitats in heavily urbanised landscapes for several taxa such as bats that are particularly affected by ALAN. We studied the effects of the illumination of facades and undersides of bridges on the relative abundance of pipistrelle bats, on their 3D distribution and their behavioural response (i.e. flight speed) close to bridges. We set-up an innovative approach based on a microphone-array to reconstruct positions and flight trajectories in 3D. We studied the effect of lighting on bats in the close proximity of six similar bridges, mostly differentiated by the presence or absence of lighting (3 lit and 3 unlit). All bridges cross the same waterway, within a uniformly and highly urbanized agglomeration (Toulouse, France). We found that bat activity was 1.7 times lower in lit sites. Bats tended to keep a larger distance, and to fly faster close to illuminated bridges. These results suggest that bridge lighting strongly reduces habitat availability and likely connectivity for bats. In that case, results call for switching off the illumination of such bridges crossing riverine ecosystems to preserve their functionality as habitats and corridors for bats.

AB  - Climate change poses a challenge to the conventional approach to biodiversity conservation, which relies on fixed protected areas, because the changing climate is expected to shift the distribution of suitable areas for many species. Some species will persist only if they can colonize new areas, although in some cases their dispersal abilities may be very limited. To address this problem we devised a quantitative method for identifying multiple corridors of connectivity through shifting habitat suitabilities that seeks to minimize dispersal demands first and then the area of land required. We applied the method to Proteaceae mapped on a 1-minute grid for the western part of the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, to supplement the existing protected areas using Worldmap software. Our goal was to represent each species in at least 35 grid cells (approximately 100 km(2)) at all times between 2000 and 2050 despite climate change. Although it was possible to achieve the goal at reasonable cost, caution will be needed in applying our method to reserves or other conservation investments until there is further information to support or refine the climate-change models and the species' habitat-suitability and dispersal models.

AB  - Anxi County is located in the northwestern part of the Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province and has the sole national level nature reserve of extremely-arid desert in China. Phytosociological methods (Braun-Blanquet, 1964) are used to classify plant community types in this area. Eleven are distinguished, including six of deserts, four of oases and one transitional type between deserts and oases. Direct gradient analysis (DCA) is employed to correlate the distribution of plant communities to physiogeographic conditions. This study makes clear that water is the most important ecological factor for the distribution of plant species and communities in this area. The effects of water have been demonstrated in different ways. A vegetation gradient from lower altitude to higher altitude in the southern part of the reserve is driven by a precipitation gradient. The effects of the depth of ground water table contribute to the differentiation of vegetation from desert to oasis in the flat area. In a finer scale, the washed gullies have obviously higher species richness and also higher vegetation cover than the surround gobi surfaces, possibly caused by the effects of floods. The vegetation patterns demonstrate that the area of Anxi County is a complete landscape unit. The range of the current nature reserve is not large enough for the purpose of conserving the unique biodiversity in this area.

AB  - Protected lands are an established method for conserving biodiversity and ecosystem services. Moreover, agencies and organizations are increasingly looking to private lands as places for new protected lands establishment. However, the effectiveness of protected lands in guarding against the loss of species or services can vary based on their coverage of habitat and species, management strategy, and their size and configuration across the landscape. We compare protected lands patches between two adjacent ecoregions, the public lands centric Blue Ridge and the private land dominated Piedmont, using estimates of land cover, management practices, and landscape configuration as a proxy for their relative contribution towards the long-term conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. We conducted a hotspot analysis to evaluate geographic changes in spatial clustering of protected lands establishment between the years 1985 and 2015. In addition, we evaluated climate resiliency of protected lands patches using metrics developed by Anderson et al. (2016). We found that, compared to public lands, private protected lands contain larger amounts of agriculture than forest, allow for more utilitarian use than public lands, and are less resilient to climatic change. Furthermore, although total area of private protected lands increased since 1985, they are smaller and more disconnected, contributing less to overall connectivity of the protected lands network. To improve upon past efforts, we must improve management accounting and practice and prioritize land for protection that improves coverage, network connectivity, and climate resilience.

AB  - We updated the floristic checklist of the Nizanda region, Isthmus of Tehuantepec (southern Mexico), characterized the occurring plant communities based on dominant species, and described the region's flora according to life form, growth form, growth type, and growth habit spectra. Ten years of botanical exploration, along with surveys in 188 100-m(2) samples from different vegetation types, provided the baseline floristic information. Ordination and classification analyses were performed to examine the degree of differentiation between communities. Geographical ranges of all species were used to assess biogeographical relationships of this flora. The inventory includes 920 species (553 genera, 124 families). More than one-third of the families were represented by a single species, whereas the 10 richest families had 43% of the species richness. Dendrograms showing plot classification at three taxonomic levels (species, genus and family) revealed savannah as the most strongly differentiated community amid seven vegetation types. Regarding growth forms, forbs and trees prevailed. Phanerophytes were the most common life form category, whereas herbs and woody plants were the dominant growth types. The largest richness for all taxonomic levels was recorded in the tropical dry forest. The expanded floristic knowledge gained for the Nizanda region provided better criteria to revise the classification scheme of its vegetation. Our preliminary biogeographical analysis illustrates the role of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as a corridor for thermophilous floras between two oceanic watersheds, and as a natural distributional limit for several Mesoamerican plant species.

AB  - Previous research has shown that trees and other roadside vegetation can mitigate adverse environmental conditions on urban street corridors, and, in turn, positively contribute to pedestrian perceptions of safety and walkability. In this study, pedestrian surveys (n = 181) were collected from three Massachusetts post-industrial cities to understand if street trees moderate pedestrian perceptions of safety. Three street tree conditions - sparse street tree abundance, mature street trees, and new street tree plantings - were compared as study settings. Several methods were used to correlate perceived safety with street trees and sociodemographic variables, including repeated measures and between-group ANOVA, qualitative open-coding, exploratory factor analysis, and simple moderation analysis. This study did not find empirical evidence that street trees influence people's perceived safety, nor that street trees substantively contribute to feelings of safety while walking. These findings suggest that pedestrians do not have universal experiences of safety in walking environments, and different sociocultural backgrounds may contribute to diverging experiences of safety or fear when walking. Our research supports previous findings on the ways in which pedestrians value street trees; this can be extended to municipal or regional Complete Streets guidance and technical assistance programs.

AB  - 1. We report a field experiment designed to explore the responses by hedgehogs to novel and unfavourable terrain, which they encounter when dispersing between fragmented local populations in farmland. We identified four replicate sites as unused by hedgehogs, but lying between existing populations and containing locally abundant food. At each site, we released six hedgehogs from distant sources at 2-day intervals and monitored their subsequent dispersals over 20 days by radio-tracking. We compared movement trajectories under this treatment to those of 29 hedgehogs released at two sites known to support abundant hedgehogs. A third treatment comprised 20 unmanipulated hedgehogs at three sites. We estimated habitat use and proximity to habitats by comparing each observed trajectory to simulated random walks of equal length. We sought differences between treatments in movement and habitat use from nested analysis of variance.
   2, No two trajectories of any translocated hedgehogs followed the same route; most involved little change in body weight, and took the animal into or through existing populations. Hedgehogs moved substantially further and faster on average from the unfavourable than from the favourable sites. They showed a significantly stronger attraction to habitat edges, which therefore acted as corridors, and a significant proportion of them stayed closer to roads and to urban habitat than random expectation. Habitat preferences also shifted significantly towards urban and away from arable areas. Six were predated, and two killed by road traffic. At least three returned to their release point, with P < 0.05 of this occurring by chance.
   3, In this region, natural dispersals between populations up to 4 km apart are rare events. We have shown, however, that hedgehogs are capable of travelling distances of up to 3.8 km from a release point, and up to 9.9 km in total, compared to an average home range span of 0.8 km, and it appears that none of the local populations in the study area are out of reach of neighbours.

AB  - Among the most popular strategies for maintaining populations of both plants and animals in fragmented landscapes is to connect isolated patches with thin strips of habitat, called corridors. Corridors are thought to increase the exchange of individuals between habitat patches, promoting genetic exchange and reducing population fluctuations. Empirical studies addressing the effects of corridors have either been small in scale or have ignored confounding effects of increased habitat area created by the presence of a corridor. These methodological difficulties, coupled with a paucity of studies examining the effects of corridors on plants and plant-animal interactions, have sparked debate over the purported value of corridors in conservation planning. We report results of a large-scale experiment that directly address this debate. In eight large-scale experimental landscapes that control for patch area and test alternative mechanisms of corridor function, we demonstrate that corridors not only increase the exchange of animals between patches, but also facilitate two key plant-animal interactions: pollination and seed dispersal. Our results show that the beneficial effects of corridors extend beyond the area they add, and suggest that increased plant and animal movement through corridors will have positive impacts on plant populations and community interactions in fragmented landscapes.

AB  - Aim To understand the impact of historical and contemporary habitat distributions and connectivity on the spatial patterns of a species' genetic variation and divergence, we examined the phylogenetic relationship, population genetic structure and demographic history of a mangrove-specialist, the crab-eating frog (Fejervarya cancrivora) from 10 geographic populations in China and northern Vietnam.
   Location Southeast Asian coasts, especially the southern China and northern Vietnam coasts.
   Methods We used the sequences of three mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) regions to infer phylogenetic relationships and divergence times between our samples and those from other Southeast Asian countries. Thirteen nuclear microsatellite loci were used to analyse population genetic structure. Ancient and more recent demographic history was assessed using mtDNA and microsatellite data, respectively, and population divergence history scenarios were evaluated using approximate Bayesian computation.
   Results The mtDNA haplotypes from China joined the F. cancrivora clades from the Philippines, Thailand and Bangladesh, which diverged from the clades from Malaysia and Indonesia. Microsatellite analyses revealed three genetically differentiated clusters and a strong pattern of isolation by distance at the individual level. Ancient population sizes were relatively stable, but genetic signatures of recent population declines were detected. Population divergence history analyses supported that Hainan populations were ancestral to those of the Guangdong, Guangxi and northern Vietnam populations.
   Main conclusions Our results suggest that F. cancrivora's contemporary genetic patterns have been shaped by past and present habitat conformations. This species may have dispersed along the coast from Southeast Asia to China during Pleistocene glaciations when sea levels were low, colonizing the Hainan area first. It subsequently spread to mainland China coasts when sea levels rose and shorelines withdrew. Additionally, current declines and fragmentation of mangrove forests have likely exacerbated population reductions and genetic divergences among now disjunct populations. This study provides a framework for understanding the population history of mangrove-associated biota and thus aids conservation management of this critical ecosystem.

AB  - Disturbed habitats are often swiftly colonized by alien plant species. Human inhabited areas may act as sources from which such aliens disperse, while road verges have been suggested as corridors facilitating their dispersal. We therefore hypothesized that (i) houses and urban areas are propagule sources from which aliens disperse, and that (ii) road verges act as corridors for their dispersal. We sampled presence and cover of aliens in 20 plots (6 x 25 m) per road at 5-km intervals for four roads, nested within three localities around cities (n = 240). Plots consisted of three adjacent nested transects. Houses (n = 3,349) were mapped within a 5-km radius from plots using topographical maps. Environmental processes as predictors of alien composition differed across spatial levels. At the broadest scale road-surface type, soil type, and competition from indigenous plants were the strongest predictors of alien composition. Within localities disturbance-related variables such as distance from dwellings and urban areas were associated with alien composition, but their effect differed between localities. Within roads, density and proximity of houses was related to higher alien species richness. Plot distance from urban areas, however, was not a significant predictor of alien richness or cover at any of the spatial levels, refuting the corridor hypothesis. Verges hosted but did not facilitate the spread of alien species. The scale dependence and multiplicity of mechanisms explaining alien plant communities found here highlight the importance of considering regional climatic gradients, landscape context and road-verge properties themselves when managing verges.

AB  - Transport infrastructure such as roads has been reported to negatively affect dispersal. Their effects on dispersal are thought to be complex, depending on the characteristics of the structure and the intensity of the traffic using it. In addition, individual factors, such as age, may strongly affect dispersal decisions and success when individuals are confronted with transport infrastructure. Despite the importance of this topic for wildlife conservation, few studies have investigated the effect of transport infrastructure on individuals' dispersal decisions before and after sexual maturity. We examined the effects on two kinds of infrastructure, gravel tracks and paved roads, on the dispersal of an endangered amphibian, the yellow-bellied toad (Bombina variegata). We used capture-recapture data collected during a five-year period on a large, spatially structured population of B. variegata. Our study revealed that emigration rates increased with an individual's age, while dispersal distance decreased. It also showed that both tracks and roads had negative effects on immigration. The negative effect of roads was stronger than that of tracks. We additionally found that the effect of tracks on dispersal slightly decreased with a toad's age. In contrast, the negative effect of roads was severe and relatively similar across age classes.

AB  - Carnivores are particularly sensitive to reductions in population connectivity caused by human disturbance and habitat fragmentation. Permeability of transportation corridors to carnivore movements is central to species conservation given the large spatial extent of transportation networks and the high mobility of many carnivore species. We investigated the degree to which two-lane highways were permeable to movements of resident Canada lynx in the Southern Rocky Mountains based on highway crossings (n=593) documented with GPS telemetry. All lynx crossed highways when present in home ranges at an average rate of 0.6 crossings per day. Lynx mostly crossed highways during the night and early dawn when traffic volumes were low. Five of 13 lynx crossed highways less frequently than expected when compared to random expectation, but even these individuals crossed highways frequently in parts of their home range. We developed fine- and landscape-scale resource selection function (RSF) models with field and remotely sensed data, respectively. At the fine scale, lynx selected crossings with low distances to vegetative cover and higher tree basal area; we found no support that topography or road infrastructure affected lynx crossing. At the landscape scale, lynx crossed highways in areas with high forest canopy cover in drainages on primarily north-facing aspects. The predicted crossing probabilities generated from the landscape-scale RSF model across western Colorado, USA, were successful in identifying known lynx crossing sites as documented with independent snow-tracking and road-mortality data. We discuss effective mitigation based on model results. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license.

AB  - 1. Payments to private landholders for providing biodiversity land can improve conservation outside protected areas. Input-based payments are widely used despite evidence they are often ineffective at improving biodiversity outcomes. Meanwhile, little has been done to assess how to use outcome-based payments to maximize biodiversity, despite growing academic interest. We compare different outcome-based allocation methods to assess which returns the greatest benefits for biodiversity.
   2. We predicted the likely landholder actions in response to outcome-based payments. We incorporated strategic interactions between landholders under four different funding allocation methods: the commonly applied "set-price" allocation method; capacity-based payments; proportional payment; and payment for change. We compared biodiversity outcomes percentage change in abundance of a species of conservation interest), return on investment and cost-effectiveness of each method.
   3. The set-price allocation method, despite its common usage, is the least cost-effective method that we test. Regardless of cost, it only results in better biodiversity outcomes than other methods under a very narrow range of conditions (high initial target species abundance and low profitability).
   4. The profitability of the property, and to a lesser degree initial population size, will influence which allocation method will perform best. Most perform well when the initial population of the species of conservation interest is very small and profitability negligible. Only one method-based on change in population-performs well across all scenarios. This method outperforms the others particularly when the property has a higher profitability and low initial numbers of animals.
   5. Policy implications. Pursuing conservation on private land using outcome-based payments for biodiversity can result in varied levels of success depending on the allocation methods used to support payment decisions. Allocation method choice should be based on a transparent analysis that incorporates both the dynamics of the ecological system and interactions between individual landholders. This analysis can guide adoption of funding allocation methods that greatly increase biodiversity outcomes.

AB  - The polarization and diffusion effects of landscape patterns are important features of megalopolis development. Under the urbanized effects, green space is a key spatial unit in delivering vital ecosystem services for sustainable urban planning. However, currently, fast urban developing is swamping the green space. In this study, by tracing landscape pattern changes of a fast-developing megalopolis, the Chengdu-Chongqing Megalopolis in the southeast of China, and using land-use data from 1980 to 2020, we aimed to determine the polarization and diffusion effects of the megalopolis and their impacts on the green space within and between the cities. We found that: (1) during the past four decades, spatial expansion of the megalopolis mainly occupied grassland and farmland, triggering an increase in landscape fragmentation; (2) based on socio-economic indicators, the spatialattraction network analysis showed a significant polarization effect; however, based on the natural landscape, this analysis demonstrated a more scattered pattern; (3) importantly, the megalopolis developed at quite a similar pace, which caused the green rural area between the central cities demonstrating an encroached trend by the urbanization. To promote sustainability of the fast-developing megalopolis, we suggest that the boundary of the green space should be broadened to form a green network in which natural green space and urban green space are interconnected, improving the connectivity of habitats within the megalopolis for urban biodiversity. Our study implied that maintaining the green buffer shall be considered in advance for sustainable megaregional planning and establishing resilience of the fast-developing megalopolis.

AB  - Butterflies (Insects: Lepidoptera) contribute to the ecosystem services and thereby qualify as a group deserving conservation effort. Information on the butterfly-plant links is used as a foundation to sustain population and enhance conservation and management. Thus, in the present study, the structure of a butterfly-plant network in an urban landscape like Kolkata, India, was deciphered highlighting metrics like degree distribution, nestedness, and interaction strength and specialization index. A total of forty eight butterfly species associated with thirty different angiosperm plant species were observed during the study period of one year. While Lantana camara was observed to be the dominant plant species with 37 links to different butterflies, the Catopsilia pyranthe butterfly species was dominant in terms of the generalist pattern of links (21 links) with the plants. Differential ability of the shrubs and herbs in the sustenance of the butterflies was reflected in the network indices using the herbs and the shrubs, separately. In urban landscapes with restricted variety of flowering plants, an estimate of relative strength of interactions enables identification and further use of the concerned species in sustaining butterfly populations. In accordance with these propositions, the butterfly-plant network illustrated in the present instance may prove useful in selection of plant species required for the enhancement of population of desired butterfly species in urban areas like Kolkata, India.

AB  - The ability to disperse among patches is central to population dynamics in fragmented landscapes. Although saproxylic (=dead wood dependent) insects live in extremely fragmented forest ecosystems and comprise a significant proportion of the biodiversity therein, few studies have focused on dispersal of members in this group. We quantified the terrestrial movements of Odontotaenius disjunctus Illiger, a common saproxylic beetle in eastern North American forests. Movement behavior of individual beetles was measured in deciduous forest and two common matrix (=unsuitable) habitats (urban lawn and cattle pasture). Probability of emigrating from a forest fragment was assessed at the high-contrast boundary between forest and pasture. Seasonal, diurnal, and sex-biased patterns of O. disjunctus dispersal were determined from captures at drift fences encircling inhabited logs. Movement was 1.6 and 2.7 times faster and 1.1 and 1.5 times more linear in suitable habitat (forest) than in unsuitable matrix (lawn and pasture, respectively). Net displacement in the forest exceeded predictions of a correlated random walk, but net displacement in matrix habitats was less than expected. When confronted with a high-contrast boundary, O. disjunctus was 14 times more likely to move toward the forest than the pasture. The importance of temperature was indicated by its positive relationship with movement rate and increased diurnal and warm season dispersal activity. Reluctance to cross boundaries into open fields and slow movement within open fields suggest a low likelihood of terrestrial O. disjunctus movement among forest fragments.

AB  - The world is rapidly urbanizing, thereby transforming natural landscapes and changing the abundance and distribution of organisms. However, insights into the effects of urbanization on species interactions, and plant-pathogen interactions in particular, are lacking. We investigated the effects of urbanization on powdery mildew infection on Quercus robur at continental and within-city scales. At the continental scale, we compared infection levels between urban and rural areas of different-sized cities in Europe, and investigated whether plant traits, climatic variables and CO2 emissions mediated the effect of urbanization on infection levels. Within one large city (Stockholm, Sweden), we further explored whether local habitat features and spatial connectivity influenced infection levels during multiple years. At the continental scale, infection severity was consistently higher on trees in urban than rural areas, with some indication that temperature mediated this effect. Within Stockholm city, temperature had no effect, while local accumulation of leaf litter negatively affected powdery mildew incidence in one out of three years, and more connected trees had lower infection levels. This study is the first to describe the effects of urbanization on plant-pathogen interactions both within and among cities, and to uncover the potential mechanisms behind the observed patterns at each scale.

AB  - Humans have urbanised and fragmented landscapes across the globe, with detrimental impacts to biodiversity, habitats and food webs in most biomes. Urbanisation might also modify the provision of ecological functions, but these putative effects of landscape transformation are rarely measured. Coastal cities are typically located near estuaries, and we tested for potential impacts of these on ecological functions. Our study used 22 estuaries in eastern Australia as model systems to examine how urbanisation shapes the consumption of carrion by fish, a pivotal ecological function in estuaries. Fish assemblages varied among estuaries according to the extent of shoreline hardening, and this was correlated with changes in the rate of carrion consumption. In estuaries with low levels of shoreline hardening and abundant remnant mangroves, most carrion was consumed by toadfishes (Tetraodontidae). By contrast, in moderately urban estuaries (i.e. where 20-60% of shorelines had been hardened with artificial structures) yellowfin bream (Sparidae) replaced toadfish and performed the bulk of the scavenging function. Bream are particularly effective scavengers that utilize artificial structures as habitat for both foraging and sheltering. We show that by augmenting habitat for an important species of scavenger, the moderate addition of urban structures to estuarine shorelines also helped to supplement a key ecological function in estuaries. Urbanisation impacts diversity in all ecosystems, but many opportunistic species flourish in urban habitats. Identifying and conserving taxa that perform important roles in urban environments is now a critical conservation challenge for maintaining ecological functions across disturbed landscapes.

AB  - Population mobility, increasing demand for transportation, and the complexity of land use have an impact on environmental quality degradation and air quality pollution. This study aims to analyze (1) the effect of population mobility, increased traffic volume, and land use change on air quality pollution, (2) direct and indirect effects of urban activities, transportation systems, and movement patterns on environmental quality degradation and air pollution index, and (3) air pollution strategy and sustainable urban environmental management. The research method used is a sequential explanation design. Data were obtained through observation, surveys, in-depth interviews, and documentation. The results of the study illustrate that the business center and Daya terminal with a value of 0.18 mu gram/m(3) is polluted, the power plant and Sermani industrial area with a value of 0.16 mu gram/m(3) is polluted, the Makassar industrial area with a value of 0.23 is heavily polluted, and the Hasanuddin International Airport area with a value of 0.04 mu gram/m(3) is not polluted. Population mobility, traffic volume, and land use changes have a significant effect on environmental quality degradation, with a determination coefficient of 94.1%. The direct effect of decreasing environmental quality on the air pollution index is 66.09%. This study recommends transportation management on the main road corridor of Makassar City, which is environmentally friendly with regard to sustainable environmental management.

AB  - Natal dispersal enables population connectivity, gene flow and metapopulation dynamics. In polygynous mammals, dispersal is typically male-biased. Classically, the 'mate competition', 'resource competition' and 'resident fitness' hypotheses predict density-dependent dispersal patterns, while the 'inbreeding avoidance' hypothesis posits density-independent dispersal. In a leopard (Panthera pardus) population recovering from over-harvest, we investigated the effect of sex, population density and prey biomass, on age of natal dispersal, distance dispersed, probability of emigration and dispersal success. Over an 11-year period, we tracked 35 subadult leopards using VHF and GPS telemetry. Subadult leopards initiated dispersal at 13.6 +/- 0.4 months. Age at commencement of dispersal was positively density-dependent. Although males (11.0 +/- 2.5 km) generally dispersed further than females (2.7 +/- 0.4 km), some males exhibited opportunistic philopatry when the population was below capacity. All 13 females were philopatric, while 12 of 22 males emigrated. Male dispersal distance and emigration probability followed a quadratic relationship with population density, whereas female dispersal distance was inversely density-dependent. Eight of 12 known-fate females and 5 of 12 known-fate male leopards were successful in settling. Dispersal success did not vary with population density, prey biomass, and for males, neither between dispersal strategies (philopatry vs. emigration). Females formed matrilineal kin clusters, supporting the resident fitness hypothesis. Conversely, mate competition appeared the main driver for male leopard dispersal. We demonstrate that dispersal patterns changed over time, i.e. as the leopard population density increased. We conclude that conservation interventions that facilitated local demographic recovery in the study area also restored dispersal patterns disrupted by unsustainable harvesting, and that this indirectly improved connectivity among leopard populations over a larger landscape.

AB  - Landscape connectivity is important for a wide range of ecological processes, including to disease spread, once it describes the degree to which landscapes facilitate or impede vector and hosts dispersion. Understanding connectivity is extremely important to identify where pathogens can move, and at what speed, allowing the organization of vaccination campaigns or other preventive measures. To better understand the effects of landscape connectivity on yellow fever virus (YFV) dispersion in Brazil, we used a network approach and modelled the movement of non-human primates' cases, the so-called epizootic events, over time. The networks consider each epizootic event as a node and the dispersion between nodes as links. Those links were established considering, respectively, the date of each epizootic event, the distance among the nodes and the permeability of the landscape between each pair of nodes. Our results demonstrated that on average YFV dispersed 1.42 km/day, with the largest movement being 6.9 km/day. Dispersions were longer in summer (1.2 km/day) than in winter (0.22 km/day). Most dispersal movements occurred up to 1 km/day (71%) and within a week after the arrival of the virus in the source node (73%), except in winter, where dispersions occurred within a period of up to 20 days. The best model indicates that YFV disperses mainly through roads adjacent to forest areas, and along forest edges (within a range of 100 m) in interface with agricultural areas, water and forestry areas. Core areas of urban, agricultural and forest regions were important barriers for virus movement. Synthesis and applications. Through landscape connectivity analyses, we provided here the first evidence that highly fragmented landscapes with a wide road network and large densities of forest edges facilitate yellow fever virus propagation, and that the maintenance of large blocks of forest can help to inhibit this spread. These results can contribute to guide forest restoration and landscape management actions in order to amplify health benefits related to restoration projects, in addition to their benefits for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation.

AB  - Forest cover is decreasing globally, chiefly due to the conversion of forest to agricultural landscapes. In contrast, the area under plantation forestry is increasing by up to 3 million hectares per annum. For wildlife occupying landscapes where native forest is the dominant land cover, plantations generally represent a lower value habitat; however, plantations established on land formerly used for pasture, may benefit wildlife by providing temporary forest habitat and increasing connectivity. This study investigates the influence of landscape, site and climatic factors on koala population density in far south-west Victoria where there has been extensive plantation establishment. We conducted koala surveys and habitat characteristic assessments at 72 sites across three habitat types: plantation, native vegetation blocks, and native vegetation strips. We employed a hierarchical modelling framework for estimating abundance, and constructed candidate multinomial N-mixture models to identify factors influencing the abundance of koalas. We detected higher mean koala density in plantation sites (0.85 per ha) than in either native block (0.68 per ha) or native strip sites (0.66 per ha). We found five covariates of koala density, and using these variables we spatially modelled koala abundance and discuss factors that are key in determining large-scale distribution and density of koala populations. We provide a distribution map that can be used to identify high priority areas for population management as well as habitat of high conservation significance for koalas. This information facilitates the linkage of ecological theory with the on-ground implementation of management actions, and may guide conservation planning and resource management actions to consider overall landscape configuration as well as the spatial arrangement of plantations adjacent to remnant forest.

AB  - Great Lakes coastal wetlands provide a critical habitat for many fish species throughout their life cycles. Once home to one of the largest wetland complexes in the Great Lakes, coastal wetlands in the Huron-Erie Corridor (HEC) have decreased dramatically since the early 1900s. We characterized the nearshore fish communities at three different wetland complexes in the HEC using electrofishing, seines, and fyke nets. Species richness was highest in the Detroit River (63), followed by the St. Clair Delta (56), and Western Lake Erie (47). The nearshore fish communities in the Detroit River and St. Clair Delta consisted primarily of shiners, bluntnose minnow, centrarchids, and brook silverside, while the Western lake Erie sites consisted of high proportions of non-native taxa including common carp, gizzard shad, goldfish, and white perch. Species richness estimates using individual-based rarefaction curves were higher when using electrofishing data compared to fyke nets or seine hauls at each wetland. Twelve fish species were captured exclusively during electrofishing assessments, while one species was captured exclusively in fyke nets, and none exclusively during seine hauls. Western Lake Erie wetlands were more indicative of degraded systems with lower species richness, lower proportion of turbidity intolerant species, and increased abundance of non-native taxa. This work highlights the importance of coastal wetlands in the HEC by capturing 69 different fish species utilizing these wetlands to fulfill life history requirements and provides insight when selecting gears to sample nearshore littoral areas.

AB  - Well-designed and effectively managed networks of marine reserves can be effective tools for both fisheries management and biodiversity conservation. Connectivity, the demographic linking of local populations through the dispersal of individuals as larvae, juveniles or adults, is a key ecological factor to consider in marine reserve design, since it has important implications for the persistence of metapopulations and their recovery from disturbance. For marine reserves to protect biodiversity and enhance populations of species in fished areas, they must be able to sustain focal species (particularly fishery species) within their boundaries, and be spaced such that they can function as mutually replenishing networks whilst providing recruitment subsidies to fished areas. Thus the configuration (size, spacing and location) of individual reserves within a network should be informed by larval dispersal and movement patterns of the species for which protection is required. In the past, empirical data regarding larval dispersal and movement patterns of adults and juveniles of many tropical marine species have been unavailable or inaccessible to practitioners responsible for marine reserve design. Recent empirical studies using new technologies have also provided fresh insights into movement patterns of many species and redefined our understanding of connectivity among populations through larval dispersal. Our review of movement patterns of 34 families (210 species) of coral reef fishes demonstrates that movement patterns (home ranges, ontogenetic shifts and spawning migrations) vary among and within species, and are influenced by a range of factors (e.g. size, sex, behaviour, density, habitat characteristics, season, tide and time of day). Some species move <0.1-0.5 km (e.g. damselfishes, butterflyfishes and angelfishes), <0.5-3 km (e.g. most parrotfishes, goatfishes and surgeonfishes) or 3-10 km (e.g. large parrotfishes and wrasses), while others move tens to hundreds (e.g. some groupers, emperors, snappers and jacks) or thousands of kilometres (e.g. some sharks and tuna). Larval dispersal distances tend to be <5-15 km, and self-recruitment is common. Synthesising this information allows us, for the first time, to provide species, specific advice on the size, spacing and location of marine reserves in tropical marine ecosystems to maximise benefits for conservation and fisheries management for a range of taxa. We recommend that: (i) marine reserves should be more than twice the size of the home range of focal species (in all directions), thus marine reserves of various sizes will be required depending on which species require protection, how far they move, and if other effective protection is in place outside reserves; (ii) reserve spacing should be <15 km, with smaller reserves spaced more closely; and (iii) marine reserves should include habitats that are critical to the life history of focal species (e.g. home ranges, nursery grounds, migration corridors and spawning aggregations), and be located to accommodate movement patterns among these. We also provide practical advice for practitioners on how to use this information to design, evaluate and monitor the effectiveness of marine reserve networks within broader ecological, socioeconomic and management contexts.

AB  - Corridors such as roads and trails can facilitate invasions by non-native plant species. The open, disturbed habitat associated with corridors provides favorable growing conditions for many non-native plant species. Bike trails are a corridor system common to many urban areas that have not been studied for their potential role in plant invasions. We sampled five linear segments of urban forest along bike trails in Lincoln, Nebraska to assess the invasion of woody non-native species relative to corridors and to assess the composition of these urban forests. The most abundant plant species were generally native species, but five non-native species were also present: white mulberry (Morus alba), common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica), tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima), honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.) and elm (Ulmus spp.). The distribution of two of the woody species sampled, common buckthorn and honeysuckle, significantly decreased with increasing distance from a source patch of vegetation (P = 0.031 and 0.030). These linear habitats are being invaded by non-native tree and shrub species, which may change the structure of these urban forest corridors. If non-native woody plant species become abundant in the future, they may homogenize the plant community and reduce native biodiversity in these areas.

AB  - The study explores the significance of residents' experience with an array of green infrastructure in Taiping, a small town in central Peninsular Malaysia. It argues that the existence of a composite of greenery and open spaces in a town that has diversity contributes to sense of well-being of its residents. Green infrastructure network is a composite of various types of greenery and open spaces linked by streets, waterways and drainages encircling and connecting urban areas, at all spatial scales. In Taiping, the green infrastructure network consists of a town park, street planting, open spaces of public buildings, pocket spaces between shop-houses, school playfields, neighbourhood open space, home gardens, and river corridors. Questionnaires (n=335) and semi structured interviews (n=33) explored the diversity of the green infrastructure in the town and the causal relationship to sense of well-being physical, cognitive and social. The data suggested that green infrastructure afford residents diversity of experience. Diverse experiences of green infrastructure network, physically and visually attract residents to participate in active activities, to socialize and to perform other transactional activities outside their homes. Therefore, the effects from the participation trigger many positive moods such as serenity, relaxation, comfort and satisfaction. Moreover, in physical and social terms, experiencing urban green spaces such as parks and gardens afford town residents active living, and community participation and harmony. There were modest relationships between the dimensions of diversity with the well-being dimensions, suggesting that residents felt diversity affected their sense of well-being. Hence, the results implicate that urban green spaces are essential amenity for towns and cities that afford an individual and a community physical, cognitive and social well-being.

AB  - Vegetated roofs are hoped to benefit urban wildlife, yet there are few empirical results regarding the conservation potential of such roofs. In this paper, we focus on arthropods on vegetated roofs. We vacuum sampled 17 succulent, meadow or succulent-meadow roofs, in Helsinki, Finland, and used order to species level information together with trait data to describe the communities. We evaluated the importance of biophysical roof characteristics on shaping arthropod assemblages to provide information concerning roof designs that promote rich arthropod fauna. Arthropod communities differed between the three roof types and the influence of roof variables varied between and within arthropod orders. The main local drivers of arthropod abundance across the individually analysed taxa were roof height and vegetation, with mainly positive effects of height (up to 11 m) and litter cover, and mainly negative effects of grass cover. Based on trait data from true bugs, spiders and ants, the roofs consisted mainly of common dispersive species that are generalist feeders and associated with dry open habitats or have wide habitat tolerance. We found one true bug species new to the country and assume that it arrived with imported vegetation. Based on these findings, vegetated roofs of varying height and size benefit common generalists and fauna of open dry habitats, but seem to lack rare native specialists and may introduce non-natives if imported plant material is used. Because the responses to vegetation characteristics are taxon-specific, high diversity of roof vegetation types would benefit arthropod conservation.

AB  - The upcoming Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) meeting, and adoption of the new Global Biodiversity Framework, represent an opportunity to transform humanity's relationship with nature. Restoring nature while meeting human needs requires a bold vision, including mainstreaming biodiversity conservation in society. We present a framework that could support this: the Mitigation and Conservation Hierarchy. This places the Mitigation Hierarchy for mitigating and compensating the biodiversity impacts of developments (1, avoid; 2, minimize; 3, restore; and 4, offset, toward a target such as "no net loss" of biodiversity) within a broader framing encompassing all conservation actions. We illustrate its application by national governments, sub-national levels (specifically the city of London, a fishery, and Indigenous groups), companies, and individuals. The Mitigation and Conservation Hierarchy supports the choice of actions to conserve and restore nature, and evaluation of the effectiveness of those actions, across sectors and scales. It can guide actions toward a sustainable future for people and nature, supporting the CBD's vision.Y

AB  - Green areas, whether located in urban or rural environments, play an important role in maintaining ecological systems that provide vital environmental services for the quality of life of populations. In this sense, the present study assessed the environmental damage in the forest remnants that make up the Santa Genebrinha ecological corridor in Campinas city, Sao Paulo State, to identify limitations in the implementation and maintenance of this corridor. Initially, we surveyed geoindicators and the distribution of forest remnants in the Ribeirao Anhumas watershed, where the corridor is inserted. Subsequently, we developed an impact assessment matrix to quantify the main environmental damages affecting the forest remnants that make up this corridor. The results allowed us to identify the most impacting actions on the corridor: agriculture/monoculture, deforestation, burning, urbanization, and land use and occupation, with quantification (Q) averages of -7.6; -8.3; -7.3; -8.1; and -7.3, respectively, resulting in a high damage percentage (66.7%) for each action. The diagnosis pointed to local scope, direct incidence, and current temporality, reinforcing the need to consider these factors for implementation and management of the quoted corridor.

AB  - Constructed wetlands are a well-established technique to degrade wastewater contained antibiotics. And its removal at low temperature (< 15 C) has baffled researchers and engineers for decades. Electrochemical process has been increasingly valued as a promising approach to enhance antibiotics removal by both electrocatalytic oxidation-reduction and electrocoagulation. A pilot study was conducted using an electrolysis-integrated tidal flow constructed wetland (E-TFCW) to intensity sulfamethoxazole (SMX) under 4, 8 and 12 & DEG;C temperature re-gimes. E-TFCW have shown the better SMX removal efficiency (16.38% -31.45%) at low temperature, which was nearly 14.10% -25.31% higher than that of TFCW. It was no significant difference between 4 & DEG;C, 8 & DEG;C and 12 & DEG;C in E-TFCW, which was attributed to electrocatalysis of iron electrode. Temperature had no effect on the degradation path of SMX, where SMX was removed with hydroxylation, nitration and S-N hydrolysis. Proteo-bacteria contributed to higher SMX removal efficiency at low temperature. The response speed of microorganisms to external environment (< 8 & DEG;C) was accelerated owing to electrolysis, where the populations with same func-tions can be gathered together to resist the change of the extreme environment. However, the cooperative relationship among microorganisms in E-TFCW was weakened at 4 & PLUSMN; 1 & DEG;C. PICRUSt analysis results further demonstrated that the abundance of extracellular electron transfer related functional genes was increased. This study provides new insights into electrolysis-integrated constructed wetland functioning stability for accelerating antibiotics removal in cold environment.

AB  - Plecturocebus ornatus is an endemic vulnerable species due to its population decline and its restricted range within the Eastern Plains of Colombia. This region is affected by deforestation as a result of legal and illegal economic activities. The aim of this work was to analyze the presence and abundance of P. ornatus during a period of urban and livestock production expansion (1986-2019) in Villavicencio, Colombia. This municipality is the most affected by land-use changes associated with regional economic development and represents 3.4 % of P. ornatus distribution???s area. The analysis was performed using satellite images Landsat 4 and 8, with V-Late in ArcGIS 10.5 to describe landscape structure, and P. ornatus occurrence records, obtained through field observations and the Global Biological Information Facility. Densities were calculated for each fragment based on total individuals observed by transect. A generalized lineal model was used to evaluate the effects of patch-scale, landscape-scale and other variables on P. ornatus abundance. By 1986 the rural and peri-urban areas of Villavicencio were already a transformed landscape. During the analyzed period, landscape was predominantly made up of disconnected linear fragments with a secondary humid forest cover. Around 82.1 % of the fragments with P. ornatus records are threatened by urbanization and only 50 % are in protected areas. Densities varied from 0.00 to 7.26 ind/ha (0.00???726.82 ind/km2). Abundance of P. ornatus was highly influenced by landscape-scale variables related with landscape connectivity, as well as fragment area and number of other primate species. Therefore, the implementation of restoration measures that increase landscape connectivity and habitat availability is proposed, as well as more control over environmental land-use planning, to contribute to the conservation of P. ornatus in urban areas.

AB  - In order to secure pollination services and improve conservation strategies, a better understanding of factors influencing population structure of pollinator species is vital. Here, we aimed to empirically evaluate various individual-and population-based statistical methods for characterization of genetic structure of the widespread dronefly, Eristalis tenax. Thirty-five European populations, comprising 888 individuals, were genotyped at five polymorphic allozyme loci. Three Bayesian genotypic clustering approaches (STRUCTURE, BAPS and Geneland), pairwise F-ST estimates, analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA), principle component analysis (PCA) and Mantel tests were applied in a comparative way in attempt to reveal the patterns of gene flow that occurs at various spatial scales in E. tenax. STRUCTURE analysis and PCA results provided no evidence of conspecific differentiation. In contrast, BAPS and Geneland clustering solutions did acknowledge low but significant proportion of among-populations genetic variation revealed by AMOVA. Similarly, pairwise FST estimates partially argue against genetic homogeneity across Europe. The lack of correlation between genetic distance and both latitude and longitude variation suggests that the flies disperse in multiple directions. Therefore, our results indicate that continued long-range dispersal tend to homogenize populations over time, resulting in little population structure in E. tenax across the European landmass. On the other hand, significant differentiations between geographically proximate populations indicate that dispersal potential may not be realized and that gene flow patterns in E. tenax might be geographically complex. Using information from our genetic approaches will be useful for identifying patterns of migration and population connectivity across continent, which is an important issue for conservation efforts. Since E. tenax is an important pollinator, our results contribute to understanding the potential extent to which this taxon can facilitate gene flow among plant populations across natural and semi-natural habitats, agroecosystems and urban environments. Dronefly-mediated gene flow in plants is likely to occur over large distances and plant-dronefly conservation will require large-scale action.

AB  - This paper assesses changes in the southern Humboldt system (33-39 degrees S) in the 20th century by constructing and comparing food web models representing four historical periods: (i) lightly exploited (<1900s), (ii) altered by removal of marine mammals (1950), (iii) development of industrial fisheries (1992), and (iv) the more recent state (2005) when main stocks are fully or overexploited. Models are constructed with a standard structure in terms of functional groups using the Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) software version 5.1. Model components include: the fisheries, cetaceans, sea lions, marine birds, cephalopods, large-sized pelagic fish (swordfish), medium-sized pelagic fish (e.g., horse mackerel, mackerel, and Pacific grenadier), small-sized pelagic fish (e.g., anchovy and Araucanian herring), demersal fish (e.g., Chilean hake, black conger-eel), benthic invertebrates (red squat lobster, yellow squat lobster, pink shrimp) and other groups such as zooplankton, phytoplankton and detritus. Input data are gathered from published and unpublished (grey) literature. Inter-model comparison is based on individual and community indicators obtained by means of network analysis. The biomasses of target species (with the exception of small pelagic fish) and top predators decrease in more recent models. Although predation mortality is the main cause of total mortality for the majority of the fish groups in all models, fishing mortality of target species is high in the 1992 and 2005 models. This has led to a decrease in the importance of predation removal of the most important fish stocks compared with fishing, which is found to assume the role of the main predator in the system in the more recent state. Changes in system energetics could have resulted in loss of productivity by increased flow to detritus. Prior to heavy fishing, long-living and high-trophic level species were abundant compared to the most recent models in which species with small body size, short life span and low trophic level dominate. These fishing-induced trends are in accordance with what is theoretically expected in stressed ecosystems and, if correct, the food web could now be more susceptible to external forcing and negative ecological interactions.

AB  - In cities, trees planted along streets could play an important ecological role for spontaneous plants growing at their bases. For example, these trees could represent corridors by potentially connecting large green spaces (e.g., parks, gardens), which allow species to move within the urban matrix. We considered sets of urban trees in 15 streets in Paris, France, as metapopulations for 15 plant species. Our objective was to determine the factors influencing the dynamics of colonization and extinction of populations based on the distance of the streets to green spaces and biological traits of each species. Plant species in 1,324 tree bases of the Bercy District of Paris were surveyed annually from 2009 to 2015. For each species and each street, we used SPOMSIM software to identify the best-fit metapopulation model between four models with different colonization and extinction functions: propagule rain model (PRM) and Levins' model with or without rescue effect. Results demonstrated that species more often conformed to the PRM in streets near green spaces, which suggested that green spaces could act as sources for the populations in those streets. Species with seeds with long-term persistence more often conformed to the PRM, indicating that a soil seed bank helps species invade entire streets. Finally, a higher percentage of species with a short height conformed to models with a rescue effect, which indicated that those small species resisted the effects of weeding by the city technical services better than taller species. Synthesis and applications. This study showed how biological traits of species and geography of the district determine the dynamics of plants in the streets, and these results may provide important information for biodiversity management in cities.

AB  - Effective management and conservation of urban herpetofauna is challenging because little is known about the distribution, population dynamics, or habitat use of most species in urban areas. To address this knowledge gap, we studied the occupancy dynamics of seven common species in the Chicago, Illinois, USA, metropolitan area using artificial cover objects and aquatic trapping. From 2009 to 2012, we detected seven focal species 899 times, ranging from 49 detections of Eastern Tiger Salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) to 223 detections of Painted Turtles (Chrysemys picta). We used single-species multi-season (dynamic) occupancy models and a suite of environmental covariates to determine how natural (e.g., canopy cover) and urban (e.g., road density) habitat features influence rates of occupancy and turnover at local (n = 159 monitoring points) and landscape (n = 27 preserves) scales while explicitly incorporating detectability. Our results suggest that natural habitat features were generally better predictors of occupancy and turnover than anthropogenic features. At the local scale, extinction was more common than colonization, while at the landscape scale, colonization was more common than extinction. This study provides important baseline information to guide future research and management decisions and we recommend managing urban preserves for habitat diversity and connectivity to maximize herpetofaunal diversity.

AB  - The study of plants and animals on islands, both natural and artificial, has produced a body of generalizations immediately useful to land use planners concerned with minimizing the impacts of habitat destruction on the environment.  A case study of 37 isolated chaparral fragments in San Diego, California, demonstrates the consequences of habitat fragmentation, including rapid and predictable extinctions of native birds in isolated canyons.  This study and others can be used to generate planning guidelines for the prevention of such disappearances.  Among the most important measures that can be taken are consolidation of open space set-asides and the provision of corridors linking habitat patches.  Corridors can mitigate some of the negative effects of development on wildlife, especially where they facilitate the movement of large predators.

AB  - Connectivity underpins the persistence of life; it needs to inform biodiversity con-servation decisions. Yet, when prioritising conservation areas and developing actions, connectivity is not being operationalised in spatial planning. The chal-lenge is the translation of flows associated with connectivity into conservation objectives that lead to actions. Connectivity is nebulous, it can be abstract and mean different things to different people, making it difficult to include in conser-vation problems. Here, we show how connectivity can be included in mathemat-ically defining conservation planning objectives. We provide a path forward for linking connectivity to high-level conservation goals, such as increasing species' persistence. We propose ways to design spatial management areas that gain biodiversity benefit from connectivity.

AB  - 1. Artificial lights have become an integral and welcome part of our urban and peri-urban environments. However, recent research has highlighted the potentially negative ecological consequences of ubiquitous artificial light. In particular, insects, especially moths, are expected to be negatively impacted by the presence of artificial lights. Previous research with light traps has shown a male-biased attraction to light in moths.
   2. In this study, we sought to determine whether street lights could limit moth dispersal and whether there was any sex bias in attraction to light. More specifically, we aimed to determine sex-specific attraction radii for moths to street lights.
   3. We tested these hypotheses by collecting moths for 2 years at an experimental set-up. To estimate the attraction radii, we developed a Markov model and related it to the acquired data.
   4. Utilizing multinomial statistics, we found that attraction rates to lights in the middle of the matrix were substantially lower than predicted by the null hypothesis of equal attraction level (0.44 times). With the Markov model, we estimated that a corner light was 2.77 times more attractive than a wing light with an equivalentre attraction radius of c. 23 m around each light. We found neither sexual differences in the attraction rate nor in the attraction radius of males and females. Since we captured three times more males than females, we conclude that sex ratios are representative of operational sex ratios or of different flight activities.
   5. These results provide evidence for street lights to limit moth dispersal, and that they seem to act equally on male and female moths. Consequently, public lighting might divide a suitable landscape into many small habitats. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume (i) that public lighting near hedges and bushes or field margins reduces the quality of these important habitat structures and (ii) that public lighting may affect moth movement between patches.

AB  - In land-scarce cities, high-rise apartment buildings may provide vertical spaces for natural-light home gardening along corridors, rooftops, balconies as well as facades. The vertical space can improve not only urban envi-ronmental sustainability but also food security. Using an experimental approach, we investigated the food production potential of a high-rise public housing apartment building based on different gardening systems, food crops, and sunlight availability. A gardening prototype system for building corridors was shown to increase the unit area yield of corridor gardening by fivefold compared to a commercial trough planter system. Additionally, this commercial trough planter system was mainly for leafy vegetable production, whereas the gardening pro-totype system for corridors is also suitable for climbing crops, such as legumes and cucurbits. Nevertheless, because of the limited space along corridors of the apartment building and the relatively low-light levels on average, corridor gardening was estimated to meet only 0.5 % of the demand for vegetables of the residents living in the apartment building. Rooftop gardening with shallow growing medium (depth < 15 cm) was esti-mated to meet 3 % of demand, and facade gardening 43 %, given the larger space available. Although the vegetable production potential in this study was estimated based on a particular typology of public housing apartment buildings in Singapore, our results showed that vegetable production in public housing apartment buildings is feasible, and home gardening can produce a substantial amount of vegetables for consumption if well deployed. Governments of highly urbanized cities may wish to invest in better home garden designs for high-rise public housing apartment buildings and encourage residents' participation in home gardening, which would increase high-rise greenery coverage and improve urban food system resilience. Future studies should also investigate the environmental sustainability and food safety aspects of home gardening in highly urbanized cities.

AB  - Context Vehicle-strike has been identified as a key threatening process for koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) survival and persistence in Australia. Roads and traffic act as barriers to koala movement and can impact dispersal and metapopulation dynamics. Given the high cost of wildlife mitigation structures such as purpose-built fauna-specific underpasses or overpasses (eco-passages), road construction and management agencies are constantly seeking cost-effective strategies that facilitate safe passage for fauna across roads. Here we report on an array of detection methods trialled to verify use of retrofitted road infrastructure (existing water culverts or bridge underpasses) by individual koalas in fragmented urban landscapes in south-east Queensland.
   Aims The study examined whether the retrofitting of existing road structures at six sites facilitated safe passage for koalas across roads. Our primary objective was to record utilisation of retrofitted infrastructure at the level of the individual.
   Methods We used a combination of existing monitoring methods such as GPS/VHF collars, camera traps, sand plots, and RFID tags, along with a newly developed animal-borne wireless identification (WID) tag and datalogging system, specifically designed for this project, to realise the study aims.
   Key results We were able to verify 130 crossings by koalas involving a retrofitted structure or a road surface over a 30-month period by using correlated data from complementary methods. We noted that crossings were generally uncommon and mostly undertaken by only a subset of our tagged individuals at each site (21% overall).
   Conclusions An important element of this study was that crossing events could be accurately determined at the level of the individual. This allowed for detailed assessment of eco-passage usage, rather than the more usual approach of simply recording species' presence.
   Implications This study underscores the value of identifying the constraints of each individual monitoring method in relation to site conditions. It also highlights the benefits of contingency planning to limit data loss (i.e. using more than one method to collect data). We suggest an approach that uses complementary monitoring methods has significant advantages for researchers, particularly with reference to improving understanding of whether eco-passages are meeting their prescribed conservation goals.

AB  - Sukarno-Hatta street corridor is forecasted to be one of Malang City business corridors. However, the condition of its pedestrian facilities is not suitable for pedestrian. The rapid activities along the Sukarno-Hatta street corridor are not in accordance with the services of its pedestrian facilities; so, it is necessary to plan a walkable street corridor that accommodates pedestrian perceptions. Several descriptive and quantitative analysis methods used in this research are support activity analysis, the pattern of pedestrian movement, importance performance analysis and walkability tool index by U.S. Department and Human Services. Based on walkability analysis, the level of walkability of Sukarno-Hatta street corridor is 52.49%, which means the walkability level is medium. The improvements of pedestrian way based on pedestrian perception are: improvement and addition of pedestrian ways that are not continuous, planting plants that can reduce air pollution, availability of crossings, the addition of shade trees, traffic management to reduce vehicle congestion and parking designs.

AB  - Questions European woodlands harbor at least 386 alien plant species but the factors driving local invasions remain unknown. By using a large vegetation-plot database, we asked how local richness and abundance of alien species vary by regions, elevation, climate, soil properties, human disturbance, and habitat types.
   Location Western, central and southern Europe.
   Methods We linked consolidated data from the European Vegetation Archive (16,211 plots) to a habitat classification scheme, climate, soil properties and human disturbance variables. In addition, we used 250 km x 250 km regional grid cells to test whether local patterns differ among regions. We used generalized additive models (GAMs) and quantile GAMs to explore how relative alien species richness and the sum of alien species covers per plot relate to predictors. Random Forest analyses (RFs) were employed to assess the importance of individual predictors that were not multicollinear.
   Results Relative alien species richness and the sum of alien species covers varied across regions and habitat types, with effects being more pronounced at the maximum rather than average responses. Both response variables declined with increasing elevation and distance to the nearest road or railroad and increased with the amount of sealed soil. Maxima in fitted functions matched plots from regional invasion hotspots in northwestern and central Europe. RFs accounted for 39.6% and 20.9% of the total variation in relative alien species richness and the sum of alien species covers, respectively, with region and habitat being the most important variables.
   Conclusions The importance of maximum response quantiles and the prevalence of regional hotspots point to invasion debt in European woodlands. As alien plants expand further, their species richness and abundance in woodlands will be likely driven by the shared effects of the introduction and planting history, differences in the invaded habitat types, and dispersal corridors.

AB  - Based on the multi-source data (e.g., building vector and remote sensing data) of the main urban areas of Chongqing, China, this study selected a few natural factors-the relief degree of the land surface (RDLS), land cover index (LCI), annual average land surface temperature (LST), water resource index (WRI), and frontal area index (FAI)-and used the geographic information system spatial analysis method to quantitatively investigate the spatial variation in the suitability of human settlements in mountainous areas from the perspective of ventilation. The study findings can be summarized as follows: 1) The population distribution in the main urban areas of Chongqing is affected by, in descending order, the LCI, FAI, RDLS, WRI, and LST. 2) In the main urban areas of Chongqing, the RDLS ranges from 0.21 to 2.82; it is low in the south and high in the north. The LCI ranges from 0.02 to 0.99; it is relatively low in those urban areas with a high building density. The LST ranges from 15.30 to 24.87 degrees C; in contrast to the spatial pattern of the LCI, the LST in the urban centers is higher than at the urban peripheries. The WRI ranges from 0.04 to 0.79; it is highest along the Yangtze and Jialing rivers. The FAI ranges from 0 to 1.63, exhibiting a gradual decline from the urban centers to the urban peripheries. As the FAI increases, the ventilation capacity worsens. 3) The ventilation-based human settlements index ranges from 0.06 to 0.54 in the mountainous areas of the city, gradually increasing from the southwest to the northeast in the main urban areas of Chongqing. In addition, zones with unsuitable human settlements are mainly distributed in mountainous regions with a high RDLS and relatively scarce water resources, whereas zones with suitable human settlements are primarily distributed in regions with a moderate RDLS, adequate vegetation cover, appropriate LST, abundant water resources, and adequate ventilation. The study findings can be used to evaluate the comfort level of human settlements, and have strategic significance to the efficient planning of urban development and the optimal layout of the population distribution.

AB  - Introduction: In the Pacific Northwest of North America, research addressing lentic-breeding amphibian population vulnerability has emphasized aquatic habitats, frequently neglecting terrestrial habitats. Consequently, wetland protection and restoration often fails to preserve or restore adjacent uplands required by lentic-breeding amphibians. Inattention to the juxtaposition and connectivity of uplands to wetlands could locally extirpate lentic-breeding amphibians. The objective of this research is to identify the relative importance of juxtaposed terrestrial and aquatic habitats in a lentic-breeding amphibian, the northern red-legged frog (Rana aurora), by evaluating the relationship between its occurrence and abundance with its aquatic and terrestrial habitats. To accomplish this, egg mass counts were used to quantify R. aurora populations in 30 stillwater habitats across an urbanization gradient. Using a Geographic Information System, seven descriptors of aquatic and surrounding terrestrial habitats were measured to evaluate their relationships to R. aurora occurrence and abundance.
   Results: Rana aurora occurrence and breeding abundance both reflect the forested area around wetland breeding sites and forest connectivity to those sites. Rana aurora breeding abundance also strongly reflects the percent of forested perimeter around wetland breeding sites. The forest habitat most important for R. aurora breeding abundance seems to be > 200 m from the breeding wetlands. The American bullfrog presence and the two aquatic parameters measured, wetland area and vegetated area, were unrelated to R. aurora occurrence and breeding abundance.
   Conclusions: Area and connectivity of juxtaposed forested terrestrial habitat may represent a basic control on R. aurora presence and population size. Urban development policies should consider preservation and restoration of upland forest habitats beyond current fixed-width buffers and wetland habitat area at landscape scales.

AB  - One consequence of the spatial expansion of cities is the multiplication of highly fragmented and diverse green spaces immediately surrounded by urban areas. Whereas the global expansion of urban areas is a growing concern for the viability of woodland arthropods, the suitability of green spaces as refuges to arthropods needs to be clarified. In order to assess and compare the survival rates of the woodland carabid Abax parallelepipedus in four types of green urban sites (remnant forest patch, urban park, woody corridor and set of gardens), we conducted a Capture-Mark-Recapture experiment based on 483 individuals collected in a forest located in a natural landscape (considered as the control site) and released into the various green spaces. Results indicated strong heterogeneity in survival probability between green spaces. Survival rates were slightly higher in the control site than in the remnant forest patch, the urban park and the corridor, which appear suitable for the survival of the species. However, it was substantially lower in the gardens. The analysis further revealed that these differences in survival are largely explained by the differences of within -site habitat fragmentation. By indicating that urban green spaces may contribute unequally to woodland carabids survival, our study highlights that the modification of local environmental conditions alone (increase of temperature, increase of soil pollution and change in food availability) could not explain the negative effect of urbanization. This study argues for the development of corridors in cities in order to favour the colonisation of green spaces by woodland carabids.

AB  - Aim Understanding the spatial ecology of animal movements is a critical element in conserving long-lived, highly mobile marine species. Analyzing networks developed from movements of six sea turtle species reveals marine connectivity and can help prioritize conservation efforts. Location Global. Methods We collated telemetry data from 1235 individuals and reviewed the literature to determine our dataset's representativeness. We used the telemetry data to develop spatial networks at different scales to examine areas, connections, and their geographic arrangement. We used graph theory metrics to compare networks across regions and species and to identify the role of important areas and connections. Results Relevant literature and citations for data used in this study had very little overlap. Network analysis showed that sampling effort influenced network structure, and the arrangement of areas and connections for most networks was complex. However, important areas and connections identified by graph theory metrics can be different than areas of high data density. For the global network, marine regions in the Mediterranean had high closeness, while links with high betweenness among marine regions in the South Atlantic were critical for maintaining connectivity. Comparisons among species-specific networks showed that functional connectivity was related to movement ecology, resulting in networks composed of different areas and links. Main conclusions Network analysis identified the structure and functional connectivity of the sea turtles in our sample at multiple scales. These network characteristics could help guide the coordination of management strategies for wide-ranging animals throughout their geographic extent. Most networks had complex structures that can contribute to greater robustness but may be more difficult to manage changes when compared to simpler forms. Area-based conservation measures would benefit sea turtle populations when directed toward areas with high closeness dominating network function. Promoting seascape connectivity of links with high betweenness would decrease network vulnerability.

AB  - Many protected areas worldwide will be too small to maintain long-term viable populations of many of their resident species. It may be possible in many cases to reduce the adverse ''island'' effects by linking adjacent protected areas with wildlife corridors. Wildlife corridors are defined in this paper as habitat that permits the movement of organisms between ecological isolates. Corridors should be designed for those species within a protected area that are considered to be most vulnerable to extinction. For these species knowledge about the habitat requirements, dispersal, seasonal movements, avoidance behavior, and learning behavior are important for the design of wildlife corridors. The ability of a species to successfully use a corridor is dependent in part upon the width and length of the corridor. In most cases, the determination of the minimum corridor width will be an empirical calculation. Many of the practical challenges of designing wildlife corridors are examined by presenting examples of proposed wildlife corridors in the Eastern Usambara Mountains and on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.

AB  - Mitigating the impact of invasive species is a global conservation challenge, which requires an understanding of the factors that drive the distribution, abundance, and ecological interactions of invaders. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are a widespread and abundant invasive omnivore in Australia. They are common in dunes and coastal areas that abut marine shorelines, which provide abundant food resources in the form of carrion. They are considered a key threatening process to Australia's biodiversity. The global literature posits that foxes use a broad mix of habitats, leading to an expectation of few consistent associations of foxes with landscape attributes and human uses of beaches and coastal dunes - this is the fundamental hypothesis tested here.
   Fox distribution was comprehensively mapped in Eastern Australia (108 km of shoreline, 192 sites, 6900 h of wildlife camera footage) and related (general additive models) to a range of potential drivers (e.g. topographic features, habitat types, urbanisation, connectivity, dogs, fox removal) on ocean beaches.
   Notwithstanding the catholic nature of red foxes elsewhere, here we show that habitat use by red foxes along ocean beaches is not indiscriminate: more foxes occur on beaches backed by high dunes and large expanses of natural vegetation. Conversely, significantly fewer foxes occur where natural dune habitats have been lost to urban areas. Fox removal did not affect fox distributions.
   Foxes are functionally important carnivores in coastal landscapes, and their disjunct distribution demonstrated by us suggests a spatially heterogeneous functional signal in coastal food-webs. More broadly, sandy beach ecosystems, interspersed by urban development, dominate many coasts, offering a rich bio-geographic tapestry to test how models of fox habitat choice articulate into invasive species management and food-web interactions.

AB  - Differently to other European countries Lithuania has inherited from Soviet time period quite width protection zones of state importance with wooden plantations along railways. Those protection zones vary from 20 m (in cities) up to 45-70 m (in rural areas) in one side. The planted or spontaneous wooden plantations within those zones occupy over 2 thous. ha. The status of protective plantations serve for multifunctional purposes by ensuring railway traffic safety, mitigating negative impact of railway traffic, exhibiting Lithuanian landscape for travellers, improving landscape connectivity, living and working environment quality. At the same time there is a challenge for proper management of those plantations and profitability. In the middle of XX century planted pioneer species reach or is going to reach mature age. There is the threat of increasing number of dangerous trees, challenge for ensuring continuous cover of protective plantations, their services and structure match for predominating function.
   This study presents the challenges for future development and society preferences to services of protective lineside plantations along railways. The results of analysis of present condition of railway lineside vegetation, as well the results of social survey showed, what it is not enough just to manage the dangerous trees for railway safeness but it is essential complex means for protective plantations development, services succession.

AB  - Despite a marked increase in the focus toward biodiversity conservation in fragmented landscapes, studies that confirm species breeding success are scarce and limited. In this paper, we asked whether local (area of forest patches) and landscape (amount of suitable habitat surrounding of focal patches) factors affect the breeding success of raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) in Tokyo, Central Japan. The breeding success of raccoon dogs is easy to judge as adults travel with pups during the breeding season. We selected 21 forest patches (3.3-797.8 ha) as study sites. In each forest patch, we used infrared-triggered cameras for a total of 60 camera days per site. We inspected each photo to determine whether it was of an adult or a pup. Although we found adult raccoon dogs in all 21 forest patches, pups were found only in 13 patches. To estimate probability of occurrence and detection for raccoon in 21 forest fragments, we used single season site occupancy models in PRESENCE program. Model selection based on AIC and model averaging showed that the occupancy probability of pups was positively affected by patch area. This result suggests that large forests improve breeding success of raccoon dogs. A major reason for the low habitat value of small, isolated patches may be the low availability of food sources and the high risk of being killed on the roads in such areas. Understanding the effects of local and landscape parameters on species breeding success may help us to devise and implement effective long-term conservation and management plans.

AB  - 1. Stream fragmentation alters the structure of aquatic communities on a global scale, generally through loss of native species. Among riverscapes in the Great Plains of North America, stream fragmentation and hydrologic alteration (flow regulation and dewatering) are implicated in the decline of native fish diversity.
   2. This study documents the spatio-temporal distribution of fish reproductive guilds in the fragmented Arkansas and Ninnescah rivers of south-central Kansas using retrospective analyses involving 63 years of fish community data.
   3. Pelagic-spawning fishes declined throughout the study area during 1950-2013, including Arkansas River shiner (Notropis girardi) last reported in 1983, plains minnow (Hybognathus placitus) in 2006, and peppered chub (Macrhybopsis tetranema) in 2012. Longitudinal patterns in fish community structure in both rivers consisted of strong breaks associated with dams, and pelagic-spawning fishes were missing from shorter fragments upstream of those barriers. Among downstream and longer fragments, probability of occurrence for pelagic-spawning fishes declined or fell to zero during periods of drought.
   4. Based on these data, interactions between fragmentation and drying are hypothesized as operating as an ecological ratchet mechanism in which forward movement toward pelagic-spawning fish extirpation occurs during desiccation, and reciprocated reverse movement toward recolonization following return of flows is blocked by fragmentation. 5. The ratchet mechanism is capable of explaining the long-term 'ratcheting down' of fish diversity in Great Plains rivers and has implications for managing biodiversity in fragmented riverscapes where water is scarce or might become so in the future.

AB  - Artificial light at night is a pervasive anthropogenic stressor for biodiversity. Many fast-flying insectivorous bat species feed on insects that are attracted to light-emitting ultraviolet radiation (10-400 nm). Several countries are currently focused on replacing mercury vapour lamps, which emit ultraviolet light, with more cost-efficient light-emitting diode (LED) lights, which emit less ultraviolet radiation. This reduction in ultraviolet light may cause declines in insect densities in cities, predatory fast-flying bats, and some edge-foraging and slow-flying bats. Capitalising on a scheme to update streetlights from high ultraviolet mercury vapour to low ultraviolet LED in Sydney, Australia, we measured the activity of individual bat species, the activity of different functional groups and the bat and insect communities, before and after the change in technology. We also surveyed sites with already LED lights, sites with mercury vapour lights and unlit bushland remnants. Species adapted to foraging in cluttered vegetation, and some edge-space foraging species, were more active in unlit bushland sites than in all lit sites and decreased in activity at lit sites after the change to LED lights. The change to LED streetlights caused a decrease in the fast-flying Chalinolobus gouldii but not Miniopterus schreibersii oceanensis, the latter being more influenced by seasonal and environmental variables. Insect biomass was not affected by changing light types, but instead was negatively correlated with the moon's percentage illuminance. Changing streetlights to LEDs could result in a decline in some insectivorous bats in cities. This study confirms that unlit urban bushland remnants are important refuges for high bat diversity, particularly for more clutter-adapted species and some edge-space foraging species. Preventing light penetration into unlit bushland patches and corridors remains essential to protect the urban bat community.

AB  - In fragmented landscapes the matrix, i.e. the surrounding but different habitat, can have a strong influence on the biodiversity in fragments. The amount of natural habitat converted for urban use is increasing on every continent, so fragments of natural habitat are becoming more likely to be embedded in a matrix of human-made habitat, rather than other natural habitats. This is particularly prevalent on urbanised coastlines. Yet there has been little research to help us understand the dynamics and consequences of fragmented coastal landscapes. In Sydney, Australia, most of the natural intertidal landscape of Sydney Harbour (a mosaic of rocky shore, mudflats and sandflats) has been replaced by artificial habitat (such as seawalls). I tested the hypothesis that biota on rocky shores in Sydney Harbour would differ depending on whether shores were embedded in a matrix of artificial habitat (here called 'complete fragments'), natural habitat (here called 'natural patches'), or a mixture of the 2 types of matrix (called mixed fragments). Assemblages at mid-shore levels were significantly different among these types of fragments. At mid- and low-shore levels, assemblages were more variable in mixed fragments than in complete fragments and natural patches. The kinds of mobile and sessile taxa that contributed most to differences among fragments differed, depending on which types of fragments were compared. Many taxa were found in greater abundance in natural patches than in mixed or complete fragments, although not all comparisons were statistically significant. Artificial habitat seems to interrupt natural connectivity among local populations of intertidal marine organisms in this urbanised estuary.

AB  - Congress is currently evaluating the wilderness status of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) public lands in Utah. Wilderness areas play many important roles, and one critical role is the conservation of biological diversity. We propose that objectives for conserving biodiversity on BLM lands in Utah be to (1) ensure the long-term population viability of native animal and plant species, (2) maintain the critical ecological and evolutionary processes upon which these species depend, and. (3) preserve the full range of communities, successional stages, and environmental gradients. To achieve these objectives, wilderness areas should be selected so as to protect large, contiguous areas, augment existing protected areas, buffer wilderness areas with multiple-use public lands, interconnect existing protected areas with dispersal and movement corridors, conserve entire watersheds and elevational gradients, protect native communities from invasions of exotic species, protect sites of maximum species diversity protect sites with rare and endemic species, and protect habitats-of threatened and endangered species. We use a few comparatively well-studied taxa as examples to highlight the importance of particular BLM lands.

AB  - There have been calls for the expansion of protected areas (PAs) to tackle the ongoing biodiversity loss, yet it is unclear where future PAs might help to protect biodiversity in degraded landscapes under the conservation planning principles of complementarity, connectivity and cost-effectiveness. Our conservation goal is to increase the PA network coverage to up to 30% of the landscape of the Zhangjiang River Basin for target species in the karst area of southwest China, a global biodiversity hotspot. Zonation 4GUI was used to evaluate the adequacy of current PAs and to strategically expand PAs while maximizing the coverage of target species and considering ecological integrity and socioeconomic activities. The results show that significant habitat degradation has occurred across 77.9% of the basin. The current PAs cover 6.3% of the site and represent 8.7% of the total distribution of key species. With regards to the threshold of protection of 30% of the area, protecting an additional 27.2% of the site under an ecological integrity prioritization scenario and a scenario of the socioeconomic costs involved in iteration would cover 93.5% and 80.4% of the ranges of the key species, respectively. Our results can be used to inform the upcoming actions associated with karst area conservation-related policies.

AB  - Conservation plans are usually developed for regions that encompass only one environmental realm (terrestrial, freshwater or marine) because of logistical, institutional and political constraints. This is inadequate because these realms often interact through processes that form, utilize and maintain interfaces or connections, which are essential for the persistence of some species and ecosystem functions. We present a conceptual framework for systematic conservation prioritization that explicitly accounts for the connectivity between the terrestrial, marine, and freshwater realms. We propose a classification of this connectivity that encompasses: (1) narrow interfaces, such as riparian strips; (2) broad interfaces, such as estuaries: (3) constrained connections, such as corridors of native vegetation used by amphibians to move between natal ponds and adult habitat; and (4) diffuse connections, such as the movements of animals between breeding and feeding habitats. We use this taxonomy of inter-realm connectivity to describe existing and new spatial conservation prioritization techniques that aim to promote the persistence of processes that operate between realms.

AB  - To reframe the imperfect review processes of nation-scale actions on area-based conservation through protected area (PA) networks, we first created novel infrastructure to visualize nation-level biodiversity information in Japan. We then assessed the performance of the existing PA network relative to land exploitation pressure and evaluated conservation effectiveness of PA expansion for the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. The Zonation software was used to spatially prioritize conservation areas to minimize biodiversity loss and the extinction risk for 8077 Japanese vascular plant and vertebrate species under constraints of the existing PA network and land use. The spatial pattern of the identified priority areas, which were considered candidate areas for expansion of the current PA network, was influenced by land-use types according to the mask layers of non-PAs, and low-, middle-, and high-ranked PAs. The current PA network reduced the aggregate extinction risk of multiple species by 36.6%. Indeed, the proportion of built-up areas in the existing PAs was generally smaller than that in the areas surrounding PAs. Notably, high-ranked PAs effectively restricted the built-up pressure (0.04% every 10 years), whereas low-ranked PAs in national park and wild-life protection areas did not (1.8% every 10 years). Conservation effects were predicted to substantially improve by expansion of high-ranked (legally strict) PAs into remote non-PAs without population/socioeconomic activities, or expansion of medium-ranked PAs into satoyama which have traditionally been used for agriculture and forestry, and urban areas. A 30% land conservation target was predicted to decrease extinction risk by 74.1% when PA expansion was implemented across remote areas, satoyama, and urban areas; moreover, PA connectivity almost doubled compared with the existing PA network. In contrast, a conventional scenario showed that placing national parks in state-owned and non-populated areas would reduce extinction risk by only 4.0%. Conservation prioritization analyses demonstrated the effectiveness of using a comprehensive conservation approach that reconciles land-sparing protection and land-sharing conservation in other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) in satoyama and urban green spaces. Our results revealed that complementary inclusion of various PA interventions related to their governance and land-use planning plays a critical role in effectively preventing biodiversity loss and makes it more feasible to achieve ambitious conservation targets.

AB  - Karachi Metropolitan Corporation has been extensively planting few species along the streets over the last few decades. However, the suitability of the species was not properly studied before planting them in Karachi. This is evident from the fact that many species were profusely planted in Karachi during different decades, which were later removed for various reasons. For instance, Eucalyptus was extensively planted during 1980s and 1990s along the streets in Karachi, which was later removed due to their fast growing roots and shoots that damaged many civic services. Therefore, the current study investigates (i) the changes in taxonomic diversity and the composition of the species growing along a major roadway of different land uses in Karachi, (ii) causes and implications due to the changes in their diversity and composition. This study reveals that monoculture plantings were commonly practiced in Karachi. Currently, Conocarpus erectus is the most frequent species, which alone has 83.55% individuals on the street under study. Earlier, the same street was extensively planted with Eucalyptus and Guaiacum officinale. In 1993, the street under study was represented by 32.04% native plants and 67.96% exotic plants from 67 different species. Currently, the same street is represented by 53 species. The target-based 10:20:30 heuristic guidelines and non-target based Shannon and Inverse Simpson Diversity indices have been applied to analyze the flora of the street. Inverse Species Diversity index of the plants along the corridor has declined substantially from 8.75 to 1.41 over the last two decades that shows an increase in monotonous landscaping along the street under study, which make them vulnerable to diseases and pests. The changes in species richness along different land uses have also been analyzed. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - AimPrimary drainage basins and megaherbivore suitability underpin the design of conservation corridors aimed at preserving regional patterns and processes in the Albany Subtropical Thicket (AST) biome. We use comparative phylogeography to investigate the influences of these two features on population-level processes (long-distance seed dispersal) of three tree species.
   LocationAlbany Subtropical Thicket biome, South Africa.
   MethodsThree dominant and widespread AST tree species (Nymania capensis, Pappea capensis and Schotia afra) were sampled across their distribution within the biome. Phylogeographical patterns were established using chloroplast DNA sequences, tested against drainage basin configuration and compared with the different seed dispersal syndromes of each tree species.
   ResultsTwo species, N.capensis and P.capensis, show strong and significant evidence of population isolation within basins, whereas S.afra has no evidence of restricted gene flow across the AST. We argue that this contradicting pattern is driven by the different seed dispersal syndromes found within each species: N.capensis is wind-dispersed, P.capensis is bird-dispersed, whereas a range of large herbivores disperse S.afra seeds including African elephants.
   Main conclusionsThe evolutionary processes that make primary drainage basins significant biogeographical units within the AST continue to operate at the intraspecific level due to a lack of long-distance interpopulation seed dispersal between basins. Thus, drainage basins in this system, and in other topographically complex landscapes, are important surrogates of biodiversity and evolutionary processes that should underpin conservation planning. However, we suggest that this surrogacy breaks down when a species is dispersed by large herbivores, which are ideal agents of long-distance dispersal in complex landscapes. These results support the two significant components of the planning decision for the AST megaconservancy network: (1) drainage basins as major biogeographical (and also now phylogeographical) units, and (2) establishing interbasin networks with the aim of allowing long-distance movement of large mammals, including elephants.

AB  - Roads and highways are 1 of the most significant obstacles affecting wildlife movement by fragmenting habitat, altering wildlife migration and use of habitat, while also being a danger to wildlife and humans caused by wildlife-vehicle interactions. To mitigate wildlife mortality on highway sections and to minimize death and injury to motorists as well, road ecologists have proposed structures adapted for the safe passage of wildlife across roads. In this study, photographic sampling was conducted using trail cameras to quantify wildlife activity and use of existing culverts, bridges, and drainages within 2 separate sections of Mexico Federal Highway 2 where previous field assessment had observed high levels of activity. These sections are important areas for the conservation of wildlife, and they are known to be biological corridors for rare species of concern such as jaguar, black bear, and ocelot. The trail cameras were operated for 1 year to document the annual cycle of wildlife movement through the area. With the photographs obtained, a database was created containing the information from each wildlife-culvert interaction. Prior to sampling, an inventory of existing culverts was conducted that measured height, width, volume, and surrounding habitat to assign a hypothesized use quality index. After testing for significant differences in use index among culverts, we recognized that all culverts were equally important for moving wildlife, and that there were no significant differences in the use of culverts by the quality index.

AB  - The threshold below which population declines impact the effectiveness of plant reproduction is essential for the identification of populations that can no longer spontaneously recover following habitat management or restoration, below the minimum viable population (MVP) size. We hypothesized that risk of reproductive limitation can be evaluated from combined analysis of pollen activity, ovule fertilization and germination in the context of population demographics and fragmentation. The marsh gentian (Gentiana pneumonanthe), a rare emblematic species of European heathland and fen, was investigated at the southern limit of its range in eighteen populations encompassing one to several hundred thousand individuals, spanning small fragments to extensive well-preserved areas. An index of habitat fragmentation was determined from GIS; field surveys determined the ratio of juvenile to reproductive age states; fluorescence microscopy of pistils determined, for each population, the proportion of flowers exhibiting active pollen tube growth. Analysis of seed lots determined the ovule fertilization rate and seed germination capacity. Some of the small populations occupying restricted habitat fragments showed high rates of pollination (100%) and 'normal' age state demographics. However, reproductive characters all exhibited exponential rise to maximum relationships with population size, indicating clear tipping points (for pollination, at a threshold of 7 reproductive adults, and for ovule fertilization rate and germination at 42 reproductive adults). Thus although small populations may set seed, exhibit a 'normal' age state structure, and may appear viable, reproductive effectiveness declines when population size falls below 42 generative individuals and < 7 is an indicator of strong limitation. Although many remnant populations of G. pneumonanthe are in the order of 50-150 individuals these should be not be considered as MVPs; they are on the brink of calamity.

AB  - Roadsides form potential habitats for several grassland species adapted to regular mowing management. We studied the communities of butterflies and day-active moths in 51 sites along the verges of the three road types, i.e., highways, urban roads and rural roads. Despite different traffic densities and widths of the road and verge, the groups were rather similar with regard to soil properties, vegetation structure and mowing intensity. The species richness and total abundance of butterflies (53 species, 5964 individuals) and diurnal moths (46 species, 4626 individuals) were also rather similar in each road type, although a preference for wider verges was observed. Butterfly diversity increased (but not significantly) from the verges of narrow rural roads to wider highways. The highest numbers of meadow species were recorded along highways and the total abundance, especially of diurnal moths, decreased in accordance with the road size. High nectar abundance was the most important factor increasing the numbers of meadow butterflies along road verges, while meadow moths were mostly favoured by shelter provided by tall vegetation. Verges surrounded by cultivated fields were generally related to low numbers of both Lepidoptera groups, whereas adjacent forests increased the total number of all species and favoured several butterflies inhabiting forest edges. The adjacent environment inflicted compositional differences on the Lepidoptera fauna of the three road types. The results indicate that road verges should be considered an important reserve for species dependent on semi-natural grasslands in Finland. A growing interest in accommodating current roadside management for conserving biodiversity is likely to benefit Lepidoptera communities in the verge habitats. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Restingas are lowland sandy ecosystems located between mountain ranges and the sea. For living organisms in this ecosystem, restingas can be seen as habitats formed by islands of vegetation separated by a sandy matrix. These organisms are highly influenced by the environmental conditions and physical characteristics of the landscape, including size, connectivity and environmental heterogeneity. Given the recognized effectiveness of ants as bioindicators, this study uses these organisms as a model to assess how do the physical characteristics of a landscape influence the structures of ant communities. The study was carried out in the Parque das Dunas, Salvador - Bahia, Brazil. Within this park, four categories of vegetation islands (Small, Medium, Large and Continuous) were delimited, where the ant fauna was sampled and the forms of vegetal life were analyzed, using the Raunkiaer analysis. A total of 69 ant species were collected from 31 genera and six subfamilies. We found a positive relationship between ant richness and diversity of plant life forms (Shannon index). In general, there was a significant difference in the composition of ant species between the areas of continuous vegetation and the different vegetation islands. We conclude that there is a bottom up effect mediating the ant community associated with dune vegetation, where the local richness of ant species responds to vegetation heterogeneity.

AB  - Roads represent barriers to animal movement due to physical obstruction, mortality, or behavioural avoidance. The population-level consequences of such constraints remain poorly understood, because successful crossings may be sufficient to counteract negative effects of fragmentation and isolation. Here we examine the individual and population-level barrier effects of a motorway on the common genet Genetta genetta, by combining long-term road mortality, radio tracking and population genetics data. We found 84 genets killed at roads, of which 68% were subadults, with a peak mortality during the dispersal period. The home ranges of resident adults often bordered the motorway, and their sizes were similar close to (314 ha, n = 9) and far from (258 ha, n = 10) the motorway. The crossing rate was much higher for dispersing subadults (4.1 crossings/100 nights, n = 3) than for resident adults living near the motorway (0.2 crossings/100 nights, n = 9), though the number of tracked subadults crossing the motorway was low. Genetic kinship analysis revealed seven crossings based on father offspring and half-sibling relationships. There was no significant genetic differentiation related to the motorway. The movement of residents were strongly constrained by the motorway, though gene flow mediated by successful crossings, particularly by subadults, likely prevented genetic differentiation. Genet movements across the motorway were probably facilitated by low traffic flow and the presence of crossing structures. Our study implies that evaluating mitigation strategies to reduce the barrier effects of roads would benefit from the integration of mortality, animal behaviour, and population genetics data, to increase effectiveness and avoid wasting scarce conservation resources.

AB  - Vegetation plays a key role in not only improving urban environments, but also conserving ecosystems. The spatial continuity of vegetation distributions can be expected to make green corridors for landscape management, wind paths against heat island phenomena. In this paper, we develop a spatial analysis met hod of vegetation distributions using remotely sensed data on a regional scale. The method consists of a spatial autocorrelation analysis, an overlay analysis, and a hydrological analysis with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) adopted as the proxy of vegetation abundance. Application of the met hod leads to the extraction of the lines between the core areas and sparse areas of vegetation. The purpose of this study is to verify our method through applying a vegetation map digitized from aerial photographs. The map contained three vegetation types of land cover: grasslands, agricultural fields, and tree-covered areas. We use remotely sensed data collected at four different time periods at the regional scale, along with information on the seasonal fluctuations of the vegetation. As a result, the exclusion of seasonal land-cover changes, as in the reaping of agricultural fields, in the process of applying the proposed method produces an effect. The analysis reveals steady areas unaffected by the seasonal fluctuation of vegetation along the lines extracted by applying the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the factors that drive population dynamics is fundamental to species conservation and management. Since the golden-cheeked warbler Setophaga chrysoparia was first listed as endangered, much effort has taken place to monitor warbler abundance, occupancy, reproduction and survival. Yet, despite being directly related to local population dynamics, movement rates have not been estimated for the species. We used an integrated population model to investigate the relationship between immigration rate, fledging rate, survival probabilities and population growth rate for warblers in central Texas, USA. Furthermore, using a deterministic projection model, we examined the response required by vital rates to maintain a viable population across varying levels of immigration. Warbler abundance fluctuated with an overall positive trend across years. In the absence of immigration, the abundance would have decreased. However, the population could remain viable without immigration if both adult and juvenile survival increased by almost half or if juvenile survival more than doubled. We also investigated the response required by fledging rates across a range of immigration in order to maintain a viable population. Overall, we found that immigration was required to maintain warbler target populations, indicating that warbler conservation and management programs need to be implemented at larger spatial scales than current efforts to be effective. This study also demonstrates that by using limited data within integrated population models, biologists are able to monitor multiple key demographic parameters simultaneously to gauge the efficacy of strategies designed to maximize warbler viability in a changing landscape.

AB  - Many temperate butterfly species occur in habitats where human activities have altered the natural or long-term disturbance regime, and current activities modify the structure and availability of butterfly habitats over several spatial and temporal scales. Indeed, human activities modify key ecological processes sufficiently that the maintenance of some butterfly populations depends on human intervention to provide suitable habitat. Combined changes in historic and current disturbance regimes and human land-use practices necessitate active vegetation and habitat management to conserve and expand many butterfly populations. Efforts to protect temperate butterfly habitats often have resulted in successional changes that reduce habitat suitability. Butterfly habitats commonly deteriorate through a reduced intensity and frequency of long-term disturbance or management patterns that result in smaller and fragmented patches of early successional habitat. Fragmentation of otherwise continuous habitats can result in the forced dependence of a metapopulation structure. Because some butterfly larvae require one or a few host plants or adults are selective for nectar or oviposition sites, habitat management plans that include selection of an appropriate site for subsequent vegetation management activities may enhance conservation efforts. Vegetation management activities within an area can be coordinated to provide a mosaic landscape with habitats suitable for numerous species. Recommended vegetation management strategies vary with plant community type, historic disturbance regime, desired vegetation structure and composition, spatial pattern of habitat patches, land ownership patterns, and economic constraints. Because butterflies respond directly and indirectly to vegetation management and to the mosaic nature of habitat patches within the landscape, management plans must accommodate the constraints of the regional landscape and the spatial and temporal dynamics of the prescribed disturbance or management regime. We review efforts to manage temperate plant communities for butterfly habitat, and discuss general strategies for developing a vegetation management program for butterfly habitats in human-dominated landscapes. A case study of Karner blue butterfly habitat conservation efforts is provided. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The boreal forests of North America support billions of birds of over 300 species. The region remains mostly intact but is expected to undergo major changes over the next century due to anthropogenic climate change. This warming, and resulting changes in moisture regimes, are altering vegetation and disturbance dynamics, and will likely result in expansion of grasslands and deciduous forests, strongly challenging bird species to keep pace. We present a vulnerability-adaptation framework to guide bird conservation based on species' individual vulnerability and exposure to climate change. For sensitive species with declining populations, conservation should focus on management of current threats and species recovery in situ to improve adaptive capacity and facilitate future shifts in distribution. Sensitive species with high exposure to climate change may warrant more extensive intervention, such as habitat manipulation or even translocation. For species with lower sensitivity and stable populations, but high climate change exposure, long-term investments in protecting refugia and "stepping stones" will be most effective. In general, across all species, land-based approaches that "conserve nature's stage" by promoting geophysical diversity and habitat connectivity, maintaining natural disturbance dynamics, and facilitating broad shifts in bird distribution may prove most effective in maintaining species diversity. Implementation of this framework will require large-scale, interagency coordination on recovery plans, as well as adaptive forest management, designation of critical habitat, and land protection. Challenges include data gaps, uncertainty about future conditions, coordination of conservation actions during the nonbreeding periods, and the region's vast scale. However, given the region's continental importance, successful implementation of this framework could benefit birds throughout the western hemisphere.

AB  - The Ministere des Transports du Quebec maintains 2000 km of highway corridors scattered throughout southern Quebec (Canada). Traditional methods of controlling vegetation along these highways result in a boring landscape, deteriorate the various wildlife habitats and impoverish wild plant life while generating high maintenance costs. Recently, it has been preferred to develop new maintenance methods that improve the safety of the highway system's users, satisfy neighboring residents, beautify the landscape and consider the plant life and wildlife present along the highways. The new approach eliminates systematic multiple annual mowing, except on the first two meters from the pavement, where maintenance will even be accentuated (four or five mowings per year) to ensure highway safety (visibility) and better control of ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), a noxious allergenic plant. Since 1998, three different highway sections have served as experimental sites for a three-year period to assess biodiversity benefits as well as road user's perceptions. These sites are located in three fragmented landscapes, one partially forested, another agricultural and the other suburban. The objective is to compare the experimental sites where the new approach is used with sections where the traditional way of management is maintained. The benefit on the plant and animal diversity, on the quality of the habitats of the new approach is evaluated herein after one year (1999). Preliminary results indicate that the plant diversity is minimal in the agriculturally intensive zone compared to the partially forested zone and the suburban zone. The roadside habitat near forests appears with the highest animal diversity (insects, small mammals, and birds) followed by suburban and agricultural sites. After this first year of monitoring, the results suggest, however, no differences have yet to appear in both animal and plant abundance and diversity between the new approach and the traditional way of managing roadside vegetation along highways in southern Quebec.

AB  - 1. Movement is a key process driving animal distributions within heterogeneous landscapes. Graph (network) theory is increasingly used to understand and predict landscape functional connectivity, as network properties can provide crucial information regarding the resilience of a system to landscape disturbances, e.g. removal of habitat patches. The temporal dimension of movement patterns, however, is not generally included in network analysis, which can lead to a discrepancy between observed space use and landscape connectivity. Reaction-advection-diffusion models, when coupled with network analysis, could provide a powerful mechanistic framework based upon spatio-temporal dimensions of animal movement, but this approach remains poorly developed for ecological studies.
   2. We developed a mechanistic space use model that considers both residency time in resource patches and movement amongst those patches within a spatial network. The framework involves two main steps: first, the network topology that best reflects functional connectivity for the study system is identified; second, a spatio-temporal flow dynamic is implemented within the network using reaction-advection-diffusion modelling. To illustrate the approach, we used observations of radiocollared plains bison Bison bison bison that were travelling in a meadow network within a forest matrix.
   3. In the model application, we found that the graph best reflecting the functional connectivity of bison was a complex graph of ultra-small world scale-free network type. The reaction-advection-diffusion model involved the effect of meadow area and inter-meadow distance on bison travels. Simulations showed that a simple graph or distance-based graphs provided less accurate predictions of bison distribution, while also predicting different management actions to effectively impact bison space use.
   4. Our study demonstrates how reaction-advection-diffusion modelling, coupled with network theory, can provide a robust mechanistic framework for predicting animal distribution in dynamic environments. The modelling approach can be applied to a large range of systems that are subjected to rapid environmental changes due to habitat management or natural resource extraction, for example. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that management and conservation planning can strongly depend upon network structure, and that a faulty assessment of network topology can result in poor planning, with potential unexpected impacts on animal distributions.

AB  - Context Research has shown many negative effects of roads and traffic on wildlife and other biodiversity. The direct and indirect mechanisms through which roads and traffic harm animal populations vary across taxa, making mitigation of road effects a great challenge for conservation. As such, a large toolkit of species-specific management techniques may be needed to mitigate the negative effects of roads for wildlife and other biodiversity. The dunes sagebrush lizard, Sceloporus arenicolus, is a psammophilic (sand-loving) habitat specialist endemic to the Mescalero-Monahans Sandhills ecosystem of New Mexico and Texas. Within this ecosystem, roads fragment shinnery oak sand-dune landforms occupied by the species.
   Aims In the present study, we conducted behaviour trials in experimental enclosures to test whether the smallest roads restrict movements of the dunes sagebrush lizard. In addition, we also conducted trials to evaluate whether a sand-filled wildlife-crossing feature could facilitate road crossing.
   Methods We conducted behavioural trials on 24 dunes sagebrush lizards in our control enclosure and 22 lizards in our road and sand-filled wildlife-crossing enclosure. Movements were recorded for 15min. The final locations at the end of each trial were analysed using circular statistics to determine whether movements in the road or the sand-filled wildlife-crossing enclosures were different from the control.
   Key results Our results supported the hypotheses that dunes sagebrush lizards avoid roads and do so according to a surface-avoidance mechanism. We also found that the wildlife crossing-feature design tested here had no effect on the movements or road-crossing frequency of dunes sagebrush lizard.
   Conclusions Surface-avoidance behaviour indicated that roads will persistently affect the movements of dunes sagebrush lizard, even when traffic is not present. Also, more research into an effective wildlife crossing is needed to increase connectivity of fragmented populations.
   Implications These findings help evaluate the impact of roads in creating isolated populations that experience increased demographic stochasticity and, in some instances, localised extirpation in this species. Our study can guide conservation plans for the dunes sagebrush lizard, and contribute to our understanding of road effects on biodiversity in general.

AB  - The tidal flat in the transitional belt between land and ocean is deeply disturbed by human reclamation activity. The reclamation and development of tidal flat is the specific land use pattern of coastal zone. Jiangsu province possesses abundant tideland resources and a large-scale tidal flat reclamation has taken place in Jiangsu during the past several decades. Analysis of the landscape pattern of reclamation is one of the important components to realize the sustainable development in the coastal zone. This paper takes Yancheng City of Jiangsu as a case to analysis the landscape pattern of reclamation area by using GF-1 satellite imagery. The panchromatic and multispectral data were resampled for geometric correction and fused to obtain the multispectral data of 2m resolution. Object-based classification method was taken to classify different landscape categories in study area. Wheat paddies, rape paddies, forest and grass, rive and lake, aquaculture ponds, facility aquaculture, facility planting, industrial land and traffic land were extracted separately from the GF-1 imagery through multi-resolution segmentation, training samples selection, classification features establishment. Landscape indices of area, shape and distribution characteristics were calculated by using Fragstats software for analyses. The results show that within the study area, high resolution GF-1 satellite imagery could identify landscape types in tidal flat reclamation area and offer reliable information for the landscape pattern analysis. The cultivated land (including wheat paddies, rape paddies) and aquaculture area (including facility aquaculture and aquaculture ponds) are the main landscape types in the study area and the shape of most of the landscape type is very regular, which reflected the characteristics of intensification. As the corridors of the study area, traffic land, river and lake played a better connecting function and the overall connectivity of the landscape is relatively high. The distribution of landscape types is uneven, but the overall concentration trend is obvious.

AB  - PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Tropical plant communities in fragmented forests are likely to experience an extinction debt, i.e., the habitat cannot support as many species as are present due to reduced habitat size and connectivity. There are few estimates of the number of species that represent extinction debt, and the number of extinctions over time has rarely been recorded. We recorded population sizes to assess threats and extinctions in gingers (sensu Zingiberales) in fragmented rainforest in Singapore, ca. 200 yr after fragmentation began.
   METHODS: We surveyed extant diversity and population sizes of gingers and used the results to estimate species survival. We critically assessed historic specimens to estimate initial extinctions and extinctions realized in present habitats.
   KEY RESULTS: We recorded 23 species, including five species previously presumed nationally extinct and four species omitted from the national checklist. The revised extinction rate is much lower than previously reported (12 vs. 37%). Most gingers have very small populations or miniscule ranges, implying that extinction debt has not been paid off.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ginger diversity remains high, but the number of species at immediate risk of extinction outnumber recorded extinctions. Although tropical forest fragments remain arks of plant diversity for a long time, extinction debt may be prevalent in all plant groups in Singapore. Slow relaxation of extinction debt should be explicitly identified as a conservation challenge and opportunity. For conserving plant diversity in tropical fragments, relaxation must be reversed through restoration of degraded landscapes and, where feasible, targeted ex situ conservation and planting.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The expansion of urban areas in combination with climate change places great pressure on species found in freshwater habitats. Dragonflies are iconic freshwater organisms due to their large body sizes and striking coloration. They have been widely used to indicate the impacts of natural and human-mediated activities on freshwater communities, while also indicating the mitigation measures required to ensure their conservation. Here, we review the major threats to dragonflies in southern Africa, specifically those in urban areas. We also provide information on effective mitigation measures to protect dragonflies and other aquatic insects in urban spaces. Using three densely populated areas as case studies, we highlight some of the greatest challenges for dragonflies in South Africa. More importantly, we give a summary of current mitigation measures which have maintained dragonflies in urban spaces. In addition to these mitigation measures, public involvement and raising awareness contribute greatly to the common cause of protecting dragonflies around us.
   Urban settlements range from small villages in rural areas to large metropoles with densely packed infrastructures. Urbanization presents many challenges to the maintenance of freshwater quality and conservation of freshwater biota, especially in Africa. There are many opportunities as well, particularly by fostering contributions from citizen scientists. We review the relationships between dragonflies and urbanization in southern Africa. Shifts in dragonfly assemblages indicate environmental change, as different species are variously sensitive to abiotic and biotic water and bank conditions. They are also conservation umbrellas for many other co-occurring species. Major threats to southern African dragonflies include increasing infrastructure densification, frequent droughts, habitat loss, pollution, and invasive alien vegetation. Mitigation measures include implementation of conservation corridors, maintenance of healthy permanent ponds, pollution reduction, and removal of invasive alien trees. Citizen science is now an important approach for supplementing and supporting professional scientific research.

AB  - Socioecological theory, developed through the study of urban environments, has recently led to a proliferation of research focusing on comparative analyses of cities. This research emphasis has been concentrated in the more developed countries of the Northern Hemisphere (often referred to as the "Global North"), yet urbanization is now occurring mostly in the developing world, with the fastest rates of growth in sub-Saharan Africa. Countries like South Africa are experiencing a variety of land-cover changes that may challenge current assumptions about the differences between urban and rural environments and about the connectivity of these dynamic socioecological systems. Furthermore, questions concerning ecosystem services, landscape preferences, and conservation - when analyzed through rural livelihood frameworks - may provide insights into the social and ecological resilience of human settlements. Increasing research on urban development processes occurring in Africa, and on patterns of kinship and migration in the less developed countries of the "Global South", will advance a more comprehensive worldview of how future urbanization will influence the progress of sustainable societies.

AB  - Road-induced habitat fragmentation is one of the greatest threats to large carnivores. Wildlife passes have been used to reduce fragmentation by mitigating the effects of roads as barriers to animal movement. However, direct observations of animals crossing roads are extremely rare and thus indirect methods are necessary to locate crossings. Yet, current methods fail to incorporate the animals' movement behavior and thus have little predictive power. Based on the principles of resource selection functions and state-space modeling, we developed a Bayesian movement model applied to radio-telemetry and GPS data to infer the movement behavior of jaguars Panthera onca as a response to vegetation, roads and human population density in the Mayan Forests of Mexico and Guatemala. We used the results of the model to simulate jaguars moving along a road that bisects the major reserve system in the area. The aim of the simulations was to identify suitable locations for wildlife passes. We found that jaguars move preferentially to undisturbed forests and that females avoid moving close to roads and to areas with even low levels of human occupation. Males also avoid roads, but to a lesser degree, and appear undisturbed by human population density. Simulations reflected these differences: potential crossing sites for females are limited to a strip of a few kilometers, whereas males are able to cross at many different sites. Still, we identified a 1 km strip along the road where the likelihood of crossing for both sexes is highest, ideal for the construction of a wildlife pass. Our study contributes to the ecology of one of the world's least-studied large carnivores and provides a modeling framework that greatly improves the location of wildlife passes. Moreover, our approach can greatly advance region-wide conservation plans for the location of corridors and conservation units.

AB  - High-volume hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") for natural gas in the Marcellus Shale (underlying about 24 mil ha in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio, and Virginia) has become a politically charged issue, primarily because of concerns about drinking water safety and human health. This paper examines fracking in the Marcellus region, and the tradeoffs between the energy and economic potential of natural gas extraction and the environmental impacts on wildlife. Therefore, we introduce a new E3 analysis that combines the costs and benefits as regards energy, economics, and the environment. The Marcellus Shale has the most proven reserves of natural gas of any basin in the United States, at 129 trillion cubic feet. Income from natural gas development comes primarily from direct and indirect jobs, and induced jobs (those created when direct workers spend their earnings in a community), taxes and fees, and royalty and lease payments to rights holders. Fracking, however, has detrimental effects on wildlife and wildlife habitats. Terrestrial habitat effects are primarily due to landscape fragmentation from the clearing of land for pipeline and well pad development, which often removes mature forest and creates open corridors and edge habitats. An increase in forest edge and open corridors is associated with shifts in the bird community, as generalist species that do well around people increase in abundance, while forest specialists decline. Invasive plants associated with disturbance further degrade forest habitats. Aquatic habitats are also affected, both directly and indirectly. Hydraulic fracturing requires up to 20 mil L of water per well fracture, most of which comes from surface water sources in the Marcellus region. The removal of water, especially in smaller headwaters, can increase sedimentation, alter water temperature and change its chemistry, resulting in reductions in aquatic biodiversity. Given the reality that hydraulic fracturing will continue, there is a need to develop practices that best minimize negative impacts on terrestrial and aquatic habitats, as well as policies and the resolve to enforce these practices. To achieve a more sustainable balance between economic, energy, and environmental costs and benefits, we recommend that industry, scientists, non-governmental organizations, mineral rights holders, landowners, and regulators work together to develop a set of best management practices that represent the best knowledge available.

AB  - Pond networks support high levels of biodiversity when compared to other freshwater ecosystems such as rivers, lakes and streams. The persistence of species in these small, sometimes ephemeral, aquatic habitats depends on the dispersal of individuals among ponds in the landscape. However, the number of ponds across the landscape is at a historical low as urbanisation and intensified agricultural practices have led to a substantial loss of ponds (nodes in the pond network) over more than a century. Here, we examine the extent and drivers of pond loss in a heavily urbanised landscape (Birmingham, UK) over 105 years and determine how pond loss influences key structural properties of the pond network using graph theoretic approaches. Specifically, we calculated minimum spanning trees (MST) and performed percolation analyses to determine changes in both the spatial configuration and resilience of the pond network through time. Pond numbers declined by 82% between ca1904 and 2009, such that pond density decreased from 7.1 km(-2) to 1.3 km(-2). The MST analyses revealed increased distance between ponds in the network (i.e. edge length increased) by up to 49% over the 105-year period, indicating that ponds in the modern landscape (2009) were considerably more isolated, with fewer neighbours. This study demonstrates that graph theory has an excellent potential to inform the management of pond networks in order to support ecological communities that are less vulnerable to environmental change.

AB  - Predicting the geographic spread of wildlife epidemics requires knowledge about the movement patterns of disease hosts or vectors. The field of landscape genetics provides valuable approaches to study dispersal indirectly, which in turn may be used to understand patterns of disease spread. Here, we applied landscape genetic analyses and spatially explicit models to identify the potential path of raccoon rabies spread in a mesocarnivore community. We used relatedness estimates derived from microsatellite genotypes of raccoons and striped skunks to investigate their dispersal patterns in a heterogeneous landscape composed predominantly of agricultural, forested and residential areas. Samples were collected in an area covering 22000km2 in southern Quebec, where the raccoon rabies variant (RRV) was first detected in 2006. Multiple regressions on distance matrices revealed that genetic distance among male raccoons was strictly a function of geographic distance, while dispersal in female raccoons was significantly reduced by the presence of agricultural fields. In skunks, our results suggested that dispersal is increased in edge habitats between fields and forest fragments in both males and females. Resistance modelling allowed us to identify likely dispersal corridors used by these two rabies hosts, which may prove especially helpful for surveillance and control (e.g. oral vaccination) activities.

AB  - Human activity and land use change impact every landscape on Earth, driving declines in many animal species while benefiting others. Species ecological and life history traits may predict success in human-dominated landscapes such that only species with "winning" combinations of traits will persist in disturbed environments. However, this link between species traits and successful coexistence with humans remains obscured by the complexity of anthropogenic disturbances and variability among study systems. We compiled detection data for 24 mammal species from 61 populations across North America to quantify the effects of (1) the direct presence of people and (2) the human footprint (landscape modification) on mammal occurrence and activity levels. Thirty-three percent of mammal species exhibited a net negative response (i.e., reduced occurrence or activity) to increasing human presence and/or footprint across populations, whereas 58% of species were positively associated with increasing disturbance. However, apparent benefits of human presence and footprint tended to decrease or disappear at higher disturbance levels, indicative of thresholds in mammal species' capacity to tolerate disturbance or exploit human-dominated landscapes. Species ecological and life history traits were strong predictors of their responses to human footprint, with increasing footprint favoring smaller, less carnivorous, faster-reproducing species. The positive and negative effects of human presence were distributed more randomly with respect to species trait values, with apparent winners and losers across a range of body sizes and dietary guilds. Differential responses by some species to human presence and human footprint highlight the importance of considering these two forms of human disturbance separately when estimating anthropogenic impacts on wildlife. Our approach provides insights into the complex mechanisms through which human activities shape mammal communities globally, revealing the drivers of the loss of larger predators in human-modified landscapes.

AB  - We have attempted to describe the genetic structure and variability of the striped field mouse population inhabiting 17 locations in and around Warsaw, Poland, within a gradient of anthropopressure and discuss the possible factors that could potentially form the observed pattern. Ecological characteristics of the striped field mouse prevent decreases in genetic variability within local urban populations. High population density, ability to cross environmental barriers and to use "green corridors" allows this species to maintain gene flow in fragmented urban landscape. However, genetic variability and gene flow were efficiently reduced in the central part of the city. The results indicated that the degree of human pressure, defined based on the level of vegetation cover, is a good indicator of isolation. In the studied striped field mouse population, genetic interactions among particular locations (local populations) are modified in comparison with populations inhabiting natural areas, by replacement of the isolation-by-distance pattern of differentiation with the "isolation-by-infrastructure" pattern. As indicated by Bayesian analysis, the urban population from the right side of the Vistula river form common genetic cluster with ex-urban population located northward from the city, while the population from the left side of the river probably exchanges genes with neighbouring northern and southern ex-urban populations. However local populations at locations within the highest zone of anthropopressure are clearly isolated, and presently constitute separate genetic units.

AB  - The key biodiversity areas (KBA) approach aims to identify globally important areas for species conservation. Although a similar methodology has been used successfully to identify Important Bird Areas, we have identified five limitations that may apply when considering other taxa: The KBA approach is overly prescriptive in identifying important conservation features, is inflexible when dealing with landscape connectivity, creates errors by applying global criteria without input from local experts, relies on post hoc consideration of implementation opportunities and constraints, and fails to automatically involve implementation agencies in the assessment process. We suggest three modifications to the present approach: (1) Provide training in regional conservation planning for local stakeholders, (2) expand the Alliance for Zero Extinction program to include a broader range of threatened species, and (3) allow local stakeholders to nominate KBAs on the basis of their own regional conservation assessments. These modifications would build on the expertise of those promoting the KBA approach and help maintain the diversity of methods that are needed to conserve biodiversity effectively.

AB  - A ubiquitous feature of active (REM) sleep in mammals and birds is its relative abundance in early development. In rat pups across the first two postnatal weeks, active sleep promotes the expression of synchronized oscillatory activity within and between cortical and subcortical sensorimotor structures. Sensory feedback from self-generated myoclonic twitches-which are produced exclusively during active sleep-also triggers neural oscillations in those structures. We have proposed that one of the functions of active sleep in early infancy is to provide a context for synchronizing developing structures. Specifically, neural oscillations contribute to a variety of neurodevelopmental processes, including synapse formation, neuronal differentiation and migration, apoptosis, and the refinement of topographic maps. In addition, synchronized oscillations promote functional connectivity between distant brain areas. Consequently, any condition or manipulation that restricts active sleep can, in turn, deprive the infant animal of substantial sensory experience, resulting in atypical developmental trajectories.

AB  - Context As urban landscapes proliferate globally, the need for research into urban wildlife interactions is magnified. The eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus) is a widespread species commonly involved in wildlife-vehicle collisions in urban areas in Australia. Despite the many urban kangaroo populations and associated conflicts with human activities, few studies have examined how eastern grey kangaroos interact with, and are affected by, the urban matrix.
   Aims The present study aimed to quantify kangaroo demography, movements, habitat utilisation and exposure to risks during a period of intensive urban development in a rapidly changing suburb located in a region undergoing high urban growth rates.
   Methods We utilised foot-based census surveys, global positioning system (GPS) collars, direct observations and reports of wildlife mortality between 2014 and 2016. Geographical information systems (GIS) were used to integrate GPS-tracking data with spatial layers, to quantify kangaroo movements and habitat utilisation.
   Key results The kangaroo population underwent a steep decline and kangaroo-vehicle collisions were the main source of mortality (73%) during the study period. Kangaroos were regularly exposed to the risk of injury, with roads intersecting many parts of their home range. Kangaroos showed positive habitat selection both for lawn and forest habitats and kangaroo movement and presence at the study site were influenced by high-quality forage and cover.
   Conclusions The present research has highlighted that despite areas of suitable habitat remaining, road-kill was a major contributor to localised kangaroo-population decline. We showed that habitat preferences of eastern grey kangaroos in this urban area were consistent with those in natural landscapes.
   Implications The present study is the first to implicate kangaroo-vehicle collisions as the major factor in population decline in kangaroos. These findings can be utilised to guide design and placement of kangaroo-vehicle collision mitigation and assist in planning of urban areas, particularly where kangaroo populations are in decline. Local extirpation of urban kangaroo populations would be greatly reduced by incorporating site-specific kangaroo habitat preferences and existing patterns of kangaroo habitat use in infrastructure planning. The study has contributed to our understanding of the effects of roads on urban wildlife in general and highlighted the importance of landscape permeability.

AB  - The study focused on the attractiveness of mulches (consisting of the addition of a layer material to the soil surface) and their efficiency to promote recolonization by pedofauna of isolated and degraded areas. The experimental study was set up in the former coal mining area of Northern France. This area is particularly disturbed and fragmented by land-use change, urbanization, industry, intensive agriculture and metal pollution. To examine the movements of pedofauna, four kinds of mulches were applied: (i) Ramial Chipped Wood (RCW), (ii) chopped Miscanthus, (iii) dead leaves and (iv) wheat straw as well as plastic sheeting, a material often used in green spaces. A negative control consisted in soil without mulch addition. The experimental set-up consisted of a set of 18 bands of mulch (6 m long x 0.5 m width x 8 cm thick, i.e. a volume of 0.04 m(3) per band) installed on three adjacent plots on a surface area which stretch on 4400 m(2): (i) plot F1, a mixed plantation, (ii) plot M consisted of three rows of maples (both considered to be the reservoir of biodiversity) and (iii) plot BF, an ash plantation (with lower biodiversity). Faunistic communities of soil present within the mulches were monitoring using pitfall traps for four months (April to July), at a rate of eight surveys for each of the 90 traps installed, i.e. 720 samples. Different life traits and indices of diversity were studied, more specifically on carabid beetles. The main objective of the study was first to check whether mulches could or not reconnect different planted plots in a peri-urban landscape highly modified by human activities. The second aim was to find which type of mulch had the best efficiency in the recovery of the connectivity between plots. The last questions were which type of zoological groups could be favoured by the use of mulches and which benefits for ecosystem functioning. The main hypotheses of this study were: (i) Organic mulches would act as dispersal corridors and refuge zones to the soil organisms; (ii) organic mulches would be attractive to many organisms with various ecological needs.
   This study highlighted the potential benefits of using the mulching technique to support ecological connectivity in disturbed environment since this method highlighted the presence of individuals with different diets (saprophagous, predators, phytophagous and so forth), small and large size species which do not have the same dispersal capacities as well as species that are more dependent on forest environments and others that depend on Ymore open environments. The study concluded that organic mulches are more favourable to pedofauna than soil without mulch or plastic sheeting. With regard to organic mulches, no difference was noted, either in terms of cumulative abundance or monthly monitoring. However, for carabids, it should be noted that dead leaves and wheat straw have higher specific richness than Miscanthus and RCW.

AB  - Cities and towns can be conceptualized as invasion hotspots. The connections created by roads or highways facilitate the mobility of these species, expanding their range of distribution and contributing to their expansion through the landscape to other urban areas or nearby natural and semi-natural ecosystems. Here we describe the actual distribution of invasive plants in a region of Colombia and determine the role that urban centers, road edges, and rivers have in shaping their distribution. We mapped-at high resolution-the distribution of exotic species in the Alto Ricaurte region (Boyaca, Colombia), specifically in the towns of Villa de Leyva, Sachica, Sutamarchan, and Arcabuco and connecting roads. Initially, a list of 40 exotic plant species with invasive potential was assembled: 26 of which were mapped in the region. Then, we used Poisson models to test whether invasive species appear more frequently near cities, roads, and riverbanks. We found that roadside and riverbank areas host more exotic species than more distant zones. Our findings suggest that roads and rivers are efficient dispersal corridors connecting different invasive hotspots with other landscape elements. Urban centers act as islands of invasion and roads and rivers as corridors for species dispersal. This invasion scenario is already causing economic and ecological damage: roads are heavily deteriorated byR. communis, K. densiflora, and C. jubata, while P. aquilinum and M. minutiflora may increase the occurrence of fires in the region.

AB  - Conservation fences have been used as a tool to stop threatening processes from acting against endangered wildlife, yet little is known of the impacts of fences on non-target native species. In this study, we intensively monitored a pest-exclusion fence for 16 months to assess impacts on a reptile community in south-eastern Australia. We registered 1052 reptile records of six species along the fence. Encounters and mortality were greatest for eastern long-necked turtles (Chelodina longicollis), whereas impacts on lizards (Tiliqua rugosa, Tiliqua scincoides, Pogona barbata, Egernia cunninghami) and snakes (Pseudonaja textilis) were more moderate. We recorded several Chelodina longicollis recaptures at the fence and many of these were later found dead at the fence, indicating persistent attempts to navigate past the fence. We conservatively estimate that the fence resulted in the death of 3.3% and disrupted movements of 20.9% of the turtle population within the enclosure. Movement disruption and high mortality were also observed for turtles attempting to enter the nature reserve, effectively isolating the reserve population from others in the wider landscape. Of 98 turtle mortalities, the most common cause of death was overheating, followed by predation, vehicular collision, and entanglement. Turtle interactions were clustered in areas with more wetlands and less urban development, and temporally correlated with high rainfall and solar radiation, and low temperature. Thus, managers could focus at times and locations to mitigate impacts on turtles. We believe the impact of fences on non-target species is a widespread and unrecognized threat, and suggest that future and on-going conservation fencing projects consider risks to non-target native species, and where possible, apply mitigation strategies that maintain natural movement corridors and minimize mortality risk.

AB  - The primary objective of this study was to compare urban and peri-urban mammal assemblages and relate variation in these communities to local differences in vegetation. We surveyed 15 locations in both urban and peri-urban habitats (n = 30). Boundaries of our survey areas coincided with those of National Park Service (NPS) areas in central Virginia. Over a 14-month period, we used five trap-types to document species in three guilds. A total of 9 and 15 species were documented at urban and peri-urban locations, respectively. Top predators Canis latrans (Coyote) and Felis rufus (Bobcat) were undetected at urban sites, while mesopredators were consistently more abundant. The absence of four small prey species and reduced abundances of the most common native generalist, Peromyscus leucopus (White-footed Mouse), were also associated with urban locations. Multivariate analyses of relative abundance data indicated significantly dissimilar mammal communities in urban and peri-urban locations. Shrub cover was highest in peri-urban locations, while grass cover was highest in urban sitesa pattern that was only marginally significant due to greater variability among these sites. The exotic grass Microstegium vimineum (Japanese Stiltgrass) was present at several urban sites and contributed to the complex relationship between percent grass cover and the small-mammal assemblages that we surveyed. Our results suggest that disturbances that reduce the recruitment of shrubs and other native plants and promote the spread of invasive grasses may have severe consequences for small-mammal communities. In addition, culturally preserved areas within both survey sites (i.e., battlefields planted with fescue grasses) were inhospitable to most small-mammal species and wildlife in general. In many NPS areas, there is great opportunity for development of adaptive management strategies that integrate ongoing NPS efforts to control invasive plant species with the enhancement of wildlife habitat in both culturally and naturally preserved areas. There is an urgent need for the conservation of native habitat in NPS areas and non-park sites threatened by urbanization. The primary focus of these efforts should include the control of exotic species and mesopredators, facilitation of native shrub recruitment, and, in many of these areas, the ecological restoration of historic sites. NPS lands in urbanized areas offer unique conditions for wildlife management and abundant opportunities for conserving native communities.

AB  - Mammals figure prominently in tropical ecology because of their role in seed dispersal, herbivore control, and nutrient cycling. Urbanization is a conservation concern for mammals not only because of lost habitat, but also other negative impacts such as illegal hunting and pollution. Some mammals are resilient to urbanization and can persist in degraded habitats; however, this has not been studied in many tropical sites. We used camera traps to study mammals in Peperpot Nature Park (PNP), a secondary forest located 5 km from the capital of Suriname, and compared it to the large Central Suriname Nature Reserve (CSNR). We found fewer species in PNP (20) compared to CSNR (30), however, PNP included apex predators and species of conservation concern, and the two sites had a similar relative abundance of large cats and most mesocarnivores. Smaller mammal species had higher relative abundance at PNP while larger herbivores were scarce or absent, likely from poaching, as PNP is still connected to interior forests. The detection models revealed that the park, the camera trap was set in, was the most common significant factor for most species, suggesting that broader landscape level effects are important. In occupancy models, the null model was the most common top model across species, but then followed by park. Despite fewer species being detected than in large protected areas, the presence of some species in PNP which are historically absent in developed areas shows promise for small urban tropical forests to support robust mammal communities, provided they maintain some connectivity to larger source habitats.

AB  - Taxonomic resolution is a critical component of biodiversity assessments. In this case study, we examined a single taxon within a larger study of nematode diversity to evaluate the taxonomic resolution of different diversity assessment methods. The selected taxon was the microbial-feeding genus Plectus, a group considered to include multiple cosmopolitan species. The methods included a morphological evaluation by light microscopy, Sanger sequencing of PCR amplicons of COI and 18S gene regions, and 18S metabarcoding sequencing. The study sites were 15 remnant tallgrass prairie plots in eastern Nebraska. In the morphological analysis, we observed two basic morphotypes, a short-tailed form with a small amphid and a long-tailed form with a large amphid. Sanger sequencing of COI sorted Plectus diversity into six distinct clades. The largest two of these six clades keyed to P. parietinus and P. rhizophilus based on morphology. BLAST analysis with COI revealed no close matches in GenBank. Sanger sequencing of the 18S region did not differentiate the six clades. These results illustrate that the method of diversity assessment strongly influences estimates of biodiversity. An additional 95 Plectus specimens, from outside the remnant sites, added taxonomic breadth to the COI phylogenetic tree. There were no geographically widespread COI haplotypes and no evidence of cosmopolitan Plectus species.

AB  - The wildland-urban interface lies at the confluence of human-dominated and wild landscapes, creating a number of management and conservation challenges. Because wildlife ecology, behavior, and evolution at this interface are shaped by both natural and human phenomena, this requires greater understanding of how diverse factors affect ecosystem and population processes. We illustrate the challenge of understanding and managing a frequent and often undesired inhabitant of the wildland-urban landscape, the cougar (Puma concolor). In wildland and residential areas of western Washington State, USA, we captured and radiotracked 27 cougars to model space use and understand the role of landscape features in interactions (sightings, encounters, and depredations) between cougars and humans. Resource utilization functions (RUFs) identified cougar use of areas with features that were probably attractive to prey, influential on prey vulnerability, and associated with limited or no residential development. Early-successional forest (+), conifer forest (+), distance to road ( ), residential density ( ), and elevation ( ) were significant positive and negative predictors of use for the population, whereas use of other landscape features was highly variable. Space use and movement rates in wildland and residential areas were similar because cougars used wildland-like forest patches, reserves, and corridors in residential portions of their home range. The population RUF was a good predictor of confirmed cougar interactions, with 72% of confirmed reports occurring in the 50% of the landscape predicted to be medium-high and high cougar use areas. We believe that there is a threshold residential density at which the level of development modifies the habitat but maintains enough wildland characteristics to encourage moderate levels of cougar use and maximize the probability of interaction. Wildlife managers trying to reduce interactions between cougars and people should incorporate information on spatial ecology and landscape characteristics to identify areas with the highest overlap of human and cougar use to focus management, education, and landscape planning. Resource utilization functions provide a proactive tool to guide these activities for improved coexistence with wildlife using both wildland and residential portions of the landscape.

AB  - The riparian forest is one of the most diverse environments of the La Plata River plains. It is represented by patches of humid forests, which are a valuable source of ecosystem services and have recreational and educational potential. However, the riparian forest has undergone constant modification, worsened by private real-estate developments and a lack of government regulation. Among the reserves that protect the riparian forest, the Municipal Ecological Reserve of Avellaneda is the closest to the southern limit of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. Although there are around 300 species of wild fauna and flora informally registered in the area, there are only a few studies published about its biodiversity. In this work, the diversity of thirteen native and exotic ferns in the core area (Eco area) of the reserve is characterized, the origin of the species is also evaluated and comparisons are made with other nearby protected areas. The Eco area of the Reserve plays an important role as part of the urban reserve corridor of the La Plata River plains and constitutes a refuge for both native and exotic ruderal species. The present work represents the basis for future studies about the population dynamics and the colonization strategies of the ferns.

AB  - Roads threaten animal species through habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, and direct mortality. It is crucial to understand how species respond to linear infrastructure for effective conservation of animal communities in fragmented landscapes. We assessed relationships between amphibian abundance and roads/ railways and habitat fragmentation. We examined whether the combined effects of habitat loss and roads or railways (accessible habitat) was a better predictor of amphibian abundance than (1) the total amount of habitat surrounding ponds, (2) distance to a highway or railway, or (3) surrounding road cover. Aquatic surveys for amphibian larvae were conducted at 30 freshwater ponds over the breeding season in a mixed peri-urban/ agricultural landscape in Hungary. Landscape variables were quantified within a 1000-m radius surrounding ponds and habitat variables were measured at the local (pond) scale. The larvae of seven amphibian species were detected. There were strong relationships between the abundance of amphibian larvae and the distance to a highway and the proportion of road cover within 1000 m of ponds. Relationships with accessible habitat and total habitat amount were uncertain, while there were no clear relationships with a major railway. Larval abundance increased with pond size, but there were mixed relationships with the presence of fish. Our results suggest that road effects were having a stronger impact on amphibian abundance than the combined effects of roads and habitat amount in the study area. Highways appeared to be negatively impacting amphibian communities within a wide road-effect zone up to 1 km from ponds. However, our results were obtained from a single-season snap-shot study and multi-season surveys are likely required to reduce uncertainty in the model predictions. Our analysis suggests that road mitigation projects for amphibians should create large ponds in areas with no highways and low road density, and with connectivity to surrounding habitats.

AB  - Classical metapopulation theory (CMT) has proven an attractive paradigm for ecologists concerned with the conservation of aquatic-breeding amphibians, given its apparent fit with the population dynamics of these animals, and the opportunities the concept provides to assess alternate management options. Nevertheless, several authors have cautioned against uncritical application of this paradigm. We assessed the application of CMT to the conservation of the endangered growling grass frog (Litoria raniformis) in the urbanising landscapes of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Support for five predictions developed from the basic tenets of CMT was assessed using a multi-year occupancy and mark-recapture data-set. There was congruence between all five predictions and data. Wetland occupancy was strongly influenced by the proximity of neighbouring populations ('connectivity'), but the estimated rate of dispersal between wetlands was low. Wetland occupancy was also temporally dynamic, with only a weak effect of connectivity on the probability of extinction, but a strong positive influence of connectivity on the probability of colonisation. Our work confirms that CMT provides a useful model of the dynamics of L. raniformis in urbanising landscapes, and justifies the application of the paradigm to conservation planning for this species. We argue that CMT may prove relevant to numerous aquatic-breeding amphibians, and encourage assessment of the application of CMT to the conservation of these animals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The biodiversity hotspot of New Caledonia hosts high levels of endemism (74% of flora) that is threatened increasingly by climate change, habitat reduction, and invasive species. The fruit-eating red-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus cafer) is currently invading the main island of the archipelago, and its recent dispersal out of urbanized habitats raises questions about its potential to disperse noxious plant seeds along urban corridors and beyond. Indeed, the red-vented bulbul is considered a vector of several introduced plant species in its alien range including Miconia calvescens, Lantana camara, and Schinus terebinthifolius. We conducted a quantitative assessment of the bulbul's fruits consumption by analyzing the gut contents of shot birds. We estimated gut passage times for four species of fruit found in gut contents (S.terebinthifolius, Myrtastrum rufopunctatum, Passiflora suberosa, and Ficus prolixa) and tested the effects of bird digestion on seed germination rates for two species. Finally, we monitored the movements of individual VHF radio-tagged red-vented bulbuls. All of the consumed fruit species we identified here have red fleshy diaspore, including fruit of the shrub M.rufopunctatum that occurred frequently (9.6%) in bulbul gut samples. Median gut passage times were short (15-41min), corresponding to short-distance seed transportation (77-92m). The effect of gut passage was positive for the germination of the invasive S.terebinthifolius and negative for the endemic M.rufopunctatum, suggesting a potential bias in the contribution to the dispersal toward alien species. This study provides the first integrated assessment of mechanisms involved in the seed dispersal effectiveness of this high-concern invasive bird species that is expected to face similar plant communities in most of its alien range in tropical islands. More generally, our results enhance knowledge of synergies between non-native frugivores and plant species dispersal.

AB  - The interdigitation of the Nearartic and Neotropical biogeographic zones in the Transvolcanic Belt (TVB) of central Mexico provides the region with high faunal richness and endemicity. Biodiversity conservation in the TVB must accommodate the region's human population of more than 40 million. The current study presents conservation plans for the TVB intended to protect 99 non-volant mammal species while minimizing the impact on the human population. A rarity-complementarity algorithm was used to select a conservation area network (CAN) from sites with untransformed vegetation to represent 10% of each species' habitat. In addition, a new method was developed for augmenting the connectivity of CANS using graph theory. External sites were assigned quality scores based on the frequency with which they were selected at different targets of representation for species. Graph algorithms identified the highest-quality sites needed to link all conservation areas in an economical manner. These connectivity areas can facilitate migration or egress of biota in the event of local environmental stress. The network initialized with existing protected areas occupied 9.13% of the TVB, whereas the network built from scratch occupied 6.02%. In both cases, an additional area of only about 1.5% of the region was required to link all conservation areas in the network. Finally, a multiple criterion synchronization technique was used to select those connected networks which minimized both total area and human population impact. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Tree-dwelling mammals are potentially highly vulnerable to discontinuities in habitat created by roads. We used population modeling to assess the viability of a metapopulation of Australia's largest gliding marsupial, the greater glider (Petauroides volans), occurring in forest remnants in the fastest-urbanizing region of Australia, where habitat is dissected by major roads. Crossing structures for arboreal mammals (consisting of a land bridge with wooden poles for gliding and adjacent rope canopy bridges) have been installed over an arterial road that separates two of these remnants (one large, one small). It is currently unknown whether this species will use the crossing structures, but available tree height and spacing do not allow a glide crossing, and fences with metal flashing prevent access to the road by terrestrial and arboreal mammals. Our modeling reveals that even a relatively low rate of dispersal facilitated by these structures would substantially reduce the probability of extinction of the smaller subpopulation. This rate of dispersal is plausible given the small distance involved (about 55 m). The inclusion of wildfire as a catastrophe in our model suggests that these two remnants may encounter an undesirable level of extinction risk. This can be reduced to an acceptable level by including inter-patch movement via dispersal among other forest remnants. However, this requires connection to a very large remnant 8 km away, through a set of remnants that straddle two motorways. These motorways create discontinuities in forest cover that are beyond the gliding ability of this species. Crossing structures will be required to enable inter-patch movement. A priority for future research should be whether the greater glider will use road-crossing structures. Loss of habitat and habitat connections is continuing in this landscape and is likely to have dire consequences for wildlife if land managers are unable to retain appropriate habitat cover with corridors and install effective wildlife road-crossing structures where large roads intersect wildlife habitat.

AB  - The wetland ecosystem along a river in a coastal region has great significance in purifying water bodies, regulating climate, and providing habitat for animals and plants. Studying the effects of human disturbances on the landscape patterns of wetlands is of great significance to the protection and management of an ecosystem. This study used Guannan County and Guanyun County, two counties in China that are located on both banks of the Xinyi River as the study area. The spatiotemporal characteristics of the landscape pattern evolution of wetlands and their relationship with human interference from 2009 to 2020 were analyzed by the landscape dynamic rate, landscape conversion matrix, landscape indices, human disturbance index, and the quadratic regression equation. The results showed that: (1) Except for the increase in the area of beach and paddy fields, the area of other landscape types decreased; (2) the changes in wetlands were heterogeneous and showed different trends in different regions; (3) the boundary shape's complexity and the landscape pattern's fragmentation showed a decreasing-increasing trend and the connectivity and the diversity of the landscape decreased; and (4) the human disturbance index increased from 2009 to 2014 and then decreased from 2014 to 2020, declining outward from the places where towns and construction land aggregated. Moreover, there was an inverted U-type relationship with the landscape pattern indices. The findings provide direct, specific, and explicit information and theoretical guidance for the protection of wetlands along the river in the coastal region as well as for the restoration of wetland ecosystem function and the improvement of wetland biodiversity in relevant regions.

AB  - Together with other signatories of the Ramsar Convention, Australia is obliged to seek to halt wetland loss, which may include farm ponds/dams and other constructed wetlands. Since European arrival in Australia, extensive clearing of native ecosystems for agriculture and urbanisation has resulted in a concomitant loss of natural wetlands. However, there is limited information on changes in physical characteristics of wetlands with the transition to agriculture and urbanisation. In North-western Sydney, we investigated changes in wetland surface area, distance to nearest neighbour (connectivity), and shape complexity with transition from natural to agricultural and urban landscapes. There were significant differences amongst land use types for these three waterbody parameters. Wetlands in natural areas were larger and further apart from each other. Half the wetlands in agricultural and urban landscapes had small surface areas, but wetlands in agricultural areas were closer together, so connectivity for biota was potentially greater. Most wetlands in all land use classes were simple or irregular in shape, though urban areas had a higher proportion of irregular wetlands. We predict that on the current trajectory of increasing urbanisation, native biodiversity will continue to decline unless more emphasis is placed on the importance of wetlands - natural and constructed.

AB  - This study shows that an integrated ecological and cultural corridor network can help guide city development strategies to better preserve ecological and cultural assets. Traditionally, protection zones and suitable development areas are often identified by separately considering natural elements of the ecosystem and elements of cultural significance. To achieve the purpose of cohesively protecting areas of ecological and/or cultural significance, we have developed a corridor-based spatial framework by integrating ecological and cultural assets. Ecological sources are identified by combining protection prioritization, nature reserves, and water bodies. Ecological corridors are delineated by using the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model on a resistance surface constructed from land-use data to connect ecological sources. Ecologically important areas are then delineated by creating a 5-km buffer zone from ecological sources and ecological corridors. Cultural corridors are historical routes and rivers surrounded by abundant cultural nodes. Like ecologically important areas, culturally important areas are delineated by creating a 5-km buffer zone from cultural corridors. Comprehensive regions are the overlap of ecologically and culturally important areas. Finally, the integrated network connects all comprehensive regions following ecological corridors and cultural corridors in such a way that the largest number of ecological sources and cultural nodes are reached. We applied this framework in Beijing, China, and the results show that there are 2011 km(2) of ecological sources, 30 ecological corridors, 423 cultural nodes, seven cultural corridors, and 10 comprehensive regions covering 2916 km(2) in the integrated network. The framework adds new insights to the methodology of considering ecological and cultural assets together in developing protection and development strategies.

AB  - Incorporating connectivity into the design of marine protected areas (MPAs) has met with conceptual, theoretical, and practical challenges, which include: 1) the need to consider connectivity for multiple species with different dispersal abilities, and 2) the role played by variable habitat quality in determining the spatial patterns of connectivity. We propose an innovative approach, combining biophysical modeling with a routinely-used tool for marine-reserve design (Marxan), to address both challenges by using ecologically-informed connectivity parameters. We showed how functional demographic connectivity for four candidate reef-associated species with varying dispersal abilities and a suite of connectivity metrics weighted by habitat quality can be used to set conservation objectives and inform MPA placement. Overall, the strength of dispersal barriers varied across modeled species and, also across species, we found a lack of spatial concordance of reefs that were high-quality sources, self-persistent, and stepping-stones. Including spatially-heterogeneous habitat quality made a considerable difference to connectivity patterns, significantly reducing the potential reproductive output from many reefs. We also found that caution is needed in combining connectivity data from modeled species into multi-species matrices, which do not perform reliably as surrogates for all connectivity metrics of individual species. We then showed that restricting the habitat available for conservation has an inequitable impact on different connectivity objectives and species, with greatest impact on betweenness centrality and long-distance dispersers. We used Brazilian coral reefs as a case study but our approach is applicable to both marine and terrestrial conservation planning, and offers a holistic way to design functionally-connected reserves to tackle the complex issues relevant to planning for persistence.

AB  - The increasing use of the landscape by humans has led to important diminutions of natural surfaces. The remaining patches of wild habitat are small and isolated from each other among a matrix of inhospitable land-uses. This habitat fragmentation, by disabling population movements and stopping their spread to new habitats, is a major threat to the survival of numerous plant and animal species. We developed a general model, adaptable for specific species, capable of identifying suitable habitat patches within fragmented landscapes and investigating the capacity of populations to move between these patches. This approach combines GIS analysis of a landscape, with spatial dynamic modeling. Suitable habitat is identified using a threshold area to perimeter ratio. Potential movement pathways of species between habitat patches are modeled using a cellular automaton. Habitat connectivity is estimated by overlaying habitat patches with movement pathways. The maximum potential population is calculated within and between connected habitat patches and potential risk of inbreeding within meta-populations is considered. The model was tested on a sample map and applied to scenario maps of predicted land-use change in the Peoria Tri-county region (IL). It (1) showed area of natural area alone was insufficient to estimate the consequences on animal populations; (2) underscored the necessity to use approaches investigating the effect of land-use change spatially through the landscape and the importance of considering species-specific life history characteristics; and (3) highlighted the model's potential utility as an indicator of species likelihood to be affected negatively by land-use scenarios and therefore requiring detailed investigation.

AB  - Rapid changes in agricultural landscape structure and composition affect many different farmland biotas, including carnivores, which are a key element of ecosystem stability, yet little is known about their distribution and habitat use. In this study, we evaluated how habitat characteristics on two different spatial scales (local and landscape scale) affected the forest-edge utilization by small and medium-sized carnivores in fragmented central European farmland. Based on an indirect method for detecting carnivores (scent stations), we sampled 212 forest fragments of different sizes (1-7864 ha) during April to May from 2006 to 2009. Our results indicate that carnivore utilization of forest-edge habitats was driven by landscape rather than local characteristics even though the overall extent of explained variation was small. The most important factors that determined response of the carnivore community were the area of farmland and that of urban land on a landscape scale. The corridor connectivity between small forest fragments and other spatial elements played a crucial role in the occurrence of red fox. Our results suggest that comprehensive studies on multi-species carnivore assemblage using scent station might be useful in evaluating species-specific response to habitat characteristics, especially if large numbers of stations visited by carnivores are available.

AB  - Population viability analyses can assess species persistence under current or simulated future conditions and guide conservation and management efforts for species of concern. We evaluated population viability of an endangered songbird, the golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia), over a 50-year period using empirically derived population parameters collected from 2009 to 2015 on the Balcones Canyonlands Preserve (BCP), Travis County, Texas, USA. Assuming the extent and quality of habitat within the BCP does not change, the population remained stable with a population size of approximately 1,800 males, adult survival of 0.57, seasonal productivity of 1.32 male fledglings/territory, and assumed juvenile survival of 0.40. Population viability, however, was sensitive to changes in vital rates. The population declined toward local extinction when vital rates were at the low end of rates considered (0.47 adult survival, 1.14 male fledglings/territory, 0.28 juvenile survival), but had little to no probability of local extinction when vital rates were at the upper end (0.67 adult survival, 1.50 male fledglings/territory, 0.44 juvenile survival). Obtaining accurate estimates of juvenile survival remains problematic, but if juvenile survival is as low as previously reported elsewhere (0.28), the stability observed during the years of our study could be due to immigration of individuals displaced by habitat loss in the surrounding landscape. Increased carrying capacity, which served as a proxy for increased habitat quality within the BCP, was insufficient to sustain the population when productivity was low, illustrating the need for adequate seasonal productivity. Consistent with previous studies, our findings underscore the importance of managing for high-quality breeding habitat and maintaining connectivity with other large habitat patches to promote the long-term viability of the species. We suggest monitoring survival and productivity of high-concern species may be justified because assessment of status from abundance alone can be confounded by immigration and other factors.

AB  - Remnant habitat patches can provide ideal space for conservation of native flora in agricultural and urban landscapes. Graveyards are ideals for such conservation actions if they are managed scientifically. Present study analyzed current status of the tree diversity and related issues of the graveyards from Tehsil Mansehra for their utilization in native tree conservation. Random sampling was made through 35 vegetation stands covering 35 graveyards occupying 35 Union Councils. Total 56 species including 35 trees and 21 shrubs, belonging to 46 genera and 31 families were documented from study sites including 44 naturally growing and 12 planted species. Total 2645 mature trees and 2532 regenerating trees were counted and 14 tree species shows high rate of regeneration. Presence of noxious invasive tree Broussonetia papyrifera and Ailanthus altissima however stipulated the active management of such remnant habitats because of severe invasion threats. Involvement of the local communities can effectively result in utilization of the graveyards as steppingstones and functional corridors in rapidly intensifying urban areas and agricultural lands. Such approach can be applied to other areas for identification and utilization of remnant habitats in plant conservation.

AB  - Loss of green space habitats and landscape fragmentation are important reasons for the decline in environmental quality, degradation of ecosystem functions, and decline in biodiversity. Quantifying the spatio-temporal characteristics of landscape fragmentation of green space and its relationship with urban expansion mode is an important basis for improving urban development mode and enhancing urban ecological functions. For this paper, we took the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration as the research object, a typical rapidly urbanizing area. Through multi-scale landscape pattern analysis and statistical analysis, the spatial-temporal evolution characteristics of green space fragmentation in the BTH urban agglomeration from 2000 to 2020 and the influence of urban expansion were analyzed, and the land-use situation in 2030 was predicted by the Future Land Use Simulation (FLUS) model. The main conclusions are as follows: The BTH urban agglomeration has developed rapidly in the last 20 years, showing the characteristics of diffusion and corridor development. The intensity and pattern of urban expansion have significantly affected the pattern of green space, leading to the intensification of domestic green space fragmentation. Among them, urban expansion exerts most severe effects on the fragmentation of farmland, followed by grassland and water. The influence of urban expansion on the scale and fragmentation of forestland is limited. The forecast results in 2030 show that built-up areas may continue to occupy green space. The rate of occupation of farmland will slow down while that of grassland will intensify.

AB  - Inland pine barrens offer the rarest type of shrubland habitat in the northeastern United States and may contribute disproportionately to the regional diversity and conservation of shrubland birds. Testing local habitat specialization and estimating survey effort is needed to inform management of pine barrens for this rapidly declining avian group. We evaluated shrubland bird habitat associations in a heavily urbanized pine barrens of the northeastern United States, and used occupancy-detection sampling and analysis to estimate the number of sample points and surveys for point-based monitoring of shrubland birds in pine barrens. Although forest area was significantly greater than shrubland area, 8 of 11 reliably modeled species showed evidence of association for shrubland, and are thus potentially useful as indicators of pine barrens shrubland quality and management to avert succession. From the analysis of survey effort. we suggest two design options for point-based monitoring of shrubland birds in pine barrens: (1) include enough points to cover at least similar to 3% of the study area and survey each point >= 5 times preferably during 05:00-08:00 hr. or (2) reduce the point sample, to no less than about 2% of study area, and increase the survey replication to >= 10 surveys. Three surveys, as suggested by shrubland bird experts for anthropogenic early-successional habitats (e.g., utility corridors) and by others as a general rule, may require too many sample points to feasibly monitor shrubland birds in pine barrens.

AB  - Landscape composition and habitat quality influence the abundance, population structure, and movements of animals. Understanding how an animal interacts with elements of the landscape helps predict its response to habitat loss and changes in land cover. We tested the hypothesis that the extent of movement depends on landscape composition in a threatened freshwater turtle, Emydoidea blandingii. We measured habitat composition at multiple spatial scales, ranging from the home range to the landscape scale. We built multiple linear regression models to predict home range size from the proportional use of 5 land-use categories, while controlling for intrinsic factors (sex, body size). We found that landscape composition significantly influenced home range size in the Blanding's turtle; however, the models explained a low proportion of the observed variation in home range size, meaning that landscape composition had a weak effect on movement. Our results also suggest that sex and body size have little influence on home range size in Blanding's turtles. More research is needed to determine the factors driving movement in this species, and overall, we recommend cautious use of models predicting space use as a function of landscape composition in a conservation context.

AB  - Background and aims - Studies on the diversity of the seaweed flora of the Philippines have waned in the past decades, and detailed data on the distribution of these economically important resources is missing. We attempt to bridge this gap by providing information on the diversity, distribution, and some aspects of the ecology of the seaweed flora of a marine biodiversity corridor in the western Philippines, the Balabac Marine Biodiversity Conservation Corridor (BMBCC).
   Methods - In seventeen stations of the BMBCC, seaweed floras were assessed. All seaweeds encountered were identified in situ, down to species level, when possible. All unidentified specimens were collected and identified in the laboratory. Cluster analysis based on Jaccard index was used to infer similarities among the seaweed floristic components of each station. A comprehensive checklist was made using data from this study and other available literature.
   Key results - There were 176 seaweed species in the area (Chlorophyceae: 70 spp., Rhodophyceae: 75 spp., and Phaeophyceae: 31 spp.). Cluster analysis showed a separation between the seaweed flora of areas within the Sulu Sea and those of the West Philippine Sea. Similarities among the floristic components of these areas may be attributed to the resemblances in the prevailing ecological conditions (i.e. substrate, wave exposure, and water movement, among others).
   Conclusions - BMBCC harbours a relatively diverse seaweed flora, considering its small area. In addition, habitat characteristics, particularly the substrate type, appear to influence floristic compositions and similarities among the different surveyed areas. This report is the first to consolidate floristic information in a marine biodiversity conservation corridor in the country.

AB  - Speciation is the "elephant in the room" of community ecology. As the ultimate source of biodiversity, its integration in ecology's theoretical corpus is necessary to understand community assembly. Yet, speciation is often completely ignored or stripped of its spatial dimension. Recent approaches based on network theory have allowed ecologists to effectively model complex landscapes. In this study, we use this framework to model allopatric and parapatric speciation in networks of communities. We focus on the relationship between speciation, richness, and the spatial structure of communities. We find a strong opposition between speciation and local richness, with speciation being more common in isolated communities and local richness being higher in more connected communities. Unlike previous models, we also find a transition to a positive relationship between speciation and local richness when dispersal is low and the number of communities is small. We use several measures of centrality to characterize the effect of network structure on diversity. The degree, the simplest measure of centrality, is the best predictor of local richness and speciation, although it loses some of its predictive power as connectivity grows. Our framework shows how a simple neutral model can be combined with network theory to reveal complex relationships between speciation, richness, and the spatial organization of populations.

AB  - Coastal seascapes are composed of a diversity of habitats that are linked in space and time by the movement of organisms. The context and configuration of coastal ecosystems shapes many important properties of animal assemblages, but potential seascape effects of natural and artificial habitats on nearby habitats are typically considered in isolation. We test whether, and how, the seascape context of natural and urban habitats modified fish assemblages across estuaries. Fish were sampled with underwater videos in five habitat types (mangroves, rock bars, log snags, unvegetated sediments, armoured shorelines) in 17 estuaries in eastern Australia. Different habitats supported distinct fish assemblages, but the spatial context of mangroves and armoured shorelines had pervasive ecological effects that extended across entire estuaries. In most estuarine habitats, fish diversity and abundance was greatest when they were in close proximity of mangroves, and decreased due to the proximity of armoured shorelines. Many cities are centred on estuaries, and urban expansion is often associated with the fragmentation of mangrove forests. Our findings emphasize that these transformations of urban estuarine landscapes are likely to propagate to broader ecological impacts detectable in multiple habitats beyond mangrove forests.

AB  - With the interactions of river discharge and tide, the balances between water and saline in estuaries are helpful for maintaining biodiversity and landscape diversity. However, the delicate balances have been broken in many estuaries especially in some areas where prosperous cities have been developed. Saltwater intrusion causes serious adverse effects on estuary ecosystems in Pearl River estuary (PRE), China. This paper tries to use a wetland network which is a methodology to divert saltwater to explain how to address the adverse effects of saltwater intrusion and aims to mitigate such intrusion. The existing wetland patches and corridors are connected and form a wetland network with structural and functional connectivity. The patches in the wetland network are assigned to attributes that represent storage capacity of wetlands, and the corridors are assigned to attributes that represent water flow of channels. The results demonstrated that the saltwater intrusion length follows a linear relationship with tidal discharge in the southern part of Guangzhou (SPG, a part of PRE). When the upstream discharge changed slightly, saltwater intrusion cannot be effectively mitigated merely by diverting water from river channels to wetland network during spring tides. This paper provides new insight for management of saltwater intrusion in estuaries.

AB  - Successional dynamics in Mediterranean forests have been modulated by anthropogenic disturbances during thousands of years, especially in areas densely populated since ancient times. Our objective is to determine whether pine tree cover (early-successional species) and oak tree cover (late-successional species), used as a surrogate of successional stage of peri-urban fragmented forests in the Valles lowlands (Catalonia, NE, Spain), are primarily determined by (1) climate and topography; (2) anthropogenic disturbances; (3) patch structure; or (4) patch dynamics from 1956 to 1993. Quercus spp. and Pinus spp. tree cover were separately recorded on 252 randomly selected plots of 100 m(2), within forest patches ranging in size from 0.25 to 218 ha. Multiple linear regressions indicated that forest patch history is the most important variable determining oak and pine tree cover: new forest patches showed higher pine and lower oak tree cover than recently split patches (i.e. those that became fragmented from large forest areas after 1956). Patches already existing as such in 1956 (pre-existent patches) showed higher pine cover than recently split patches. Oak cover increased and pine cover decreased with increasing forest connectivity of the patch. Finally, highly frequented forests were related to high cover of pines. Climatic and topographic variables were not significant. We conclude that pine and oak cover in these peri-urban forests are mainly determined by recent patch dynamics, but also by the spatial pattern of patches. However, human-induced disturbance can modulate this as there is some evidence for pine being associated with a high human frequentation.

AB  - As urban habitats vary in composition and structure along the urban to rural gradient, different degrees of urbanization likely result in a diversity of landscape responses from wildlife. We investigated this relationship with the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), an urban adapted species that is both common and understudied in highly metropolitan landscapes. We investigated which landscape factors affect opossum occupancy, colonization, extinction, and detection by using a large system of motion-triggered camera traps in the Chicago metropolitan area over 10 seasons from spring 2010 to summer 2012. Opossum patch occupancy rates were highest near natural water sources regardless of urbanization, whereas occupancy rates in patches >= 1000 m from natural water sources decreased with increasing urbanization. Our results suggest opossums have relaxed habitat needs at intermediate levels of disturbance, as the ability to locate anthropogenic water sources may allow them to occupy previously uninhabitable patches.

AB  - Single trees and small patches of trees in farmland are conspicuous components of agricultural landscapes around the world, but their value for the conservation of biodiversity is not well known. In this study, arboreal mammals were censused by using hair-sampling tubes in small patches of woodland (single trees to patches < 1.0 ha) in cleared farmland adjacent to a linear network of woodland known to support resident populations of arboreal mammals. Ninety-one small isolates were stratified by size (single trees or small patches) and distance from the linear network to test the capacity of animals to cross habitat 'gaps'. The genus Petaurus (small gliding marsupials), the most commonly detected taxon, was recorded in 31% of hair-tubes (98 of 316). It occurred in 21% of sites in isolated trees and patches, and in all linear strips. A logistic regression model demonstrated that Petaurus sp. was most likely to occur in isolates in close proximity to linear strips and other patches of woodland. Ninety-five per cent of sites at which this taxon occurred were within 75 In of the linear network. This threshold corresponds with the maximum distance that animals can glide in a single movement between trees. The size of isolates did not influence utilisation rates. Such isolates are smaller than a single home range and were probably used to supplement home ranges centred on the linear network, by providing additional foraging habitat and den sites. Protection and restoration of isolated trees and small woodland clumps in cleared landscapes contributes to mammal conservation and this study provides quantitative data that can assist landscape design and habitat restoration in rural environments.

AB  - High severity rangeland wildfires have enormous negative impacts on human safety and infrastructure and may have long-term consequences on ecosystem structure, function, and services, across the vast rangelands in the western United States. We explored prefire vegetation structure of all high severity wildfires, as well as associated areas with low and moderate burn severity, in nonherbaceous-dominated rangelands in western United States from 1985 to 2018, based on fractional cover of annual forbs and grasses, perennial forbs and grasses, shrubs and trees from the Rangeland Analysis Platform. These wildfires were grouped into nine clusters using Expectation Maximization algorithms and patterns of prefire vegetation structure and the major vegetation types were assessed. High woody cover is a common characteristic of the prefire vegetation structure. Four of the clusters, which accounted for more than 70% of the areas of high severity wildfires, were characterized by high (similar to 50%) woody cover in prefire vegetation structure. The areas with high severity burns also had significantly higher woody cover than the areas with low or moderate severity burns in eight of the nine clusters. Some of these ecosystems can have abundant fine fuel, structural connectivity such as fuel laddering, and/or highly flammable materials, which can facilitate the ignition of the woody crowns, leading to high severity wildfires. Management strategies (such as prescribed burning) that can decrease woody cover and reduce standing dead vegetation and fuel laddering could be effective in reducing the risk and extent of high severity wildfires on rangelands in the western United States.

AB  - Knowledge of habitat use by animals within urban-riparian corridors during the breeding season is important for conservation, yet remains understudied. We examined the bird community along an urban-riparian corridor through metropolitan Boise, Idaho and predicted that occupancy of individual species and species richness would be greater in forested areas than in urbanized areas. We surveyed birds throughout the summers of 2009 and 2010 and quantified the m(2) of each cover-type within 50-m, 100-m, and 200-m buffers surrounding each survey location using satellite imagery. Occupancy modeling revealed that eight of 14 species analyzed were positively associated with riparian forest, and no species avoided forest. Species richness was negatively associated with the amount of paved surface within 100 m of a survey site with richness declining by more than two species for every hectare of paved surface. Most associations with cover-types - especially riparian forest-were at >= 100 m. Therefore, the riparian forest within 100 m of a given site along an urban-riparian corridor should be the most important for maintaining species richness. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation represents the single greatest conservation challenge of the 21st century. This problem is particularly acute for large, obligate carnivores like pumas Puma concolor which have persisted in North and South America in the face of habitat fragmentation and other anthropogenic disturbances. Shrinking habitat and reduced connectivity mean that mapping habitat is increasingly important for species conservation in multiple-use landscapes. Previous work suggests that pumas occupy habitats where sufficient stalking cover and preferred prey are present, yet the intersection of these factors has rarely been assessed. Here we used data from 68 299 camera trap nights collected from 181 sites throughout the San Francisco Bay Area over a four-year period to identify key predictors of habitat occupancy for pumas and their primary prey (mule deer Odocoileus hemionus). Our goal was to determine whether pumas occupy habitats based on relative measures of prey availability (detection frequency), or ease of predation (density of stalking cover) and whether these predictors changed between seasons. Our results indicated that pumas primarily occupied forested habitats and did not choose habitats with abundant deer. Instead, pumas preferentially occupy habitats that facilitate their stalk and ambush hunting strategy, rather than higher prey densities, per se. The best occupancy models for mule deer indicated the importance of roads and shrub cover. However, even the best deer models performed poorly compared to the puma models, likely due to the ubiquity of mule deer in the region. Although prey density is a widely accepted correlate of habitat quality for many carnivores, our results suggest that structural elements of habitat may be a more important variable in predicting habitat use by large stalk and ambush predators like pumas, which has important implications for conservation success.

AB  - Although it is generally accepted that wetlands in drylands are subject to higher fire frequencies than wetlands in humid regions, little is known about how wetlands in varied hydrogeomorphic settings mediate runoff and material fluxes in the post-fire catchment landscape. This paper evaluates the intermediary role of wetlands in water and sediment dispersal through a wet season that followed the March 2015 wildfire in the Silvermine River catchment, Cape Town. Field and laboratory analyses of the development and dynamics of soil water repellency were conducted across terrestrial hillslope, river riparian zone and hillslope seepage wetland sites. The latter two sites had significantly lower soil water repellency than the terrestrial site immediately preceding the first large rainfall event, and soil moisture emerged as a significant predictor of soil water repellency, consistent with previous research. Remote sensing analysis of post-fire vegetation recovery revealed that the first emergence of new vegetation occurred within wetlands and other moisture-rich areas across the catchment, likely associated with intact rhizome networks of the predominant sprouting vegetation in these areas. This post-fire green flush could have served to enhance post-fire infiltration due to macropore flow along rhizome networks, and to reduce early wet season runoff and erosion due to the rapid establishment of rainfall-intercepting leaf and stem structures. Longitudinal investigations of post-fire river channel and bed sediment characteristics detected a transition in bed composition from gravel to sand through hillslope-channel coupling and channel bank erosion, and effective conveyance of sand through the catchment to a constructed wetland at the catchment outlet. Suspended sediment sampling upstream, within and downstream of this wetland suggested a relative sediment trap efficiency of similar to 87 to 99%, supporting previous observations of post construction aggradation at the head of the wetland, with serious implications for long term wetland maintenance and management. Insights from field and remote sensing studies were used to develop a conceptual geospatial model of the role of wetlands in varied hydrogeomorphic settings in post-fire catchment sediment (dis)connectivity. Hillslope seepage wetlands located across the burned region of the catchment were shown to play an important role in hillslope surface sediment trapping and erosion control, contrary to common assumptions, and sediment connectivity modelling is recommended as a tool for further research aimed at understanding the intermediary role of wetlands in drylands in material fluxes in post-fire landscapes.

AB  - Urbanization tends to remove or isolate green areas into fragments or restrict them to narrow corridors inserted in a matrix of buildings. Nevertheless, urban green areas may act as refuges for fauna and bats are among the animals able to use such habitats. Using bioacoustics we investigated the influence of green areas on the activity of insectivorous bats in the metropolitan area of Recife, a conurbation of 4 million people in the Atlantic forest of Northeastern Brazil. Bat activity was statistically higher in green areas, based on calls (t = 2.5298, p = 0.0165), but not on feeding buzzes (t = 1.8132, p = 0.0817) or social calls (t = -1.5551, p = 0.1329). Several species were able to persist in an urban matrix and calls were classified into 16 sonotypes, belonging to five families (Emballonuridae, Molossidae, Noctilionidae, Phyllostomidae and Vespertilionidae). However, activity was significantly more associated with areas with vegetation, indicating that green remnants are hotspots for bat activity. Our results indicate that most insectivorous bats have a biased use of the urban landscape and the maintenance of urban green areas is essential to preserve them and the environmental services they provide.

AB  - Bumblebees are a key pollinator group globally which have declined over time. However, while some species remain common others are rare and have declined at a sharper rate. The Great Yellow Bumblebee (Bombus distinguendus Morawitz) is classified as 'Endangered' on the Irish Red List, and 'Vulnerable' at European level. We aimed to investigate the ecology of B. distinguendus within the wider bumblebee community in its only remaining Irish population to inform conservation management. Eight true bumblebee species were recorded in total in four habitat types surveyed, with highest species richness in species-rich grassland and highest abundance in urban habitats. Highest numbers of B. distinguendus were found in two designated nature reserves. However, outside these reserves the species was only found in three of twelve sites surveyed in both species-rich and coastal grassland habitats. B. distinguendus is a late emerging species in this region with a foraging preference for Common Knapweed (Centaurea nigra). Availability of key forage species was lowest when numbers of B. distinguendus were highest, potentially limiting survival of this species. Some smaller suitable habitats in urban areas and roadside verges were not used by the species, which suggests potential issues with habitat connectivity, patch size and/or availability of nesting and hibernation sites. Implications for insect conservation Based on our findings, we suggest that existing species-rich and coastal grassland sites should be conserved, and other areas restored, for B. distinguendus in Ireland. Conservation management should focus on delaying cutting grasslands until late September, winter grazing of stock and reducing pesticides and fertilisers with the aim of increasing forage availability in late season, and ensuring that suitable habitats are connected in the landscape to allow adequate habitat area as well as movement and dispersal of the species to new areas.

AB  - Hurricanes are one of the major natural forces affecting plant and animal dynamics in areas where tropical dry forests (TDF) are located. Most studies of hurricane impacts have evaluated the effects on plants, but few have addressed how interactions between plants and animals are affected. We investigated the effect of hurricane Jova on plant-lepidopteran interaction networks along a TDF successional gradient in the Chamela region on the Mexican Pacific coast. We surveyed plant-lepidopteran larvae trophic interactions during 2007-2010 and re-surveyed this association in 2012 and 2013, following the landfall of a category 2 hurricane. The parameters of plant-lepidopteran interaction networks changed after the hurricane. Network size, number of compartments and specificity (H2) diminished, while connectance and robustness increased. Network differences throughout the chronosequence remained similar to the patterns observed in previous studies showing larger networks and higher levels of robustness but lower connectance in late successional stages than in recently abandoned pastures. It is interesting that even though the hurricane affected plant-lepidopteran interaction networks, the topology related to forest succession remained unaltered after the passage of the hurricane, demonstrating the long legacy of the human footprint on ecosystems.

AB  - Theory suggests that species with different traits will respond differently to landscape fragmentation. Studies have shown that the presence of species in fragments of varying size, shape and connectivity is dependent on plant traits related to dispersal ability, persistence and disturbance tolerance. However, the role of traits in determining long-term plant community changes in response to changing landscape context is not well understood. We used data from resurveys of 184 plots to test the ability of nine plant traits to predict colonizations and extirpations between 1968 and 2009 based on the surrounding landscape context. We related apparent colonizations and extirpations to road density, naturally vegetated area and patch shape and then tested for significant relationships between a tendency for positive or negative associations and plant traits. Exotic, herbaceous, annual, shade-intolerant species and species with higher specific leaf area were more likely than others to colonize plots with higher road density, lower amount of naturally vegetated area and higher edge-to-area ratio. However, extirpations were rarely predictable based on traits. The role of landscape context in structuring plant community change over the past four decades in the 184 plots resurveyed was largely mediated by colonization events, suggesting that trait-based extirpations occur with a longer post-fragmentation time lag or, alternatively, that extirpation is more stochastic with respect to plant traits than is colonization.

AB  - The global increase in urbanization is leading to heavier interface between humans and wildlife. Within these anthropogenic landscapes, little is known about ranging patterns, particularly with regard to urban primates. Here we present the results of the first long-term deployment of multiple GPS collars on two species of macaques to investigate the impacts of urbanization on urban primate ranging patterns in Singapore and Gibraltar. Collars data acquisition were excellent with respect to the amount, quality, and accuracy of data collected; however, remote connectivity and drop-off functionality was poor across all deployments. Analyses highlighted high variability in ranging patterns between individuals within each species that aligned with access to human food resources and patterns of tourism. Individuals from troops with less access to human food had much larger home, core, and day ranges relative to those with regular provisioning or raiding opportunities. Almost no temporal range overlap was observed between any focal individuals at either site and spatial overlap was low for all but two troops at each site. We found no relationship between anthropogenic schedules and changes in ranging patterns. Significant seasonal variation existed for daily path length and day range size for both the Singapore long-tailed and the Gibraltar Barbary macaques, with long-tailed macaques increasing their range during the equatorial monsoon season and Barbary macaques increasing their range during drier, summer months. This study highlights how the behavioral plasticity found within the genus Macaca is reflected in ranging pattern variability within urban environments.

AB  - Long-distance pipeline construction results in marked human disturbance of the regional ecosystem and brings into question the safety of pipeline construction with respect to the environment. Thus, the direct environmental impact and proper handling of such large projects have received much attention. The potential environmental effects, however, have not been fully addressed, particularly for large linear pipeline projects, and the threshold of such effects is unclear. In this study, two typical eco-fragile areas in western China, where large linear construction projects have been conducted, were chosen as the case study areas. Soil quality indices (SQI) and vegetation indices (VI), representing the most important potential effects, were used to analyze the scope of the effect of large pipeline construction on the surrounding environment. These two indices in different buffer zones along the pipeline were compared against the background values. The analysis resulted in three main findings. First, pipeline construction continues to influence the nearby eco-environment even after a 4-year recovery period. During this period, the effect on vegetation due to pipeline construction reaches 300 m beyond the working area, and is much larger in distance than the effect on soil, which is mainly confined to within 30 m either side of the pipeline, indicating that vegetation is more sensitive than soil to this type of human disturbance. However, the effect may not reach beyond 500 m from the pipeline. Second, the scope of the effect in terms of distance on vegetation may also be determined by the frequency of disturbance and the intensity of the pipeline construction. The greater the number of pipelines in an area, the higher the construction intensity and the more frequent the disturbance. Frequent disturbance may expand the effect on vegetation on both sides of the pipeline, but not on soil quality. Third, the construction may eliminate the stable, resident plant community. During the recovery period, the plant community in the work area of the pipeline is replaced by some species that are rare or uncommon in the resident plant community because of human disturbance, thereby increasing the plant diversity in the work area. In terms of plant succession, the duration of the recovery period has a direct effect on the composition and structure of the plant community. The findings provide a theoretical basis and scientific foundation for improving the environmental impact assessment (EIA) of oil and gas pipeline construction as it pertains to the desert steppe ecosystem, and provide a reference point for recovery and management of the eco-environment during the pipeline construction period.

AB  - Destruction of natural habitat, land-use changes and biological invasion are some of the major threats to biodiversity. Both habitat alteration and biological invasions can have impacts on pollinator communities and pollination network structures. This study aims to examine the effect of an invasive plant, praxelis (Praxelis clematidea; Asteraceae), and land-use types on pollinator communities and the structure of pollination networks. We conducted the study in smallholder orchards which are either invaded or non-invaded by P. clematidea. We estimated the pollinator richness, visitation rates, and pollinator diversity and evaluated the network structures from 18 smallholder orchards in Northeastern Thailand. The effect of landscape structure in the vicinity of the orchards was investigated, with the proportion of agricultural, forest, and urban landscape within a 3 km radius analyzed. The invasive species and land-use disturbance influence the pollinator communities and pollination network structure at species level was affected by the presence of P. clematidea. Bees were the most important pollinator group for pollinator communities and pollination networks of both invaded or non-invaded plots, as bees are a generalist species, they provide the coherence of both the network and its own module. The urban landscape had a strong negative influence on pollinator richness, while the proportions of agriculture and forest landscape positively affected the pollinator community.

AB  - To assist land managers responsible for park management, we conducted a pilot study to examine small mammal assemblages at 7 riparian parks in suburban/ urban landscapes and at 1 riparian site in mature forest, all located in central Pennsylvania. Species richness and diversity were lowest in parks containing manicured habitats and surrounded by human-modified landscapes. However, parks managed for passive recreation supported mammalian assemblages that were similar in richness and diversity to our mature riparian forest site. The mature riparian forest site contained four species of small mammals (eastern chipmunks [Tamias striatus], white-footed mice [Peromyscus leucopus], deer mice [P. maniculatus], and woodland jumping mice [Napeozapus insignis]), and Spring Creek Nature Park, a park managed to promote natural and native habitats, contained five species (short-tailed shrews [Blarina brevicauda], eastern chipmunks, white-footed mice, meadow voles [Microtus pennsylvanicus], and meadow jumping mice [Zapus hudsonius]). In contrast, parks located in more urban settings and consisting primarily of mowed habitat contained only 1 or 2 species of small mammals. We did not capture non-native species in our study. Based upon this study, we recommend locating parks along streams or other natural corridors, leaving unmowed 10-15-m buffers along streams, and planting native trees along stream corridors in order to encourage diversity of small mammals in suburban and urban parks.

AB  - The importance of examining multiple hierarchical levels when modeling resource use for wildlife has been acknowledged for decades. Multi-level resource selection functions have recently been promoted as a method to synthesize resource use across nested organizational levels into a single predictive surface. Analyzing multiple scales of selection within each hierarchical level further strengthens multi-level resource selection functions. We extend this multi-level, multi-scale framework to modeling resistance for wildlife by combining multi-scale resistance surfaces from two data types, genetic and movement. Resistance estimation has typically been conducted with one of these data types, or compared between the two. However, we contend it is not an either/or issue and that resistance may be better-modeled using a combination of resistance surfaces that represent processes at different hierarchical levels. Resistance surfaces estimated from genetic data characterize temporally broad-scale dispersal and successful breeding over generations, whereas resistance surfaces estimated from movement data represent fine-scale travel and contextualized movement decisions. We used telemetry and genetic data from a long-term study on pumas (Puma concolor) in a highly developed landscape in southern California to develop a multilevel, multi-scale resource selection function and a multi-level, multi-scale resistance surface. We used these multi-level, multi-scale surfaces to identify resource use patches and resistant kernel corridors. Across levels, we found puma avoided urban, agricultural areas, and roads and preferred riparian areas and more rugged terrain. For other landscape features, selection differed among levels, as did the scales of selection for each feature. With these results, we developed a conservation plan for one of the most isolated puma populations in the U.S. Our approach captured a wide spectrum of ecological relationships for a population, resulted in effective conservation planning, and can be readily applied to other wildlife species.

AB  - Bees of the tribe Euglossini are known as orchid-bees. In general, areas with more vegetation cover have greater abundance and diversity of these bees. This study investigated the effects of forest fragmentation on assemblages of the euglossine bees in the region of Rio Branco municipality, State of Acre, and surrounding areas. Ten forest fragments with varying sizes were selected for the study and were classified as urban or rural. The bees were sampled between December 2005 and August 2006. A total of 3,675 bees in 36 species and 4 genera were collected. In general abundance and richness of bees did not differ statistically between urban and rural fragments. The index of edge in fragments was a predictor of richness and diversity of bees. The connectivity estimated was also an adequate predictor for richness. Fragments with greater similarity in relation to their landscape structure were also more similar in relation to faunal composition.

AB  - Caprimulgus affinis is an endemic species commonly known as the Taiwan nighthawk, forest nighthawk, or South Asian nighthawk. In recent years, the C. affinis population has gradually moved outward from river habitats into the metropolitan areas of Taiwan. Because male birds' booming sounds at night can reach up to 90 dB or higher and they can be intermittently tweeting for more than 10 hours, they often disturb the sleep of urban residents and can even cause nightmares. In this study, we analyzed long-term survey data to assess the distribution history of C. affinis in Taiwan. By using 1738 entries of observation data collected from 1999 to 2014, a model of C. affinis distribution was constructed, and a geostatistical method was used to improve the accuracy of the model estimate. In addition, the Mann-Kendall trend test was applied to predict future C. affinis distribution. Based on the results, four variables were selected to construct the C. affinis distribution matrix. Urban population, coastal proximity, and distance to upstream river location represented positive driving forces, whereas city elevation was a negative driving force. C. affinis is currently distributed on the plains of central and southern Taiwan and in eastern Taiwan. The C. affinis emergence trend diagram was plotted using the time-space trend diagram, which showed yearly increases in the C. affinis populations in urban and settled areas including central, western, northeastern, and southeastern Taiwan and yearly decreases in the populations in rural areas including northern and southern Taiwan, especially in fragmented riverine habitats. Regression kriging can correctly describe the distribution of the entire C. affinis population, which leads to the correct understanding of the biological corridor of C. affinis in their migration through the graphical contours in GIS.

AB  - Large captors such as northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) frequently have been the focus of conservation efforts because of their large area requirements and habitat sensitivity. We examined landscape-scale habitat selection of breeding goshawks and created a habitat model of goshawk landscape use in an area (1 600 km(2)) that contained forested, agricultural, and urban landscapes in northern Japan. From a systematic nest survey and extensive radio telemetry, we delineated 36 male home ranges (18 of them were approximated with similar-sized plots around nests) and 44 similar-sized unoccupied plots over the study area. The proportions of forest cover in each home range varied widely (between 2 and 88%). Despite this variation, goshawk landscape use was estimated accurately (classification accuracy = 84%) with a stepwise logistic regression model; the probability of occupancy was positively associated with the proportion of forest interior (> 200 m from the forest edge) and that of open land < 200 m from the forest edge, but it was negatively associated with the proportion of water and the mode of the slope. In home ranges, the proportions of forest interior and open land < 200 m from forest edge complemented each other with the change in forest cover in such a way that the sum of the 2 variables always occupied > 30% of the home ranges. These results suggest that a preference for the 2 different habitats, both of which may have a high prey availability, enables goshawks to nest in landscapes with a wide variety of forest fragmentation. The adverse effect of water on goshawk occupancy was due to the tendency of goshawks not to include a large river (> 800 m wide) in their home ranges. This suggests that goshawks need connectivity between forest patches in their home ranges. The proportion of urban land was 19% lower in home ranges than in unoccupied plots. These results indicate that management efforts should focus on maintaining landscapes with high prey availability and connectivity between forest patches and on preventing urbanization over entire home ranges.

AB  - The establishment of protected areas is one of the most common environmental policy tools which can effectively contribute to landscape protection, biodiversity conservation, and ecosystem services provision. In this sense, the Brazilian Law on Native Vegetation Protection establishes the legal reserves, mandatory protected spaces within private rural lands, which seek to maintain and restore ecological functions and promote biodiversity conservation. This paper aims to present an approach that attempted to locate potential protected spaces, in the form of legal reserves, in the East Zone of Ribeirao Preto - a recharge zone of the Guarani Aquifer System. We made use of seven criteria to create five possible scenarios with varying priorities for native vegetation protection or restoration. Then, we used eight landscape metrics, as well as the level of compliance with the law, to discuss the viability of each scenario in terms of ecological thresholds and landscape indicators. We found only one scenario (the broader perspective on recovering the natural vegetation corridors) capable of meeting the ecological and legal requirements. We conclude that using less data-demanding methods, such as the one applied in this research, could be useful in assisting decision-making regarding the selection of areas for conservation or restoration.

AB  - Mosses (Bryophyta) comprise about 12 800 species in the world. In Mexico, 984 species and varieties are recognized from literature records and specimens in the Bryophyte Collection of the National Herbarium (MEXU). The southern states and those along the Neovolcanic Belt are the richest in terms of number of species, but the botanical exploration elsewhere may still produce many records. The proportion of endemic taxa is low in most vegetation types, except in the alpine areas where it reaches 17% while it is only 8% at the national level. Moss diversity is concentrated in 25 out of 75 families that contain 792 species and varieties (80% of the moss flora); the most diverse family is the Pottiaceae with 158 species and varieties. Ease of dispersal and longevity are considered responsible for the low level of moss endemism in Mexico. Only 6 species are officially recognized as rare or endangered, but many others are at risk because of forest and microhabitat disturbance by man.

AB  - The contradiction between rapid urbanization's demand for land resources and the ecological environment is increasing, which has led to large-scale hardening of the underlying surface of the city and reduction of land for storage. In addition, construction land occupies rainwater confluence land, resulting in a significant decline in urban stormwater control capabilities. The increasingly frequent flood disasters in recent years have exposed the contradiction between urban construction and stormwater safety that cannot be ignored. Therefore, this article takes the central city of Harbin as the research object, uses ArcGIS for spatial analysis and SCS (Soil Conservation Service) hydrological model simulation to construct the rain and flood safety pattern in the research area, and proposes targeted optimization suggestions and strategies based on the evaluation results to achieve the purpose of coordinating the water ecosystem service function with social and economic development. The research shows that protecting the original stormwater corridor and strengthening the connection between the stormwater control patches can effectively guarantee the connectivity of the stormwater corridor, build the natural stormwater regulation and storage system, and then increase the ability of the city to resist the risk of rainstorm, reduce the disaster caused by urban waterlogging, and achieve the goal of sponge city construction.

AB  - In 1996, a coalition of diverse and determined organizations launched a new initiative in the Chicago region. Our vision? Chicago Wilderness: a thriving mosaic of natural areas, connected by greenways and wildlife corridors, embedded in the nation's third largest metropolis. In this vision, the region's human communities reclaim a cultural tradition of protecting and restoring these globally significant natural communities that enrich our lives. Today, more than 100 organizations join forces to transform this vision into reality. A regional Biodiversity Recovery Plan-the result of three Years OF assessment and planning by scientists, land managers, educators, and policy strategies-sets priorities and determines the lines of action for the coalition. This regional agenda stems from our vision and recovery goals for each ecological community; it encourages targeted research initiatives that focus on characterizing our native biological diversity and on analyzing elements critical to its recovery. Ultimately though the long-term survival of our natural wealth rests on the support from the public. While the challenges to conservation educators and communicators are many, Chicago Wilderness allows us to work together in understanding our. audiences, channeling our resources, and creating novel approaches to engage the wiliest public in our conservation efforts.

AB  - Hedge density, structure, and function vary with primary production and slope gradient and are subject to other diverse factors. Hedgerows are emerging ecosystems with both above- and belowground components. Functions of hedges can be categorized as provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting ecosystem services; these functions include food production, noncrop food and wood production, firewood production, pollination, pest control, soil conservation and quality improvement, mitigation of water flux and availability, carbon sequestration, landscape connectivity and character maintenance, and contributions to biodiversity. Urban hedges provide a relatively equitable microclimate and critical connections between green spaces and enhance human health and well-being through contact with biodiversity. Soil and water conservation are well researched in tropical hedges but less is known about their contribution to pollination, pest control, and biodiversity. Establishing a minimum hedge width and longer intervals between cutting of temperate hedges would enhance biosecurity and promote carbon sequestration and biodiversity. Hedges have a global role in mitigating biodiversity loss and climate change, which restoration should maximize, notwithstanding regional character.

AB  - Managers tasked with repairing degraded stream ecosystems require restoration strategies that are tailored to local and regional characteristics. Emerging evidence suggests that local reach-scale approaches may be as effective, if not more so, than catchment-scale actions in highly permeable coastal landscapes, particularly if there is hydraulic connectivity to shallow groundwater and where recharge is strongly seasonal. This study assessed the relative influence of catchment-scale land use and reach-scale vegetation structure on the distribution of carbon and nutrient concentrations of streams within urban and agricultural catchments of the Perth region of southwestern Australia. We used linear mixed-effects models to evaluate the extent to which phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon concentrations in different stream zones (streamwater, and fluvial and parafluvial sediments) were explained by catchment and reach-scale attributes and moderated by high versus low-flow periods, i.e., in wet versus dry months. We found that reach-scale vegetation (woody plant cover, annual plant cover) was a better predictor of nutrient concentrations than catchment-scale land use, particularly total imperviousness, a common measure of urbanisation. Flow was also important, with carbon and nutrient concentrations better described by reach- or catchment-scale attributes during the low flow period. The extent to which individual catchment and reach attributes influenced the distribution of nutrients in different stream zones was complex. However, our results suggest that planting woody vegetation can reduce nitrogen concentrations in surface water and fluvial sediments. Reducing the abundance of weedy annual species and restoring woody perennial species may further reduce phosphorus concentrations in surface water. We conclude that local riparian restoration can be a cost-effective strategy for managing excess nutrients and carbon in flat and permeable urban landscapes, particularly during low flow periods.

AB  - The Amazonian ecosystems of Madre de Dios (MDD) region, considered Peru's "capital of biodiversity" due to its impressive species richness, are threatened by the rapid expansion of infrastructure. The paving of the Interoceanic Highway in 2010 has brought rapid population growth and environmental degradation, threatening large-scale conservation efforts such as the Vilcabamba-Amboro Conservation Corridor (VACC). To quantify the impacts of development processes and to identify critical areas where further conservation efforts should be focused, we analyzed 20 years of land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics, drivers, and fragmentation patterns in MDD. We mapped LULC in 1993, 2003, and 2013 using Landsat imagery and modeled the proximate drivers of change related to deforestation, forest regrowth, gold mining, agriculture, and urban expansion in two time periods (1993-2003 and 2003-2013). We characterized habitat fragmentation patterns in four regional target areas. Our results show accelerated deforestation triggered by the road network spreading, mining and agriculture expansion, and population growth. LULC changes produced two contrasting spatial landscape patterns: numerous small forest fragments in the north due to agricultural expansion along the Interoceanic Highway and large continuous forest losses caused by gold mining expansion in the south. Current unplanned development in this region is threatening its outstanding biodiversity. We suggest that further conservation efforts should focus on strengthening the legal framework of the VACC, implementing a sustainable management plan for MDD, promoting agroforestry strategies along the Interoceanic Highway, and preserving smaller corridors for animal movement.

AB  - Identifying causes of structural ecosystem shifts often requires understanding trophic structure, an important determinant of energy flow in ecological communities. In coastal pelagic ecosystems worldwide, increasing jellyfish (Cnidaria and Ctenophora) at the expense of small fish has been linked to anthropogenic alteration of basal trophic pathways. However, this hypothesis remains untested in part because baseline description of fish-jellyfish trophic dynamics, and the environmental features that influence them are lacking. Using stable isotopes of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15), we examined spatiotemporal patterns of fish and jellyfish trophic structure in greater Puget Sound, an urbanizing fjord estuary in the NW United States. We quantified niche positions of constituent species, niche widths and trophic overlap between fish and jellyfish assemblages, and several community-level trophic diversity metrics (resource diversity, trophic length, and niche widths) of fish and jellyfish combined. We then related assemblage- and community-level measures to landscape gradients of terrestrial-marine connectivity and anthropogenic influence in adjacent catchments. Relative niche positions among species varied considerably and displayed no clear pattern except that fish generally had higher delta N-15 and lower delta C-13 relative to jellyfish, which resulted in low assemblage-level trophic overlap. Fish assemblages had larger niche widths than jellyfish in most cases and, along with whole community trophic diversity, exhibited contrasting seasonal patterns across oceanographic basins, which was positively correlated to landscape variation in terrestrial connectivity. In contrast, jellyfish niche widths were unrelated to terrestrial connectivity, but weakly negatively correlated to urban land use in adjacent catchments. Our results indicate that fish-jellyfish trophic structure is highly heterogeneous and that disparate processes may underlie the trophic ecology of these taxa; consequently, they may respond divergently to environmental change. In addition, spatiotemporal variation in ecosystem connectivity, in this case through freshwater influence, may influence trophic structure across heterogeneous landscapes.

AB  - River floodplains with their constituent biodiversity are among the most endangered ecosystems worldwide. These systems are conceptualised as mosaics of aquatic and terrestrial patches at different successional stages colonised by a wide range of aquatic, semi-aquatic and terrestrial species.
   In three reaches in the active corridor of a French Mediterranean braided river, we tested whether community structure and composition of ground-dwelling terrestrial arthropods varied across the mosaic of terrestrial patches, and identified some of the underlying mechanisms.
   We predicted that arthropod community structure and composition would vary consistently with the age and position of the patches in the mosaic, due to species habitat preferences and dispersal. We also predicted that between-patch species turnover would contribute to corridor diversity to a greater extent than within-patch diversity.
   The natural flow regime of the Asse River promoted patch diversity in all the reaches considered. Arthropod communities differed according to patch age, indicating that successions had occurred over a decennial timescale. By contrast, the location of patches within the mosaics seemed not to affect communities, suggesting that dispersal was not limited. The contribution of between-patch diversity to corridor diversity far exceeded that of within-patch diversity, as predicted by mosaic theory.
   These results put the onus on river ecosystem managers to preserve natural flow regimes in braided rivers, so as to foster various types of pioneer and mature habitat patches and maintain associated biodiversity.

AB  - At the present time, rehabilitation of polluted urban areas and the restoration of their soil are environmental priorities. The creation of constructed soils appears to be a tempting way to restore, lastingly, a contaminated urban soil provided that they can become fertile and host a functional biodiversity delivering essential ecosystem services.
   To ensure this, the recolonization of newly established technosols composed of a mixture of compost and in situ deep alluvion was monitored using judiciously chosen bioindicators: springtails, mites, earthworms, carabid beetles and woodlice. These technosols were part of an experimental plot located inside the future "Ecoquartier de l'Union" (Roubaix, France).
   The results show that, if the connection of the technosols with an element of the local landscape (in this case a railway hedgerow) plays a part chiefly in aiding the first stages of recolonization, notably for earthworms and springtails, technosols management has a lasting impact on the colonization dynamics and the implantation of the different taxa.
   Establishing an herbaceous cover (flowering meadow, lawn) or a hedge was especially profitable to the pedofaunic communities, which were richer and more abundant, as well as to the technosols functioning (better litter degradation, diversified collembolan communities with regards to functional traits). The same is true for the addition of RCW (Ramial Chipped Wood) which benefits earthworm and mesofauna through the organic components released and the associated fungal development.

AB  - As landscapes are increasingly modified due to anthropogenic processes such as urbanisation or development for agriculture, the need to understand wildlife habitat requirements is imperative. This is particularly pertinent for species that are threatened, or apex predators with specific nest, den, or food requirements. Identifying responses to habitat with thresholds can provide an understanding of what resources species are using or avoiding, and their interactions with the surrounding environment. In this research we investigated space use and habitat requirements of the threatened apex predator, the powerful owl (Ninox strenua) in Greater Melbourne, Australia. We deployed GPS devices to 21 urban powerful owls over five years and found owls had an average home range size of 397 ha, and an average core-range of 84 ha. Home range size and positioning was driven by tree cover and urban land cover, while core ranges were restricted to treed environments with a limited area of impervious surfaces and housing. We used thresholds to identify-three priorities for powerful owl conservation in Mel-bourne. Priority 1: Ensuring river corridors and public open spaces are adequately protected. Priority 2: Limit property densities near rivers and protected areas. Priority 3: Finding opportunities for revegetation to expand and enhance habitat over time. Our research demonstrates how species-specific thresholds can inform land use planning to ensure wildlife species are maintained within highly modified environments.

AB  - Rivers provide critically important ecosystem services to society, and play an essential role in maintaining the structure, function, and integrity of landscapes in which the rivers reside. Better understanding of the patterns and processes in river systems requires a broader landscape approach that goes beyond the traditional linear and longitudinal focus. Such a landscape approach is especially important for effectively restoring and managing already damaged or degraded rivers around the world. Toward this end, here we develop a riverscape transect approach by adapting landscape gradient analysis with pattern metrics so as to quantify the longitudinal variations in the spatial pattern of the river-land complex from headwater to mouth. Two rivers systems in southern China were used to develop and demonstrate the approach. For each river, we first constructed a riverscape transect, consisting of a spatial series of overlapping neighborhood landscapes, then computed a selected set of landscape metrics, and finally depicted the longitudinal profile of riverscape pattern with relative location-based plots. Our results have shown that this riverscape transect approach is conceptually consistent with the increasingly prominent riverine landscape perspective and technically feasible with the aid of remote sensing data and landscape pattern analysis methods. In particular, landscape metrics, such as percentages of urban and native vegetation, patch density, and Shannon diversity, can be used to reveal important variations in riverscape structure along the river. These longitudinal profiles of riverscape pattern, used as spatial indicators, can help identify key socioeconomic drivers and ecological impacts of land use and land cover change in the watershed. Our study demonstrates that this riverscape transect approach can be a new and effective way of facilitating the planning and evaluation of river restoration and management efforts.

AB  - Since urbanisation and fragmentation result in a decrease in larger forests, the importance of isolated trees as habitat in urban landscapes is increasing. This study investigated the contribution of trees in urban landscapes to the abundance and variety of arthropod taxa. Ants and other arthropods were surveyed on the bark of 341 trees in three types of arrangement: isolated trees, trees in linear corridors and trees in patches. Ant species and other arthropods were identified and the numbers on each tree were counted. In order to determine the effects of host tree properties (size and plant species) and the surrounding environment (arrangement of trees, surrounding land cover), an analysis of covariance was conducted. Tree species was the most important influence, followed by tree size, on ants and other arthropods in the urban landscape, with little effect from the arrangement of trees. Thus, in order to increase arthropod diversity in urban landscapes, it is important to select tree species that attract a large number of arthropod taxa. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urbanization has negative consequences for the integrity of ecosystems and services they provide, by reducing their extent and quality in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Few studies have explored how urban infrastructure expansion affects the spatial connectivity of coastal ecosystems by provoking their fragmentation and loss. Here we explore changes in the spatial connectivity of coastal ecosystems due to urbanization, analyzing ecosystem extent and concatenation with urban infrastructures (shared perimeter) in four bays of the Coquimbo region of northern Chile (from 29 degrees S to 32 degrees S) as model systems. Increase in natural-to-urban concatenation patterns were observed in most urbanized bays; sandy beaches and wetlands were the habitats most connected with urban infrastructures like roads and coastal artificial defenses. Availability of ecosystem services is compromised by progressive loss of natural connectivity and poor governance structure, which seems to confer high vulnerability to urbanized bays with future urban expansion. Complementary actions are proposed to reduce the vulnerability of coastal urban systems, considering 1) investment in nature-based infrastructures for coastal defenses, 2) restoration-rehabilitation of natural (remnant) urban ecosystems and eco-engineering of current artificial infrastructures, focusing on reestablishment of biodiversity patterns and habitat connectivity, and 3) limitation of coastal town and village expansion. Management strategies can improve coastal adaptation to natural hazards, stabilizing changes in the natural-urban concatenation mosaic present in coastal urban systems like bays.

AB  - Roads form a vast, rapidly growing global network that has diverse, detrimental ecological impacts. However, the habitats that border roads ('road verges') form a parallel network that might help mitigate these impacts and provide additional benefits (ecosystem services; ES). We evaluate the capacity of road verges to provide ES by reviewing existing research and considering their relevant characteristics: area, connectivity, shape, and contextual ES supply and demand. We consider the present situation, and how this is likely to change based on future projections for growth in road extent, traffic densities and urban populations. Road verges not only provide a wide range of ES, including biodiversity provision, regulating services (e.g. air and water filtration) and cultural services (e.g. health and aesthetic benefits by providing access to nature) but also displace other habitats and provide ecosystem disservices (e.g. plant allergens and damage to infrastructure). Globally, road verges may currently cover 270,000 km(2) and store 0.015 Gt C/year, which will further increase with 70% projected growth in the global road network. Road verges are well placed to mitigate traffic pollution and address demand for ES in surrounding ES-impoverished landscapes, thereby improving human health and well-being in urban areas, and improving agricultural production and sustainability in farmland. Demand for ES provided by road verges will likely increase due to projected growth in traffic densities and urban populations, though traffic pollution will be reduced by technological advances (e.g. electric vehicles). Road verges form a highly connected network, which may enhance ES provision but facilitate the dispersal of invasive species and increase vehicle-wildlife collisions. Synthesis and applications. Road verges offer a significant opportunity to mitigate the negative ecological effects of roads and to address demand for ecosystem services (ES) in urban and agricultural landscapes. Their capacity to provide ES might be enhanced considerably if they were strategically designed and managed for environmental outcomes, namely by optimizing the selection, position and management of plant species and habitats. Specific opportunities include reducing mowing frequencies and planting trees in large verges. Road verge management for ES must consider safety guidelines, financial costs and ecosystem disservices, but is likely to provide long-term financial returns if environmental benefits are considered.

AB  - Although the influence of microbial community assembly processes on aquatic ecosystem function and biodiversity is well known, the processes that govern planktonic communities in human-impacted rivers remain largely unstudied. Here, we used multivariate statistics and a null model approach to test the hypothesis that environmental conditions and obstructed dispersal opportunities, dictate a deterministic community assembly for phytoplankton and bacterioplankton across contrasting hydrographic conditions in a subtropical mid-sized river (Jiulong River, southeast China). Variation partitioning analysis showed that the explanatory power of local environmental variables was larger than that of the spatial variables for both plankton communities during the dry season. During the wet season, phytoplankton community variation was mainly explained by local environmental variables, whereas the variance in bacterioplankton was explained by both environmental and spatial predictors. The null model based on Raup-Crick coefficients for both planktonic groups suggested little evidences of the stochastic processes involving dispersal and random distribution. Our results showed that hydrological change and landscape structure act together to cause divergence in communities along the river channel, thereby dictating a deterministic assembly and that selection exceeds dispersal limitation during the dry season. Therefore, to protect the ecological integrity of human-impacted rivers, watershed managers should not only consider local environmental conditions but also dispersal routes to account for the effect of regional species pool on local communities.

AB  - Remote sensing of urban land surface temperatures (LST) has been conducted based largely on pixel-by-pixel correlation with land use and land cover (LULC) types. Few studies have examined the spatial variations of LST within land use zoning polygons, in spite of its significance on the knowledge of environmental implications or planning practices. This study aimed to analyze the spatial patterns of LSTs and to explore factors contributing to the LST variations in the city of Indianapolis. Four Terra's ASTER images, representing distinct seasons, were used in conjunction with other types of spatial data for the analysis. The potential factors were grouped into the categories of LULC composition, biophysical conditions, intensity of human activities, and landscape pattern. Statistical analyses were conducted to determine the relative importance of each group of the variables. Moreover, the spatia variations of LST were examined at both the residential and general zoning levels, so that the environmental effect of urban planning on LST may be assessed. By analyzing the mean and standard deviation values of normalized LSTs, the seasonal dynamics of LST were finally studied. Results show that the biophysical variables were most significant in explaining the spatial variations of LST. At both zoning levels, LST possessed a weaker relationship with the LULC compositions than with the biophysical variables. Principal component analysis further indicates that the cumulative variance was always larger in residential zoning, implying that the factors contributing to the LST variations in general zoning might be more complex than those for the residential zoning. An interesting finding of this study was in the relationship between LST and the landscape metrics of zoning polygons. It suggests that smaller residential zoning polygons were associated with larger temperature variations, and that the more complex in shape a residential zoning category was, the more intrapolygon variation of LST tended to be. These correlations, however, did not exist in the nonresidential zoning categories. The spatial pattern of LST in Indianapolis may be characterized as concentric in the central part of the city, a hot ring along the Highway 465, and several hot corridors along the radial highways outward to the countryside. The seasonal fluctuation of LST was weak in the central part, but increased towards the countryside. Due to the amount of anthropogenic heat, land use zones with less human activities were found to have a strong seasonal variability, whereas the zones with intensive human activities fluctuated less in LST.

AB  - Multifunctional and connected green infrastructure (GI) systems have been linked to urban resilience. Although there have been significant scholarly efforts to assess resilience and to evaluate the benefits of GI, it remains unclear the degree in which GI efforts enhance resilience. Following theoretical frameworks that study coupled infrastructure systems, this paper explores the state of the art on the contribution of GI to urban resilience from multiple dimensions: (1) policy - that promotes the adoption of GI, (2) performance - assessment of GI impacts on water infrastructure systems resilience, (3) connectivity - evaluation of human and wildlife movement through GI, and (4) social - community cohesion as a result of GI efforts. We argue that beyond their individual contributions to supporting urban resilience, the interactions across the various dimensions are key to enhancing resilience. Ultimately, participatory processes are needed to assess resilience originating from GI systems and avoid injustice.

AB  - The formulation of a strategic plan for the conservation of terrestrial biodiversity in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR; 87,892 km(2)) requires an objective and spatially explicit assessment of the representativeness of major habitat categories (surrogates for biodiversity) currently under protection. A GIS layer of statutory and non-statutory conservation areas was used, along with layers of many biological and physical features, to explore the configuration of conserved areas relative to key biological and physical indicators. Three analyses were performed. (1) Recursive partitioning, a classification-tree analysis technique, was used to contrast features of protected areas with non-protected areas. (2) The conservation status of 16 primary and 88 secondary Broad Habitat Units (BHUs; derived on the basis of topography, geology, homogeneous climatic zones, and floristic composition) was assessed in terms of prescribed conservation targets. (3) The extent to which protected areas are able to sustain ecological and evolutionary processes was explored by assessing the extent of spatial components of these processes for all conservation areas. About 20% of the CFR is protected in some form of conservation area, mostly concentrated on sandstone substrates, and areas with high altitude and steep slopes. The reservation bias towards upland areas has seriously constrained representation of biodiversity pattern and processes. Most of the habitat diversity is poorly represented in the current conservation area system with only 9% of the remaining primary BHUs in the lowlands conserved. However, almost 50% of the Mountain Fynbos Complex is conserved (largely exceeding its conservation target). Spatial components of the ecological processes identified are poorly captured by the conservation area network although faunal and floral migration is possible in the uplands due to the strong spatial connectivity of the protected network.

AB  - Seed rain has ecological consequences on plant community structure. This study was conducted in the Monte Austral Neuquino nearby the town of Picun Leufu, Province of Neuquen. Argentina, within an area of 15 km x 15 km (39 degrees 20 32'S; 69 degrees 19 30' W). Studies were conducted at two sites, distant 1.5 km from one another. Vegetation is distributed on the soil surface us vegetation patches. Four superficial locations may be found in the soil of these patches: location 1, small dune accumulated under the lee; location 2, found at the edge of the small dune, and below the major grass canopies and tallest shrubs; location 3, located at the edge of the vegetation patch, and location 4 which includes the uncovered corridors among vegetation patches. Seed rain was measured by collecting seeds from traps located in the four study locations. Our working hypotheses were that (1) seeds of the study species arrive to all locations of the vegetation patches and the nude corridors among patches, and (2) the magnitude of the seed rain depends on time of the year. Larrea divaricata showed the greatest values in the corridors among vegetation patches and in the periphery of such patches. A similar pattern was found for S. neaei although this species dispersed seeds further from the mother plant. Atriplex lampa distributed seeds homogeneously in all four locations. Elymus erianthus only contributed 1 seed to the seed rain. Larrea, divaricata showed a greater, proportion of its total seed rain between December and March in all locations. Seed rain in A. lampa was almost permanent throughout the year while in S. neaei was concentrated in December and January, although it showed some seed rain until April.

AB  - With cities growing at a rapid pace, animal species must either retreat to patches of intact natural habitat or adapt to novel conditions in urban areas. While this disturbance causes most species to be in local decline, some show specific behavioural plasticity, facilitating success in a new habitat. The Eurasian red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) is a common small mammal species which occurs in high numbers in urban environments. To determine which characteristics enable its success, we investigated space use and activity budgets of seven free-ranging individuals living in semi-natural and urban habitats within a large city. We did not find significant differences in animals' space use between habitat types but tendencies towards smaller home ranges and increased home range overlap existed among individuals in the urban site. Squirrels differed between sites in both overall activity levels and temporal activity patterns: urban animals spent less time active and activity onset was later compared to semi-natural conspecifics. This is likely explained by a combination of dense and reliable supplementary food sources in the urban habitat, reducing foraging effort, and restrictions to movement imposed by higher fragmentation. Flexibility in space use and activity budgets, as well as the ability to exploit anthropogenic food sources and tolerate reduced habitat connectivity, are likely the most important factors contributing to the squirrels' success in cities. Accordingly, these traits could be used as indicators of low sensitivity towards urbanisation when assessing other species' potential resilience. However, they do not immunise squirrels against extirpation. Further research on individuals' foraging ecology and population health may reveal possible threats to urban red squirrels and help predict their future persistence in this challenging habitat.

AB  - Societal Impact Statement The plants sold in nurseries directly influence urban landscapes by providing habitat that supports humans and other organisms and indirectly influence the natural landscape by acting as a major source of invasive species. We analyzed the ornamental plants sold in US nurseries from 1719 to 1946 and found broad patterns of increasing diversity occurring in step with an increase in species relatedness, a switch from native to alien species, and a decrease in regional distinctness. Patterns like these, which have been observed recently in urban areas, thus have a basis in cultivation/horticultural history. Summary center dot Cultivated plants are foundational species in urban areas, where they simultaneously provide essential ecosystem services while posing a risk of invasion into natural communities. We sought to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of cultivated plants using historical data to better understand the origins of the patterns of diversity observed in present-day human-dominated landscapes. center dot Using records of 5098 ornamental vascular plant species available in 319 US nursery catalogs published from 1719 to 1946, we quantified the taxonomic and phylogenetic alpha$$ \alpha $$-diversity, phylogenetic structure, and beta$$ \beta $$-diversity of the historical US nursery flora in cultural regions, biomes, latitudinal bands, and longitudinal zones. center dot We showed a peaked increase in taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of the US nursery flora over time, concurrent with the proliferation of nurseries and the addition of new species to nursery offerings. However, standardized phylogenetic diversity showed a convex pattern, with a trough during a time of peak growth and connectivity in the nursery industry, and diversity actually decreased at the end of the time series. We also showed a pattern of increasing homogenization of regional nursery floras, as well as a shift from offering predominately native to predominately alien species. center dot Echos of the history of the US nursery industry can be found today in patterns with great ecological relevance. Previous reports of high alien plant diversity in urban areas, phylogenetic clustering and overdispersion among naturalized alien plants, and homogenization of urban plant communities are all consistent with the historical availability of these plants in the nursery flora. 10.1002/(ISSN)2572-2611Kinlock et al.

AB  - The current research aims at investigating a GIS-based method for measuring spatial quality of slow mobility routes, through mapping and statistical tools, with the aim to compare existing alternative routes but also to support design-choices of new routes. In the field of cultural tourism, slow routes have a great potential for economic and social development, and need to be assessed also in relation to their spatial quality implications. This paper tries to explore the effectiveness of a quantitative multi-indicators approach for measuring spatial quality. The method refers to a set of criteria, that allow to measure the spatial quality of slow routes with: cultural heritage density, spatial composition of the crossed landscape, infrastructural connectivity, route-specific features. Each criterion has been assessed through different indicators with GIS tools. The landscape components have been measured through: land-use diversity, waterways, vegetation, protected areas; the level of infrastructural connectivity of the route has been estimated with: number of route-roads intersections and railway stations; the route-specific features have been evaluated through: comfort, user-friendliness and directness. The Monks Route, that crosses the agricultural landscape in the southern Milan, has been considered as case study to test the method. The Spatial Quality Index of Slow Routes (SQISR) is the main outcome of the research and it is shown through: numerical index, graded track and diagrams.

AB  - Most large reserves in Brazil do not hold viable populations of jaguars to guarantee the species' long-term survival. Corridors linking populations have been identified as a potential tool to avoid negative effects of isolation, increasing population viability. Here, we performed a Brazil-wide evaluation of potential large scale corridors connecting protected jaguar populations. Six variables (human population size, dam reservoir size, number of dams, roads, railways and cities) expected to negatively impact jaguar movement were analyzed across 180 potential corridors connecting 298 protected jaguar areas. We established overall disturbance scores for the corridors using a principal components analysis and compared them among the Brazilian biomes. We further investigated which variables separated biomes using a canonical variates analysis. The Atlantic Forest and the semi-arid Caatinga have the most impacted potential corridors, whereas the Amazon and Pantanal still have the best potential corridors. Corridor quality in the Cerrado grasslands was intermediate. All variables but human population size and corridor length contributed significantly to differences in corridor variables among biomes. Our conclusions suggest that we need to plan the implementation of large scale corridors in the Amazon, Pantanal and particularly the Cerrado soon, while potential corridors might still be economically viable. In the much more impacted Atlantic Forest and Caatinga, the need for conservation actions is strongest, but logistical difficulties and costs may turn implementation of corridors unfeasible.

AB  - The aim of the present work was to give a first approach on the composition, abundance and distribution of the soft-bottom macrofauna of Sacrificios reef lagoon (Veracruz Reef System: VRS); highlighting its function as part of a species macrofaunal reef corridor through the Gulf of Mexico and its relevance as a biodiversity bridge among coral reefs. This reef is part of an important protected area, however, the soft-bottom macrofauna is poorly known despite its species richness and biodiversity potential, considering the high biodiversity present in coral reefs and the variety of habitats they host. Sampling was carried out in four shallow soft sediment regions of the reef lagoon, considering three microhabitats. In all, 2211 individuals were collected and 137 species were identified. Polychaetes were the dominant group in abundance and diversity. East (windward) and West (leeward) regions were established based on the environmental analysis. These regions coincided with those proposed in coral reef studies. Nevertheless the community structure suggests the presence of a third zone (North). The seagrass and patch reef microhabitats had the highest diversity and species richness and their species turnover, or beta diversity, was high between them supporting the presence of a different community. The faunistic changes among regions were more evident than those among microhabitats.

AB  - Green Infrastructure (GI) is defined as a network of natural and semi-natural areas that is strategically designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services and to enhance human wellbeing. In Europe, the GI concept has been strongly related to the concepts of multifunctionality, climate change, and green growth, particularly in the last decade, leading to a research and policy agenda that varies greatly, targeting different audiences and topics. Here, we provide an up-to-date review of the key characteristics of GI research by focusing on the countries of the European Union. We consider the conceptualizations of GI, key research priorities, and thematic clusters within the existing literature. We demonstrate that the ambiguous definition of GI has generated a high diversity in research objectives and outputs. We also show that urban green spaces and ecosystems services are the most frequent topics and that more research is needed on the social aspects of GI. We suggest that an explicit incorporation of both nature conservation and social-environmental justice goals is essential for GI research to support sustainability transitions within and beyond the city.

AB  - Stormwater basins are commonly employed structures designed to mitigate the negative effects of urban runoff. They are ubiquitous in the urbanized landscape; yet the effect of these basins on anurans has only recently been addressed. Stormwater basins have the potential to influence the breeding distribution of anurans by being sources for some species and sinks for others. Our study aims to determine which species benefit from the existence of stormwater basins, which species are negatively impacted, and what variables are the best predictors of these effects. We monitored thirty-six permanently-ponded basins in southern New Jersey for the presence of anuran larvae and calling males by aural surveys, dip-netting and trapping. We assessed fish presence by interviews, visual encounters, dip-netting, and traps. We divided near shore buffer areas into impervious surface and managed or unmanaged categories for both grass and woody vegetation. Two connectivity metrics, distance to canopied corridor and percent of undeveloped upland were analyzed with ArcGIS. Fish were detected in 92% of the basins. Resistance to fish predation distinguished successful species, those with larvae present, from unsuccessful species, those with calling activity but no larval presence. Connectivity to and availability of terrestrial habitat were significant predictors of the breeding species richness at the basins. Number of calling species increased as access to and amount of terrestrial habitat increased. Therefore, design, management, and placement of permanently-ponded basins can impact anuran communities. Additionally, as wet basins are sources for Rana catesbeiana, where bullfrogs are invasive, basins will likely increase propagule pressure.

AB  - Urbanization involves a cocktail of human-induced rapid environmental changes and is forecasted to gain further importance. Urban-heat-island effects result in increased metabolic costs expected to drive shifts towards smaller body sizes. However, urban environments are also characterized by strong habitat fragmentation, often selecting for dispersal phenotypes. Here, we investigate to what extent, and at which spatial scale(s), urbanization drives body size shifts in macro-mothsan insect group characterized by positive size-dispersal linksat both the community and intraspecific level. Using light and bait trapping as part of a replicated, spatially nested sampling design, we show that despite the observed urban warming of their woodland habitat, macro-moth communities display considerable increases in community-weighted mean body size because of stronger filtering against small species along urbanization gradients. Urbanization drives intraspecific shifts towards increased body size too, at least for a third of species analysed. These results indicate that urbanization drives shifts towards larger, and hence, more mobile species and individuals in order to mitigate low connectivity of ecological resources in urban settings. Macro-moths are a key group within terrestrial ecosystems, and since body size is central to species interactions, such urbanization-driven phenotypic change may impact urban ecosystem functioning, especially in terms of nocturnal pollination and food web dynamics. Although we show that urbanization's size-biased filtering happens simultaneously and coherently at both the inter- and intraspecific level, we demonstrate that the impact at the community level is most pronounced at the 800 m radius scale, whereas species-specific size increases happen at local and landscape scales (50-3,200m radius), depending on the species. Hence, measuressuch as creating and improving urban green infrastructureto mitigate the effects of urbanization on body size will have to be implemented at multiple spatial scales in order to be most effective.

AB  - Mammals are charismatic organisms that play a fundamental role in ecological functions and ecosy stem services, such as pollination, seed dispersal, nutrient cycling, and pest control. The state of Sao Paulo represents only 3% of the Brazilian territory but holds 33% of its mammalian diversity. Most of its territory is dominated by agriculture, pastures, and urban areas which directly affect the diversity and persistence of mammals in the landscape. In addition, Sao Paulo has the largest port in Latin America and the largest offshore oil reservoir in Brazil, with a 600 km stretch of coastline with several marine mammal species. These human-made infrastructures affect the diversity, distribution, ecology, and the future of mammals in the state. Here, we answer five main questions: 1) What is the diversity of wild mammals in Sao Paulo state? 2) Where are they? 3) What is their positive and negative impact on human well-being? 4) How do mammals thrive in human-modified landscapes? 5) What is the future of mammals in the state? The state of Sao Paulo holds 255 species of native mammals, with four endemic species, two of them globally endangered. At least six species (two marsupials, Giant otter, Pampas deer, Brazilian dwarf brocket deer, and Giant armadillo) were extirpated from the state due to hunting and habitat loss. The intense human land use in the state forced many mammalian species to change their diet to cope with the intense fragmentation and agriculture. Large-scale monoculture has facilitated the invasion of exotic species such as wild boars (javali) and the European hare. Several "savanna-dwelling" species are expanding their ranges (Maned wolf, Bracket deer) over deforested areas and probably reflect changes towards a drier climate. Because the state has the largest road system, about 40,000 mammals from 33 species are killed per year in collisions causing an economic loss of 12 million dollars/year. The diversity of mammals is concentrated in the largest forest remnants of Serra do Mar and in the interior of the State, mainly in the regions of Ribeirao Preto and Jundiai. Sampling gaps are concentrated throughout the interior of the state, particularly in the northwest region. Wild mammals play a fundamental role in many ecosystem services, but they can also be a concern in bringing new emergent diseases to humans. Although the taxonomy of mammals seems to be well known, we show that new species are continuously being discovered in the state. Therefore, continuous surveys using traditional and new technologies (eDNA, iDNA, drones), long-term population monitoring, investigation of the interface of human-wildlife conflict, and understanding of the unique ecosystem role played by mammals are future avenues for promoting sustainable green landscapes allied to human well-being in the state. The planting of forest or savanna corridors, particularly along with major river systems, in the plateau, controlling illegal hunting in the coastal areas, managing fire regimes in the Cerrado, and mitigating roadkill must be prioritized to protect this outstanding mammal diversity.

AB  - Sound pressure levels (SPL) in dB are the traditional noise measurement, but dB measures alone limit characterization of the complex urban acoustic environment. The aim of this paper is to apply alpha and beta ecoacoustic indices from soundscape ecology at two contrasting locations corresponding to an urban mixed-use corridor and a deciduous forest. Twenty acoustic indices and mean dB(A) are calculated from 2,798 three-minute recordings taken every 26 min over a 28-day period. Acoustic indices are summarized by case with mean hour-of-day plots and 7- and 28-day time series plots to identify temporal patterns. Correlations to assess index relationships for each case separately and combined are presented. Acoustic indices provide complimentary information beyond SPL measures alone, especially in frequency and temporal domains, useful to identify patterns in the acoustic environment. Correlation between specific multiple indices at individual locations is a promising approach to identification of anthrophonic and biophonic dominated sonotopes. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) have experienced explosive growth in Northwest China over the last three decades, but their effectiveness in representing regional ecological system diversity has not attracted considerable attention. Low effectiveness would exacerbate the conservation-development conflicts, particularly those that arise as a result of the Great Western Development Strategy (GWDS). Thus, an assessment of the effectiveness of the PA network has become quite important. We proposed natural vegetation communities to represent regional ecological system diversities, and proposed Global 200 Priority Ecoregions, Important Bird Areas, and ecosystem function regions to represent important conservation areas. To determine their effectiveness, we studied the extent to which ecological system diversities and important conservation areas are represented by the existing 96 PAs. Our results indicated that the total coverage of vegetation communities in PAs in Northwest China is not sufficiently comprehensive. As the PA system has expanded, the growth in the total area of the PAs has been greater than that of their vegetation community richness. While most of the important conservation areas are covered by PAs, some regions have not yet reached the 10% threshold; further, PAs are distributed unevenly and conservation gaps remain in the region. Therefore, these regions should receive more attention when planning new PAs. It is vital that more biodiversity datasets and assessment of ecosystem function regions are integrated in order to provide a basis for the government to formulate appropriate protection and development strategies.

AB  - The widespread urbanization of river catchments has resulted in the degradation of many fluvial ecosystems. We examined the hypothesis that riparian vegetation corridors form effective buffers, mitigating the effects of anthropogenic disturbances in urban river systems. We aimed to identify the principal factors affecting ecological status and biological diversity in the River Corgo (northern Portugal) in order to develop a programme of rehabilitation measures. Data were collected from urban reaches and downstream rural reaches of the River Corgo. We assessed the habitat preferences of two native cyprinid fish species Pseudochondrostoma duriense and Luciobarbus bocagei and also sampled the benthic macroinvertebrate fauna, physicochemical characteristics and hydromorphological support elements following Water Framework Directive compliant protocols. Fish habitat preference curves indicated that the specific habitat preferences of the target native cyprinid fish species were influenced by riparian zone vegetation quality, in addition to micro-habitat characteristics (substrate, current velocity and shelter). Sampling sites located in the urban centre were found to have higher ecological status than sites located in downstream rural and agricultural areas. This may reflect the increased habitat quality and buffering capacity of riparian vegetation, which was better preserved at urban sites. Despite this, non-native fish species were more abundant within urban sites compared to downstream rural sites. The results indicate the significant cumulative effect of anthropogenic influences on downstream sites, such as diffuse pollution from agriculture and loss of riparian cover. Based on the results of this study we recommend that rehabilitation measures should be directed to: a) improve the connectivity of the flowing channel in urban reaches; and b) restore the riparian corridor in the other reaches affected by nutrient input and the spread of invasive fish species.

AB  - Multiple-species habitat conservation plans (MSHCPs) are designed to eliminate project-by-project review and minimize species-by-species conflicts; but these onetime, short-term processes invariably compress the divergent expectations of interest groups into an exercise driven by economic, amenity, and aesthetic values rather than scientific values. Participants may define an MSHCP as an exchange of habitat preserves for federal permits to take populations of endangered animals and plants, but the outcome is typically driven by overarching arguments over land development and suburban sprawl. Existing land uses also constrain the size, shape, and linkages among wildlife habitats, leading to a divergence of MSHCPs from the scientific preserve selection and design literature. Problems created by constraints to preserve configuration (e.g., land costs, fragmentation, pre-existing amounts of edge, lack of connectivity) must be resolved by long-term, post facto management. To date, estimates of preserve persistence have not been used in MSHCPs. Rather than focus on map-based exercises of preserve elements, it may be more productive to set goals for the persistence of species (states) and ecosystems (processes) within the preserves-accepting that preserve configurations and arrays will be defined by the landscape and politics of suburban areas and that long-term management will provide the primary means of maintaining biodiversity along the wildland/urban interlace.

AB  - 1. This review assesses current knowledge about the interplay between landscape and pollinator communities. Our primary aim is to provide an evidence base, identify key gaps in knowledge and highlight initiatives that will help develop and improve strategies for pollinator conservation.
   2. Human-dominated landscapes (such as arable land and urban environments) can have detrimental impacts on pollinator communities but these negative effects can be ameliorated by proximity to semi-natural habitat and habitat corridors. There is also evidence to suggest that increased landscape heterogeneity and landscape configuration can play an important role in the maintenance of diverse pollinator communities.
   3. Landscape characteristics have direct impacts on pollinator communities, but can also influence abundance and richness through interaction with other drivers such as changing climate or increased chemical inputs in land management.
   4. The majority of existing literature focuses on specific hymenopteran groups, but there is a lack of information on the impact of landscape changes on non-bee taxa. Research is also needed on the effectiveness of management interventions for pollinators and multiple year observations are required for both urban and rural initiatives.
   5. Current policies and monitoring schemes could contribute data that will plug gaps in knowledge, thus enabling greater understanding of relationships between landscapes and pollinator populations. This would in turn help design mitigation and adaptation strategies for pollinator conservation.

AB  - Vegetated coastal ecosystems (VCEs) are in global decline and sensitive to climate change; yet may also assist its mitigation through high rates of 'blue' carbon sequestration and storage. Alterations of relative sea-level (RSL) are pervasive drivers of change that reflect the interaction between tidal inundation regimes and ground surface elevation. Although many studies have investigated sediment accretion within VCEs, relatively few have addressed spatiotemporal patterns of resilience in response to RSL change. In this study, we used high resolution elevation models and field surveys to identify RSL changes and socio-ecological responses in a tidal lagoon system following earthquakes in New Zealand. We expected that vegetation changes would result from RSL effects caused by surface-elevation changes in intertidal zones. Elevation measurements showed a sequence of vertical displacements resulting from major earthquakes in 2011 and 2012, and additional surface-elevation loss since. VCE losses were recorded over an 8 year period post-2011 in response to high rates of RSL rise (up to 41 mm yr(-1)). Anthropogenic factors influenced the pattern of losses and illustrate opportunities for managing risks to other VCEs facing RSL rise. Four key principles for building VCE resilience were identified: i) anthropogenic encroachment results in resilience loss due to the need for landward migration when changes exceed the tolerance thresholds of VCEs at their lower elevational limits; ii) connectivity losses exacerbate encroachment effects, and conversely, are a practical focus for management; iii) landscape-scale risk exposure is disproportionately influenced by the largest wetland remnants illustrating the importance of site-specific vulnerabilities and their assessment; and iv) establishing new protected areas to accommodate the movement of VCEs is needed, and requires a combination of land tenure rearrangements and connectivity conservation. Embracing these concepts offers promise for improving whole-system resilience to help address the challenge of global climate change. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Efficient and safe movement is fundamental for wild birds to thrive in their environments. For arboreal forest animals, especially birds, canopy cover has a large impact on birds' daily movements and is a crucial component of conservation strategies seeking to retain avian population in disturbed or urban habitats. Methods We translocated woodland bird species utilizing different forest strata during two non-breeding seasons in Gainesville, FL, USA. We used linear model and generalized linear model to examine the effects of canopy cover and species identity on homing success and speed. Results Among our study species of Tufted Titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), Carolina Chickadee (Poecile carolinensis), and Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), we found that Carolina Chickadees and Tufted Titmice were more likely to return than Northern Cardinals. Among birds that successfully returned, homing speed is significantly affected by forest canopy cover and species identity (titmice had higher homing speed than cardinals). Birds return much faster in landscape with higher canopy cover. Conclusions This study presented evidence of species identity's effect on homing success and speed in common feeder bird species in Southeast US and provided further evidence that bird movements in the suburban land cover are constrained by low canopy cover.

AB  - Aim To investigate the association between hummingbird-plant network structure and species richness, phylogenetic signal on species' interaction pattern, insularity and historical and current climate.
   Location Fifty-four communities along a c. 10,000 km latitudinal gradient across the Americas (39 degrees N-32 degrees S), ranging from sea level to c. 3700 m a.s.l., located on the mainland and on islands and covering a wide range of climate regimes.
   Methods We measured the level of specialization and modularity in mutualistic plant-hummingbird interaction networks. Using an ordinary least squares multimodel approach, we examined the influence of species richness, phylogenetic signal, insularity and current and historical climate conditions on network structure (null-model-corrected specialization and modularity).
   Results Phylogenetically related species, especially plants, showed a tendency to interact with a similar array of mutualistic partners. The spatial variation in network structure exhibited a constant association with species phylogeny (R-2 = 0.18-0.19); however, network structure showed the strongest association with species richness and environmental factors (R-2 = 0.20-0.44 and R-2 = 0.32-0.45, respectively). Specifically, higher levels of specialization and modularity were associated with species-rich communities and communities in which closely related hummingbirds visited distinct sets of flowering species. On the mainland, specialization was also associated with warmer temperatures and greater historical temperature stability.
   Main conclusions Our results confirm the results of previous macroecological studies of interaction networks which have highlighted the importance of species richness and the environment in determining network structure. Additionally, for the first time, we report an association between network structure and species phylogenetic signal at a macroecological scale, indicating that high specialization and modularity are associated with high interspecific competition among closely related hummingbirds, subdividing the floral niche. This suggests a tighter co-evolutionary association between hummingbirds and their plants than in previously studied plant-bird mutualistic systems.

AB  - Five large (greater than 35 ha) urban bushland reserves in Greater Sydney were selected where herpetofaunal assemblages could be deduced and there were recent herpetofauna surveys. Four reserves (Rockdale Wetlands Corridor, Wolli Creek Valley, Burnt Bridge Creek Corridor and Middle Harbour Bushland Reserves) had been surrounded by residential development for more than 50 years. The fifth (University of Western Sydney, Richmond campus) was surrounded by agricultural and peri-urban development. Records from the scientific literature, local natural history groups, amateur herpetologists and council archives were used to gather historic information on the frogs and reptiles. Interviews were also conducted with researchers and neighbours of the reserves. Eight extant species were common to all reserves while another, predicted to be in all reserves, was universally absent. Despite the relatively large size of these bushland remnants, in all reserves the number of reptile and frog species had declined since urbanisation. The largest losses occurred in the four urban reserves. Seven species predicted to have occurred historically were now only present in the peri-urban site. Some herpetofaunal groups were more vulnerable than others. Goannas were locally extinct in urban reserves. Tree frogs and geckos were depleted while ground frogs and skinks were reduced to approximately half their original species numbers. This is in contrast to the peri-urban site where there had been no loss of tree frogs or goannas and generally more than half of the species in each group were extant. Urban impacts that appeared to relate to herpetofauna decline were direct human intervention that resulted in death or removal of individuals (e.g. goannas, large snakes), interference with habitat such as bush rock removal (e.g. smaller snakes, geckoes, skinks), fire (e.g. non-burrowing small residents), interference with the water cycle including infilling and pollution (e.g. frogs) and exotic predators (e.g. dragons, turtles, skinks). In general, herpetofauna with the least future prospects were those most susceptible to decline.These included the large, conspicuous fauna that required a substantial home range, attracted the attention of humans because of 'pet appeal' or due to their perceived danger; were vulnerable at some stage of the lifecycle to predation by feral species; and had specific habitat requirements for reproduction such as quality water or open sandy banks for egg incubation. Those that are small, generalist and unappealing to humans are most likely to survive. There is, therefore, little doubt that diversity in reserves will continue to dwindle unless strategies are devised to overcome the present trend. Current conservation strategies that generally target single species need to be expanded to ecosystem level to monitor threats and management implemented for their removal.

AB  - Effective conservation planning requires an understanding of species-habitat relationships across a diverse array of taxa, yet many studies typically focus on conspicuous fauna. Using systematic acoustic surveys, we examine the response of insectivorous bat species to urbanization and quantify species-habitat relationships to classify species in terms of their tolerance or sensitivity. Surveys were conducted in Sydney. Australia, during spring-summer of 2008 in 29 defined 25 km(2) landscapes, across various land uses. We quantified bat-habitat relationships using local and landscape scale variables. We recorded 17 taxa across the urban gradient, with substantial variation in the tolerance and sensitivity of each species. The density of houses, landscape geology, the amount of bushland (ha) exclusively on fertile geologies and moth biomass were the most frequent predictors of individual activity, explaining more than 60% of variation in activity for some species. Importantly, the area of bushland on poorer soils was not a good predictor, highlighting the need for caution when interpreting results of large scale studies which do not account for variations in habitat productivity. Species-specific differences existed, although the majority of the assemblage was considered to be urban-sensitive. Many of these sensitive species were most active in fertile suburban habitats, with an average of 12-28% bushland cover within 5 km. Our study demonstrates the necessity to elucidate species-specific habitat relationships, and suggests bats would benefit from the conservation of productive suburban bushland remnants and riparian habitats, while improving connectivity to these areas via the maintenance of tree cover across the matrix.

AB  - constitute one of the richest and most endangered groups in Mexico; however, their diversity and threat factors at the regional level remain little known in many parts of the country, including in protected areas. We analyzed amphibian diversity of the Ejido Tierra y Libertad, Municipality of Jiquipilas, Chiapas, Mexico, 40% of which occurs within the La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve (Reserva de la Biosfera La Sepultura, or REBISE). We conducted fieldwork from January 2016 to April 2020, including 980 person-hours of systematic sampling across 11 transects spanning different habitat types. We documented 20 amphibian species, including the first record of the Yellowbelly Mushroomtongue Salamander (Bolitoglossa flaviventris) for the REBISE. Seven of these amphibian species are included in some risk category: three in the NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010 of the Mexican federal government, two in the Red List of Threatened Species of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and two categorized in both. The Common Leaf-litter Frog (Craugastor loki) was the most abundant species, and together with four other anuran species, constituted 82.1% of the total abundance observed. Inter-transect faunal similarity was generally associated with proximity, forest corridor connectivity, and the presence of water. Conserved Semi-Deciduous Forest had the highest alpha diversity, but somewhat surprisingly, urban and some disturbed habitats had the highest species richness. Pasture was the least rich and diverse habitat, however, so we discuss the consequences of ongoing expansion of pastures on amphibian populations. We propose conservation measures intended to promote both amphibian diversity and human health.

AB  - Ecosystem restoration is the practice of assisting recovery in degraded ecological communities. The aims of restoration are typically broad, involving the reinstatement of composition, structure, function, and resilience to disturbances. One common restoration tactic in degraded urban systems is to control invasive species, relying on passive restoration for further ecosystem-level recovery. Here, we test whether this is an effective restoration strategy in Garry oak savanna, a highly threatened and ecologically important community in the North American Pacific Northwest. In urban savanna patches surrounding Victoria, British Columbia, community members have been actively removing aggressive invasive exotic species for over a decade. Based on vegetation surveys from 2007, we tested ecosystem changes in structure, composition, and resilience (i.e., functional redundancy and response diversity) across 10 years of varied management levels. We expected higher levels of invasive species management would correspond with improvements to these ecosystem metrics. However, management explained little of the patterns found over the 10-year-period. Woody encroachment was a complicated process of native and exotic invasion, while resilience and compositional changes were most closely tied with landscape connectivity. Thus, though invasive species management may prevent further degradation, active restoration strategies after removal are likely required for recovery of the ecosystem.

AB  - The study presents results of habitat creation and riparian vegetation recovery in artificial oxbow lakes in urbanized area within the large river valley. The investigation of open water, rush and wet meadows flora and vegetation in three ponds located in the city centre of Opole was conducted in years 2001-2013. Oxbow lakes were constructed as a compensation measure and no vegetation was transplanted into the ponds on purpose. 13-years observation showed that (1) the red-listed species are able to spontaneous reoccurrence after habitat restoration, but they can thrive only in first years of oxbow lakes recolonisation process, (2) there are some restoration constraints, especially in relation to Phragmites australis and Nuphar lutea expansion, but alien species invasions were insignificant and (3) the species number and vegetation cover was constantly increasing during the recolonisation process in recreated oxbow lakes. The dynamic of vegetation was considerable, especially in first 6 years of experiment when the significant increase in diversity and richness of native plant species was observed. After that time, the increasing expansion of P. australis and N. lutea was noted causing the decline of several species and vegetation types. So, restoring just the environmental conditions may be sufficient for a limited period of time only. Strong disturbances, much intense that moderate inundations, imitating disastrous flooding within the valley each 10-13 years are need to maintain the ecological niches for river corridor and riparian species.

AB  - This study describes the first attempt in the world to use timber poles to Provide habitat connectivity for a gliding mammal. The Australian squirrel glider Petaurus norfolcensis is a small tree-dependent gliding marsupial whose habitat is characterized by ongoing fragmentation. We installed five 12 m-high poles across a 70 m gap that had existed between two woodland remnants for over 45 years. Our aims were to determine whether animals were able to use the poles for gliding and to travel between the remnants. We released 22 animals onto the poles at night. All animals readily climbed and glided from the poles. Five individuals successfully glided pole-to-pole on initial release. Squirrel gliders were captured in both remnants only after pole erection and two were trapped on poles. One radio-collared individual was observed gliding pole-to-pole to reach the non-home remnant where it foraged on two separate nights. Petaurus hair was detected oil several poles by hair-sampling devices in four separate periods Lip to 12 months after radio-tracking and trapping had ceased. Our observations suggest that wooden poles may assist gliding mammals to traverse open areas between habitat patches and have the potential to be used as a rapid technique to reconnect severed habitat.

AB  - The extent to which the 'fragmented' properties of a landscape have actually been caused by anthropogenic fragmentation is often unknown. We can, however, understand links between spatial patterns of habitat in the current landscape and the biota. Built seawalls in Sydney Harbour, Australia, appear to fragment the natural, intertidal habitat. Rocky shores naturally occur, however, in a landscape of 'fragments', i.e. as patches of natural habitat separated by other natural habitats. To examine the extent to which fragmentation, i.e. due to human disturbance, has affected biota, we compared assemblages in these naturally patchy habitats to those in 'fragmented' habitats. Rocky shores were smaller and further apart from one another when surrounded by artificial habitat (called 'complete fragments') than when surrounded by other natural habitats (called 'natural patches'). This pattern matches the physical properties of 'fragmented landscapes'. We therefore tested whether patterns of diversity of biota in complete fragments, in mixed fragments (with one side adjacent to natural habitat and the other to artificial habitat) and in natural patches can be predicted from current models about the effects of the process of fragmentation. The number of taxa, number of unique taxa and variability in the number of taxa were all greater in natural patches than in mixed and complete fragments, although not all analyses were statistically significant. The current study supports notions that the composition and configuration of 'seascapes' is more important to the ecology of many marine organisms than previously thought.

AB  - Context. Animals' use of space and habitat selection emerges from their movement patterns, which are, in turn, determined by their behavioural or physiological states and extrinsic factors.
   Aim. The aims of the present study were to investigate animal movement and incorporate the movement patterns into habitat selection analyses using Global Positioning System (GPS) location data from 16 black bears (Ursus americanus) in a fragmented area of Florida, USA.
   Methods. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) were used to discern the movement patterns of the bears. These results were then used in step-selection functions (SSFs) to evaluate habitat selection patterns and the factors influencing these patterns.
   Key results. HMMs revealed that black bear movement patterns are best described by three behavioural states: (1) resting (very short step-lengths and large turning angles); (2) encamped (moderate step-lengths and large turning angles); and (3) exploratory (long step-lengths and small turning angles). Bears selected for forested wetlands and marsh wetlands more than any other land cover type, and generally avoided urban areas in all seasons and when in encamped and exploratory behavioural states. Bears also chose to move to locations farther away from major roads.
   Conclusions. Because habitat selection is influenced by how animals move within landscapes, it is essential to consider animals' movement patterns when making inferences about habitat selection. The present study achieves this goal by using HMMs to first discern black bear movement patterns and associated parameters, and by using these results in SSFs to investigate habitat selection patterns. Thus, the methodological framework developed in this study effectively incorporates state-specific movement patterns while making inferences regarding habitat selection. The unified methodological approach employed here will contribute to an improved understanding of animal ecology as well as informed management decisions.
   Implications. Conservation plans focused on preserving forested wetlands would benefit bears by not only providing habitat for resting and foraging, but also by providing connectivity through fragmented landscapes. Additionally, the framework could be applied to species that follow annual cycles and may provide a tool for investigating how animals are using dispersal corridors.

AB  - The Atlantic Rain Forest, an important biodiversity hot spot, has faced severe habitat loss since the last century which has resulted in a highly fragmented landscape with a large number of small forest patches (<100 ha). For conservation planning it is essential to understand how current and future forest regeneration depends on ecological processes, fragment size and the connection to the regional seed pool. We have investigated the following questions by applying the forest growth simulation model FORMIND to the situation of the Atlantic Forest in the state of Sao Paulo, SE Brazil: (1) which set of parameters describing the local regeneration and level of density regulation can reproduce the biomass distribution and stem density of an old growth forest in a reserve? (2) Which additional processes apart from those describing the dynamics of an old growth forest, drive forest succession of small isolated fragments? (3) Which role does external seed input play during succession? Therefore, more than 300 tree species have been classified into nine plant functional types (PFTs), which are characterized by maximum potential height and shade tolerance. We differentiate between two seed dispersal modes: (i) local dispersal, i.e. all seedlings originated from fertile trees within the simulated area and (ii) external seed rain. Local seed dispersal has been parameterized following the pattern oriented approach, using biomass estimates of old growth forest. We have found that moderate density regulation is essential to achieve coexistence for a broad range of regeneration parameters. Considering the expected uncertainty and variability in the regeneration processes it is important that the forest dynamics are robust to variations in the regeneration parameters. Furthermore, edge effects such as increased mortality at the border and external seed rain have been necessary to reproduce the patterns for small isolated fragments. Overall, simulated biomass is much lower in the fragments compared to the continuous forest, whereas shade tolerant species are affected most strongly by fragmentation. Our simulations can supplement empirical studies by extrapolating local knowledge on edge effects of fragments to larger temporal and spatial scales. In particular our results show the importance of external seed rain and therefore highlight the importance of structural connectivity between regenerating fragments and mature forest stands.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the shrubby tree component in riparian corridors in restoration process and natural remainders in a matrix forestry. We identified the richness, diversity, dispersal and pollination syndromes of the individuals and estimate the floristic similarity. The study was conducted at the producing farm of Pinus spp. wood Santa Alice, located in Rio Negrinho city, Santa Catarina state, Brazil. We adopted the center-quarter method for survey the shrubby tree component in four sample groups: CA (advanced stage of riparian corridors vegetation), CR (riparian corridors in restoration), MA (advanced stage of natural remaining), MI (intermediate stage of natural remaining). We found the highest richness and diversity index in MA and CR. Regarding the number of individuals, the dispersal and pollination syndromes predominant in all sample groups were zoochory and zoophilia. CR and CA had the highest percentage of floristic similarity while MA and MI did not form clusters. The sample group CR has composition, richness and diversity more similar to CA. This indicates that the restoration of riparian zones has conditions to rescue the components and the interactions of an ecological community.

AB  - Negative effects of habitat fragmentation are thought to be diminished when habitat patches are joined by a corridor. A key assumption is that corridors facilitate exchange rates of organisms between otherwise isolated patches. If the organisms are pollinators, corridors may be important for maintaining genetically viable populations of the plants that they pollinate. We tested the hypothesis that corridors increase the movement of insect pollinators into patches of habitat and thereby increase pollen transfer for two species of plants, one pollinated by butterflies (Lantana camara) and the other by bees and wasps (Rudbeckia hirta). We worked in an experimental landscape consisting of 40 >= 1-ha patches of early-successional habitat in a matrix of forest. Within each of eight experimental units, two patches were connected by a corridor (150 x 25 m), and three were not. Patch shape varied to control for the area added by the presence of a corridor. Differences in patch shape also allowed us to test alternative hypotheses of how corridors might function. The Traditional Corridor Hypothesis posits that corridors increase immigration and emigration by functioning as movement conduits between patches. The Drift Fence Hypothesis posits that corridors function by "capturing" organisms dispersing through the matrix, redirecting them into associated habitat patches. Using fluorescent powder to track pollen, we found that pollen transfer by butterflies between patches connected by a corridor was significantly higher than between unconnected patches (all values mean +/- 1 SE: 59% +/- 9.2% vs. 25% +/- 5.2% of flowers receiving pollen). Likewise, pollen transfer by bees and wasps was significantly higher between connected patches than between unconnected patches (30% +/- 4.2% vs. 14.5% +/- 2.2%). These results support the Traditional Corridor Hypothesis. There was little support, however, for the Drift Fence Hypothesis. To generalize our results to a larger scale, we measured the probability of pollen transfer by butterflies as a function of distance along a 2000 x 75 m corridor. Pollen transfer probability exponentially declined with respect to distance and successfully predicted pollen transfer probability on the scale of our previous experiment. These results suggest that corridors facilitate pollen transfer in fragmented landscapes.

AB  - 1. The conservation of insects is not a priority for most urban dwellers, yet can be accomplished in urban settings by the careful design of urban nature. Our goal is to foster cross-talk between practitioners of insect conservation biology who develop the knowledge base and professional design practitioners who are poised to apply this knowledge in designs and management plans for urban green space. The collaborative product promises a built environment that promotes human well-being and urban beauty while maximizing the potential for the conservation of insects.
   2. There is precedence for collaboration between science and design communities to achieve conservation, and existing professional and civic organizations offer a structure to formalize and expand collaboration. Design professionals, particularly landscape architects, are trained to support insect conservation in the urban landscape through land planning and ecological site design.
   3. Ecological site design is based in principles of sustainability and so must address the well being of humans and nature simultaneously. This powerful approach for insect conservation is illustrated in examples from around the world focusing on roadway-easement corridors, stormwater management areas, and greenroofs.
   4. To improve insect conservation and its public support we offer recommendations, organized in response to cultural aspects of sustainability. Considerations include: a) social drivers for support of conservation practices, b) public perception of urban space, c) applying conservation biology principles in urban areas, and d) merging insect conservation goals with human cultural demands.

AB  - Urbanization results in a suite of harmful effects to streams, including removal or degradation of riparian vegetation. Many stream-restoration programs address this by adding plants, with limited quantitative knowledge about vegetation dynamics already occurring within the stream corridor. This project examined natural plant establishment along an urbanized stream channel in Syracuse, NY. It had three objectives: first, to relate plant establishment along an urban stream gradient to substrate condition; second, to quantify seeds dormant in the soil at those same sites; and third, to indicate what passive revegetation responses might occur to various treatments along a rural-to-urban gradient. Three sites were selected along such a gradient on Onondaga Creek, near Syracuse, NY. Vegetation plots were established at each site to assess plant germination and establishment under substrate conditions designed to mimic restoration interventions. We also conducted a seedbank study using soil cores collected from these sites. Plant communities were dominated by grasses and forbs. Numbers of alien species increased from 34% at more rural sites to 51% at more urban sites. Seedlings of native riparian trees nonetheless germinated at all three sites along the gradient. Recruitment of native riparian trees (especially Populus deltoides [Eastern Cottonwood], Fraxinus pennsylvanica [Green Ash], and Acer negundo [Boxelder]) exceeded non-native and invasive ones. The riparian seedbank showed disproportionate dominance by herbaceous plants (95.5% of individuals) at all locations surveyed, and invasive species were common (about 25% of all germinants). This study shows some potential for natural regeneration of native trees, but also found a significant source of invasive plants in the soil seedbank that could reduce restoration success. Notably, the study recorded the presence of 16 bryophyte taxa, and the common ones were those typically associated with disturbances.

AB  - Conservation seeks ultimately to protect and maintain biodiversity indefinitely. Most biodiversity features targeted in past conservation planning have been largely aspects of ecological and biogeographical pattern rather than process. However, the persistence of biodiversity can only be ensured through consideration of the ecological and evolutionary processes that underpin biodiversity, as well as its present spatial pattern. This paper identifies spatial surrogates of ecological and evolutionary processes for regional conservation planning in one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, the Cape Floristic Region. We identified six types of spatial components (namely edaphic interfaces, upland-lowland interfaces, sand movement corridors, riverine corridors, upland-lowland gradients and macroclimatic gradients) as surrogates for key processes such as ecological and geographical diversification, and species migration. Spatial components were identified in a GIS using published data and expert knowledge. Options for achieving targets for process components have been seriously compromised by habitat transformation. Between 30 and 75% of the original extent of the spatial components currently remain functional. Options for achieving upland-lowland and macroclimatic gradients are very limited in the lowlands where most of the habitat has been transformed by agriculture. We recommend that future studies place their research on ecological and evolutionary processes in a spatially explicit framework. Areas maintaining adaptive diversification (e.g. environmental gradients, ecotones) or containing historically isolated populations should be identified and protected. The spatial dimensions of eco-logical processes such as drought and fire refugia also need to be determined and such insights incorporated in conservation planning. Finally, connectivity within these areas should be ensured to maintain species migration and gene flow.

AB  - Bobcats (Lynx rufus) are valuable indicators of connectivity in the highly fragmented landscape of coastal Southern California, yet their population sizes and densities are largely unknown. Using noninvasive scat sampling in It capture-recapture framework, we estimated population sizes for 2 similar areas of natural habitat with differing levels of isolation by human development in Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, California. We used scat transects with geographic information system land-use layers and home-range sizes of bobcats to estimate effective sampling area and Population densities. Estimates of population size in the study area connected to I much larger habitat area (26-31 individuals) were similar to estimates for the area that was completely surrounded by development (25-28 individuals). Bobcat densities for the 2 Study areas also were similar (ranging from 0.25 to 0.42 bobcat/km(2)) and likely represent recent population declines because of notoedric mange likely interacting with toxicants. These methods proved effective despite particularly low densities of bobcats and may be especially useful when Study areas are geographically isolated, reducing the uncertainty in size of the sampling area.

AB  - Understanding how jaguars (Panthera onca) adapt to disturbed landscapes, especially urbanized areas, can help us prevent adverse situations, thus reducing conflict, and perhaps even achieve coexistence with these predators. Playa del Carmen, a city located in the middle of a natural corridor linking two jaguar conservation units (JCUs; Sian Ka'an and Yum Balam), is facing intense pressure from tourism-related city growth. From January 2013 to March 2014, we tracked an adult male jaguar using a satellite collar and found that the presence of the Playa del Carmen landfill had a clear influence on a male jaguar's home range and movements. We observed that this particular jaguar had the smallest seasonal home range and core areas reported in the literature (particularly during the dry season in 2013, where the home range was only 16.22 km(2) and the core area was 2.5 km(2)) and also that the seasonal core areas overlapped with the area covered by the landfill (with a number of important locations within the landfill). Our results showed that male jaguars are surviving in areas previously not considered as jaguar habitat and are taking advantage of the human resources within. We hope that these results encourage more jaguar studies to be carried out in areas disturbed by human activities.

TI  - APPARENT AVIAN EXTINCTIONS FROM ISLANDS IN A MAN-MADE LAKE, SOUTH-AFRICA
T2  - OSTRICH
LA  - English
AB  - We surveyed avian diversity and abundance on islands in a 16 year old man-made lake in southern Africa. The vegetation was semi-arid shrubland and grassland. We compared species lists on islands with matched sites on the surrounding mainland. We recorded a total of only 19 species on islands, 25 on islands connected by landbridges to the mainland and 32 species on the mainland. Islands had significantly fewer species than their mainland pairs but the difference was unrelated to island size. Three species (Fairy Flycatcher Stenostira scita, Redeyed Bulbul Pycnonotus nigricans, and Namaqua Dove Oena capensis) were common in mainland censuses but absent on islands. These species are insectivorous, frugivorous and granivorous respectively. Two species, Cape Sparrow Passer melanurus and Mountain Chat Oenanthe monticola, were more common on islands than mainland sites. Larger species and those with patchy mainland distributions were most prone to extinction on islands. This study shows that habitat fragmentation can cause rapid species loss, even in vagile groups such as birds. It points to the importance of recolonisation ability for predicting minimum viable areas. The persistence of species in habitat fragments may depend critically on corridors over which birds are willing to fly.

AB  - This study presents a graph-theoretical modelling approach using daily movements and habitat demands of different target bird species in an urban context to assess: 1) habitable land cover types, 2) threshold distances between patches of habitat, 3) the required minimum accessible habitat areas and 4) the effects of barriers and stepping stones. The modelling approach is tested using empirical data from field surveys in the urban area of Stockholm, Sweden.
   The results show that groups of small habitat patches can house the same species as larger contiguous patches as long as they are perceived as functionally connected by the inhabitant organisms. Furthermore, we found that binary habitat/non-habitat representations of the landscape could roughly explain the variation in species occurrence, as long as habitat was properly defined. However, the explanatory power of the landscape models increased when features of matrix heterogeneity such as stepping stones and barriers were accounted for.
   Synthesis and application: in a world where forest ecosystems are becoming increasingly fragmented there is an urgent need to find comprehensive and scientifically relevant methods for managing and planning ecosystems. This study shows that: 1) groups of well placed small habitat patches can, together, be sufficient to attract birds in intensively developed areas, 2) the presented modelling approach can help identify such groups of patches, 3) matrix heterogeneity should preferably be accounted for, and 4) proper assessments of habitable land cover types are important. Finally, we argue that the modelling approach applied here may substantially improve landscape management and planning at scales ranging from whole landscapes down to neighbourhoods.

AB  - We report on efforts to conduct an ecoregion-scale assessment of biological resources in the forests and woodlands of southern California. Key ecological questions under consideration are: How important are undeveloped habitat corridors between southern California mountain ranges? Is there adequate habitat on public lands for species dependent on oak woodlands? What are the long-term, ecological ramifications of current fire management policies? What are the ecological effects of existing and projected future levels of resource utilization and recreation use on public lands? We describe a four-step approach to addressing these questions: (1) compile and integrate spatial data on landscape patterns; (2) determine temporal trends in landscape change based on the influence of ecological processes and human land use; (3) identify local species/habitat relationships; and (4) use spatially explicit models to simulate and predict the effects of landscape change on the distribution and abundance of plant and animal populations.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation affects a wide variety of biological variables including species' abundance and richness (population demography), phenology, male and female reproductive fitness, and it also affects the degree of specialization versus generalization of pollination networks. Evidence is accumulating that suggests that habitat fragmentation can have significant impacts on plant-pollinator interactions. In this article, we review the literature on habitat fragmentation effects on plants, pollinators, and the pollination network. We also discuss pollination network mechanisms that may be affected by habitat fragmentation. Habitat fragmentation isolates populations and affects ecological properties at both population and community levels. Evidence shows that habitat size and connectivity directly or indirectly influence the abundance of both plant and pollinator species. In general, plant and pollinator diversity and population size decrease with the decreasing size and habitat connectivity. Habitat fragmentation of plant communities can shift plant phenological patterns, contract flowering periods and increase the risk of local pollinator extirpation. Fragmentation has the potential to influence pollination dynamics by altering pollinator or plant densities and by altering pollinator behavior. However, evidence for the impact of habitat fragmentation on plant species' flowering phenology is relatively limited, and little is known about the effect of habitat fragmentation on the phenology of pollinators. Habitat fragmentation also leads to reduced reproduction in many species. In contrast, other species showed neutral or positive responses to habitat fragmentation in female reproductive fitness, especially in plants regularly affected by pollen limitation and pollination limitation which lead to plants' experience selection for increased autogamy in isolated habitats. Habitat fragmentation often leads to the extirpation of specialist species and results in an influx of generalists. However, studies have shown that pollinators tend to be more generalized as habitat fragmentation increases. The reason is that habitat fragmentation changes the composition of the flora, and scatters floral resources, so any remaining pollinators may need to behave as generalists in order to survive. However, the knowledge of potential ecological consequences of habitat fragmentation is limited, especially regarding the effects on a long-term scale and at landscape scales. We propose experiments involving long-term monitoring, permanent samples of flowering plants, pollinators, and their interactions at large spatial and temporal scales.

AB  - Understanding patterns of genetic structure is fundamental for developing successful management programmes for deme-structured organisms, such as amphibians. We used five microsatellite loci and DNA sequences of the mitochondrial control region to assess the relative influences of landscape (geographic distance, altitude and rivers as corridors for dispersal) and historical factors on patterns of gene flow in populations of the toad Bufo bufo in Central Spain. We sampled 175 individuals from eight populations distributed along two major river drainages and used maximum-likelihood and Bayesian approaches to infer patterns of gene flow and population structure. The mitochondrial DNA data show closely-related haplotypes distributed across the Iberian Peninsula with no geographic structuring, suggesting recent differentiation of haplotypes and extensive gene flow between populations. On the other hand, microsatellites provide finer resolution, showing that high altitude populations (> 2000 m) exchange lower numbers of migrants with other populations. The results of Bayesian estimates for recent migration rates in high altitude populations suggest source-sink dynamics between ponds that are consistent with independent data from monitoring over the past 20 years.

AB  - In much of the United States and elsewhere, urbanization continues to transform landscapes. In central Texas, anthropogenic conversion of land is due in part to a rapidly growing population in the Austin and San Antonio metro areas and the subsequent infrastructure and resources needed to support that growth. Protected natural areas adjacent to urbanized landscapes are often intended to mitigate the impact of land development by serving as wildlife habitat. To maximize the potential of this habitat, we must assess how urbanization influences the occurrence of species in these natural areas (e.g., parks, greenspaces, preserves). We used motion -activated cameras to survey 72 sites (points) across six different regions throughout the urban corridor from San Antonio to Austin. Using occupancy modeling, we examined the influence of ten different urbanization factors (model covariates) on the occurrence of a variety of medium-sized mammal species. Generalist species, such as raccoons and opossums, had an increased probability of occurrence at sites with greater urban influence and were most likely to occur in smaller more urbanized study areas. Ringtails and grey foxes appeared to be unaffected by urbanization and were equally likely to occur across all sites. None of the other examined species were found to have a conclusively positive or negative response to urbanization. Knowledge of the effect of urbanization on wildlife will be important in evaluating current preserves as well as planning future preserves. Our study suggests that natural areas within urbanizing landscapes can be effective in providing habitat for some wildlife species. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite the negative impacts of urbanisation, some species adapt to pressures of habitat loss and fragmentation. Trumpeter Hornbills Bycanistes bucinator are a large avian forest frugivore that uses urban environments in South Africa. Consequently, we used GPS/UHF transmitters to study their home range size, movement and habitat use in an urban-forest mosaic in Eshowe, South Africa from March to October 2014. We estimated the home range size using three methods: minimum convex polygon (MCP), kernel density estimation (KDE) and local convex hull (LoCoH). Our results showed that overall monthly home range size was 5.1 +/- 1.28 km(2) (mean +/- SE; 95% MCP), 4.6 +/- 1.14 km(2) (95% KDE) and 1.9 +/- 0. 46 km(2) (95% LoCoH). However, individual home range sizes varied monthly and seasonally. We found that all individuals tagged used mostly the indigenous forest and frequently utilised urban residential areas (gardens) with little or no use of cultivated land. Observed individual variations in monthly and seasonal home ranges could be a response to variations in availability of key fruit resources in the urban residential and indigenous forest mosaic. This study supports the use of more than one method of home range estimation for insight regarding home range and habitat use in urban-forest mosaics for this large forest frugivore.

AB  - The present research was conducted to assess the anthropogenic impacts on avian diversity around the river Chenab, Pakistan. The avian diversity was recorded on different landscapes along the river Chenab, that is, forest, agricultural, rural, and urban habitats. The data on diversity and distribution of various avian species were collected through linear count along with direct count methods viz. personal observations and sound records and indirect count methods viz. presences of carcasses and meeting with local communities. The habitat preferences of birds varied significantly. A decline in avian diversity was observed from forest habitat to urban landscapes. One year of bird surveys compiled a total of 150 species from all habitats along the river Chenab. Computed statistical data show that Shannon's index provides a quantitative report of diversity which was highest at forest habitat (4.261) followed by rural forest habitat (3.746), agrierural habitat (3.746), agriculture habitat (3.623), WLH (2.723), urban vegetative habitat (3.215), and very least at urban nonvegetative habitat (2.247). It can be concluded from the present study that many of the avian species have specific habitats and also noted that corridors and connections among different landscapes are important for the conservation of avian diversity.

AB  - The cumulative movements of large mammals are expressed in many areas as semi-permanent wildlife trails. The mapping of semi-permanent trail networks offers a direct approach to assess habitat selection of high-use movement routes at relatively fine spatial scales across a landscape. Here we examine an ungulate trail network in north-central Utah created and maintained by the repeated movements of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and elk (Cervus elaphus). In a resource selection analysis using multivariable spatial regression analysis, we show that at a spatial scale of 70 in open and low cover and distance to water are important predictors of movement pathway density. We also demonstrate at a scale of 10 m that elk and deer movement pathways are less steep than adjacent terrain. The mapping of trail networks should be a particularly useful technique for examining functional connectivity among resource patches across a landscape and identifying important high-use movement routes.

AB  - We examined the efficacy of a mitigation project in Avra Valley Arizona, established to provide wildlife access across the barrier created by a canal, the Central Arizona Project (CAP). We monitored movements of 17 radio-collared desert mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus eremicus) to determine if deer were using the corridor for access across the canal and the 26-km wide valley We also determined frequency of corridor use by desert mule deer relative to surrounding lands. Four deer crossed the canal but stayed within 500 m of the crossing site. One deer traversed the valley via the corridor. Two of these deer used crossing areas not in the designated corridor. Overall, 22.4% of deer locations were in the corridor. The corridor currently serves as a link with other undeveloped lands to provide movement for animals seeking to cross Avra Valley, but some lands outside the corridor are scheduled for development for agriculture. With increasing pressures from an urban population, the corridor may prove to be of greater value in the future.

AB  - Increased economic growth, urbanisation and substantial rise in automobile vehicles has contributed towards the elevated levels of air pollution in major cities in Pakistan. Aone week study was conducted by using passive samplers to assess NO2 concentration in occupational built environments at two most congested and populated sites of Lahore. Both sites were locatedon the busy roads of Lahore. At Site-I the highest concentration was in outdoors followed by corridor and indoor. While at Site II all the sampling location wereindoors and level were comparable to that of outdoor levelsat Site I. The results suggest the likely contribution of ambient sources in exposure to indoor NO2 in educational and other occupational built environments in urban centres.

AB  - Channel evolution models (CEMs) are used to structure the interpretation of observed channel morphology to support long-term restoration of these systems. However, channels reflect the variety of their watersheds' climatological, ecological and physiographic contexts, and so no single CEM can be truly global'. Unrecognised differences between the assumptions and the reality of evolutionary trajectories of particular streams can subsequently lead to restoration actions that neither fully achieve their intended objectives nor successfully self-maintain even limited improvements. Despite the daunting variety of biophysical settings, however, urbanisation imposes distinctive, homogenising influences on virtually all watercourses, suggesting that even a relatively small set of evolutionary pathways can embrace much of the diversity of critical watershed drivers on urban channels. CEMs describing single-thread channel response to incision are most common in the published literature, but not every urban disturbance yields this classic sequence, initiated by excess transport capacity followed by incision, bank erosion, widening and ultimately a lowered re-equilibrated channel. A comprehensive urban CEM must also include responses under less common (but locally ubiquitous) conditions, such as excess sediment relative to transport capacity (the inverse' of the classic CEM), imposed constraints on vertical and/or lateral adjustment, and multi-thread channels or those influenced by instream or riparian vegetation. An urban CEM also requires a hierarchical framework that acknowledges fundamental differences in the process drivers within any given watershed, because a single observation of channel form can rarely pinpoint the context or evolutionary trajectory of every stream. We present a geomorphic framework for diagnosing and predicting the evolution of urban streams, potentially guiding the selection of restoration targets that are achievable within an urban context and sustainable without ongoing maintenance.

AB  - The ability of insects to persist in urban greenspace depends on their ability to usefully interact with available plant resources. Greenspace design influences plant-insect interactions by: (1) limiting the plant-species pool available for interaction through plant choice, (2) limiting the insects that are available for interaction through site-occupancy dynamics, and (3) mediating insect preferences based on the context of particular plant-insect interactions through structural barriers, microclimatic changes or competition. We designed an experiment to measure the effect of greenspace design attributes on site occupancy and insect preferences while keeping plant availability constant. Using a set of five functionally distinct flowering plant species ("phytometres"), we used occupancy-detection modelling to test factors affecting probability of visitation for eight groups of pollinating insects (ants, beetles, butterflies, bumblebees, honeybees, small bees, and hoverflies amend other flies) across 102 urban squares in Munich, Germany. We found that the probability of detecting an interaction was low for most functional groups, and situational factors, such as weather or competition from co-occurring flowers, were the primary drivers of visitation. Increasing the proportion of unsealed surfaces and quantity or diversity of flowers on the site had a positive influence on the probability of interaction, and, to a lesser extent, on probability of occupancy. Landscape connectivity and site area were important for only a few groups. Together, our results suggest that small-scale habitat conditions are more important than site context for influencing pollinator visitation. Designers can encourage interaction through contiguous provision of floral resources and unsealed surfaces while limiting internal barriers.

AB  - Linear strips of natural or semi-natural vegetation are a characteristic feature of rural landscapes throughout the world. Their value for the conservation of fauna in heavily modified landscapes depends on the response of species to the linear shape of the habitat, and the pressures this imposes on population processes and spatial organization. In south-eastern Australia, woodland habitats occupied by the squirrel glider Petaurus norfolcensis, a threatened species of arboreal marsupial, have been preferentially cleared for agriculture leaving only remnants within cleared farmland. In this study, the home range of P norfolcensis was investigated by radio-tracking 40 gliders within a highly modified landscape where the majority (83%) of remaining wooded habitat occurs as a network of linear strips along roadsides and streams. Individuals were tracked for one to four seasons, resulting in the collection of 4213 independent locational 'fixes'. All fixes of animals were from remnant woodland. Home ranges were elongated and linear, primarily determined by the shape and arrangement of woodland habitat. Seasonal home ranges were small (mean of 1.4-2.8 ha) and ranged between 320 and 840 m long. Small patches of trees in farmland adjacent to the linear habitats were also extensively used. Despite the highly modified landscape structure, home ranges of P norfolcensis in the linear network were smaller than those estimated from other studies of this species in continuous habitat. The apparent high quality of the linear habitats is attributed to the density of large old trees, which provide foraging and breeding resources, and the productivity of the environment. Linear landscape elements may have a valuable conservation function where they provide resident habitat or enhance landscape connectivity, but their long-term viability is vulnerable to disturbance.

AB  - We studied drivers of habitat conversion in the Panama Canal region, where rich biodiversity in tropical rainforests currently coexists with two major growing cities and a plethora of economic opportunities. We examined existing administrative units (counties) with known biophysical (e.g., rainfall, topography) and socio-economic (e.g., Population density, road density) characteristics. To identify associations between those characteristics and likelihood of habitat conversion to agriculture or urbanization, we used canonical correlation analysis. Two axes accounted for most of the variation among administrative units: one for urbanization and the other for agriculture. Rainfall and topography were negatively associated with urbanization, whereas population wealth was positively associated with land conversion to urban. Agriculture was most strongly associated with elevation variability and topographic complexity. To a lesser extent, agriculture was associated with rural population density, mean annual human population growth and poverty level. We hypothesize that most future habitat loss in the Panama Canal region will be from urbanization as Panama City expands and populations grow along the highway system. Decision-makers will need to emphasize preservation of forests on the edge of developments, where risk of loss is highest. These forested lands tend to become more expensive as urbanization approaches, putting them at greater risk of being converted. Nevertheless, they are still important for protection of the Canal watershed and the high levels of biodiversity in watershed forests. Land planners and decision-makers should consider the influence of socio-economic and biophysical factors when selecting forests to protect for conservation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The spread of the exotic species Hovenia dulcis known as Japanese raisin tree, coming from Asia, detected in a protected area of 465.0 ha surrounding the city of Santa Cruz do Sul, RS, Brazil, named "Green Belt." In this context, this research aimed at developing an aerial monitoring system able to identify and quantify the extension in the Green Belt area that this species invaded, as well as describing the impacts caused on the local forest community. We collected data from an ultralight Flyer GT aircraft equipped with a vertical camera. The images were taking in June and July 2015, when H. dulcis trees have shed their leaves, displaying a gray color, and September and October 2015, when the leaves are young and with a light green color. Based on the methodology proposed trough aerial monitoring by photogrammetry, the results indicated that the total invaded area by H. dulcis in the Green Belt of Santa Cruz do Sul County, RS, was 131.8 ha, corresponding to 20.9% of the total area. To validate this method, a quantitative comparison between the result from a terrestrial fieldwork carried out and the proposed method showed no significant differences in the estimated area occupied by H. dulcis. We concluded that these results validate the proposed aerial assessment method.

AB  - Conserved remnants of indigenous vegetation patches and corridors are regarded as important components of the built environment for the survival of birds. Field research was conducted at Boknes and Cannon Rocks in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa to study habitat use, movement, and dispersal of two Red-necked SpurfowlPternistis afersubpopulations during 2004-2007. Surveys included trapping, marking, releasing, and censusing spurfowl by traversing the study area on a regular basis, as well as fixed point observations. The density of Red-necked Spurfowl varied from 0.66-1 spurfowl ha(-1). The sex ratio for female to male was 1:1.28. The average home range for adult males was 6.3 ha. The results suggest that supplementary feeding does not change the population structure or dispersion, nor does it improve productivity or density. The most determining factor influencing spurfowl populations was the presence of indigenous vegetation patches and continuous corridors of coastal vegetation allowing populational interchange and outright dispersal. Conservation measures are suggested to promote the survival of Red-necked Spurfowl in coastal town biotopes. This includes the removal of free ranging chickensGallus gallus domesticus, which could harbour contagious disease, reduced use of hazardous substances, such as insecticides and herbicides in gardens, and the conservation of well-positioned green patches and corridors.

AB  - Hedgerows are an abundant and ecologically important feature of many rural areas. Their biodiversity value depends on composition, structure and availability of food resources, which can be significantly impacted by poor management. However, information about hedgerow condition is very limited due to field surveys being costly and labour-intensive. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with miniaturized cameras could prove a more cost-effective and time-efficient hedgerow surveying solution while preserving a high level of detail unattainable with airborne or satellite sensors. This study explored whether UAV remote sensing is a viable alternative for performing hedgerow condition surveys at local scale, focusing on hedgerow structure and flowering abundance. We acquired UAV Red, Green and Blue (RGB) and multispectral nadir and oblique imagery of structurally different hedgerows and used them to generate 3D point clouds and models with SfM workflow. Height thresholding allowed extraction of hedgerow extents, with root-mean-square error (RMSE) of height and width ranging from 0.11 to 0.23 m. RGB flower classification showed poor relationship with ground measurements (R-2 = 0.31-0.42) due to confusion with woody material of hedgerows. Inclusion of a near-infrared channel in multispectral imagery significantly improved the relationship (R-2 = 0.68-0.75, RMSE = 10%). Our study shows UAV remote sensing has high potential for performing detailed surveys of hedgerows, providing better characterization of structural variations and distribution of flowers than traditional ground surveys due to larger coverage. More comprehensive understanding of hedgerow, or other vegetated buffer strips, conditions offered by UAV surveys can enable better informed decisions on habitat management and biodiversity conservation in rural areas. Acquisitions over larger areas, potentially integrated with satellite remote sensing, can allow assessment of hedgerow connectivity over farm to landscape scales, contributing to better understanding of the hedgerow network and its role as a wildlife corridor.

AB  - The objective of this paper was to assess the link between premature mortality and a combination of neighbourhood contextual (environmental and health) and compositional (socioeconomic and demographic) characteristics. We statistically and spatially examined six environmental variables (ultrafine particles, carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic pollutants, pollution released to air, tree cover, and walkability index), six health service indicators (number health providers, breast, colorectal and cervical cancer screening uptake rates, student nutrition program uptake rates, and healthy food index), and eight socioeconomic indicators (total income, Gini coefficient, two age categories-below and above 40 years, proportion of females to males, visible minorities, Indigenous peoples, education, less than grade 9) among 140 neighbourhoods of the City of Toronto in Ontario (Canada). We applied principal component analysis to identify patterns and to reduce the number of explanatory variables into combined component axes that represent unique variation in these confounded and overlapping factors. We then applied regression analysis to model the relationship between the indices of enviro-health and socioeconomics and their potential relationship with premature mortality. Residual spatial analysis was used to investigate any remaining spatial structure (such as neighbourhoods with higher residual premature mortality rates). Neighbourhood Equity Index was correlated with our enviro-health and socioeconomic indices. Premature mortality within neighbourhoods was predicted by poor cancer screenings, pollution, lack of tree canopy, increased uptake of student nutrition programs and high walkability index. A negative association between premature mortality and pollution was associated low walkability index and presence of visible minorities within neighbourhoods. There was some unexplained residual spatial variation in our model of premature mortality-especially along the shores of Lake Ontario and in neighbourhoods with major highways or road corridors: premature mortality in Toronto neighbourhoods was higher than expected along highway-corridor neighbourhoods and shorelines. Our analysis revealed a significant relationship between neighbourhood contextual features-both environmental and health-and premature mortality, suggesting that these contextual components of neighbourhoods can predict rates of urban premature mortality in Toronto.

AB  - Changes in land-use practices have affected the integrity and quality of water resources worldwide. In Patagonia there is a strong concern about the ecological status of surface waters because these changes are rapidly occurring in the region. To test the hypothesis that greater intensity of land-use will have negative effects on water quality, stream habitat and biodiversity we assessed benthic macroinvertebrates, riparian/littoral invertebrates, fish and birds from the riparian corridor and environmental variables of 15 rivers (Patagonia) subjected to a gradient of land-use practices (non-managed native forest, managed native forest, pine plantations, pasture, urbanization). A total of 158 macroinvertebrate taxa, 105 riparian/littoral invertebrate taxa, 5 fish species, 34 bird species, and 15 aquatic plant species, were recorded considering all sites. Urban land-use produced the most significant changes in streams including physical features, conductivity, nutrients, habitat condition, riparian quality and invertebrate metrics. Pasture and managed native forest sites appeared in an intermediate situation. The highest values of fish and bird abundance and diversity were observed at disturbed sites; this might be explained by the opportunistic behavior displayed by these communities which let them take advantage of increased trophic resources in these environments. As expected, non-managed native forest sites showed the highest integrity of ecological conditions and also great biodiversity of benthic communities. Macroinvertebrate metrics that reflected good water quality were positively related to forest land cover and negatively related to urban and pasture land cover. However, by offering stream edge areas, pasture sites still supported rich communities of riparian/littoral invertebrates, increasing overall biodiversity. Macroinvertebrates were good indicators of land-use impact and water quality conditions and resulted useful tools to early alert of disturbances in streams. Fish and birds having a greater ability of dispersion and capacity to move quickly from disturbances would reflect changes at a higher scale. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hedychium coronarium is an invasive plant widespread in the Brazilian Atlantic forest, especially in riparian areas. However, its distribution along streams is not continuous and the factors that are related to its local occurrence are unknown. We investigated which natural and anthropogenic drivers, particularly concerning dispersal and disturbance, facilitate establishment of H. coronarium. We sampled 148 randomly chosen riparian sites (each containing two plots) in a subtropical basin in southern Brazil and recorded presence/absence of the plant and some environmental variables in situ; other variables were extracted via GIS software. We performed a GLMM with presence/absence as the response variable, sampling site as a random factor and five predictors: intensity of ecosystem degradation, dominant type of terrestrial vegetation, river substrate size class, Strahler stream order and downstream distance to the nearest urban centre. Our results point out that invader presence is favoured by local human disturbance (high riparian degradation and presence of non-native forest), and possibly dispersal, as there is a higher H. coronarium presence probability in proximity to urban centres. Furthermore, a higher presence probability in downstream sections (higher Strahler order) might be explained by hydrologic dispersal of rhizome fragments. Our study illustrates that in the case of riparian invasions it is important to consider terrestrial and aquatic drivers, both natural and anthropogenic.

AB  - Most river corridors have been highly modified and managed but they still support diverse assemblages of birds. To aid conservation it is important to know which river corridor habitats support the greatest diversity and numbers of bird species. All birds were counted on three occasions in winter along 50 one kin stretches of lowland rivers in eastern England, and habitat variables were recorded. A total of 81 species was recorded. Species richness was greatest on tidal stretches of river, followed by urban/amenity sites, with lowest richness on rural stretches. Mute Swans, Mallards and Moorhens were significantly more numerous at urban/amenity stretches and were scarce or absent in headwater reaches. Three terrestrial species also occurred in significantly greater numbers in urban/amenity stretches. No species was significantly more numerous in rural stretches. TWINSPAN analysis separated out tidal and urban/amenity stretches, while bird species were separated into those associated with riparian trees and shrubs, and those of more open stretches, with further groups associated with wider rivers and the tidal stretches. A CANOCO analysis showed river width to be the most significant factor explaining bird distributions, followed by presence of floodbanks, riparian tree cover and amount of thick marginal vegetation. The rivers studied and their immediate floodplains have long been managed and modified from source and this has an overriding influence on habitat quality and on the species richness and numbers of birds utilizing any particular stretch.

AB  - Grazing exclusion using fences is a key policy being applied by the Chinese government to rehabilitate degraded grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and elsewhere. However, there is a limited understanding of the effects of grazing exclusion on alpine ecosystem functions and services and its impacts on herders' livelihoods. Our meta-analyses and questionnaire-based surveys revealed that grazing exclusion with fences was effective in promoting aboveground vegetation growth for up to four years in degraded alpine meadows and for up to eight years in the alpine steppes of the TP. Longer-term fencing did not bring any ecological and economic benefits. We also found that fencing hindered wildlife movement, increased grazing pressure in unfenced areas, lowered the satisfaction of herders, and rendered substantial financial costs to both regional and national governments. We recommend that traditional free grazing should be encouraged if applicable, short-term fencing (for 4-8 years) should be adopted in severely degraded grasslands, and fencing should be avoided in key wildlife habitat areas, especially the protected large mammal species.

AB  - Despite a large body of literature that reports habitat use in non-urban areas, we lack a fundamental understanding of how American black bears (Ursus americanus; hereafter, black bear) use habitats in the urban-wildland interface in the eastern United States. This lack of information is problematic for bear managers in areas where bear populations are large and adjacent to urban areas. To better understand characteristics of urban-wildland habitat occupied by black bears, we conducted a study to understand habitat use of black bears in 7 urban areas in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. We fit data from 77 individual black bears with Global Positioning System-Global System for Mobile Communications collars during 2010-2012 in Johnstown, State College, and Scranton, Pennsylvania; northwestern New Jersey; and Beckley, Charleston, and Morgantown, West Virginia. We fit resource selection functions using generalized linear mixed models in R with different combinations of study area, human impact (human density and housing density), habitat (distance to roads, patch size), land cover (deciduous forest, evergreen forest, mixed forest, shrubland, grassland, pasture, barren, open-, low-, medium-, and high-intensity development, woody wetlands, and herbaceous wetlands), topographic (elevation and slope), and other variables (year, period of day [night or day], age and sex of the individual bear). Black bears used habitat similarly among study areas and between sexes. Black bears used forested slopes and riparian corridors in the urban-wildland interface. Black bears on the urban-wildland interface selected habitats similarly to wildland bears within the body of literature. Habitat selection was similar for males and females, regardless of study area, time of day, season, or year. Our results indicate that managers can employ the same suite of management tools to reduce human-bear conflicts at the urban-wildland interface that they use to deal with black bear conflicts in wildland areas.

AB  - Increasing evidence of post-divergence gene flow between taxa is shifting our understanding on the mode of speciation. A fundamental question arises concerning the circumstances under which strict allopatric speciation still holds true. Sky island populations might undergo reduced gene flow by niche conservatism to highland habitats and follow divergence in an allopatric manner. In this study, we tested this hypothesis in the sky island Grey-headed Bullfinch (Pyrrhula erythaca) species complex via statistical analyses of both genetic and ecological data. Results of coalescent-based analysis of multiple nuclear loci suggested that P. e. owstoni likely colonized Taiwan island during the severe mid-Pleistocene glacial climate followed by strictly allopatric divergence from P. e. erythaca distributed in Himalayas-Hengduan mountains and central North China. Results of ecological niche modeling suggested that their speciation may be attributed to the niche conservatism of these birds and the lack of a suitable ecological corridor during subsequent milder glacial episodes. In addition, we delimited the traditionally defined P. erythaca into two full species, P. erythaca in the Asian mainland and P. owstoni on the island of Taiwan, based on both genetic and behavioural evidences. These results suggest that ecology can have a dynamic role in allowing highland populations to expand their ranges and isolated by habitat barriers to diversify in a strictly allopatric manner.

AB  - We conducted an analysis of global forest cover to reveal that 70% of remaining forest is within 1 km of the forest's edge, subject to the degrading effects of fragmentation. A synthesis of fragmentation experiments spanning multiple biomes and scales, five continents, and 35 years demonstrates that habitat fragmentation reduces biodiversity by 13 to 75% and impairs key ecosystem functions by decreasing biomass and altering nutrient cycles. Effects are greatest in the smallest and most isolated fragments, and they magnify with the passage of time. These findings indicate an urgent need for conservation and restoration measures to improve landscape connectivity, which will reduce extinction rates and help maintain ecosystem services.

AB  - Studies on elevation gradients in Panama and Costa Rica have shown that leaf-litter ants exhibit a mid-elevation peak in diversity. This diversity pattern has been observed in other groups and regions, but uncertainty remains as to just how pervasive it is and what might explain it. Here we examine the robustness of the mid-elevation peak in ant diversity across the entire Middle American corridor, from Veracruz, Mexico, to Costa Rica. We sampled 56 sites distributed throughout Middle America. All were in closed-canopy evergreen wet forest, spanning 11 degrees latitude, from near sea level to 2600 m elevation. Ants were extracted from 100 litter samples from each site and identified to genus or species. Model selection was performed on richness and diversity variables to test if ant diversity best fits a linear model or one allowing for a mid-elevation peak. Linear models were also used to examine the relationships among diversity measures and temperature, precipitation, and seasonality. Species richness measures and diversity indices that incorporate relative abundance show a similar relationship to elevation throughout the region: a truncated bell curve with a mode near 400 m. A cubic relationship is statistically favored over quadratic or linear. Temperature is a significant correlate with diversity, but does not predict a bell-curve. Precipitation and precipitation seasonality fail to explain much of the variability, and no combination of environmental variables predicts a bell curve. Potential causes of the truncated bell curve include lowland biotic attrition, mid-point attractors, and ecotonal transitions from lowland to montane communities. Analysis of 17 subclades within ants mostly showed the same truncated curve but six clades were anomalous. Distinctive behavioral or historical features potentially explain their patterns.

AB  - Fewer than 250 Asian elephants remain in China, occupying fragmented habitats of Yunnan Province. One such fragmented population of 18-23 individuals occupies the Nangunhe Nature Reserve Area in Lincang City, Yunnan Province, China. The greatest threat to the survival of this population is the loss and fragmentation of habitat. In this study, we applied an ecological niche factor analysis (ENFA) model to evaluate the habitat suitability of Lincang City for Asian elephants based on geographical factors, vegetation type, and human disturbance. Optimal, relatively suitable, and marginal habitat accounted for 0.16% (38.45 km(2)), 0.61% (150.00 km(2)), and 3.34% (817.26 km(2)) of the total study area, whereas non-suitable habitat accounted for 95.89% (23,463.29 km(2)) of this area. The marginality of Asian elephant habitat in Lincang was 1.954, indicating nonrandom selection of various eco-geographical variables in the environment. The primary factor affecting Asian elephant habitat quality was vegetation type, followed by geographical factors and human disturbance. A habitat quality map for the total distribution of Asian elephants remaining in China (i.e., Yunnan Province: Xishuangbanna, Lincang, and Pu'er) based on our current and previous study showed that just 1400.57 km(2) and 2689.62 km(2) relatively suitable and optimal habitat is available, owing to significant deforestation. In addition to reintroduction programs, conservation strategies should focus on improving the quality of marginal habitats for elephants, in parallel to placing ecological corridors through non-suitable habitat to connect all suitable habitats for this and other extremely small elephant populations in China to reduce genetic isolation and secure long-term survival for the species.

AB  - The letting surveys from northern New England and New York provide a unique opportunity to derive quantitative documentary evidence on past forests. Due to the distinctive "proprietory town" land tenure system, northern New England has an extensive and virtually untapped archive of land division surveys done prior to settlement (1763-1820). I searched archives throughout Vermont, New Hampshire, and northern New York and located records from 179 towns documenting 48,260 individual trees across the region. Surveyors used 131 separate vernacular names representing at least 49 recognizable species. This collection of town-wide witness tree relative frequencies is a consistent and unbiased empirical estimate of the composition of the natural vegetation before confounding land use. Five ubiquitous taxa (beech, spruces, maples, hemlock, birches) comprised 79% of the witness trees. Beech (32%) consistently dominated the region with greater than 60% of the trees in some towns. Spruce (14%) was the second most abundant species and found throughout the region. Maples (12%) were consistently distributed with peak abundance in Vermont. Hemlock (12%) had a patchy distribution with pockets of abundance, including the eastern Adirondacks. Birches (9%) were a species group with higher abundance in the mountains or to the north. White pine was consistently uncommon with very low (<1%) abundance on the uplands. A dramatic "oak-beech" tension zone or ecotone separated the oak-pine Vegetation in the major southern valleys from the spruce-maple-beech composition northward. The central tendency was toward spruce-hardwoods with distinctive variants in the north, the Taconics, and the Champlain Valley. Major fires and blowdowns were equally rare and affected only 0.5% of the region. Fire was frequent only in the Hudson-Champlain corridor and windthrow was a low-level background disturbance. The most dramatic changes documented over the past 200 years have been the decline of beech and the profound effects of human land use.

AB  - Landscape restoration is increasingly becoming a necessary management directive for the rural landscape. The addition of patches and corridors in a fragmented agricultural landscape is considered to restore ecological integrity to the landscape by enhancing the biogeochemical cycle. Agricultural benefits of erosion reduction and nutrient cycling, as well as wildlife enhancements in terms of providing habitat, movement corridors, etc., can also be attained by diversifying the fragmented landscape. The challenge lies in developing a restoration method which establishes a symbiotic relationship between agriculture and wildlife. This research has developed one such method of implementing a regional landscape restoration design. The number and location of the additional patches and corridors necessary to restore the landscape were determined for a case study site in southern Ontario. Three alternative restoration designs were then generated to simulate the structural and functional changes in landscape composition. The placement of patches and corridors in the first alternative emphasizes wildlife enhancement. The second alternative emphasizes the existing grid-like pattern of the cultural features (e.g. road alignment, lot layout). The third alternative provides a compromise between maximizing either wildlife or agricultural benefits thereby emphasizing landscape functioning.

AB  - Assessing the status and monitoring the trends of land cover dynamics in and around protected areas is of utmost importance for park managers and decision makers. Moreover, to support the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)'s Strategic Action Plan including the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, such efforts are necessary to set a framework to reach the agreed national, regional or global targets. The integration of land use/cover change (LULCC) data with information on habitats and population density provides the means to assess potential degradation and disturbance resulting from anthropogenic activities such as agriculture and urban area expansion. This study assesses the LULCC over a 20 year (1990-2000-2010) period using freely available Landsat imagery and a dedicated method and toolbox for the Udzungwa Mountains National Park (UMNP) and its surroundings (20 km buffer) in Tanzania. Habitat data gathered from the Digital Observatory for Protected Areas (DOPA)'s eHabitat+ Web service were used to perform ecological stratification of the study area and to develop similarity maps of the potential presence of comparable habitat types outside the protected area. Finally, integration of the habitat similarity maps with the LULCC data was applied in order to evaluate potential pressures on the different habitats within the national park and on the linking corridors between UMNP and other protected areas in the context of wildlife movement and migration. The results show that the UMNP has not suffered from relevant human activities during the study period. The natural vegetation area has remained stable around 1780 km(2). In the surrounding 20 km buffer area and the connecting corridors, however, the anthropogenic impact has been strong. Artificially built up areas increased by 14.24% over the last 20 years and the agriculture area increased from 11% in 1990 to 30% in the year 2010. The habitat functional types and the similarity maps confirmed the importance of the buffer zone and the connecting corridors for wildlife movements, while the similarity maps detected other potential corridors for wildlife.

FX  - The study was accomplished within the framework of the BIOPAMA (Biodiversity and Protected Areas Management) project, a four year initiative (2012-2016) funded by resources from the intra-ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) envelope of the 10th European Development Fund (EDF). BIOPAMA aims to address threats to biodiversity in the ACP countries, while reducing poverty in communities in and around protected areas [70]. It is also the first step towards supporting a new European Union (EU) strategy for wildlife conservation in Africa, focusing on key conservation landscapes [69] rather than on individual, independent protected areas.

AB  - Projects focusing on the restoration of degraded ecosystems have to be financially appealing, spatially multiscaled, and ecologically efficient. Considering such premises, a model was elaborated to assess the locals in relation to the kind of management to be adopted (conservation or restoration) and, for locals indicated for restoration, the kind of restoration to be adopted (assisted or passive). Furthermore, we propose a set of ecologically-based alternatives at medium-and local-scaleto assist the restoration of areas considered unsuitable for passive restoration. Such techniques are: install artificial connectors among forest fragments near each other, or, for areas where forest fragments are far each other, install nucleation techniques, revitalization of concrete-lined urban rivers, and the control of erosion and invasive plant species. We tested the potential of our model through a case study carried out in Sorocaba, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The study area is predominantly occupied by pasture lands, but urbanization also is an important land cover category. There are 661 forest fragments, being 25 of them larger than 50 ha. From the area considered "non-habitat", i.e., modified due to human usage, 35.5% of the total study area and 45.5% of the study area classified as non-habitat is suitable for passive restoration, and the rest of the area needs is suitable only for assisted restoration techniques. We verified that the facility and low cost of installation are advantageous features of such techniques and the results obtained by mean of application of the assisted techniques indicate that the alternatives tend to accelerate the process of establishing connectivity of the landscape in locals devoid of connections.

AB  - Small mammal population outbreaks are one of the consequences of socio-economic and technological changes in agriculture. They can cause important economic damage and generally play a key role in food webs, as a major food resource for predators. The fossorial form of the water vole, Arvicola terrestris, was unknown in the Haute Romanche Valley (French Alps) before 1998. In 1998, the first colony was observed at the top of a valley and population spread was monitored during 12 years, until 2010. Spread occurred as a high population density wave. Based on farming history (1810-2003,193 years) and spatio-temporal analysis of crop rotations, our study indicates that this water vole population outbreak has been promoted by the presence of grassland corridors that increase hayfield connectivity. These corridors appeared as a result of the conversion of cropped fields to hay meadows where water vole outbreaks have occurred. Spatial mosaic management for grasslands with decreasing spatial connectedness should be considered to prevent vole outbreak risks and promote biodiversity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Africa, India and Madagascar were once part of the supercontinent of Gondwana. This land mass began to fragment approx. 170 million years ago, and by 83 million years, all of the major components we recognize today were separated by tracts of water. Madagascar's fossil record and estimates of the timing of the extant vertebrate radiations in Madagascar are not easily reconciled with this history of fragmentation. Fossil faunas that lived prior to approx. 65 million years had a cosmopolitan flavour, but this was lost after the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. Phylogenetic reconstructions of most extant Malagasy vertebrate radiations indicate divergence times that postdate the End-Cretaceous (lemurs, tenrecs, cichlid fish) and even the Early Miocene (chameleons, carnivores, rodents). Most biogeographic explanations of these groups rely, therefore, on Simpson's model of sweepstakes dispersal (see also cover figure), but there are significant problems in applying the model to migrations from Africa to Madagascar, although its application is not so intractable between India and Madagascar. Alternative migration routes for consideration lie: (1) along the suite of fracture zones between Antarctica and Africa/Madagascar (known as the Antarctic-Africa Corridor), which may have been exposed episodically above sea level; (2) along a series of submerged basaltic ridges/plateaus with known or suspected continental crust between Antarctica and Africa/Madagascar/ India flanking the Antarctic-Africa Corridor (e.g. the Madagascar Ridge, Mozambique Ridge, Conrad Plateau, Gunnerus Ridge); (3) between Africa and Madagascar along the Davie Ridge (parts of which are known to have been exposed episodically above sea level); (4) along the Deccan hotspot corridor between India and greater Africa.

AB  - Background: Dengue viruses are endemic across most tropical and subtropical regions. Because no proven vaccines are available, dengue prevention is primarily accomplished through controlling the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti. While dispersal distance is generally believed to be,100 m, patterns of dispersion may vary in urban areas due to landscape features acting as barriers or corridors to dispersal. Anthropogenic features ultimately affect the flow of genes affecting vector competence and insecticide resistance. Therefore, a thorough understanding of what parameters impact dispersal is essential for efficient implementation of any mosquito population suppression program. Population replacement and genetic control strategies currently under consideration are also dependent upon a thorough understanding of mosquito dispersal in urban settings.
   Methodology and Principal Findings: We examined the effect of a major highway on dispersal patterns over a 2 year period. A. aegypti larvae were collected on the east and west sides of Uriah Butler Highway (UBH) to examine any effect UBH may have on the observed population structure in the Charlieville neighborhood in Trinidad, West Indies. A panel of nine microsatellites, two SNPs and a 710 bp sequence of mtDNA cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) were used for the molecular analyses of the samples. Three CO1 haplotypes were identified, one of which was only found on the east side of the road in 2006 and 2007. AMOVA using mtCO1 and nuclear markers revealed significant differentiation between the east- and west-side collections.
   Conclusion and Significance: Our results indicate that anthropogenic barriers to A. aegypti dispersal exist in urban environments and should be considered when implementing control programs during dengue outbreaks and population suppression or replacement programs.

AB  - Ecological theory predicts that specialist insect herbivores are more likely to locate and colonize host plants growing in relatively sparse or pure stands compared to host plants growing amongst diverse non-host vegetation. We tested the hypothesis that increasing the apparency and accessibility of milkweed (Asclepias spp.) host plants in small polyculture gardens would boost their colonization by the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), an iconic native species of conservation concern. We established replicated gardens containing the identical mix of milkweeds, flowering nectar sources, and non-host ornamental grasses but arranged in three different spatial configurations that were monitored for monarch colonization over two successive growing seasons. Monarch eggs and larvae were 2.5-4 times more abundant in gardens having milkweeds evenly spaced in a 1m corridor around the perimeter, surrounding the nectar plants and grasses, than in gardens in which milkweeds were surrounded by or intermixed with the other plants. Predator populations were similar in all garden designs. In a corollary open-field experiment, female monarchs laid significantly more eggs on milkweed plants that were fully accessible than on milkweeds surrounded by non-host grasses of equal height. In addition, we monitored monarch usage of 22 citizen-planted gardens containing milkweed and nectar plants in relation to their botanical composition, layout, and surrounding hardscape. Multivariate analysis explained 71% of the variation, with significantly more eggs and larvae found in gardens having milkweeds spatially isolated as opposed to closely intermixed with non-host plants, and in gardens having 100m north/south access unimpeded by structures. Numerous programs encourage citizens to establish gardens with milkweed and nectar plants to help offset habitat loss across the monarch's breeding range. Our findings suggest guidelines for garden design that can help make the urban sector's contributions to monarch habitat restoration more rewarding for participants, and of greater potential value to monarch recovery.

AB  - Ecological theory suggests that intermediate connectivity between protected areas will increase their resilience by facilitating dispersal, recolonisation, and genetic mixing. Conversely, over-connectivity may make areas less resilient to contagious perturbations such as pathogen outbreaks. In a similar manner, socioeconomic connectivity should enhance the spread of effective management strategies and the sharing of scarce resources, but over-connectivity carries the risks associated with one-size-fits-all strategies. We used network analysis to examine the topology of management collaborations and related exchanges of information and equipment in two protected area networks in South Africa using the Eastern and Western Cape Provinces as study sites. National protected areas displayed the highest degree of centrality in the Western Cape, while provincial protected areas occupied the central role in the Eastern Cape. Managers in the Western Cape were more concerned about establishing ecological connectivity between protected areas whereas tourism emerged as an important driver in the Eastern Cape protected area network. Our results support the argument that both location and network membership are important for the socioeconomic resilience of protected areas. As with ecological corridors, deliberate fostering of particular socioeconomic corridors may make the protected areas more resilient to perturbations.

AB  - Dispersal of soil-dwelling organisms via the repeatedly exposed Sunda shelf through much of the Pleistocene in Southeast Asia has not been studied extensively, especially for invertebrates. Here we investigated the phylogeography of an endemic termite species, Macrotermes gilvus (Hagen), to elucidate the spatiotemporal dynamics of dispersal routes of terrestrial fauna in Pleistocene Southeast Asia. We sampled 213 termite colonies from 66 localities throughout the region. Independently inherited microsatellites and mtDNA markers were used to infer the phylogeographic framework of M. gilvus. Discrete phylogeographic analysis and molecular dating based on fossil calibration were used to infer the dynamics of M. gilvus dispersal in time and space across Southeast Asia. We found that the termite dispersal events were consistently dated within the Pleistocene time frame. The dispersal pattern was multidirectional, radiating eastwards and southwards out of Indochina, which was identified as the origin for dispersal events. We found no direct dispersal events between Sumatra and Borneo despite the presence of a terrestrial connection between them during the Pleistocene. Instead, central Java served as an important link allowing termite colonies to be established in Borneo and Sumatra. Our findings support the hypothesis of a north south dispersal corridor in Southeast Asia and suggest the presence of alternative dispersal routes across Sundaland during the Pleistocene. For the first time, we also propose that a west-east dispersal through over-water rafting likely occurred across the Pleistocene South China Sea. We found at least two independent entry routes for terrestrial species to infiltrate Sumatra and Borneo at different times.

AB  - Edge effects in temperate forests is studied, taking as a case study fragmented pineoak communities of central Mexico. A total of 29 forest patches were sampled to recognize edge and interior areas with different composition and vegetation structure. In order to evaluate the edge effects at the landscape scale, we analyzed the impact of the amplitude of the edge and interior areas in 333 fragments with different spatial characteristics (size, shape and connectivity). The results indicate the existence of an edge-interior gradient that primarily impacts on forest biological composition. The area of lower ecological quality is the edge (<= 50 m), which has high values of composition (diversity, richness and abundance), presence of species showing preference for outdoor environments (Prunus serotina, Quercus rugosa and Q. crassipes) and cultivated pine (Pinus patula) or disturbed environments (P. leiophylla). The core area (> 100 m), unlike the edge area shows lower compositional values, but with the presence of species that prefer indoor environments (Q. crassifolia, Q. obtusata and P. montezumae). A transition area (> 50-100 m) with overlapping exterior and interior species (Prunus serotina, Q. obtusata and P. teocote) was detected between both, but with lower composition values than those of the edge area and greater statistical similarity with the core area. While 93% of forest area corresponds to fragments still retain a core area and/or transition area, 7% is divided into a large number of small fragments formed exclusively by edge area; the latter are linear forms that pose a high potential for connectivity and restoration. This paper provides new information about the consequences of landscape fragmentation in temperate forests.

AB  - Ecuador has among the world's highest biodiversity, despite being a tiny fraction of the world's land area. The threat of extinction for some of this biodiversity has dramatically increased since April 2016, during which time the Ecuadorian government has opened around 13% of the country to mining exploration, with many of the concessions in previously protected forests. Herein, we describe the system of protected lands in Ecuador, their mining laws, and outline the scale of threat by comparing the mammals, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and orchids from several now threatened protected areas, classed as "Bosques Protectores," in the northwestern montane cloud forests. Together, these reserves form a buffer and a southern corridor for the still-protected Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve, which is otherwise now surrounded by mining concessions. We gathered published literature, "gray literature," information from reserve records and websites, and our previously unpublished observations to make comparative species tables for each reserve. Our results reveal the potential losses that mining could cause: eight critically endangered species, including two primates (brown-headed spider monkey and white-fronted capuchin), 37 endangered species, 153 vulnerable, 89 near threatened, and a large number of less threatened species. Our data show that each reserve protects a unique subset of taxa in this region of highly localized endemics and the reserves also generate sustainable income for local people. The short-term national profits from mining will not compensate for the permanent biodiversity losses, and the long-term ecosystem service and economic losses at the local and regional level.

AB  - Various multi-scale hierarchical river health approaches and assessments have been developed and implemented with a variety of scientific and management purposes. Although many existing biological and geomorphological assessments offer insights into stream function, none were developed for or exclusively capture the functions of streams in the urban environment. Quantitative aspects of existing screening tools are limited in urban streams due to the unique combination of hydrogeomorphic and anthropogenic factors in the urban environment. Analyzing the physical, biological, and social drivers within the concept of the urban stream syndrome coupled with recent advances in stream assessments connects the health of urban streams with past, present, and future impacts. The urban stream assessment procedure (USAP) provides an innovative framework and conceptual model to comprehensively assess stream functions in the urban environment and quantify their health at multiple scales. The specific aim is to identify the highest function and lowest maintenance "version" of an urban stream that is achievable given the context-varying hydrologic regimes, geomorphic conditions, ecological diversity, social contexts, and community goals. It is designed to classify urban stream reaches and corridors according to their hydrological, geomorphological, vegetation characteristics and to support identification of reaches that might be candidates for rehabilitation. Employing a multi-scale framework yields greater success in assessing stream function, diagnosing watershed-wide drivers, and implementing strategies to enhance streams in the urban environment. Furthermore, the USAP framework can assist water resources managers in assessing and managing health specific to urban streams through applicable spatial and relevant parameters and metrics.

AB  - Roads and traffic reduce landscape connectivity and increase rates of mortality for many species of wildlife. Species that glide from tree to tree may be strongly affected by roads and traffic if the size of the gap between trees exceeds their gliding capability. Not only are wide roads likely to reduce crossing rates, but mortality may also be increased if gliders that do cross have poor landing opportunities. The road-crossing behavior of 47 squirrel gliders (Petaurus norfolcensis) was investigated in southeast Australia using radio-tracking. The proportion of gliders crossing one or both roadways of a freeway where trees were present or absent from the center median was compared to that at single-lane country roads (control). The proportion of gliders crossing the road at control sites (77%) was similar to the proportion that crossed one or both roadways at the freeway with trees in the median (67%), whereas only a single male (6%) crossed the freeway where trees were absent from the median. The frequency of crossing for each individual was also similar at control sites and freeway sites with trees in the median. The almost complete lack of crossing at sites where trees were absent from the median was attributed to the wider gap in canopy (50 - 64 m vs. 5 - 13 m at sites with trees in the median). This suggests that traffic volume, up to 5,000 vehicles per day on each roadway, and the other characteristics of the freeway we studied are not in themselves complete deterrents to road crossing by squirrel gliders. This study demonstrates that retaining and facilitating the growth of tall trees in the center median of two-way roads may mitigate the barrier effect of roads on gliders, thus contributing positively to mobility and potentially to connectivity. This information will be essential for the assessment of road impacts on gliding species using population viability models.

AB  - The Royal Sites have been studied and analysed from many points of view and there is an extensive bibliography regarding their historic, artistic and touristic heritage. However, their importance in the conservation of the environment, namely the conservation of soils and ecological corridors allowing the movement of animals and maintenance of biodiversity, has hardly been studied. Their high levels of protection, both as patrimony of the State and as ecological areas, have helped to preserve these natural landscapes even in areas close to big cities. In this paper we will analyse the importance that the Royal Sites, located in the northwest of the Autonomous Community of Madrid and in areas nearby in the Province of Segovia, have had in the conservation of the soils.

AB  - Aim: The transition from the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, 950-1250 CE) to the Little Ice Age (LIA, 1350-1800 CE) is the largest pre-industrial climate shift within the last two millennia, offering an opportunity to study how vegetation responds to rapid climate change. We analysed a sedimentary record from the Colombian Andes to reconstruct regional vegetation dynamics during this time interval, identify the modern environmental distribution of taxa present in the fossil record and provide a reference for modern regional temperature change.
   Location: Lake Tota, Eastern Cordillera, Colombian Andes.
   Taxon: Angiosperm and Gymnosperms.
   Methods: A sediment core was analysed for organic geochemistry and pollen to reconstruct environmental and vegetation variability between 800 and 1800 CE. Modern occurrences of individuals of the genera found in the fossil record were used to model the distribution of taxa across gradients of mean annual temperature and precipitation. These models were used to reconstruct temperature and precipitation across time and evaluate the probability of occurrence of taxa from the fossil record across the contemporary landscape.
   Results: Reconstructed regional vegetation dynamics were highly coupled with global temperature patterns. Reconstructed climate showed that conditions were warm and dry during the MCA, and cold and relatively wet during the LIA, although quantitative estimations might have been amplified by human disturbances. Rates of temperature change during the MCA-LIA transition were substantially lower than those calculated for the last two decades. Vegetation turnover between 800 and 1800 CE resembled those expressed through a transect extending similar to 30 km southeast from the lake.
   Main conclusions: Around lake Tota, modern rates of temperature change have no precedent within the last two millennia. The modern environmental affinities of taxa involved in vegetation turnover during the MCA-LIA transition point to the importance of landscape diversity and connectivity for rapid vegetation response to climate change.

AB  - The landscape genetics framework is typically applied to broad regions that occupy only small portions of a species' range. Rarely is the entire range of a taxon the subject of study. We examined the landscape genetic structure of the endangered Point Arena mountain beaver (Aplodontia rufa nigra), whose isolated geographic range is found in a restricted (85 km(2)) but heterogenous region in California. Based on its diminutive range we may predict widespread gene flow and a relatively weak role for landscape variation in defining genetic structure. We used skin, bone, tissue and noninvasively collected hair samples to describe genetic substructure and model gene flow. We examined spatial partitioning of multilocus DNA genotypes and mitochondrial DNA haplotypes. We identified 3 groups from microsatellite data, all of which had low estimates of effective population size consistent with significant tests for historical bottlenecks. We used least-cost-path analysis with the microsatellites to examine how vegetation type affects gene flow in a landscape genetics framework. Gene flow was best predicted by a model with "Forest" as the most permeable, followed by "Riparian". Agricultural lands demonstrated the highest resistance. MtDNA data revealed only two haplotypes: one was represented in all 57 individuals that occurred north of the east-west flowing Garcia River. South of the river, however, both haplotypes occurred, often at the same site suggesting that the river may have affected historical patterns of genetic divergence.

AB  - The hypotelminorheic is a groundwater-fed shallow subterranean habitat, occurring a few metres below the surface and emerging at a seepage spring. Little is known about the habitat requirements for the amphipods and isopods that live there, and forest quality and other surface parameters have been largely unexplored. Urban parks, encompassing protected lands from ballfields to forests, are not necessarily secure sites, because of non-compatible uses and changing park boundaries. Almost all records for this fauna in the study area are in parks. Using data from sampling in parklands of south-east Washington, DC, exploratory analyses were conducted at two spatial scales - the seeps and pervious land patches surrounded by impervious surfaces (which range from 0.59 to 231 ha). Habitat quality, fragmentation and geological variables were calculated, and exploratory logistic regression models were fitted to predict occupancy. Hypotelminorheic macroinvertebrates were found at 66 of 207 seeps and 15 of 27 patches. Five species were collected, three of which were uncommon. Only patches containing three or more seeps and >7.6 ha were inhabited. Occurrence of one or more species in seeps was associated with distance inside the forest, taller tree canopy, elevation and geological formation. There is a threshold amount of habitat below which a population can no longer exist. Few patches of forest remain that are sufficiently large for habitation, and conservation actions should prioritize forested patches with three or more seeps. In addition, the development of forested corridors to enhance connectivity among populations, education of the public about the value of the hypotelminorheic, and development of field methods to detect habitats is recommended. Urban parklands can be important reservoirs for species of conservation concern.

AB  - Integrated waterbird management over the past few decade has implicitly referred to methods for managing wetlands that usually attempt to enhance habitat for taxonomic groups such as shorebirds and wading birds, in addition to waterfowl, the traditional focus group. Here I describe five elements of integration in management: taxonomic, spatial, temporal, population and habitat, and multiple-use management objectives. Spatial integration Simply expands the Scale of management concern. Rather than emphasizing management on a very limited number of impoundments or wetlands in small refuges or wildlife management areas, the vision is beginning to shift to connectivity within larger landscapes on the order of many square kilometers as telemetry data on daily and seasonal movements for many species become available. Temporal integration refers to the potential for either simultaneous management for waterbirds and commercial "crops" (e.g., crawfish and rice) or for temporally-staggered management such as row crop production in spring-summer growing seasons and waterbird management on fallow fields in the non-growing (winter) season. Integrating population dynamics with habitats has become a major research focus over the past decade. Identifying which wetlands are "sources" or "sinks" for specific populations provides managers with critical information about effective management. Further, the applications of spatially explicit population models place heavy demands on researchers to identify use patterns for breeding and dispersing individuals by age, sex, and reproductive class. Population viability analysis models require much the same information. Finally, multiple-use management integration refers to trying to optimize the uses of wetlands, when only one (perhaps secondary) use may include waterbird management. Depending upon the ownership and primary land use of a particular parcel of land containing wetlands and,, or water bodies, managing for waterbirds may be an "easy sell" (e.g., public natural resource lands) or a very contentious one, where wetlands are created for industrial, aquaculture or urban uses. In the latter case, careful planning and implementation require broad stakeholder participation and education.

AB  - The migrations of murine rodents and their capacity for overcoming various obstacles in urbanized environments have been analyzed. Animals marked with tetracycline were captured at different distances from the marking plot. The maximum distance of movement along a straight line was 2030 m for the pygmy wood mouse (Sylvaemus uralensis Pall.) and 430 m for the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus Schr.). It was revealed that the pygmy wood mouse can successfully cross various types of landscape discontinuities which can act as movement barriers.

AB  - The study sought to investigate the process of built-up expansion and the probability of built-up expansion in the English Bazar Block of West Bengal, India, using multitemporal Landsat satellite images and an integrated machine learning algorithm and fuzzy logic model. The land use and land cover (LULC) classification were prepared using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for 2001, 2011, and 2021. The landscape fragmentation technique using the landscape fragmentation tool (extension for ArcGIS software) and frequency approach were proposed to model the process of built-up expansion. To create the built-up expansion probability model, the dominance, diversity, and connectivity index of the built-up areas for each year were created and then integrated with fuzzy logic. The results showed that, during 2001-2021, the built-up areas increased by 21.67%, while vegetation and water bodies decreased by 9.28 and 4.63%, respectively. The accuracy of the LULC maps for 2001, 2011, and 2021 was 90.05, 93.67, and 96.24%, respectively. According to the built-up expansion model, 9.62% of the new built-up areas was created in recent decades. The built-up expansion probability model predicted that 21.46% of regions would be converted into built-up areas. This study will assist decision-makers in proposing management strategies for systematic urban growth that do not damage the environment.

AB  - Freshwater communities are threatened by the conversion of natural landscapes for urban and agricultural purposes. Changes to land use may disrupt stream nutrient and geomorphological processes and reduce water quality, increase sedimentation, and decrease habitat heterogeneity eventually leading to species loss and decreases in ecosystem productivity. Endemic species are frequently at greater risk of habitat-mediated fragmentation and extirpation due to their constrained distributions.
   The Kanawha darter (Etheostoma kanawhae) is an understudied fish endemic to the New River Drainage in North Carolina and Virginia, USA. To investigate the potential effect(s) of land-use change on Kanawha darters, naive occupancy was modelled using instream habitat characteristics and upstream forest cover.
   Generalized linear models revealed that instream habitat and forest cover are reliable predictors of Kanawha darter site occupancy. Specifically, models demonstrated that occupancy increased in reaches with reduced stream width, velocity, and bedrock substrate but higher concentrations of coarse woody material. Kanawha darter occupancy was also positively associated with the extent of forest cover in upstream catchments.
   Although Kanawha darters are not currently considered imperilled, most populations occurred in isolated reaches separated by large sections of unoccupied habitat. Continuing ex-urban development in riparian zones is likely to be the primary threat to Kanawha darters and other endemic species in this catchment. Resource managers and stakeholders should preserve forest cover in headwaters and occupied tributaries and protect or restore riparian zones along the main-stem South and North Forks of the New River to preserve high-quality habitat and enhance connectivity among isolated Kanawha darter populations.
   As human populations in montane regions continue to grow, there is a need to understand how land-use change affects endemic freshwater species. This study further supports the importance of retaining forest cover as an effective strategy for protecting and restoring populations of endemic fishes in high-gradient streams.

AB  - Land transformation reduces biodiversity and regional sustainability, with land price being an indicator of the opportunity cost to a landowner of resisting land conversion. However, reliable spatially explicit databases of current land prices are generally lacking in developing countries. We used tools from data science to scrape 1,487 georeferenced land prices in southern Kenya from the internet. Prices were higher for land near cities and in areas of high agricultural productivity, but also around the Maasai Mara National Reserve. Predicted land prices ranged from US$662 to US$4,618,805 per acre. Land speculation associated with expanding urbanization increases the opportunity and acquisition costs of maintaining conservation buffer zones, corridors, and dispersal areas. However, high land values are also found adjacent to a world-famous tourist destination. Profit-driven turnover of ownership, subdivision, and transformation of land is occurring at a rapid pace in southern Kenya, to the detriment of savanna biodiversity and the sustainability of the pastoral social-ecological system.

AB  - Physiological metrics are becoming popular tools for assessing individual condition and population health to inform wildlife management and conservation decisions. Corticosterone assays can provide information on howanimals cope with individual and habitat-level stressors, and the recent development of feather assays is an exciting innovation that could yield important insights for conservation of wild birds. Due to the widespread enthusiasm for feather corticosterone as a potential bioindicator, studies are needed to assess the ability of this technique to detect meaningful differences in physiological stress across a variety of stressor types and intensities. We examined feather corticosterone from 144 individuals among the 13 known breeding populations of Hawaiian gallinule (Gallinula galeata sandvicensis), an endangered waterbird, on the island of O'ahu. These ecologically independent subpopulations are known to have low genetic connectivity and movement rates and differ largely across a number of important conditions, including level of predator management, human disturbance, proximity to urban development and conspecific population density. This system is well suited for assessing the performance of feather corticosterone as a bioindicator of different known habitat-level threats common to this and many other conservation-reliant species. We found no statistically significant relationship between feather corticosterone and level of predator control, level of humandisturbance, gallinule population density, percent urban cover or body condition across all sites despite the substantial difference in stressor magnitude in our dataset. We did find that gallinules in habitats with larger population densities were in worse body condition. These findings suggest that feather corticosterone is not a consistent indicator of anthropogenic impacts on populations. Furthermore, they suggest that feather corticosterone may be a poor bioindicator of known habitat-level threats for Hawaiian gallinules and that it should be used with caution in other avian taxa of conservation concern.

AB  - The presence of adequate riparian strips in agricultural landscapes is generally recognized to contribute to the reduction of the impacts of agricultural practices on the water quality of streams, to regularize water temperature and to help in the creation of important wildlife habitats. This study aimed at determining the importance of riparian strips in agricultural landscapes of southern Quebec for small mammal and herpetofaunal communities, and verifying farmers' general belief that these habitats become shelters for species considered as agricultural pests. Abundance, composition and diversity of communities were compared between three types of riparian strips: herbaceous, shrubby and wooded. A total of 1460 small mammals belonging to 14 species and 329 amphibians and reptiles belonging to 11 species were captured with line trapping and drift fences. The generalist species Sorer cinereus, Zapus hudsonius, Blarina brevicauda, and Bufo americanus were abundant in all three types of riparian strips. Peromyscus maniculatus, Sorex fumeus, Clethrionomys gapperi, and Rana pipiens were associated more closely to wooded strips, whereas Rana sylvatica was captured mostly in shrubby strips. The abundance of small mammals and herpetofauna increased with complexity of vegetation structure. Small mammal diversity was higher in herbaceous and wooded riparian strips, whereas the herpetofaunal community was more diverse in shrubby strips. Proportion and abundance of pest species diminished with complexity of vegetation structure, whereas insectivores increased in abundance. Maintaining woody vegetation in riparian strips should increase abundance and diversity of wildlife within agricultural landscapes where increasing development pressure is presently contributing to the conversion of such habitats to herbaceous strips. Such a management approach should also help reducing the risk of riparian strips becoming shelters for pest species. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We examined the behavior of bobcats and coyotes in a fragmented urban area northwest of Los Angeles, California, from July 1998 to October 1999. Activity patterns of bobcats and coyotes were crepuscular with no apparent shift to nocturnality, but activity was somewhat lower during daylight hours than in an unfragmented reference area, implying some avoidance of humans. Home ranges were not significantly larger in fragmented than in unfragmented habitat, probably because unproductive development within a home range may have been balanced by availability of human-related food, such as fruit, garbage, and pets. Female bobcat home ranges were generally within a single fragment, while male bobcats and coyotes of both sexes included more than one fragment. Both species tended to cross over roads rather than use culverts. Culverts were more likely to be used earlier in the night, during heavier traffic, and if they contained less water. Bobcats and coyotes used corridors as habitat and, less often, for travel. Both species also crossed development to move between fragments, but seemed to prefer corridors when available. Our results indicate that bobcats and coyotes persisting in an urban environment adjust behaviorally to habitat fragmentation and human activities, in part through temporal and spatial avoidance. Both species appeared willing to cross well-travelled roads despite the availability of culverts; consequently, vehicular collision is an important cause of mortality (50%) and needs attention.

AB  - Balancing the needs of biodiversity in the context of ecologically sustainable development remains a challenging and ongoing issue for consent authorities, developers and scientists alike. This article explores some of the practical, scientific, legislative and policy issues facing the protection of biodiversity in the context of urbanisation. The application of legislative and policy instruments to environmental decision-making needs to be complemented with more site-specific, evidenced-based research and with regard to the biodiversity of the broader landscape. It is argued that such an approach will help determine more accurately the likely long-term environmental outcomes that can be expected from setbacks, offsets, buffers and corridors within urban landscapes. In examining the question of setbacks adjacent to development, various relevant examples of court decisions are considered. In addition, a range of recent research studies are used to show that riparian zones are ecologically distinct as compared with non-riparian bushland. In addition, riparian corridor width is shown to influence the composition of flora and invertebrate fauna communities, supporting the use of wide buffers to maximise biodiversity outcomes. The application of site-specific empirical findings in biodiversity planning and decision-making will help limit and mitigate the key threatening processes of clearing and fragmentation.

AB  - Understanding the diversity of bacteria and E.coli levels at beaches is important for managing health risks. This study compared temporal changes of the bacterial communities of Belle Isle Beach (Detroit, MI) and Sand Point Beach (Windsor, ONT), both located near the Lake St. Clair origin of the Detroit River. Water samples collected 4 days/week for 12 weeks in summer, were subjected to 16S rRNA analysis of amplicon sequencing and E. coli enumeration. Bacterial communities changed over time, as determined by cluster dendmgram analysis, exhibiting different communities in July and August than in June and different communities at the two beaches. After June, alpha diversity decreased and relative abundance of Enterobacter (Gammaproteobacteria) increased at Sand Point; whereas, Belle Isle maintained its alpha diversity and dominance by Betaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Contamination at both beaches is dominated by birds (23% to 50% of samples), while only similar to 10% had evidence of human-associated bacteria. High E. coli at both beaches was often associated with precipitation. Nearshore sampling counts were higher than waist-deep sampling counts. Despite the dynamic changes in bacterial communities between the two beaches, this analysis based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing is able to provide information about bacterial types associated with high E. coli levels and to use bacterial sequences to more precisely determine sources and health relevance of contaminants.

AB  - Background Despite a rapidly accumulating evidence base quantifying ecosystem services, the role of biodiversity in the maintenance of ecosystem services in shared human-nature environments is still understudied, as is how indigenous and agriculturally dependent communities perceive, use, and manage biodiversity. The present study aims to document traditional ethnobotanical knowledge of the ecosystem service benefits derived from wild and tended plants in rice-cultivated agroecosystems, compare this to botanical surveys, and analyze the extent to which ecosystem services contribute social-ecological resilience in the Terai Plains of Nepal. Method Sampling was carried out in four landscapes, 22 Village District Committees, and 40 wards in the monsoon season. Data collection was based on transects walks to collect plant specimens, structured and semi-structured interviews, and participatory fieldwork in and around home gardens, farms, and production landscapes. We asked 180 farmers to free-list vernacular names and describe use-value of wild and tended plants in rice-cultivated agroecosystems. Uses were categorized into eight broad groupings, and 61 biomedical ailment classifications. We assessed if knowledge of plant species diversity and abundance differed with regard to caste, age, and gender. Results Nepalese farmers have a deep knowledge of the use and management of the 391 vascular plant specimens identified, which provide key provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural ecosystem services. Altogether, plants belong to 76 distinct plant species from 49 phylogenetic families: 56 are used to cure 61 ailments, 27 for rituals, 25 for food, 20 for timber, 17 for fuel, 17 for fodder, 11 for soil enhancement, and eight for pesticides. Four caste groups have statistically different knowledge, and younger informants report a lower average number of useful plants. Conclusion Agricultural landscapes in Nepal are reservoirs of biodiversity. The knowledge of the use of wild and tended plant species in and around these farms differs by the caste and age group of land manager. Conducting research on agroecosystems will contribute to a deeper understanding of how nature is perceived by locals, to more efficient management and conservation of the breadbasket of Nepal, and to the conservation of valuable, but disappearing traditional knowledge and practice.

AB  - Biological invasions have significant ecological, evolutionary and economic consequences. Ants are exemplary invaders and their invasion success is frequently attributed to a shift in social structure between native and introduced populations. Here, we use a multidisciplinary approach to determine the social structure, origin and expansion of the invasive Argentine ant, Linepithema humile, in Australia by linking behavioural and genetic studies with indicators of dispersal pathways and propagule pressure. Behavioural assays revealed a complete absence of aggression within and between three cities - Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth - spanning 2700 km across Australia. Microsatellite analyses showed intracity genetic homogeneity and limited but significant intercity genetic differentiation. Exceptions were two Perth nests that likely represent independent translocations from Adelaide. These patterns suggest efficient local gene flow with more limited jump dispersal via transport corridors between cities. Microsatellite analyses of L. humile from potential source regions, combined with data from port interceptions, trade pathways and the timeline of spread within Australia, implicate the main European supercolony as the source of L. humile in Melbourne. Such an introduction probably then redistributed across Australia and spread to New Zealand to form an expansive Australasian supercolony.

AB  - We assess the potential impact of climate change on plant diversity in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) and its interaction with land transformation that has already occurred in the region. Predictions were made both at the scale of the Fynbos Biome (the dominant vegetation assemblage in the CFR) and for selected Proteaceae species. Bioclimatic modelling identified parts of the biome at particular risk from climate change. Species-level modelling (Generalised Additive Modelling) was done for 28 Proteaceae species selected from areas at high risk of biome loss, revealing individualistic range changes in a pattern broadly consistent with biome modelling results. Most species experienced potential range contractions (17 of 28), of which five showed range elimination. Several species (I I of 28) showed potential range expansions. For species showing range contractions, current land transformation had less impact on future potential ranges than did climate change, because many species ranges shifted to higher altitudes where land transformation is currently less prevalent. Fewer than half of the high-risk species showed overlap between current and future potential range, showing that propagule transport, establishment of species in novel ranges and conservation of landscape linkages will be critical for maintenance of biodiversity. Methods described here provide useful forecasts of potential climate change impacts that could guide conservation responses, but results need cautious interpretation in the light of the many assumptions underlying the techniques used.

AB  - Seminatural habitats are declining throughout the world; thus, the role of small anthropogenic habitats in the preservation of plants is becoming increasingly appreciated. Here, we surveyed the orchid flora of roadside verges in five Central European countries (Austria, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia) and tested how the surrounding landscape matrix affects the overall number of species and individuals, and also different functional groups of orchids. We found more than 2,000 individuals of 27 orchid species during our surveys. According to our results, the increasing coverage of agricultural and urban areas negatively affects both the number of orchid species and individuals on roadsides. Our study further suggests that differences in the surrounding habitats affect which species are found on roadsides, since the increasing coverage of grasslands or forested areas around orchid occurrences had a significant positive effect on the number of grassland or forest-dwelling species and individuals, respectively. Most variance in orchid numerosity and diversity was explained by the cover of the suitable habitat types of the respective taxa in the surrounding landscape of the sampling points. This highlights the importance of roadsides acting as refugia for numerous species and valuable plant communities as well as in supporting biodiversity in general.

AB  - Maintenance of movement corridors is a fundamental component of the conservation of biological diversity, and is especially critical for terrestrial species that migrate extended distances. Highways and interstate freeways fragment corridors and often result in increased mortality of terrestrial migrants from collisions with vehicles. Wildlife crossing structures are an important tool in multiple ecosystems to allow safe passage for wildlife across roadways. Indeed, crossing structures have been used extensively in Europe and with increasing frequency in North America to reconnect fragmented habitats for numerous species. Few projects, however, have documented responses to >1 structure type simultaneously that are close to one another. We used mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), a widespread species across diverse bioregions in western North America, to test hypotheses about efficacy of 2 different types of crossing structures for ungulates. We documented behavioral responses and use of overpasses and underpasses by mule deer. Our metrics to evaluate success included passage rates and the number of animals that crossed each structure. Crossing structures were used by mule deer immediately following construction and although all of the crossing structures were used, we observed greater passage rates at overpasses than underpasses. Wildlife crossing structures reduced habitat fragmentation and enhanced connectivity by allowing safe passage across US 93. More importantly, those structures succeeded in removing a large number of mule deer from the roadway making US 93 safer for wildlife and motorists. (C) 2016 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - With increasing road encroachment, habitat fragmentation by transport infrastructures has been a serious threat for European biodiversity. Areas with no roads or little traffic ("roadless and low-traffic areas") represent relatively undisturbed natural habitats and functioning ecosystems. They provide many benefits for biodiversity and human societies (e.g., landscape connectivity, barrier against pests and invasions, ecosystem services). Roadless and low-traffic areas, with a lower level of anthropogenic disturbances, are of special relevance in Europe because of their rarity and, in the context of climate change, because of their contribution to higher resilience and buffering capacity within landscape ecosystems. An analysis of European legal instruments illustrates that, although most laws aimed at protecting targets which are inherent to fragmentation, like connectivity, ecosystem processes or integrity, roadless areas are widely neglected as a legal target. A case study in Germany underlines this finding. Although the Natura 2000 network covers a significant proportion of the country (16%), Natura 2000 sites are highly fragmented and most low-traffic areas (75%) lie unprotected outside this network. This proportion is even higher for the old Federal States (western Germany), where only 20% of the low-traffic areas are protected. We propose that the few remaining roadless and low-traffic areas in Europe should be an important focus of conservation efforts; they should be urgently inventoried, included more explicitly in the law and accounted for in transport and urban planning. Considering them as complementary conservation targets would represent a concrete step towards the strengthening and adaptation of the Natura 2000 network to climate change.

AB  - Wide-ranging large carnivores pose myriad challenges for conservation, especially in highly fragmented landscapes. Over a 13-year period, we combined monitoring of radio collared pumas (Puma concolor) with complementary multi-generational genetic analyses to inform puma conservation in southern California, USA. Our goals were to generate survivorship estimates, determine causes of mortality, identify barriers to movement, and determine the genetic and demographic challenges to puma persistence among >20,000,000 people and extensive urban, suburban, and exurban development. Despite protection from hunting, annual survival for radio collared pumas was surprisingly low (55.8%), and humans caused the majority of puma deaths. The most common sources of mortality were vehicle collisions (28% of deaths), and mortalities resulting from depredation permits issued after pumas killed domestic animals (17% of deaths). Other human-caused mortalities included illegal shootings, public safety removals, and human-caused wildfire. An interstate highway (I-15) bisecting this study area, and associated development, have created a nearly impermeable barrier to puma movements, resulting in severe genetic restriction and demographic isolation of the small puma population (n similar to 17-27 adults) in the Santa Ana Mountains west of I-15. Highways that bisect habitat or divide remaining "conserved" habitat, and associated ongoing development, threaten to further subdivide this already fragmented puma population and increase threats to survival. This study highlights the importance of combining demographic and genetic analyses, and illustrates that in the absence of effective measures to reduce mortality and enhance safe movement across highways, translocation of pumas, such as was done with the endangered Florida panther (P. c. coryi), may ultimately be necessary to prevent further genetic decline and ensure persistence of the Santa Ana Mountains population.

AB  - Species ranges are seldom at equilibrium with climate, because several interacting factors determine distribution, including demographic processes, dispersal, land use, disturbance (e.g., fire), and biotic interactions. Conservation strategies in a changing climate therefore cannot be based only on predicted climate-driven range shifts. Here, we explore conservation and management options in a framework for prioritizing landscapes based on two 'axes of concern': landscape conservation capacity attributes (percentage of protected area, connectivity, and condition of the matrix) and vulnerability to climate change (climate change velocity and topographic variation). Nine other conservation actions are also presented, from understanding and predicting to planning and managing for climate change. We emphasize the need for adaptation and resilience in populations, ecosystems, and the conservation environment itself.

AB  - To date, the provision of ecosystem services has largely been estimated based on spatial patterns of land cover alone, using benefit transfer analysis. Although it is increasingly being recognised that the distribution of the human population affects whether a potential service translates into a realised service, this misses key steps in the process and assumes that everyone accesses ecosystem services in the same way. Here we describe a conceptual approach to ecosystem services in terms of movement and flows. We highlight that ecosystem service flows can be broken down into 'nature to people' (the movement of nature towards beneficiaries) and 'people to nature' (the movement of beneficiaries towards nature). The former has been relatively well described. Here, we explore the latter by reviewing research on human migration, animal foraging and landscape connectivity. We assess if and how existing theories might be useful in describing how people seek out ecosystem services. We consider some of the ways in which flows of people to nature can be measured. Such measurements may reveal which movement theories best represent how people seek out and access ecosystem services. Overall, our review aims to improve the future modelling of ecosystem services by more explicitly considering how people access potential services and therefore realise them.

AB  - The diversification processes underlying why Amazonia hosts the most species-rich vertebrate fauna on earth remain poorly understood. We studied the spatio-temporal diversification of a tree frog clade distributed throughout Amazonia (Anura: Hylidae: Osteocephalus, Tepuihyla, and Dryaderces) and tested the hypothesis that Miocene mega wetlands located in western and central Amazonia impacted connectivity among major biogeographic areas during extensive periods. We assessed the group's diversity through DNA-based (16S rRNA) species delimitation to identify Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) from 557 individuals. We then selected one terminal for each OTU (n=50) and assembled a mitogenomic matrix (similar to 14,100 bp; complete for 17 terminals) to reconstruct a Bayesian, time-calibrated phylogeny encompassing nearly all described species. Ancestral area reconstruction indicates that each genus was restricted to one of the major Amazonian biogeographic areas (western Amazonia, Guiana Shield and Brazilian Shield, respectively) between similar to 10 and 20 Mya, suggesting that they diverged and diversified in isolation during this period around the Pebas mega wetland. After 10 Mya and the transition to the modern configuration of the Amazon River watershed, most speciation within each genus continued to occur within each area. In Osteocephalus, only three species expanded widely across Amazonia (< 6 Mya), and all were pond-breeders. Species with other breeding modes remained mostly restricted to narrow ranges. The spectacular radiation of Osteocephalus was probably driven by climatic stability, habitat diversity and the acquisition of new reproductive modes along the Andean foothills and western Amazonia. Our findings add evidence to the importance of major hydrological changes during the Miocene on biotic diversification in Amazonia.

AB  - Building and preserving a network of greenways can be an intricate activity requiring interdisciplinary collaboration. Greenway segments often require local input and participation. In addition, greenways are not necessarily generic open spaces, but can be managed structurally to fulfill specific spatial and temporal requirements. This paper describes local activities in the Fargo (North Dakota)-Moorhead (Minnesota) metropolitan area related to preserving and embellishing the greenway focused around the Red River Valley of the North. This greenway is part of a larger Western Hemisphere greenway, composed of riparian corridors operating as wildlife habitat migration flyways and as resident wildlife habitat. Local activities include demonstration gardens, comprehensive corridor planning, habitat analysis, and revegetation studies. From 1985 to 1990, four spatial treatment investigations were completed, one spatial planning study was prepared, and five demonstration gardens were built. The spatial treatment investigations revealed that the wildlife occupying the greenway could be divided into four habitat-use dimensions, suggesting four important habitat associations for the greenway. The study also revealed three distinct vegetation zones for re-establishing herbaceous vegetation in non-wooded planting conditions. In addition, one experiment indicated that replanting the disturbed woodland corridor was not influenced by seedling size and that Fraxinus pennsylvanica seedlings were highly successful at surviving in a gap opening within the forest corridor, In the last experiment, a seeding application rate study indicated that seeding rates three times higher than recommended rates resulted in improved vegetation cover of non-wooded herbaceous vegetation planting sites. The spatial planning study illustrated landscape patterns for the greenway composed of a continuous tree canopy corridor, augmented by herbaceous vegetation patches, food plots, and snags. To build and manage the greenway, this investigation reaffirms the importance of multi-disciplinary collaboration, local participation, and the potential individualistic structure of a greenway. The study suggests that both broad landscape planning visions and detailed site endeavors are necessary to understand and manage the greenway successfully.

AB  - The management of diverse biota within protected areas is affected by both land cover change within a protected area and habitat loss and fragmentation in the surrounding landscape. Satellite images provide a synoptic view of land cover patterns, but the use of such imagery requires careful consideration of sensor type, resolution, extent, and the metrics used to quantify ecologically significant change. We examined these factors for landscape monitoring applications in four small National Parks near Washington, DC: Antietam National Battlefield, Catoctin Mountain Park, Prince William Forest Park and Rock Creek Park. Using 4 m Ikonos, 10 m SPOT, 15 m pan-sharpened Landsat ETM+ and 30 m Landsat ETM+ imagery, the parks and surrounding areas were mapped to National Land Cover system classes. For each park, we examined four methods for defining map extent, including park administrative boundaries, two variable buffer widths, and watershed boundaries, and then analyzed patterns of forest habitat for the maps using a graph theoretic approach (critical dispersal threshold distance) and common landscape metrics (number of patches, percent forest, forest edge density, and forest area-weighted mean patch size). As expected, landscape metrics for maps derived at differing resolutions varied significantly, but map extent often yielded even larger differences. We found that for most applications, coarser scale data (e.g., 30 m Landsat) are adequate for characterizing landscape pattern, although ultimately data from multiple sensors may be appropriate or necessary based on different objectives of landscape monitoring (e.g., mapping single trees vs. forest stands) and the scale at which a resource of interest interacts with the larger landscape (e.g., birds vs. herptiles). Our results provide a strong caution regarding the practical issues associated with combining data sources from multiple satellite sensors for monitoring applications. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Soil characteristics of four distinct urban riparian plant communities were studied along a drainage ditch in Tempe, AZ. Our objective was to test if plant communities occurred in similar soil chemical conditions in an urban riparian area. We quantified reduction oxidation (redox) potential, pH, electrical conductivity, phosphorus, reduced iron and soil texture. Our results indicate that the four communities sampled occur in differing chemical conditions. Redox potentials in cattail and bulrush dominated communities ranged from -240 to -303 mV while levels of ferrous iron ranged from 17.0 to 38.5 mg kg-1. This indicates that soils of a highly anaerobic nature occur in these two communities. Redox potentials in knotgrass and Johnson grass communities were significantly (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) higher, ranging from +194 to +244 mV. Reduced iron was not found in these communities, indicating the more aerobic nature of these stands. Both cattail and bulrush communities were found in significantly finer soil textures than the knotgrass and Johnson grass communities. In addition to occupying the stream margins, the more aerobic conditions in knotgrass and Johnson grass communities may result from increased water interflow through the soils of these communities. Data of this type are important so that managers can set realistic goals for re-establishment of vegetation in riparian areas that have been impacted by urban and suburban development.

AB  - Legislation and policy are key tools used by governments to change the socio-economic and political landscape of agrarian systems with consequences for mobile pastoralism. This study used the social-ecological systems framework to examine how pastoral mobility in the semi-arid, montane communal rangeland in South Africa adapted to the changing socio-political landscape. It analysed the impact of apartheid and democratic era legislation and policies over the past 70 years. Apartheid legislation promoted betterment planning and the privatisation of communal lands by awarding access to most of the grazing areas to a few wealthier pastoralists. This led to increased stocking densities and further restriction of herd mobility when the majority of herds were restricted to fewer grazing camps. Democratic era land reform policies continue to advocate for the modernisation and sedentarisation of pastoral practices. The persistence of mobility among livestock keepers despite discriminatory policy interventions suggests that this is a particularly resilient and necessary element of their practices. We argue that agricultural legislation and policies regarding livestock farming should promote landscape connectivity to allow mobile pastoralists to access variable resources. Connected landscapes should be viewed as alternative ways to modernising pastoralism and these should prevent elite capture when the land is subdivided.

AB  - In recent decades land cover change resulting from different types of human activity has severely reduced the original area of tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF). Deforested landscapes in neotropical America commonly have a heterogeneous structure (i.e. landscape context) with increasingly small forest patches immersed in an agricultural matrix. Often, this matrix is not completely devoid of trees, but contain numerous and widely spread arboreal elements. Many of these elements are remnants of the original forest, such as arboreal riparian belts. In 14 riparian belts of TMCF in central Veracruz, Mexico, we assessed the relationship between the attributes of the bird community that uses these belts and their vegetation attributes, as well as with landscape structure in their vicinity at four different scales (within 250, 500, 750 and 1000 m). Bird richness and abundance in riparian belts were positively related with mean tree height. Regarding landscape context, the amount of urban area in the vicinity of each belt was positively related with bird abundance at the four scales studied, explaining between 14 and 31% of spatial variation. However, the abundance of forest interior birds was negatively related with urban area, explaining from 46 to 50% of variation. Both, local (tree height) and landscape characteristics (urban and forest cover) influence differentially bird abundance in riparian belts of cloud forest. Thus, both kinds of variables should be relevant for designing management plans aimed at enhancing the conservation of the native avifauna of the cloud forest and its ecosystem services within transformed landscapes.

Therefore, motor vehicle-borne flora was evaluated monthly for a random sample of 20 cars between October 1988 and September 1989. At the end of the experiment 33 car-borne plant species, with a total of 690 seedlings were identified from mud, attached to these vehicles. There was considerable temporal variation in the mud mass attached to the vehicles and therefore also the size and composition of the vehicle-borne flora varied during the year. Because mud retention on cars is a crucial factor in seed dispersal., the number of emerging seedlings is negatively correlated with precipitation in the week preceding the sampling. The flora dispersed by vehicles consists mostly of species with small, light seeds and a persistent seed bank. Usually, they are pioneer species of nitrogen-rich habitats. The nature of the vehicle dispersed flora was compared with the local flora of road verges and differed significantly from this in, e.g., seed length, seed weight, ecological groups, Ellenberg indicator values for nitrogen supply, potential. dispersal strategies and rarity. A larger resemblance with the flora of the zone immediately adjacent to the carriageway was found. We only found a low similarity to other motor vehicle-borne floras.

AB  - Housing development has emerged as a primary driver of land-use change around the world. In the United States, there is particular concern about low-density residential development on rural lands, which often occurs in places with abundant natural amenities. Conservation development (CD), housing development that incorporates protected open space, has emerged as a tool that can accommodate development and achieve land protection, potentially forming networks with existing protected areas. To assess how these developments contribute to housing and conservation at the landscape level, we gathered data on 343 CDs in 13 counties throughout the State of Colorado, U.S.A., including the number, location, and open space configuration of these housing developments. We found that although CDs comprise a small proportion of housing (4% on average), they account for a mean of 11% of privately owned protected lands, and they are often located in close proximity to protected areas (on average <400 m). A majority of these developments (76%) are immediately adjacent to at least one protected area, most commonly the protected open space of other CDs, and more than one-third (33%) of these developments are adjacent to two or more protected areas with different ownership. We conclude that CDs are poised to contribute to conservation at the landscape level in Colorado, given their proximity to protected lands. However, here and elsewhere, strategic placement of these housing developments and well-coordinated open space stewardship will be important if they are to serve as functional parts of protected area networks.

AB  - Large populations of free-roaming cats (FRCs) generate ongoing concerns for welfare of both individual animals and populations, for human public health, for viability of native wildlife populations, and for local ecological damage. Managing FRC populations is a complex task, without universal agreement on best practices. Previous analyses that use simulation modeling tools to evaluate alternative management methods have focused on relative efficacy of removal (or trap-return, TR), typically involving euthanasia, and sterilization (or trap-neuter-return, TNR) in demographically isolated populations. We used a stochastic demographic simulation approach to evaluate removal, permanent sterilization, and two postulated methods of temporary contraception for FRC population management. Our models include demographic connectivity to neighboring untreated cat populations through natural dispersal in a metapopulation context across urban and rural landscapes, and also feature abandonment of owned animals. Within population type, a given implementation rate of the TR strategy results in the most rapid rate of population decline and (when populations are isolated) the highest probability of population elimination, followed in order of decreasing efficacy by equivalent rates of implementation of TNR and temporary contraception. Even low levels of demographic connectivity significantly reduce the effectiveness of any management intervention, and continued abandonment is similarly problematic. This is the first demographic simulation analysis to consider the use of temporary contraception and account for the realities of FRC dispersal and owned cat abandonment.

AB  - Riparian vegetation constitutes a key element for the maintenance of fluvial ecosystems, especially for those that are surrounded by ur" Jan zones. The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition and variation of riparian vegetation in a stretch of the Santa Catarina river, over two cities of the Monterrey Metropolitan Area. For the analysis of the vegetation, sampling transects were established in a section of 15.65 km. The high stratum (shrub and tree plants) was analyzed using a Bray-Curtis ordering model and a dominance-diversity plot. The Jaccard similarity coefficient was used for the low stratum (herbaceous plants). In the high stratum, 16 families belonging to 25 genera and 28 species were recorded. The species with the highest number of individuals were Salix nigra, Leucaena leucocephala, Ricinus communis and Parkinsonia aculeata. The composition of the vegetation has a similarity level of intermediate to high. because the groups vary between 60 % to 71.53 %. In thelow stratum. 25 families. 53 genera and 60 species were recorded with a similarity level of low to intermediate, because the groups vary between 23 to 47 %. The species that were mostly registered in the low stratum were Cyperus involucratus in 7 sites, and Eragrostis mexicana, Heliantus annuus, Melinis repens, Polygonum pensylvanicum and Typha domingensis in six sites each one. The composition of the vegetation is in a secondary successional state, because the species with greater presence are exotic or invasive, such as Leucaena leucocephala and Ricinus communis for the high stratum and Cyperus involucratus, Typha aomingensis and Melinis repens for the low stratum.

AB  - Understanding how populations of target species interact with their habitats is necessary for developing an effective conservation strategy. During its complex life history, The Caribbean spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) uses a variety of benthic marine habitats, but how habitat characteristics affect their dispersal is unclear: To assess how habitat insularity affects the benthic dispersal of spiny lobsters, I compared lobster abundance, size class structure, and migration among insular mangrove and coral reef habitats that were surrounded by bare rubble fields or by seagrass meadows. Lobsters were significantly more abundant on mangrove and col nl islands surrounded by seagrass. The size-class distributions of lobsters in these habitats had higher proportions of juveniles, whereas islands surrounded by sand and rubble had skewed distributions dominated by adult lobsters. Seagrass is known to serve as settlement habitat for larval recruits and is likely associated with the higher abundances of lobsters found in seagrass-isolated habitats. Immigration and emigration rates were three to four times higher on seagrass-isolated islands than on rubble-isolated islands, reflected in the significantly greater number of juveniles moving into and from seagrass-isolated is lands Rubble fields appeared to function as a barrier to benthic dispersal for all lobsters except adults. Vegetated substrates may function as movement corridors for juvenile lobsters and may facilitate dispersal to areas containing new resources. The effects of insularity on a population may be lessened by the nature of the surrounding habitats if those habitats have important functional roles as larval settlement areas, foraging grounds, or,movement corridors Protection of insular habitats like coral reefs may be ineffective if related habitats like seagrass meadows are left unprotected. Conservation? strategies for mobile benthic species need to incorporate the protection of areas with heterogenous habitats that are important to meet the changing habitat requirements in complex life cycles.

AB  - The decline and fragmentation of habitats areas are two main factors that lead to the reduction of biodiversity in landscape ecosystems. As a kind of large carnivores, South China tiger (Panthera tigris amoyensis) is one of the most endangered tiger subspecies and considered to be extinct in the wild. The Chinese government has intended to release a certain number of tigers into two of their historically habitats areas, Hupingshan-Houhe national nature reserves (NNR) in central-south China that provides suitable habitats for P. tigris. Because wild boar (Sus scrofa) is a prey of P. tigris, spatially characterizing the populations of the prey and its habitats is critical for the success of habituating the tigers to the areas. Although there has been effort made to protect the habitats of wild boar, there have been no report that deal with investigation and analysis of the habitat suitability and potential forwild boar, especially in terms of landscape connectivity. Herewe present the novel integration of the habitat suitability index (HSI) and graph-based network to identify the priority areas for wild boar dispersal in and around the NNR. In addition, a novel method to identify the proper connectivity distance to avoid excessive connectivity when the field data are essentially non-existent. Results showed that in summer andwinter, the potential habitat areas were 6848-10,245 and 5984-10,152km(2), respectively. The total area of the priority patches was 1590 km(2), approximately occupying 16% of the suitable habitat area. Our study indicated that the novel integration of the HSI and network analysis led to an effective approach to spatially characterize priority patches to support decision-making for landscape planning. The results shown here also have implications for future efforts for habituating large carnivores into their historical habitat regions. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Roadside plantings along urban and rural road corridors are designed to create visual effects as well as to provide functional benefits such as shading, screening or routing. Considering their potential for daily public use, roads and road corridors, as significant visual impact centers, can attract people's attention and affect their points of view. Poplar species, which grow rapidly and easily along road corridors and can adapt to different ecological conditions swiftly, are used widely in both urban and rural landscapes in Turkey. The main objective of this study was to determine the visual structures dependent on the mad-plant relationships of the poplar compositions that play an important role in shaping the roadside landscapes. For this purpose, compositions of poplar trees in selected urban and rural road corridors throughout Turkey were photographed and visual analysis techniques (VATS) were applied to determine visual preferences. Participants (n= 35) were shown 30 photographs, selected from the nearly 1000 taken, of road corridor poplar plantings and their evaluations were recorded in a questionnaire. In this survey, the people were requested to evaluate their appreciation levels towards the plantings as well as to express their other visual preferences and to assess visual quality. In addition, the association of all these evaluations with the demographic characteristics of the participants were determined. A correlation analysis was then performed to identify the relationships among all the visual assessments and a cluster analysis was conducted according to the visual status of the photographs in order to determine their groups. In the results of the study, the poplar trees, either individually or in the form of compositions, were reported to have a significant visual diversity. Moreover, the cluster analysis found the resulting three groups to be associated with leaf density, seasonal conditions and the trees as individuals or in groups. The seasonal variation factor in particular was shown to be visually effective in the poplar compositions. It was determined that visual perception of the poplar plantations differed in accordance with the demographic differences. This work established that poplar plantations as single trees or in groups and their proximity to the road altered visual preferences, and consequently, some suggestions were made concerning the use of poplars in roadside landscape planning.

AB  - River corridors in urban environments provide areas of biodiversity which are important for both aesthetic and economic reasons. A physical habitat model, which was used to assess urban rivers in Birmingham, UK, was applied to pairs of selected reaches to represent differing levels of habitat diversity on three rivers. The results for different life-stages of dace, roach and chub suggest that the worst physical habitat occurs in highly modified channels and at the highest flows. Four scenarios, which were designed to represent alterations in flow regime caused by changes in management practices, were calculated using the hydrological model. Changes in physical habitat created by changes to the flow regime were assessed using a consistent, replicable method. It was shown that an increase in runoff would have detrimental effects in all cases, and that less engineered sites would benefit more from flow reductions. The lack of a suitable habitat for fry is shown to be a limiting factor for fish at all sites.

AB  - This letter is dedicated to a generic approach for the automated detection and classification of man-made objects in urban corridors from point clouds acquired by vehicle-borne mobile laser scanning (MLS). The approach is designed based on a priori knowledge in urban areas: 1) man-made objects feature geometric regularity such as vertical planar structures (e. g., building facades), whereas vegetation reveals huge diversity in shape and point distribution and 2) different types of urban man-made objects can be characterized by the point extension and the height above the ground level. Therefore, MLS-based point clouds are first divided into three layers with respect to the vertical height. In each layer, seed points of man-made objects are indicated by a line filter in the footprints of off-ground objects, which is generated by binarizing the spatial accumulation map of the point clouds. These seed points are further classified by examining in which layers the seed points of objects are found. Finally, points belonging to respective objects can be retrieved based on the classified seed points. The experiments show that various man-made objects on both sides of the street can be well detected, with a detection rate of up to 83%. For the classification of detected urban objects, overall accuracy of 92.37% can be achieved.

AB  - Impact mitigation practices are currently one of the hottest topics in conservation and regarded as priorities worldwide. Forest bat populations are known to provide important ecosystem services such as pest control and bat boxes have become one of the most popular management options for counteracting the loss of roosts. However, bat boxes tend to be employed in non-native forests near highly humanized areas where human disturbance is higher. The aim of this study was to evaluate how the surrounding landscape composition affects bat box occupancy in urban non-native forests along the Mediterranean corridor in the Northeastern Iberian Peninsula. Two hundred wooden bat boxes were monitored in young non-native forests in the period 2004-2012. The influence of land cover on occupancy rate of bat boxes was analysed at the landscape level in a 5 km buffer around bat-box stations. In total, 1659 inspections were carried out, in which a 15 % occupancy rate was detected. Bat boxes hosted three different species (Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Pipistrellus kuhlii and Nyctalus leisleri). More than 70 % of the occupancy can be explained by habitat and spatial composition. The presence of urban areas around bat boxes tends to have a negative impact on bat occupation rates; by contrast, forest coverage has a positive effect, especially for the tree-dwelling bats. These patterns could be associated with the large number of available roosts in buildings, microhabitat or phylopatry. Thus, to increase success, we suggest that landscape composition should be considered when using bat boxes for conservation.

AB  - Complex landscapes interact with meteorological processes to generate climatically suitable habitat (refuges) in otherwise hostile environments. Locating these refuges has practical importance in tropical montane regions where a high diversity of climatically specialized species is threatened by climate change. Here, we use a combination of weather data and spatial modeling to quantify thermally buffered environments in a regional tropical rainforest. We do this by constructing a spatial surface of maximum air temperature that takes into account important climate-mediating processes. We find a strong attenuating effect of elevation, distance from coast and foliage cover on maximum temperature. The core habitat of a disproportionately high number of endemic species (45%) is encompassed within just 25% of the coolest identified rainforest. We demonstrate how this data can be used to (i) identify important areas of cool habitat for protection and (ii) efficiently guide restoration in degraded landscapes to expand extant networks of critical cool habitat.

AB  - Natural riparian corridors can serve as biodiversity reservoirs in urban environments. Despite the many opportunities that riparian corridors present for biodiversity conservation within urban environments, they may present conservation challenges by providing a thriving hub for local and alien invasive plants. The aim of the study was to map and characterise the occurrence of local and alien invasive plants along the natural green riparian corridors in Lusaka district of Zambia. A combination of field surveys and remote sensing approaches using Sentinel-2 imagery were employed to conduct the vegetation mapping and characterise the invasive plant proliferation. Five local and nine alien invasive plant species were identified within the natural green riparian corridors at 23 field survey sites. A total of 108 plant species were recorded in the study area out of which 57 were grasses of the Poacea family, five were local invasive and nine were alien invasive plant species. Six of the invasive plant species were mapped using Sentinel-2 data. The study showed that 47.35% of areal extent of the natural green riparian corridors in Lusaka had invasive and alien plant presence. Invasive and alien plant richness was determined to affect non-invasive plant richness and diversity. There was no linear association between poverty and percentage cover of invasive plant species but percentage cover of invasive plants seemed to be concentrated around wards with a poverty headcount around 0.15. The outcomes of this research are relevant for the management of invasive species within natural green corridors in urban areas.

AB  - This study documents the distribution of the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile), a well known invader of urban and agricultural ecosystems, in a riparian corridor near San Luis Obispo, California. Sampling of the ant community was done using pitfall traps placed along transects that crossed three vegetation types found at the study site: (1) riparian woodland dominated by coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), and willow (Salix: spp.) (2) Hard chaparral dominated by scrub oak (Q. dumosa) and silk-tassel bush (Garrya sl.) (3) Coastal scrub dominated by black sage (Salvia mellifera), California sagebrush (Artemisia californica), and Yucca (Yucca whipplei). Linepithema humile has become well established throughout the lower reaches of the study site except in the chaparral vegetation. Ten species of native ants were found in the study area, but there was little to no correlation or cooccurrence between L. humile and native ant species. Total species diversity in areas where L. humile occurred was significantly less than in areas where L. humile was absent. These results suggest that invasion by L. humile is restricted by habitat type, and has significant negative impacts on native ant diversity.

AB  - Conservation of critical habitats for shorebirds (Charadriiformes : Charadrii), usually requires spatially explicit identification of each habitat. Most non-breeding shorebirds depend on two critical habitats: foraging (intertidal flats) and roosting (safe and open supratidal sites). We used published information on use of high-tide roosts by shorebirds to develop models of roost selection (probability of occurrence) and usage (mean abundance) for 12 species of shorebirds spending the non-breeding season in Moreton Bay, in subtropical eastern Australia. Selection of roosts was most strongly affected by the proximity to a large foraging area, field of view and to a lesser extent by composition of the surrounding landscape. Abundance of the most common species, such as Bar-tailed Godwit (Limosa lapponica), Eastern Curlew (Numenius madagascariensis) and Whimbrel (N. phaeopus), depended on distance to the nearest large foraging area or the size of the roost per se. Our results suggest that the shorebird species occurring in a subtropical Australian estuary use two generalised types of roosts: exposed ocean-front roosts typified by supratidal spits and sandbars and patches of claypan saltmarsh in the upper reaches of the tidal range surrounded by mangroves. The amount of these habitats available in Moreton Bay was examined by visiting unmonitored sites with a predicted high probability of occupancy by two key species, Eastern Curlew and Bar-tailed Godwit. Few of the unmonitored sites currently supported many shorebirds. These data suggest that despite the high demand on coastal land for urban development in Moreton Bay, suitable roosting habitat is still available near their foraging areas.

AB  - The straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) is a pteropodid whose conservation is crucial for maintaining functional connectivity of plant populations in tropical Africa. Land conversion has pushed this species to adapt to roosting in urban centers across its range. These colonies often host millions of individuals, creating intensive human-bat contact interfaces that could facilitate the spillover of coronaviruses shed by these bats. A better understanding of coronavirus dynamics in these roosts is needed to identify peak times of exposure risk in order to propose evidence-based management that supports safe human-bat coexistence, as well as the conservation of this chiropteran. We studied the temporal patterns of coronavirus shedding in E. helvum, by testing thousands of longitudinally-collected fecal samples from two spatially distant urban roosts in Ghana and Tanzania. Shedding of coronaviruses peaked during the second part of pup weaning in both roosts. Assuming that coronavirus shedding is directly related to spillover risk, our results indicate that exposure mitigation should target reducing contact between people and E. helvum roosts during the pup "weaning" period. This recommendation can be applied across the many highly-populated urban sites occupied by E. helvum across Africa.

AB  - The Byzantine road system in Cappadocia (Turkey) is known in reasonable detail. Reconstructions of the road system by Hild (1977) show the most probable location of the routes that were built and maintained by the imperial administration. Unlike the earlier Roman routes, these were not only built to establish fast connections between major cities; rather, they were intended to connect all administrative and religious centres in the area. A conspicuous element of this connecting network is the fact that road junctions are found in the countryside, without any corresponding traces of settlement. Least cost path models trying to connect the centres will inevitably fail to identify these junctions, since LCP modelling will only create routes between single sources and targets, and not find the optimal network solution to connect three or more destinations. Steiner trees are an appropriate mathematical solution to deal with this problem; however, applications in GIS are lacking up to now. In this paper we would like to present the preliminary results of a case study showing that it is technically possible to use Steiner trees in conjunction with cost surfaces. The modelling results seem promising, as the resulting connections are closer to the documented ones than those resulting from least cost path modelling. However, there are substantial unresolved issues regarding the implementation of this method in GIS.

AB  - Deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs) are the primary source of mortality for the endangered Florida Key deer (Odocoileus virginianus clavium). Of these collisions, >50% occur on United States Highway 1 (US 1), the primary roadway connecting the islands in the Florida Keys, USA. The DVCs on the 5.6-km section of US 1 on Big Pine Key are responsible for approximately 26% of annual Key deer mortality, but extensive urban development along this highway segment complicates efforts to reduce DVCs using traditional methods (e.g., fencing, underpasses). In 2002, a continuous 2.6-km system of 2.4-m fencing, 2 underpasses, and 4 experimental deer guards was completed. We evaluated the long-term effectiveness of these highway improvements in reducing DVCs within an urban landscape. Deer used the underpasses all 7 postconstruction years (2003-2009) with dramatic increases in use over the course of the project. Roadway fencing largely eliminated deer intrusion onto the fenced area of US 1. Although well-maintained fencing effectively restricted deer movement onto the fenced section of US 1 (73-100% decline), other sections of US 1 experienced increases in DVCs. Overall, highway improvements along the US 1 corridor were effective in reducing Key deer mortality over the long-term. The success of deer guards in preventing deer access into the fenced section of US 1 supported the feasibility of implementing similar wildlife exclusion projects in other urban areas.

AB  - We completed a floristic inventory of the James River Park System (JRPS), a ca. 223-hectare (550-acre) multi-unit park along the James River in Richmond, Virginia. The JRPS includes land within the riparian zone along a 13-kilometer (8-mile) stretch of the river that bisects the city, providing two million annual visitors with recreational access to the rapids along the "Falls of the James." Although the vegetation within the park system is an important attraction for park-goers, information on the flora of the JRPS and this section of the James River corridor is limited. This study updates partial records of the JRPS flora from ca. 50 years ago with collections that were made over the span of three growing seasons from 2016-2018. A total of 566 species and sub-specific taxa were documented from 336 genera and 115 families, including 63 new botanical records for the locality. Native species comprise 60.4% of the overall species richness, with dominant families including Asteraceae, Poaceae, and Cyperaceae. Non-native invasive species are prevalent throughout the park: 51 species are listed on the Virginia Invasive Plant Species List, 21 of which carry a "high" invasiveness rank. Four state listed rare species were documented within the park, and seven other state-rare "watchlist" species were found. The information presented here is being used to help guide management efforts of the JRPS Invasive Plant Task Force, an organization dedicated to the removal of non-native invasive species, restoration of natural habitats, and preservation of natural communities within the park system.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of road and highway proximity on the occurrence of bird species in isolated secondary pine forest fragments in an agricultural matrix. We assessed the effects of road proximity separately for three different groups of bird species in order to detect ecological responses related to species biology. Bird occurrence was mainly related to fragment size but also to vegetation structure and fragment connectivity. When corrected for patch characteristics, we found that fragments up to 2 km away from a main highway contained less forest species, both generalists and specialists than fragments more distantly located. This pattern was independent of the side of the highway analysed. Considering each bird species separately, we found consistent lower occurrence probabilities near the highway in 50% of forest species. This difference was not found for ubiquitous species that were to some extent positively influenced by proximity of other major roads. Our results suggest that highway proximity, but not that of other major roads, decrease occupancy probability of forest birds in isolated forest fragments, thus reducing probability of metapopulation persistence. Although low habitat quality as a result of noise disturbance is likely to account for some of the results, the long distance effect detected strongly suggests that other factors rather than direct traffic disturbance alone are involved in lower bird occurrences near the highway. Decreased connectivity among forest fragments associated to avoidance of areas near the highway is an alternative explanation to the results obtained. We suggest that these findings should be included in strategic environmental impact assessment studies conducted to determine the ecological impact of large transport infrastructures across highly fragmented landscapes.

AB  - Concerns over the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in farmland have prompted the development of agri-environment policy measures aimed at reducing farming pressure and maintaining semi-natural habitats in farmed landscapes. However, further knowledge is needed to guarantee successful agri-environment measures implementation. The current study assessed the quantity and the quality of semi-natural habitats in farms across a gradient of farming intensities in two contrasting regions in Ireland. Policy protection seemed fundamental for semi-natural habitats preservation. Habitats not protected by agricultural policy relied on extensive farming and are in danger of disappearing if they are intensified or abandoned. Due to the lack of policy incentives for habitat quality, no correlations were found between farming intensity and share of semi-natural habitats with habitat quality. Therefore, extensive farming and retention of habitats alone may not reverse the decline of farmland quality and biodiverisity and, thus, measures incentivising the environmental quality may be more successful.

AB  - Dengue is a growing public health problem in tropical and subtropical cities. It is transmitted by mosquitoes, and the main strategy for epidemic prevention and control is insecticide fumigation. Effective management is, however, proving elusive. People's day-to-day movement about the city is believed to be an important factor in the epidemiological dynamics. We use a simple model to examine the fundamental roles of broad demographic and spatial structures in epidemic initiation, growth and control. We show that the key factors are local dilution, characterised by the vector-host ratio, and spatial connectivity, characterised by the extent of habitually variable movement patterns. Epidemic risk in the population is driven by the demographic groups that frequent the areas with the highest vector-host ratio, even if they only spend some of their time there. Synchronisation of epidemic trajectories in different demographic groups is governed by the vector-host ratios to which they are exposed and the strength of connectivity. Strategies for epidemic prevention and management may be made more effective if they take into account the fluctuating landscape of transmission intensity associated with spatial heterogeneity in the vector-host ratio and people's day-to-day movement patterns.

AB  - Fuel management for wildfire protection is becoming increasingly common in the wildland-urban interface and may have conservation implications for species with restricted distributions and limited dispersal abilities. To evaluate the impact of forest fuel management on the damselfly Argia vivida at the northern margin of its range, we examined terrestrial movements and habitat associations using Capture-Mark-Recapture and point count techniques. We found that habitats away from the springs were particularly important for A. vivida females. Most damselflies travelled at least 50 m between capture and recapture and patches of cleared forest up to this size did not pose a barrier to movement. Although A. vivida typically roosts in trees at night, cleared fuel treatment areas were preferred over unmodified or thinned forest as daytime basking and foraging sites. Preferred sites were also characterized by heterogeneous canopy closure, i.e., a clearing adjacent to unmodified forest with a closed canopy. We speculate that this behaviour derives from the species' thermoregulation requirements; the use of sunspots for thermal basking during the day and the use of forest cover at night to slow the radiant loss of heat. Our findings demonstrate the scale of movements that define available habitat and the importance of both daytime and night time habitat requirements in considering terrestrial foraging and movement corridors. Consequently, conservation efforts for this species in fuel management areas should focus on maintaining unmodified stands of dense trees in association with cleared patches of appropriate dimension, rather than a uniformly thinned forest.

AB  - The importance of wildlife conservation in the agricultural Midwest has long been recognized. Likewise, the impact of habitat fragmentation within human-perturbed landscapes has received increased attention. Theoretically there exists an optimum degree of fragmentation at the landscape scale (e.g. to maintain both interior and edge species) that will permit an integrative approach to sustainable agriculture, as well as to conserve biotic diversity at a greater spatial and temporal scale. We propose a method for comparing biotic diversity within and between fragmented landscapes. This method encompasses both natural and human-subsidized components of the landscape mosaic.
   A sustainable landscape approach to conserving biotic diversity will require the cooperation of land-use planners, public land owners, policy makers, resource managers, and wildlife biologists, to name a few, at a scale seldom addressed in a human-dominated landscape. We describe a representative watershed (Four-Mile Creek Watershed) in Ohio and Indiana within which we outline an approach to wildlife habitat conservation that attempts to optimize biotic diversity and sustainable agricultural productivity. A new paradigm, namely agrolandscape ecology, is needed if we are to manage landscape elements (corridors and patches) within an agricultural landscape matrix. Approaches using ecological theory, hierarchy theory, landscape planning, and problem-solving algorithms must be integrated if society is to simultaneously increase habitat quality and implement a sustainability approach to landscape management.

AB  - Organismal traits interact with environmental variation to mediate how species respond to shared landscapes. Thus, differences in traits related to dispersal ability or physiological tolerance may result in phylogeographic discordance among co-distributed taxa, even when they are responding to common barriers. We quantified climatic suitability and stability, and phylogeographic divergence within three reed frog species complexes across the Guineo-Congolian forests and Gulf of Guinea archipelago of Central Africa to investigate how they responded to a shared climatic and geological history. Our species-specific estimates of climatic suitability through time are consistent with temporal and spatial heterogeneity in diversification among the species complexes, indicating that differences in ecological breadth may partly explain these idiosyncratic patterns. Likewise, we demonstrated that fluctuating sea levels periodically exposed a land bridge connecting Bioko Island with the mainland Guineo-Congolian forest and that habitats across the exposed land bridge likely enabled dispersal in some species, but not in others. We did not find evidence that rivers are biogeographic barriers across any of the species complexes. Despite marked differences in the geographic extent of stable climates and temporal estimates of divergence among the species complexes, we recovered a shared pattern of intermittent climatic suitability with recent population connectivity and demographic expansion across the Congo Basin. This pattern supports the hypothesis that genetic exchange across the Congo Basin during humid periods, followed by vicariance during arid periods, has shaped regional diversity. Finally, we identified many distinct lineages among our focal taxa, some of which may reflect incipient or unrecognized species.

AB  - We studied the reproduction and dispersal of giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum) at its northern distribution limit in North America (Quebec, 2014-2016) to better understand the invasion dynamics of the species along rivers. Seeds were collected from a riparian population to conduct germination, floatation, and dispersal experiments. Data were analysed in comparison with a real invasion case that was initiated about 10years ago along a river system. In Quebec, giant hogweed individuals produce on average 14,000 to 16,000 seeds with a germination rate of 75-85%. Seeds with endosperm that fall in water likely sink within 5hr. Along a small brook, most disperse over short distances (<40m) in summer, although some can travel 100-300m. These data suggest that late-summer or early-fall water dispersal of seeds would not explain the magnitude and rapidity of the invasion patterns observed along streams. We suggest that late-fall and, especially, spring floods are the most efficient dispersal vectors for giant hogweed seeds and are likely responsible for the establishment of populations kilometres downstream from introduction points along river systems. The spread of giant hogweed would consequently be less influenced in the near future by a rise in temperature than by a change in the magnitude or timing of flood events.

AB  - Landscape heterogeneity plays an integral role in shaping ecological and evolutionary processes. Despite links between the two disciplines, ecologists and population geneticists have taken different approaches to evaluating habitat selection, animal movement, and gene flow across the landscape. Ecologists commonly use statistical models such as resource selection functions (RSFs) to identify habitat features disproportionately selected by animals, whereas population genetic approaches model genetic differentiation according to the distribution of habitat variables. We combined ecological and genetic approaches by using RSFs to predict genetic relatedness across a heterogeneous landscape. We constructed sex-and season-specific resistance surfaces based on RSFs estimated using data from 102 GPS (global positioning system) radio-collared mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) in southeast Alaska, USA. Based on mountain goat ecology, we hypothesized that summer and male surfaces would be the best predictors of relatedness. All individuals were genotyped at 22 microsatellite loci, which we used to estimate genetic relatedness. Summer resistance surfaces derived from RSFs were the best predictors of genetic relatedness, and winter models the poorest. Mountain goats generally selected for areas close to escape terrain and with a high heat load (a metric related to vegetative productivity and snow depth), while avoiding valleys. Male- and female-specific surfaces were similar, except for winter, for which male habitat selection better predicted genetic relatedness. The null models of isolation-by-distance and barrier only outperformed the winter models. This study merges high-resolution individual locations through GPS telemetry and genetic data, that can be used to validate and parameterize landscape genetics models, and further elucidates the relationship between landscape heterogeneity and genetic differentiation.

AB  - A number of societal changes such as an ageing population and a lack of economic prosperity mean that Japanese greenway planners will be faced with a number of new challenges in the coming decades. These societal changes will be particularly dramatic in the Japanese New Towns, which were constructed in the late 1950s. Some of these New Towns marked a departure for Japanese planning by including a network of greenways, which were planned to provide pleasant corridors for pedestrians and bikers. Around 30 years have passed since these areas were developed; today the greenways in these New Towns have become corridors with dense and rich greenery. Such matured greenways, which were supposed to provide an amenity for local residents, have increasingly come to be regarded as a cause of fear of crime. To try and mitigate this, trees and shrubs along the greenways are now closely trimmed or even removed.
   However, such mature vegetation along the greenways may be regarded as a feature that maintains the history of the town. Such vegetation is also expected to provide ecological corridors that accommodate wildlife species which were abundant in the rural areas surrounding these New Towns. Within the context of proposing an optimum management scheme for Japanese greenways, the following study aims to explain and discuss how the fear of crime on greenways can be prevented whilst maintaining their ecological and historical functions.

AB  - This article examines the evolution of the current legal and planning system influencing urban rivers in New South Wales. A future direction for legislators and policy makers is presented as a means to improve the condition of urban waterways. Ensuring water management professionals appropriately value river systems is a key element. Waterways occupy a tenuous position in the urban landscape despite their ecological significance, often providing the last refuges for biodiversity. Smaller waterways are often piped to improve stormwater drainage, while larger systems are chemically, physically and biologically degraded as a result of development within the catchment. Legal, planning and policy arrangements have historically provided limited protection for urban waterways and riparian environments. This is due to four main factors: rivers are traditionally valued for their utility as conduits for stormwater to manage flooding; the biodiversity value of riparian areas is not widely understood and acknowledged; the cumulative impacts of development on river health are not recognised; and an inadequate legal definition for river in legislation and at common law. The fate of many urban riparian environments is often determined due to death by a thousand pipes.

AB  - wide variety of topographical and environmental elements have been shown or proposed to influence the movement decisions of dispersing animals. Most real landscapes have topographical elements such as hills, valleys and urban developments, which can all act to modify a species' perceptual range and directly influence movement behaviour. If a visual-based perceptual ability enables a dispersing individual to locate suitable habitat patches at a distance, then it is to be expected that topographical features would act to modify the overall success of this strategy. However, the majority of individual-based Spatially Explicit Population Models (SEPM) employ only two-dimensional landscapes.
   To investigate the effects of topographical elevation on dispersal patterns, a three-dimensional visual-based perceptual range algorithm was added to the dispersal rules of an individual-based SEPM. To explore the possible influences of a behavioural-based response to topography, an algorithm modelling valley-seeking behaviour was also developed. The performance of both algorithms was compared with that of a two-dimensional visual-based perceptual range algorithm. The overall consequences of dispersal under each algorithm were measured by recording population sizes in a target wood in the centre of a modelled, real landscape.
   The size of the population in the target wood, modelled using both of the three-dimensional algorithms, exhibited sensitivity to the direction of dispersal in interaction with perceptual range, which differed from that predicted by the two-dimensional approach. Population size was dependant on the spatial configuration of habitat patches and on the topography of the landscape, both of which could guide dispersers either towards or away from the target patch depending on the particular combinations of dispersal directions and perceptual ranges selected. Topography was found to have a greater effect on dispersal at shorter perceptual ranges, and thresholds in the results for all three algorithms suggested the existence of species and landscape dependant optimal perceptual ranges. It is recommended that both topography and topographical-based dispersal-altering algorithms, commensurate with the studied species' behaviour, be incorporated into the movement rule-base of dispersal simulation models. The modelling of topography and its effects on movement in patchy landscapes are seen as essential ingredients in future landscape planning. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper describes a method of mapping riparian vegetation in semi-arid to arid environments using the Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The method successfully identified a range of riparian community types across the entire state of Nevada, USA, which spans 7 degrees of latitude and almost 4000 m of elevation. The landscape was stratified into units of similar elevation and solar exposure, and riparian areas were identified as having anomalously high NDVI within a local neighborhood. Thousands of calibration points were used in a simplex optimization to select the spatial neighborhood, the elevation and insolation strata, the minimum NDVI to be considered as potentially riparian, the number of standard deviations from the mean for an anomaly to be classified as riparian, and a limit on upslope position. Mapping of subpixel riparian corridors was improved by applying a directional high-pass filter to the NDVI data. Irrigated areas in agricultural and urban areas were removed based on land ownership maps and manual editing. The final map was tested with 400 independent test points: producer's accuracy was 84.6% and user's accuracy was 93.5%. This method should be broadly useful for mapping riparian features across large and complex regions with arid to semi-arid environments.

AB  - Birds are among the most widely studied organisms on earth and represent an important indicator group for learning about the effects of climate change - particularly in regard to the effects of climate change on tropical ecosystems. In this review, we assess the potential impacts of climate change on tropical birds and discuss the factors that affect species' ability to adapt and survive the impending alterations in habitat availability. Tropical mountain birds, species without access to higher elevations, coastal forest birds, and restricted-range species are especially vulnerable. Some birds may be especially susceptible to increased rainfall seasonality and to extreme weather events, such as heat waves, cold spells, and tropical cyclones. Birds that experience limited temperature variation and have low basal metabolic rates will be the most prone to the physiological effects of warming temperatures and heat waves. Mostly unknown species' interactions, indirect effects, and synergies of climate change with other threats, such as habitat loss, emerging diseases, invasive species, and hunting will exacerbate the effects of climate change on tropical birds. In some models habitat loss can increase bird extinctions caused by climate change by 50%. 3.5 degrees C surface warming by the year 2100 may result in 600-900 extinctions of land bird species, 89% of which occur in the tropics. Depending on the amount of future habitat loss, each degree of surface warming could lead to approximately 100-500 additional bird extinctions. Protected areas will be more important than ever, but they need to be designed with climate change in mind. Although 92% of currently protected areas are likely to become climatically unsuitable in a century, for example only 7 or 8 priority species' preferred climatic envelopes are projected to be entirely lost from the African Important Bird Area network. Networks of protected areas need to incorporate extensive topographical diversity, cover wide elevational ranges, have high connectivity, and integrate human-dominated landscapes into conservation schemes. Most tropical bird species vulnerable to climate change are not currently considered threatened with extinction, often due to lack of knowledge; systematically and regularly gathering information on the ecology, and current and future distributions of these species is an urgent priority. Locally based, long-term tropical bird monitoring and conservation programs based on adaptive management are essential to help protect birds against climate change.

AB  - The complex landscape history of the Neotropics has generated opportunities for population isolation and diversification that place this region among the most species-rich in the world. Detailed phylogeographic studies are required to uncover the biogeographic histories of Neotropical taxa, to identify evolutionary correlates of diversity, and to reveal patterns of genetic connectivity, disjunction, and potential differentiation among lineages from different areas of endemism. The White-crowned Manakin (Pseudopipra pipra) is a small suboscine passerine bird that is broadly distributed through the subtropical rainforests of Central America, the lower montane cloud forests of the Andes from Colombia to central Peru, the lowlands of Amazonia and the Guianas, and the Atlantic forest of southeast Brazil. Pseudopipra is currently recognized as a single, polytypic biological species. We studied the effect of the Neotropical landscape on genetic and phenotypic differentiation within this species using genomic data derived from double digest restriction site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD), and mitochondrial DNA. Most of the genetic breakpoints we identify among populations coincide with physical barriers to gene flow previously associated with avian areas of endemism. The phylogenetic relationships among these populations imply a novel pattern of Andean origination for this group, with subsequent diversification into the Amazonian lowlands. Our analysis of genomic admixture and gene flow reveals a complex history of introgression between some western Amazonian populations. These reticulate processes confound our application of standard concatenated and coalescent phylogenetic methods and raise the question of whether a lineage in the western Napo area of endemism should be considered a hybrid species. Lastly, analysis of variation in vocal and plumage phenotypes in the context of our phylogeny supports the hypothesis that Pseudopipra is a species-complex composed of at least 8, and perhaps up to 17 distinct species which have arisen in the last similar to 2.5 Ma.

AB  - Mexico has one of the richest tropical forests, but is also one of the most deforested in Mesoamerica. Species lists updates and accurate information on the geographic distribution of species are necessary for baseline studies in ecology and conservation of these sites. Here, we present an updated list of the diversity of amphibians and reptiles in the Lacandona region, and actualized information on their distribution and conservation status. Although some studies have discussed the amphibians and reptiles of the Lacandona, most herpetological lists came from the northern part of the region, and there are no confirmed records for many of the species assumed to live in the region. After reviewing databases of scientific collections and published herpetological lists, and adding new information from our 2007 to 2013 inventories of the southeastern Lacandona rainforest, we recorded 124 species (89 reptiles and 35 amphibians) for the region. Nine amphibians (25.7%) and 2 (2.2%) reptiles are endemic to the Mayan forest (from the Lacandona, in Mexico, to the Mayan Mountains in Belize). Four amphibians and three reptiles appeared to be restricted to the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, suggesting that they are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and degradation. On average, the region shares less than 60% of the species with neighboring Mexican tropical forests (e.g., Las Choapas region and Los Tuxtlas, Calakmul, and Sian- Ka'an Biosphere Reserves). Of the herpetofauna evaluated, the Mexican government threatened species list (NOM 059) indicates that seven species (20%) are under a risk category, while the IUCN indicates that only seven species (10.1%) are at risk. Our findings indicate that Lacandona is of great importance for the conservation of the Mesoamerican herpetofauna. Nevertheless, increasing deforestation levels add further uncertainties to the maintenance of amphibians and reptiles among other vertebrates in the region.

AB  - Aim Given the influence of seasonality on most ecological systems, an emerging research area attempts to understand how community network structure is shaped by seasonal climatic variations. To do so, most researchers conduct their analyses using open networks due to the high cost associated with constructing their own community networks. However, unwanted structural differences from the unique sampling and construction methods used to create each open network likely make comparing these networks a difficult task. Here, with the largest set of open bipartite networks collected to date, we test whether seasonal climatic variations explain network structure while additionally accounting for construction/sampling differences between networks. Location Trying to approach global. Time period Contemporary. Major taxa studied Plants and animals. Methods Using 723 open bipartite networks, we test whether temperature and/or precipitation seasonality explains (un)weighted metrics of nestedness, modularity or specialization across plant-pollinator, seed-dispersal, plant-ant, host-parasite or plant-herbivore systems. Results Generally, seasonality only weakly explained network structure: at most 16% of the variation in weighted metrics and 5% of the variation in unweighted metrics. Instead, a control for sampling bias in networks, sampling intensity, often better explained many of the network structural metrics. When limiting our analyses to only intensely sampled networks, however, about 33% of the variation in weighted modularity and specialization was explained by seasonality, but only in plant-pollinator networks. Main conclusions Altogether, we do not find strong evidence that seasonality explains network structure. Our study also highlights the large amount of structural differences in open networks, likely from the many different sampling and network construction techniques adopted by researchers when constructing networks. Hence, a definitive test for the relationship between network structure and seasonality across large spatial extents will require a dataset free from sampling and other biases, where networks are derived from a consistent sampling protocol that appropriately characterizes communities.

AB  - Aim: Biodiversity hotspots often span international borders, thus conservation efforts must as well. China is one of the most biodiverse countries and the length of its international land borders is the longest in the world; thus, there is a strong need for transboundary conservation. We identify China's transboundary conservation hotspots and analyse the potential effects of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) on them to provide recommendations for conservation actions. Location: China, Asia. Methods: We compiled a species list of terrestrial vertebrates that span China's borders. Using their distribution, we extracted the top 30% of the area with the highest richness value weighted by Red List category and considered these transboundary hotspots for conservation priority. Then we analysed protected area (PA) coverage and connectivity to identify conservation gaps. To measure potential impact of the BRI, we counted the species whose distribution range is traversed by the BRI, and calculated the aggregation index, proportion of natural land and night light index along its routes. Results: We identified 1964 terrestrial vertebrate species living in the border region. We identified four transboundary hotspots and found insufficient PA coverage and low connectivity in three of them. The BRI routes intersected all four hotspots and traversed 82.4% (1619/1964) of the transboundary species, half of which (918) are sensitive to the potential risks brought by the BRI. Night light index increased generally along the BRI. However, the proportion of natural land and the aggregation index near the BRI showed different trends in hotspots. Main Conclusions: There is an urgent need for conservation action in China's transboundary region. The BRI should put biodiversity conservation at the core of its development strategy. Furthermore, we suggest using the planned BRI as a platform for dialogue and consultation, knowledge and data sharing, and joint planning to promote transboundary conservation.

AB  - For many children today, the easiest available outdoor environment is their school ground. However, school grounds shaped by adult priorities for neatness, simplicity of maintenance, safety, the demands of team sports, and the surveillance and behavior management of children are often devoid of biodiversity. We investigated elementary and secondary students' (n = 300) valuation of naturalized versus traditional school grounds with the help of computer-aided photo editing. Photographs of a traditional school ground (paved and asphalted ground bordered by trimmed hedges and some trees) were enriched either with species-poor lawns or with species- and structurally-rich elements such as wildflower meadows, diverse flowerbeds, and an area with a diversity of shrubs. Overall, scenarios enriched with vegetation were clearly preferred over status quo ones. They were characterized as beautiful and interesting, while the latter were characterized as boring and ugly. The best-liked scenario included a dry stack wall, a rock flowerbed, a gravel path, and a stone bench. Species-rich wildflower meadows were also rather appreciated, especially by girls. However, the younger the children were, the more did they like the species-poor lawn scenarios. We also included some school garden elements (diverse vegetable plots and raised garden beds) in our visualizations, which were, however, perceived as rather untidy. Our results indicate that the inclusion of biodiverse small-scale enrichments may increase the aesthetic appeal of traditional school grounds as long as they are not perceived as untidy - a perception which was stronger in older than younger students. The present enrichments could be integrated into school grounds without major redesign of the sites. However, students need also built structures like gravel paths and benches, which provide them with access to a site or offer opportunities to relax and socialize.

AB  - Spatial and seasonal distribution of amphibians in four ponds at mountainous region in southeastern of Brazil: influence of forest corridor. This study evaluated the composition of anuran assemblages, and also the spatial and temporal distribution of those species in four permanent ponds. Two of these ponds are connected to Atlantic rainforest fragments by forest corridor and the other two are surrounded by Eucalyptus plantation and human settlement. Twenty-two species from five families were recorded from December 2003 to November 2004. Most species and individuals collected belong to Hylidae, which presented pronounced spatial overlap. Vegetation under 0.60 m was the most used calling site. Although not statistically supported, species richness and abundance were higher in rainy than dry months. Ponds with corridors had higher species richness and fourteen species were exclusively found on these ponds. The community structure of anurans in permanent ponds at this fragmented landscape is apparently dictated by the presence or absence of forest corridors connecting ponds to forest fragments.

AB  - Alluvial and colluvial sequences were studied around the prehistoric tell Arslantepe in 11 exposures and additional auger cores. The chronology is based on 11 optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages, four radiocarbon ages, and the embedded artifacts. Sediments contained wood charcoals, providing information on former vegetation. Fluvial activity is documented during Late Glacial times (15.4 +/- 2.5, 12.8 +/- 3.1kyr) and frequently after Roman times. Slope and soil erosion occurred in the early (10.6 +/- 1.4, 8.2 +/- 0.7kyr) and mid-late Holocene (6.7 +/- 0.9, 5.4 +/- 0.7-4.7 +/- 0.7, 2.6 +/- 0.2-2.5 +/- 0.2, 1.9 +/- 0.2-1.8 +/- 0.2kyr, and during the last 1000 years). The early Holocene erosion phases pre-date the so far established onset of settlement at the tell. This either indicates an earlier onset of agricultural land use than assumed or climatic influence on erosion, such as the 10.3 and 8.2kyr climate events known from Western Europe. The erosion phases at around 5.0 and 2.6kyr could reflect geomorphic responses to societal collapse (Late Chalcolithic state, Neo-Hittite kingdom) at Arslantepe. Most intensive Holocene soil erosion and landscape degradation occurred after occupation of the region by the Roman Empire. This is paralleled by the onset of river activity. A part of the lower neo-Hittite town as well as an early Holocene Terra Rossa-like soil that had formed rapidly were found buried. So far, no indication for mid-late Holocene fluvial activity of the adjacent creeks until Roman times has been found. Our results illustrate the large potential of slope deposits for long term reconstructions of human induced landscape transformation in Anatolia.

AB  - Ecophylogenetics can be viewed as an emerging fusion of ecology, biogeography and macroevolution. This new and fast-growing field is promoting the incorporation of evolution and historical contingencies into the ecological research agenda through the widespread use of phylogenetic data. Including phylogeny into ecological thinking represents an opportunity for biologists from different fields to collaborate and has provided promising avenues of research in both theoretical and empirical ecology, towards a better understanding of the assembly of communities, the functioning of ecosystems and their responses to environmental changes. The time is ripe to assess critically the extent to which the integration of phylogeny into these different fields of ecology has delivered on its promise. Here we review how phylogenetic information has been used to identify better the key components of species interactions with their biotic and abiotic environments, to determine the relationships between diversity and ecosystem functioning and ultimately to establish good management practices to protect overall biodiversity in the face of global change. We evaluate the relevance of information provided by phylogenies to ecologists, highlighting current potential weaknesses and needs for future developments. We suggest that despite the strong progress that has been made, a consistent unified framework is still missing to link local ecological dynamics to macroevolution. This is a necessary step in order to interpret observed phylogenetic patterns in a wider ecological context. Beyond the fundamental question of how evolutionary history contributes to shape communities, ecophylogenetics will help ecology to become a better integrative and predictive science.

AB  - Little information is available on the ecology of Aedes aegypti Linnaeus at the southern extreme of its distribution (Buenos Aires, Argentina), particularly on microhabitat suitability. The aim of our study was to identify at a detailed scale, microhabitat factors that correlate with the presence of preimaginal stages of the mosquito. In March 2001, we performed a spatial census of all containers located in a 1 ha patch within a cemetery in Buenos Aires City. On a reference map (1:700) we plotted the position of graves and surrounding corridors, the location of containers, the shade projected by each plant between 10:00 and 16:00 h and vegetation cover. We classified vegetation by height, substrate by composition and shadow by level of exposure to sunlight. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses with nine constructed independent variables, some of them at scales of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 10 m. Of 850 receptacles examined, 101 contained preimaginal stages of Ae. aegypti. Level of exposure to sunlight, type of substratum, vegetation height and distance of containers to vegetation were significantly associated with the presence of breeding sites at the studied scales. Final multivariate models were significant at scales of 2 m (chi(2)((3)) 25.693, p<0.001), and 3m (chi(2)((3)) = 26.440, p < 0.001), and 65.9 and 66.8% of our data were correctly classified, respectively, for each scale. Our results suggest that sites less exposed to sunlight, with taller and closer vegetation, and in shaded and vegetated neighbourhoods were the most favourable microhabitats for Ae. aegypti breeding.

AB  - Forested riparian corridors are thought to minimize impacts of landscape disturbance on stream ecosystems; yet, the effectiveness of streamside forests in mitigating disturbance in urbanizing catchments is unknown. We expected that riparian forests would provide minimal benefits for fish assemblages in streams that are highly impaired by sediment or hydrologic alteration. We tested this hypothesis in 30 small streams along a gradient of urban disturbance (1-65% urban land cover). Species expected to be sensitive to disturbance (i.e., fluvial specialists and "sensitive" species that respond negatively to urbanization) were best predicted by models including percent forest cover in the riparian corridor and a principal components axis describing sediment disturbance. Only sites with coarse bed sediment and low bed mobility (vs. sites with high amounts of fine sediment) had increased richness and abundances of sensitive species with higher percent riparian forests, supporting our hypothesis that response to riparian forests is contingent on the sediment regime. Abundances of Etheostoma scotti, the federally threatened Cherokee darter, were best predicted by models with single variables representing stormflow (r(2) = 0.34) and sediment (r(2) = 0.23) conditions. Lentic-tolerant species richness and abundance responded only to a variable representing prolonged duration of low-flow conditions. For these species, hydrologic alteration overwhelmed any influence of riparian forests on stream biota. These results suggest that, at a minimum, catchment management strategies must simultaneously address hydrologic, sediment, and riparian disturbance in order to protect all aspects of fish assemblage integrity.

AB  - Agricultural land use is a primary driver of environmental impacts on streams. However, the causal processes that shape these impacts operate through multiple pathways and at several spatial scales. This complexity undermines the development of more effective management approaches, and illustrates the need for more in-depth studies to assess the mechanisms that determine changes in stream biodiversity. Here we present results of the most comprehensive multi-scale assessment of the biological condition of streams in the Amazon to date, examining functional responses of fish assemblages to land use. We sampled fish assemblages from two large human-modified regions, and characterized stream conditions by physical habitat attributes and key landscape-change variables, including density of road crossings (i.e. riverscape fragmentation), deforestation, and agricultural intensification. Fish species were functionally characterized using ecomorphological traits describing feeding, locomotion, and habitat preferences, and these traits were used to derive indices that quantitatively describe the functional structure of the assemblages. Using structural equation modeling, we disentangled multiple drivers operating at different spatial scales, identifying causal pathways that significantly affect stream condition and the structure of the fish assemblages. Deforestation at catchment and riparian network scales altered the channel morphology and the stream bottom structure, changing the functional identity of assemblages. Local deforestation reduced the functional evenness of assemblages (i.e. increased dominance of specific trait combinations) mediated by expansion of aquatic vegetation cover. Riverscape fragmentation reduced functional richness, evenness and divergence, suggesting a trend toward functional homogenization and a reduced range of ecological niches within assemblages following the loss of regional connectivity. These results underscore the often-unrecognized importance of different land use changes, each of which can have marked effects on stream biodiversity. We draw on the relationships observed herein to suggest priorities for the improved management of stream systems in the multiple-use landscapes that predominate in human-modified tropical forests.

AB  - Functional diversity is commonly used to assess the conservation value of ecosystems, but we have not yet established whether functional and taxonomic approaches are interchangeable or complementary to evaluate community dynamics over time and in response to disturbances. We used a five-year dataset of dung beetles from undisturbed forest, primary forest corridors, and Eucalyptus plantations to compare the sensitivity of conceptually equivalent metrics to temporal variation in different anthropogenic disturbances. We compared species richness with functional richness, Pielou's evenness with functional evenness, and Simpson's diversity with Rao's quadratic entropy. We assessed the sensitivity of the metrics to anthropogenic changes. The indices showed complex patterns among habitat types, with with similar responses in some cases and not in other, and little incongruence between the pairs within the same year. The influence of disturbance on longer-term temporal variation over the five-year period revealed lower temporal variation in functional than taxonomic metrics. Both approaches showed greater variation in plantations compared to native forests. We evaluated the variation in taxonomic and functional metrics between consecutive years and among habitats. Most metrics showed similar shifts between years in all habitats, except for species and functional richness. We demonstrate that even conceptually similar indices may not provide similar information on dung beetles responses to disturbance. However, the differences between the indices can yield key insights about the drivers of change, especially over the long-term. It is important to use taxonomic and functional diversity in tandem to better understand community responses to environmental and anthropogenic changes.

AB  - Forest-associated species in fragmented landscapes must traverse potentially inhospitable gaps to move between habitat patches. Although conservation biologists advocate connecting patches with corridors or improving the matrix to make it suitable for movement, little is known about the factors influencing gap-crossing decisions for most species. We investigated gap crossing by the red squirrel (Tarniasciurus hudsonicus) in logged landscapes in southeastern Alaska, where the species avoids microhabitats associated with gaps created by clearcutting. We released individuals across clearcuts and determined the routes they took home with tracking spools and radio telemetry. Of 36 adult red squirrels translocated across six clearcuts, 14 crossed clearcuts to reach home. Squirrels were more likely to cross clearcuts if the detour efficiency (distance to home crossing gap divided by distance of forested detour) was low, indicating an ability to compare distances along alternate routes and travel costs or risks in different habitats. No other landscape metrics, such as gap size or crossing distance, predicted crossing behavior. Red squirrels of low body mass were more likely to cross clearcuts, where the probability of encountering conspecifics is low. Distance predicted route choice for squirrels detouring around clearcuts. Indirect evidence suggests that perceived predation risk, energetic costs, or both are higher in clearcuts. Detour efficiency reportedly influences the gap-crossing decisions of some forest-associated birds, but this is the first demonstration of its role in gap-crossing decisions by a mammal.

AB  - A significantly increased water regime can lead to inundation of rivers, creeks and surrounding flood-plains-and thus impact on the temporal dynamics of both the extant vegetation and the dormant, but viable soil-seed bank of riparian corridors. The study documented changes in the soil seed-bank along riparian corridors before and after a major flood event in January 2011 in southeast Queensland, Australia. The study site was a major river (the Mooleyember creek) near Roma, Central Queensland impacted by the extreme flood event and where baseline ecological data on riparian seed-bank populations have previously been collected in 2007, 2008 and 2009. After the major flood event, we collected further soil samples from the same locations in spring/summer (November-December 2011) and in early autumn (March 2012). Thereafter, the soils were exposed to adequate warmth and moisture under glasshouse conditions, and emerged seedlings identified taxonomically. Flooding increased seed-bank abundance but decreased its species richness and diversity. However, flood impact was less than that of yearly effect but greater than that of seasonal variation. Seeds of trees and shrubs were few in the soil, and were negatively affected by the flood; those of herbaceous and graminoids were numerous and proliferate after the flood. Seed-banks of weedy and/or exotic species were no more affected by the flood than those of native and/or non-invasive species. Overall, the studied riparian zone showed evidence of a quick recovery of its seed-bank over time, and can be considered to be resilient to an extreme flood event.

AB  - Aim Neotropical savanna birds occur north and south of, but mostly not in the Amazon Basin, except for a few isolated savanna patches. Here, we investigate the phylogeography of 23 taxa of Neotropical savanna birds co-distributed across multiple isolated savanna patches to assess to what extent these species have a shared history of spatial diversification. We explore the role of the forested Amazon Basin as a vicariant barrier separating northern and southern populations, particularly focusing on the role of the coastal savannas of Amapa as a potential corridor of gene flow between northern and southern populations.
   Location Neotropical savannas.
   Taxon Aves.
   Method We employ 775 mtDNA samples of 24 co-distributed savanna bird taxa from all major savanna patches in South America to infer phylogeographic patterns. For this purpose, we use 24 genomic samples (UCEs) of a subset of 12 taxa in addition to the mtDNA samples to estimate timing of divergence across the Amazon Basin. We use phylogeographic concordance factors (PCF) to assess the level of phylogeographic congruence across co-distributed taxa. Finally, we assess to which level physical distance drives genetic structuring by estimating isolation-by-distance (IBD) effects.
   Results We find that although the study taxa generally do not share similar diversification patterns geographically, many have at least two distinct genetic groups, one north and one south of the Amazon Basin, that have only recently diverged. The timing of divergence between both areas is generally centered in the late Pleistocene, but somewhat variable, indicating there is no single vicariant event responsible for driving diversification.
   Main conclusions Variability in divergence times indicates that landscape processes have not led to shared phylogeographic responses, which indicates a relatively minor role for vicariance. Shallow divergences suggest that Neotropical grassland habitats may have recently been more connected or that gene flow has played an important role. We did not find evidence of a single dominant corridor of dispersal between savannas north and south of the forested Amazon Basin.

Many elements of their biota, including montane forest birds, are shared across several disjunct mountains, yet it has been difficult to rigorously define an Afromontane forest avifauna, or determine its evolutionary relationships with the birds of the surrounding lowland forests. In order to trace the historical relationship between lowland and highland avifaunas, we review cases of species or groups of closely related species with breeding populations at different elevations, and use phylogeographic methods to explore the historical connections between such populations within the biodiversity hotspot of East Africa. The study reveals several idiosyncratic patterns, but also a prominent number of cases of gene flow between populations in southern areas, mainly around the Malawi Rift, and mountains and coastal forests to the north, close to the equator. This may reflect more continuous past distributions through northern Mozambique and coastal Tanzania, or seasonal migrations between areas with different rainfall regimes. Over time, these distributional dynamics have resulted in a higher persistence of lineages, and an accumulation of forest-dependent lineages within the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania and the northern part of the coastal forest mosaic.

AB  - Organismal movement is an essential component of ecological processes and connectivity among ecosystems. However, estimating connectivity and identifying corridors of movement are challenging in oceanic organisms such as young turtles that disperse into the open sea and remain largely unobserved during a period known as 'the lost years'. Using predictions of transport within an ocean circulation model and data from published genetic analysis, we present to our knowledge, the first basin-scale hypothesis of distribution and connectivity among major rookeries and foraging grounds (FGs) of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) during their 'lost years'. Simulations indicate that transatlantic dispersal is likely to be common and that recurrent connectivity between the southwestern Indian Ocean and the South Atlantic is possible. The predicted distribution of pelagic juvenile turtles suggests that many 'lost years hotspots' are presently unstudied and located outside protected areas. These models, therefore, provide new information on possible dispersal pathways that link nesting beaches with FGs. These pathways may be of exceptional conservation concern owing to their importance for sea turtles during a critical developmental period.

AB  - To address the adverse effects of harmful algal blooms, there are increased demands over the implementation of ozone coupled with biologically active carbon (BAC) filters in the drinking water treatment plants. Although the microbial biofilms are vital elements to support the proper performance of BAC filters, except for taxonomic affiliations, little is known about the assembly mechanisms of microbial communities in the full-scale BAC filters. This study aimed to examine how the assembly processes and their associated factors (e.g., influent characteristics, biological interactions) drive the temporal dynamics of bacterial communities in full-scale BAC filters, which underwent ozone implementation (five consecutive seasons from 2017 to 2018). The results revealed that along with the increase of bacterial taxonomic richness and evenness, stochastic processes became more crucial to determine the bacterial community assembly in the summer and autumn after ozone implementation (relative contribution: 61.23% and 83.75%, respectively). Moreover, their corresponding networks possessed simple network structures with lower modularity than other seasons, which implied lesser biological interactions among bacterial populations. The correlation between taxonomic and predicted functional diversities using functional redundancy index indicated that relatively high levels of bacterial functional redundancy (>0.83) were generally present in BAC filters. However, compared to other seasons, significantly higher degrees of functional redundancy existed in the summer and autumn after ozone implementation (0.85 +/- 0.01 and 0.86 +/- 0.01, respectively). Overall, this work improves our understanding of the microbial ecology of full-scale BAC filters by providing a conceptual framework that characterizes bacterial biofilm assembly processes relevant to performance optimization of full-scale BAC filters.

AB  - Many wildlife populations are either naturally, or as a result of human land use, patchily distributed in space. The degree of fragmentation-specifically the remaining patch sizes and habitat configuration-is an important part of population dynamics. Demographic stochasticity is also likely to play an important role in patchy habitats that host small local populations. We develop a simulation model to evaluate the significance of demographic stochasticity and the role fragmentation plays in the determination of population dynamics and the risk of extinction of populations on habitat patches. Our model is formulated as a Markov-chain stochastic process on a finite, spatially explicit array of patches in which probability of successful dispersal is a function of interpatch distance. Unlike past work, we explicitly model local population dynamics and examine how these scale up to the entire population. As a test case, we apply the model to the American pika (Ochotona princeps) population living on the ore dumps in the ghost mining town of Bodie, California. This population has been studied nearly continuously for over four decades and has been of conservation concern as the southern half of the population declined precipitously beginning in 1989. Our model suggests that both the specific configuration of habitat and landscape heterogeneity are necessary and sufficient predictors of the eventual extinction of the southern constellation of patches. This example has important implications, as it suggests that fragmentation alone can lead to regional extinctions within metapopulations.

AB  - Determination of the factors influencing the population structure and adaptive tolerance to environmental pressures of the synanthropic hoverfly Eristalis arbustorum is of essential importance in understanding how pollinator populations could respond to climate change or ecosystem management. We addressed the issue of connectivity among conspecific populations sampled in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Twenty environmental factors, mitochondrial DNA sequences of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI mtDNA), allele frequencies at allozyme loci and wing traits (size and shape) were compared for characterization of population structure and environmental niches. Additionally, patterns of within-individual asymmetry (fluctuating asymmetry; FA) in wing size and shape within and among conspecific populations were studied. In line with the overall similarity of the environmental factors extracted for our study sites, the results of COI mtDNA diversity and STRUCTURE allozyme data provide evidence for shallow differentiation among conspecific populations. In contrast, geo-referenced Bayesian clustering methods (BAPS and GENELAND) and population-based approaches (pairwise F-ST values and AMOVA) indicate that the dispersal potential of E. arbustorum may be limited across the study area. Along with a significant FA in wing size and shape, a consistent level of FA regardless of urban/rural sampling origin is an indication of the great potential of E. arbustorum for local adaptation, because increased FA levels can be considered to be a way of expression of phenotypic variation and, hence, may contribute to adaptive responses in populations facing changing environments. Thus, by using a combined genetic-morphological approach, we significantly contributed to the understanding of the fine-scale genetic structure of the synanthropic generalist pollinator E. arbustorum.

AB  - Predicting the potential distribution of species and possible dispersal corridors at a global scale can contribute to better understanding the availability of suitable habitat to move between, and the potential connectivity between regional distributions. Such information increases knowledge of ecological and biogeographic processes, but also has management applications at a global scale, for example, for estimating the restocking ability of exploited regional subpopulations. As a case study, we tested the utility of environmental niche modeling to investigate the potential global distribution of a highly mobile temperate marine coastal species, the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). First, we characterized and compared three model variants using global data and regional data from two geographically distant and genetically diverging subpopulations in the Southwest Atlantic and southern Australia. The best performing model was then transferred to the rest of the world to obtain a final global prediction for the species. Predictions revealed broad suitable areas across temperate regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. As a final step, we overlaid underwater seamount data on suitability maps to simulate possible dispersal corridors and regional connectivity. Global subpopulation connectivity and dispersal are discussed in the light of recent genetic evidence, to help explain why unoccupied suitable areas are not currently accessed by the species. This study highlights the potential use of global and regional data for the assessment of habitat suitability of species at a global scale, and provides considerations when applying these models to other highly mobile species.

AB  - Management of wetlands is often constrained by lack of a precise typology of habitats. Regional landscape attributes need to be considered in the integrative research of wetlands to allow habitat-specific management. Here we investigated the distribution and the habitat diversity of the wetlands in the Amazonian Piedmont in the Caqueta Department of Colombia. Based on the landscape approach we combined geomorphic, hydro-chemical and biotic attributes. We used remote sensing based interpretation and ground truth verification. We found 896 wetlands covering up to 11 % of the study area. Our estimate of the wetland area does not reflect the true historic wetland area (occasionally flooded area) because 76.9 % of the flooded active floodplain area has been converted to pastures. Including the pastures the estimated wetland area is 29.3 % of the study region. We identified 7 wetland habitats. The method we applied can be used to map small and middle sized wetlands achieving an acceptable overall accuracy. These wetlands provide important ecosystem services and act as corridors for biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes such as the Caqueta region. Our results provide support for the wise use of tropical wetlands and may help to improve landscape management in the Amazon basin.

AB  - The strength and arrangement of movement barriers can impact the connectivity among habitat patches. Anthropogenic barriers (e.g. roads) are a source of habitat fragmentation that can disrupt these resource networks and can have an influence on the spatial genetic structure of populations. Using microsatellite data, we evaluated whether observed genetic structure of moose (Alces alces) populations were associated with human activities (e.g. roads) in the urban habitat of Anchorage and rural habitat on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska. We found evidence of a recent genetic subdivision among moose in Anchorage that corresponds to a major highway and associated infrastructure. This subdivision is most likely due to restrictions in gene flow due to alterations to the highway (e.g. moose-resistant fencing with one-way gates) and a significant increase in traffic volume over the past 30 years; genetic subdivision was not detected on the Kenai Peninsula in an area not bisected by a major highway. This study illustrates that anthropogenic barriers can substructure wildlife populations within a few generations and highlights the value of genetic assessments to determine the effects on connectivity among habitat patches in conjunction with behavioral and ecological data.

AB  - Range limits of many plant species are expected to shift dramatically if climatic warming, driven by the release of greenhouse gases, occurs in the next century.  The ability of species to migrate in response to the range shifts has been questioned, especially in the context of extensive habitat fragmentation which occurs in modern-day landscapes.
   Simulation models are presented which incorporate two factors, land use pattern and means of dispersal, to assess potential responses of forest species to climatic warming.  Study areas displayed a range of human influence on the landscape, from heavily forested areas to areas dominated by urbanization and agriculture.  The effect of establishing corridors (greenways) through fragmented landscapes is also assessed.
   Results indicate that many species may be unable to track shifts in climatically-controlled range limits, resulting in widespread disequilibrium between vegetation and climate.  A variety of mitigating options likely will be necessary to offset the negative consequences of climatic warming on biological diversity.  Land use planners and managers are encouraged to incorporate climate warming into long-term planning.

AB  - Driven by rapid urbanization, land use change has become a significant factor influencing ecosystem services (ESs). To support the decision-making process of city planners and policy makers, assessing the spatiotemporal changes associated with multiple ESs is vital. In this study, we developed a general structure to assess the changes of multiple ESs in Zengcheng, China. A new index also was developed to measure the comprehensive ecosystem service (CES). Trade-offs of various ESs were analyzed by using correlation analysis. We then designed four alternate scenarios to explore the optimal land use strategies to increase the CES value and minimize trade-offs among various ESs. Results demonstrated that rapid expansion of built-up land and traffic land resulted in a decrease of CES in Zengcheng from 2003 to 2013. Although the water supply, water purification, and vegetable and fruit production services increased, the climate regulation, soil conservation, biodiversity protection, recreation opportunity and grain production services decreased during the ten-year period. Government should implement land use policies and ecological engineering measures to improve soil conservation in the northern region; recreation opportunity in the central region; and carbon storage, water purification, biodiversity protection and recreation opportunity in the southern region. Among all alternative scenarios, woodland buffer and soil conservation scenarios exhibit the highest CES values, indicating that policies such as the "Ecological corridor construction" project and the "Grain for Green" project should be implemented. However, a caveat is that these policies improve the ESs at the expense of food production due to significant trade-off relationships. To minimize the trade-offs, a more sustainable intensification of agriculture should be adopted to increase food production without decreasing other ESs or occupying additional land. The land use strategies and ecological engineering measures in this study can provide a reliable reference for sustainable development of other urbanized regions in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recent studies using vegetation plots have demonstrated that habitat type is a good predictor of the level of plant invasion, expressed as the proportion of alien to all species. At local scale, habitat types explain the level of invasion much better than alien propagule pressure. Moreover, it has been shown that patterns of habitat invasion are consistent among European regions with contrasting climates, biogeography, history and socioeconomic background. Here we use these findings as a basis for mapping the level of plant invasion in Europe.
   European Union and some adjacent countries.
   We used 52,480 vegetation plots from Catalonia (NE Spain), Czech Republic and Great Britain to quantify the levels of invasion by neophytes (alien plant species introduced after ad 1500) in 33 habitat types. Then we estimated the proportion of each of these habitat types in CORINE land-cover classes and calculated the level of invasion for each class. We projected the levels of invasion on the CORINE land-cover map of Europe, extrapolating Catalonian data to the Mediterranean bioregion, Czech data to the Continental bioregion, British data to the British Isles and combined Czech-British data to the Atlantic and Boreal bioregions.
   The highest levels of invasion were predicted for agricultural, urban and industrial land-cover classes, low levels for natural and semi-natural grasslands and most woodlands, and the lowest levels for sclerophyllous vegetation, heathlands and peatlands. The resulting map of the level of invasion reflected the distribution of these land-cover classes across Europe.
   High level of invasion is predicted in lowland areas of the temperate zone of western and central Europe and low level in the boreal zone and mountain regions across the continent. Low level of invasion is also predicted in the Mediterranean region except its coastline, river corridors and areas with irrigated agricultural land.

AB  - Plantations of fast-growing tree species may be of use in conservation by accelerating the restoration of forest habitat on abandoned farmland and increasing connectivity in fragmented landscapes. The objective of this study was to determine if hybrid poplar plantations can be suitable habitats for the reintroduction of native forest plant species and, if so, which abiotic factors predict successful reintroduction. Four species of forest herb species (Trillium grandiflorum, Sanguinaria canadensis, Maianthemum racemosum, Asarum canadense), of which three have legal conservation status, were transplanted into experimental plantations of two hybrid poplar clones and nearby second-growth woodlots at six sites in southern Quebec, Canada. The transplanted individuals were protected from deer browsing with exclusion cages. After two years, the plant responses of all four species were stable or increased over two years in both types of hybrid poplar plantations. Sanguinaria showed a better response in the plantations than in the woodlots, preferring the rich post-agricultural soils of the plantations with low C:N ratios. Asarum and Maianthemum showed no significant difference between stand types, while Trillium grew better in the woodlots than in the plantations. Much of the variability in the response of the latter three species was unexplained by the measured environmental variables. These results suggest that certain forest herb species can be reintroduced as juvenile plants into plantations, knowing that their spontaneous recolonization is often limited by dispersal and/or seedling establishment. Plantations could also contribute to the conservation of biodiversity by providing an environment for the cultivation of forest herb species as an alternative to their destructive harvest from natural populations.

AB  - We examined the influence of point and nonpoint source contamination on microplastic (MP) levels in water, macroinvertebrates, and trout in a small, cold-water stream in western Wisconsin, U.S.A. We collected samples along an urbanization gradient centered around a 6-mile corridor that receives numerous MP inputs from stormwater outfalls and a wastewater plant. We digested samples using a wet peroxide oxidation method. Particles filtered from digestates were stained with Nile Red dye, then viewed using fluorescence microscopy. We quantified fluorescing MPs using ImageJ software. MP concentrations in water increased significantly from upstream to downstream reaches and appeared to influence organism MP levels. Macroinvertebrates and trout collected upstream of the city had significantly lower MP levels than macroinvertebrates and trout collected within the city, and for trout, downstream of the city. MP particle lengths were significantly longer in macroinvertebrates compared to water and trout, perhaps indicating preferential accumulation of longer particles from the water column.

AB  - In the springs of 2004, 2005, and 2006, surveys were conducted on the Nevada Test Site (NTS) to characterize vegetation resources and climatic components of the environment that contribute to wildland fires. The NTS includes both Great Basin Desert and Mojave Desert ecosystems and a transitional zone between these two deserts. The field surveys assessed 211 sites along major NTS corridors for the abundance of native perennial and annual species and invasive weeds. The abundance of fine-textured (grasses and herbs) and coarse-textured (woody) biomass was visually estimated on numerical scales ranging from zero to five. Distribution of biomass is shown in Geographic Information System maps by NTS operational area. Precipitation on the NTS from January through April of 2004, 2005, and 2006 was above average. There has been an average of 11 wildland fires per year on the NTS over the past 28 years with an average of about 239 acres (97 hectares) per fire. A map showing the location and description of historic fires is presented. The three most commonly observed invasive annual plants to colonize burned areas are Arabian schizmus (Schizmus arabicus) at low elevations, red brome (Bromus rubens) at lower to middle elevations, and cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) at middle to higher elevations. Colonization by invasive species increases the likelihood of future wildland fires because they provide abundant fine fuels that are more closely spaced than native vegetation. Blackbrush (Coleogyne rammosissima) vegetation types appear to be the most vulnerable plant communities to fire followed by pinyon juniper/sagebrush vegetation types. Wildland fires are costly to control and to mitigate once they occur. Recovery of burned areas is very slow without reseeding or transplanting with native species and other rehabilitation efforts. Untreated areas become much more vulnerable to future fires once invasive species, rather than native species, colonize a burned area.

AB  - Urban areas currently have a severe shortage of recreational spaces. Many of the stream reservations are owned by the government, Therefore public use of those reservations located especially in urban areas, for recreational purposes can be considered as a fair use of the land. A 5 Kilometer stretch of Uruwal Oya adjacent to Gampaha Town was selected to implement a program to re-configure the riparian reservations into recreational areas while improving the stream to mitigate flooding. Basically the project was a landscape exercise to create a Recreational & Bio Corridor park along stream banks. Diversity of the landscape in aquatic and terrestrial interface of stream banks provided ideal conditions to grow different kinds of trees. Those paths also serve as environmentally sustainable transport for local communities by providing safe environment for walking. Out of 5 Km selected, recreational facilities with jogging path was introduced in the first 2 Km. Balance 3 Km was developed as a low cost nature trail. Due to public demand after the completion of the Gampaha Project two more similar projects are now in progress adjacent to towns of Kiribathgoda, Biyagama. Two more are in planning stage in Minuwangoda & Katana.

AB  - Background: The Eastern Arc Mountains (EAM) is an example of naturally fragmented tropical forests, which contain one of the highest known concentrations of endemic plants and vertebrates. Numerous paleo-climatic studies have not provided direct evidence for ancient presence of Pleistocene forests, particularly in the regions in which savannah presently occurs. Knowledge of the last period when forests connected EAM would provide a sound basis for hypothesis testing of vicariance and dispersal models of speciation. Dated phylogenies have revealed complex patterns throughout EAM, so we investigated divergence times of forest fauna on four montane isolates in close proximity to determine whether forest break-up was most likely to have been simultaneous or sequential, using population genetics of a forest restricted arboreal chameleon, Kinyongia boehmei.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We used mitochondrial and nuclear genetic sequence data and mutation rates from a fossil-calibrated phylogeny to estimate divergence times between montane isolates using a coalescent approach. We found that chameleons on all mountains are most likely to have diverged sequentially within the Pleistocene from 0.93-0.59 Ma (95% HPD 0.22-1.84 Ma). In addition, post-hoc tests on chameleons on the largest montane isolate suggest a population expansion similar to 182 Ka.
   Conclusions/Significance: Sequential divergence is most likely to have occurred after the last of three wet periods within the arid Plio-Pleistocene era, but was not correlated with inter-montane distance. We speculate that forest connection persisted due to riparian corridors regardless of proximity, highlighting their importance in the region's historic dispersal events. The population expansion coincides with nearby volcanic activity, which may also explain the relative paucity of the Taita's endemic fauna. Our study shows that forest chameleons are an apposite group to track forest fragmentation, with the inference that forest extended between some EAM during the Pleistocene 1.1-0.9 Ma.

AB  - Tree planting in design practice is considered simply as void fillers or view blockers. However, for a sustainable design, creating places using trees need to be reconsidered. Going beyond traditional tree plantings in urban environments, an application of computational methods in landscape architecture for the management of the complex system is needed. While computational methods have been extensively applied to buildings, less has been applied to trees. The goal of this paper is to investigate how the presence of trees affects human movement and find out if computational methods can be used for recommending tree planting patterns. We analysed the tree planting patterns in renowned theme parks as an initial research categorizing tree planting patterns, using an agent-based analysis for simulation, and comparing the results of the average agent counts in theme park plans without trees and those with trees. We noticed there was a clear distinction between tree planting pattern types and the change in agent counts supporting the qualitative theory in landscape architecture. The result of this research can guide theme park designers as well as urban park designers when deciding which tree planting patterns to implement for the purpose of controlling pedestrian movements.

AB  - This annotated checklist is the third major compilation for Singapore. It lists the current status of all bird species ever recorded in the wild in Singapore. A total of 404 species have been recorded, including 44 species which are now extinct or have not been recorded for the last 50 years. Some of the latter species have been recorded again as non-breeding visitors. There are now 342 species that occur naturally in Singapore and another 22 species that were introduced by man. Fifty-eight families of birds are represented. There are 121 resident species with proven breeding records and 21 other presumed residents. One hundred and fifty-four species are winter visitors and/or passage migrants, with another 25 species listed as non-breeding visitors and 21 others that occur in Singapore as vagrants.
   Census data since 1991 shows that the total number of birds in Singapore has declined by 40 % and the number of species has declined by nearly 17 %. The most abundant bird species Is a migrant, the Pacific Golden Plover (Pluvialis fulva). The most important site in terms of bird population is Sungei Mandai, an unprotected mudflat and mangrove ecosystem while Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve and Pulau Ubin are important in having the highest diversities of birds. The loss of mudflats through reclamation, damming of estuaries, and canalisation of rivers has resulted in a decline in waterbird density and diversity as shown in the Annual Waterfowl Census. The current total shorebird population in Singapore is only 4,000 - 5,000 birds, a vast decrease from the large wintering population of 10,000 birds at a single site, the Serangoon Estuary, in 1985.
   Forty-one of the 44 extinct species were resident forest birds, of which, 34 (82.9 %) went extinct between 1900 and 1950. This equates to 3.4 species lost every five years, an alarming rate of extinction for a small island like Singapore. The most susceptible families are the Trogonidae and Eurylaimidae, with 100 % species loss, and Picidae, with 56.3 % species loss. The susceptible bird families are predominantly those of the forest, whereas the resistant families exist largely in open country and scrub. In fact, only three extinct species were not largely dependent on tropical rainforests for their existence. Forest species such as the Green Broadbill (Calyptomena viridis) became extinct from the forests as recently as 1941. This emphasises the role that habitat destruction has played in shaping Singapore's avifauna.
   Fifty-four species of birds are at risk of extinction, of which 34 species (63 %) live in the forest. The remaining patches of forest in Singapore are mostly protected in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve that should provide a safe haven for the forest birds. However, the forests are too fragmented, small and constantly disturbed by thousands of visitors. By connecting the smaller Bukit Timah Nature Reserve to the much larger Central Catchment Nature Reserve, the forest patch size can be increased and might allow more movement of animals and plants between the two patches. Many forest birds are secretive or weak fliers and are reluctant to cross open spaces. A green corridor might encourage them to do so. Another 16 species (29.6 %) of threatened birds are specialists of mangroves and wetlands. Preservation of these most-threatened of ecosystems in Singapore is of utmost importance to the survival of the birds found in these special habitats. With improvement in the quality of habitats, we could perhaps slow down the rate of local extinction of the avifauna of Singapore. Our remaining habitats need to be protected and laws protecting wildlife must be strictly enforced, so that the birds may have a chance to coexist with us.

AB  - As natural habitats become fragmented by human activities, animals must increasingly move through human-dominated systems, particularly agricultural landscapes. Mapping areas important for animal movement has therefore become a key part of conservation planning. Models of landscape connectivity are often parameterized using expert opinion and seldom distinguish between the risks and barriers presented by different crop types. Recent research, however, suggests different crop types, such as row crops and orchards, differ in the degree to which they facilitate or impede species movements. Like many mammalian carnivores, bobcats (Lynx rufus) are sensitive to fragmentation and loss of connectivity between habitat patches. We investigated how distinguishing between different agricultural land covers might change conclusions about the relative conservation importance of different land uses in a Mediterranean ecosystem. Bobcats moved relatively quickly in row crops but relatively slowly in orchards, at rates similar to those in natural habitats of woodlands and scrub. We found that parameterizing a connectivity model using empirical data on bobcat movements in agricultural lands and other land covers, instead of parameterizing the model using habitat suitability indices based on expert opinion, altered locations of predicted animal movement routes. These results emphasize that differentiating between types of agriculture can alter conservation planning outcomes.

AB  - We analysed the floristic turnover, or beta-diversity patterns, of woody legumes in Baja California, the 1300 kill long peninsula in NW Mexico. From the specimen labels of nine herbaria, we digitized 4205 records front 78 species and projected them onto a grid of 205 cartographic cells (20' longitude x 15' latitude). We found that the E-W turnover from the Pacific coast to the Sea of Cortes was high (ca. 60% change from one cell to the next) and that it was significantly associated with topographic variation across the peninsula. An analysis of between-site similarities showed that floristic regions in the peninsula have well defined boundaries. and that floristic similarities tend to extend for long distances along the coastal corridor of the Sea of Cones. Finally, a numerical classification of Baja California based on the floristic attributes of the cells separated the peninsula into five well defined regions that coincide very closely with regionalizations, previously proposed by various authors using descriptive methods, and with the areas of endemism described for the peninsula in a previous paper. We conclude that the ecological regions of woody legumes in the peninsula clearly reflect the two main environmental forces that act on it, namely, the 1300 kill long temperate-tropical climatic gradient and the dramatic E-W gradient running from the Pacific Ocean ca. 100 kill across the mountain range into the Sea of Cortes.

AB  - Like many parts of the US, Maryland is urbanizing rapidly. The scattered pattern of low-density development consumes an excessive amount of land, fragments the landscape, displaces many native species, and disrupts ecosystem functions. Maryland's Green Infrastructure Assessment is a tool developed in the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to help identify and rank those areas of greatest statewide ecological importance, as well as those at greatest risk of loss to development. It identifies large contiguous blocks of natural land (hubs), interconnected by natural corridors to allow animal and plant propagule dispersal and migration. Hubs and corridors were ranked within their physiographic region for a variety of ecological and development risk parameters, as well as combinations of these. Prioritization was also done on a finer scale (0.127 ha) for ecological importance and vulnerability to development, allowing a more detailed analysis for site prioritization within the network. The hub and corridor framework identified through the Green Infrastructure Assessment is being used to guide Maryland's ongoing land conservation efforts. At a multi-state scale, the green infrastructure method has been used as the framework for setting landscape ecological priorities within the Chesapeake Bay program. At a regional scale, the method has been used to rank or focus areas for state land conservation programs. Within a local government planning context, the method is now being translated into locally relevant criteria to support county-scale green infrastructure initiatives. Finally, the cell-based ranking method has been incorporated into parcel prioritization that has been used to aid state, local and private land trust conservation decision-making.

AB  - Urbanization is a primary driver of landscape conversion, with far-reaching effects on landscape pattern and process, particularly related to the population characteristics of animals. Urbanization can alter animal movement and habitat quality, both of which can influence population abundance and persistence. We evaluated three important population characteristics (population density, site occupancy, and species detection probability) of a medium-sized and a large carnivore across varying levels of urbanization. Specifically, we studied bobcat and puma populations across wildland, exurban development, and wildland-urban interface (WUI) sampling grids to test hypotheses evaluating how urbanization affects wild felid populations and their prey. Exurban development appeared to have a greater impact on felid populations than did habitat adjacent to a major urban area (i.e., WUI); estimates of population density for both bobcats and pumas were lower in areas of exurban development compared to wildland areas, whereas population density was similar between WUI and wildland habitat. Bobcats and pumas were less likely to be detected in habitat as the amount of human disturbance associated with residential development increased at a site, which was potentially related to reduced habitat quality resulting from urbanization. However, occupancy of both felids was similar between grids in both study areas, indicating that this population metric was less sensitive than density. At the scale of the sampling grid, detection probability for bobcats in urbanized habitat was greater than in wildland areas, potentially due to restrictive movement corridors and funneling of animal movements in landscapes influenced by urbanization. Occupancy of important felid prey (cottontail rabbits and mule deer) was similar across levels of urbanization, although elk occupancy was lower in urbanized areas. Our study indicates that the conservation of medium-and large-sized felids associated with urbanization likely will be most successful if large areas of wildland habitat are maintained, even in close proximity to urban areas, and wildland habitat is not converted to low-density residential development.

AB  - Since 1955 a plan known as the Stephenson-Hepburn Plan has dominated the allocation of public open space(POS) in Perth, the capital of Western Australia and within a Hotspot of Global Biodiversity. Since that time there has been a general requirement of 10% POS within any new suburban development based on 1955 parameters, identified here as being private open space and housing densities. These assumptions were examined with a view to determine their relevance today, and changes were noted in housing densities, and POS objectives and policy practices up to 2005.
   It was found that current housing densities are greater than existing or predicted in 1955, and private open spaces (gardens) have reduced. Since 1955 there has been an accumulation of additional requirements made on POS. while the allocation of land has not increased. It was considered that the current allocation of land for public open space in this global Hot Spot is based on old realities of private open space and housing, and does not address new ambitions for POS, particularly those regarding ecological function. It was suggested that the spatial configuration of POS moving into biologically diverse areas needs to be site-specific and ecologically framed, rather than culturally, to enable corridor design of meaningful function across regions.

AB  - Habitat loss and habitat isolation have contributed to declines in the green and golden bell frog (Litoria aurea) over much of its former range in south-eastern Australia. Understanding the parameters critical for the persistence of extant populations is required to halt further declines. We assessed waterbody occupancy in a local network of potential L. aurea breeding habitats on Kooragang Island, Australia, by conducting surveys over two years (2000 and 2001) at 30 waterbodies, and using site-occupancy models. The probability that a waterbody was used by L. aurea in 2000 increased with increasing waterbody area, and decreasing distance to the nearest waterbody where L. aurea was detected and where reproductive recruitment was observed. Large waterbodies where high numbers of L. aurea were detected in 2000 were more likely to be used in 2001. The probability that a waterbody used in 2000 was not used in 2001 (i.e., turnover) decreased with increasing waterbody area and increasing numbers of L. aurea detected at the site in 2000. Our results demonstrate the potential for frog abundance, immigration, and recruitment to reduce local turnover. We recommend that conservation strategies for extant populations of L. aurea protect mosaics of wetland habitat and maintain connectivity among waterbodies.

AB  - The beginnings of the Cittaslow movement date back to 1998 Italian towns became a model for other European towns, and subsequently for others, around the world. This is how an international movement came into being, founded on the idea of improvement of the quality of life of residents, savouring "slow", healthy lifestyle, drawing on the tradition and history and respecting the natural and cultural environment of small towns. Green areas play a huge role in creating the image of Cittaslow towns. They constitute the so-called "green urban corridors" or " green spots" and have cultural, educational and social significance, including recreation and spa functions. They are not only a complement to architecture, but can play a superior role in the structure of cities. The aim of the work is to analyze the state of parks, squares and green areas management in the Cittaslow towns in region of Warmia and Mazury (Poland). There are 20 environmentally, spatially, economically and demographically diverse towns in the region of Warmia and Mazury that acceded to the association. The international network includes towns with a population under 50 thousand. An analysis of the source materials involved gathering and interpretation of information obtained from monographic and cartographic documentation, both current and archival, from websites of Cittaslow towns and mentions in the media. Apart from a monographic study, the authors carried out a landscape and spatial analysis, pre-project studies and made original designs for selected urban parks and greens in Cittaslow towns. All the Cittaslow towns in the Province of Warmia and Mazury under analysis have high potential in terms of using greenery areas with the social and cultural function. Parks and squares are perfect places for integration of communities and for conducting educational and cultural activities. However, diversity regarding land development and programme offer is observed (utility programme). In some towns, greenery areas cover only space with planned (not always in accordance with the art of gardening) plant compositions. However, parks and squares should be planned not only with their visual aspect in mind, but emphasis should be placed on their utility side (active use). Therefore, the article points to the directions of development of new places, as well the possibility of adding socio-cultural functions to existing greenery areas.

AB  - Urban areas are associated with high levels of habitat fragmentation. For some terrestrial species with limited climbing abilities, property boundaries can pose a significant problem by limiting access to residential gardens. The West European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) has declined markedly in the UK but is commonly found in areas of human habitation, including residential gardens. 'Hedgehog Street' is a public engagement campaign aimed at recruiting volunteers ('Hedgehog Champions') to create access points ('hedgehog highways') across garden boundaries to improve habitat connectivity. In this study, we used a series of questionnaire surveys to explore motivations for and obstacles to the creation of highways. Householders were more likely to have created a highway if they were already aware of the Hedgehog Street campaign, if their garden contained a high number of wildlife-friendly features and if they considered watching wildlife to be important. Hedgehog Champions created, on average, 1.69 highways each with 52.0% creating none; this would equate to an estimated >120,000 across all registered Champions. In comparison, 6.1-29.8% of non-Champions stated that they had made a highway. However, most highways had been created in boundaries that could already be traversed via naturally occurring holes: only 11.4% of garden boundaries could be traversed, and 3.2% of gardens accessed, just via a hedgehog highway. In addition, only 5.0% of gardens were considered totally inaccessible to hedgehogs. The most common reasons cited for not having made a highway were that householders' gardens were already accessible to hedgehogs followed by concerns relating to boundary ownership and / or communicating with neighbours. Future studies need to identify strategies for overcoming these obstacles to maximize citizen engagement, particularly with those householders who are not innately "wildlife-friendly", and to quantify the degree to which networks of highways affect patterns of individual movement and, ultimately, populations.

AB  - Artificial illumination of the night is increasing globally. There is growing evidence of a range of ecological impacts of artificial light and awareness of light pollution as a significant environmental issue. In urban and suburban areas, complex spatial patterns of light sources, structures and vegetation create a highly heterogeneous night-time light environment for plants and animals. We developed a method for modelling the night-time light environment at a high spatial resolution in a small urban area for ecological studies. We used the position and height of street lights, and digital terrain and surface models, to predict the direct light intensity at different wavelengths at different heights above the ground surface. Validation against field measurements of night-time light showed that modelled light intensities in the visible and ultraviolet portions of the spectrum were accurate. We show how this model can be used to map biologically relevant lightscapes across an urban landscape. We also illustrate the utility of the model using night-time light maps as resistance surfaces in the software package circuitscape to predict potential movement of model nocturnal species between habitat patches and to identify key corridors and barriers to movement and dispersal. Understanding the ecological effects of artificial light requires knowledge of the light environment experienced by organisms throughout the diurnal and annual cycles, during periods of activity and rest and during different life stages. Our approach to high-resolution mapping of artificial lightscapes can be adapted to the sensitivity to light of different species and to other urban, suburban, rural and industrial landscapes.

AB  - The forest-dwelling ecotype of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) is vulnerable to predation, hunting, and disturbances due to anthropogenic activities. Its strategies of space and habitat use are oriented towards reducing the effects of these limiting factors. Caribou occupy large home ranges, undertake extensive movements, and avoid fragmented areas. They use various habitats, but especially mature and over-mature conifer stands with irregular structure, which are less suitable for other ungulates, wolves and black bears. In order to protect habitat for forest-dwelling caribou, we suggest an ecosystem approach based on the protection of large forested blocks, the concentration of forest harvesting in large management blocks, and the maintenance of habitat connectivity. This strategy focuses on short-term conservation of minimum caribou habitats in the protected blocks, a medium-term habitat recovery in the management blocks, the maintenance of forest activities, and facilitation of seasonal and dispersal movements. Within the management blocks, we recommend creation of an irregular forest structure similar to the pattern created by natural disturbances inherent to spruce-moss forests. These guidelines have been tested in Quebec for the last few years and were well received by forest and wildlife agencies as well as the forest industry.

AB  - We used externally applied transmitters to study movements of female grass snakes (Natrix natrix) during the egg-laying period in a near-urban landscape in Sweden. Half of the studied snakes were residents while the other half were translocated individuals with no previous experience of the area. As predicted, resident females moved more goal-oriented and shorter distances than did translocated individuals. Habitat use did not differ between resident and translocated snakes; they were typically found in bushes, reeds, and tall vegetation. Habitat preference (use in relation to availability) showed that bushy habitats, tall grassy vegetation and reedbeds were over-used in proportion to availability, whereas forest and open grass lawns were used less than expected based on availability. Our study highlights the importance of preserving and restoring linear habitat components providing shelter and connectivity in conservation of grass snakes. We suggest that externally applied transmitters are a better option than surgically implanted ones in movement studies of grass snakes, and that translocation as a conservation method for snakes has drawbacks.

AB  - Sweden aims to increase the proportion of renewable energy sources, ultimately to be able to phase out fossil fuels. To achieve this, new energy sources need to be explored. In this multi-disciplinary article, we examine the technical, economical, ecological and legal possibilities to commercially and sustainably harvest brushwood for bioenergy, while simultaneously gaining positive environmental effects, both for biological diversity, the cultural heritage, and the climate.
   The Swedish open landscape is becoming covered with secondary brushwood regrowth through natural succession, except where it is kept open. Brushwood is spreading along roads, railway lines, edge zones, in power line corridors, abandoned semi-natural grasslands, nature reserves, and in marginal land in urban areas. Such brushwood consists of saplings, bushes and young trees of a range of deciduous plant species, e.g. birch, aspen, alder and goat willow, sometimes mixed with conifers, often forming dense thickets.
   Such secondary brushwood regrowth could be systematically utilised as a new source of renewable bioenergy. Commercial brushwood harvesting in Sweden may contribute 26 PJ of energy annually, which may be a small but significant contribution, considering the favourable energy ratio (E-r = 28), indicating that large emission reductions can be achieved, if fossil fuels are replaced. Growing brushwood does not require fertilizers or pesticides, soil tillage or crop management, and it does not compete with any other potential land use. Many brushwood habitats are already being managed to clear brushwood, for other purposes, minimizing the added harvesting cost.
   Apart from providing bioenergy, it has also been suggested that brushwood harvesting would benefit biological diversity. A large number of nationally redlisted species are dependent on the active management of open habitats, including semi-natural grasslands, and man-made habitats such as road verges and power line corridors.
   Our literature review shows that brushwood harvesting could benefit both biological diversity and the cultural heritage, and contribute to the management of the open cultural landscape. There are however certain limitations. Brushwood harvesting would favour a certain set of species, including many redlisted, but it may also threaten another set of species, especially species associated with early successional stages of forest regeneration, as well as forest edge species, depending on how and where it is applied. Harvesting may be affected by legislation imposing limitations regarding habitats of particular importance for biodiversity. The environmental and legal constraints would probably reduce the profitability of brushwood harvesting in certain areas, as well as the annual production of bioenergy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The fragmentation of forests is a consequence of human activities that intensively change the natural landscapes. In Brazil, there is a long-standing legal framework for native vegetation protection, called Forest Code. The last update is from 2012. The revisions incorporated in this restructured code (Law No. 12,651/12) encompassed new rules, rights and obligations for adequate land use management of productive systems and for environmental conservation and protection. An example of a protective measure was the creation of a Legal Reserve inside the rural properties and Areas of Permanent Protection around the watercourses. This study explored the effects of implementing the new code on the spatial and temporal evolution of forest cover fragmentation since the legal changes were set up. In that context, the area, perimeter and shape (circularity index) of forest fragments, as well as the buffer strips along watercourses, were assessed from 2010 to 2016 within the municipality of Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo state, Brazil. The assessment resorted to remote sensing techniques and visual inspection of orbital images. It was clear from the results that forest patches became more abundant but smaller, more dispersed and elongated, and that this route to fragmentation was hinged on a chaotic expansion of urban and agricultural areas. Important edge effects were anticipated from these results. The area numbers revealed that Ribeirao Preto was 7.95% covered with forest fragments in 2010, while this percentage rose to 8.03% in 2013 and reached 8.35% in 2016. Most of this increase occurred within a 30-meter wide buffer along the watercourses. This was a positive outcome. However, the numbers also revealed that forested areas smaller than 51 hectares increased from 71% in 2010 to 73% in 2016. The conclusions were that implementation of Law No. 12,651/12 is leading to an increase of forestland, but not yet promoting sustainability, namely through improved connectivity among fragments for reduction of edge effects and provision ecosystem services.

AB  - Understanding and early identification of state transitions in dryland systems' landscape pattern are challenging but critical for conservation planning and sustainable management strategies. Currently the alternative states of drylands have been identified based on dynamics of single vegetation index (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index), with the interactions between vegetation and soil components often being neglected. Here, we proposed a framework for identifying the alternative states in relation to land degradation based on the interactive pathways of fractional vegetation and soil-related endmember nexuses. In this framework, we initially generated 16-day fractional green vegetation endmember (green vegetation [GV]) and soil-related endmembers (sand [SL], saline [SA], dark surface [DA]) time series using a standardized linear spectral mixture analysis model in the Hexi Corridor during 2001-2017. A discrete wavelet transform based trends and turning points detection (DWT-TTD) algorithm was proposed to detect trends, turning point types, and timing of these time series records. These metrics were subsequently used to identify eight state transition pathways for each endmember and synthetic degradation processes at the appropriate 5-10 year scale. We found that the unmixed fractional endmembers exhibited a consistent agreement with both field abundance values and estimated fractions from high-spatial-resolution Google Earth images. Based on the DWT-TTD algorithm derived alternative pathways, we found that four positive pathways of GV and DA fractions can be observed in the vegetated areas were integrated with corresponding negative pathways of SA and SL fractions. These pathways resulted in remarkably increasing GV (+4551.81 km2) and DA (+9749.26 km2) and significantly declining SA (-1452.70 km2) and SL (-9555.57 km2) from 2001 to 2017. These processes were linked to increased precipitation and temperature and reduced drought degree. Also, the timing of the turning points (around 2007 and 2013) was largely coincidental with the timing of ecological management, suggesting that ecological governance played a crucial role in the state shifts. However, because of drought trends in the barren regions, land desertification exhibited an increasing occurrence in extent (+2.5% of total pixels) during the study period, which may increase in the future, as indicated by the large pixel proportion of initially positive reversal pathway for SL (9.31%). Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the DWT-TTD algorithm, as a multi-resolution analysis method, has the potential to detect hierarchical temporal changes and disentangle the cross-scale inherent shifts of vegetation-soil systems. The framework can help devise sustainable management practices that maintain land degradation neutrality, especially when integrated with land use cover change analysis.

AB  - Urban areas encounter a common problem called the heat island effect. Public-space plantings and parks have become a crucial countermeasure for decreasing urban temperatures. In this study, field measurements were carried out in a subtropical park in the summer to investigate the effect of plantings on microclimate and the thermal environment of pedestrian areas. It was found that obstructions affected the wind field; although cold air enters parks, an overcrowding of plants resulted in temperature rises in downstream areas. Shading is a key to thermal comfort in both tropical and subtropical regions, and its effect is augmented by ventilation. Trees that are planted without proper planning can decrease wind movement, which in turn has a detrimental effect on thermal comfort, especially downwind. Wind corridors through urban parks can promote both shading and ventilation, improving thermal comfort, and should thus be considered when designing the layout and trimming of plantings. Data from both fixed and mobile-type measurements were used to validate the feasibility of a computational fluid dynamics simulation model. It was observed that wind speed and shading are the two main variables that influence the human comfort index, based on which a simpler human comfort assessment was proposed to replace the conventional index, standard effective temperature (SET*). The proposed method can be used as a guideline for landscape architects when designing planting locations. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Typified by heterogeneous habitats, large rivers host diversified communities throughout their course. As the spatial organisation of fish communities within these ecosystems remains little studied, longitudinal gradients and spatial heterogeneities of fish diversity were analysed in the large temperate St. Lawrence River, Canada. We used two distinct datasets obtained from either seine nets or gillnets from governmental standardised fish surveys (1995-2012) consisting of a total of 299,662 individuals from 76 fish species captured in 1,051 sites. Results from diversity indices and multivariate analysis revealed a gradual downstream increase in taxonomic diversity, and a gradual change of the community structure along the river. In addition, we observed different fish communities within fluvial lakes and corridors and found significant differences in fish community structure between opposite shores. The fish communities described along the river using seine nets are spatially more heterogeneous than when described using gillnets. This discrepancy is likely resulting both from the more mobile species targeted by gillnets and sampling sites located farther from the shallower shoreline habitat targeted by seine nets. The organisation of fish communities stresses the need to implement science-based policies and actions to preserve biodiversity and restore communities distributed over large heterogeneous ecosystems.

AB  - 1. A comparison was made between a variety of alien and endemic plant species from 272 aquatic and riparian habitats in Portuguese Mediterranean-type streams in reference condition - i.e. near-natural river corridors - and non-reference condition. The objective was to detect differences in relative proportion and cover between these species groups. The differences in endemic and alien flora from siliceous and calcareous river types were also analysed. Environmental and human disturbance factors were related with the richness and cover of both species groups.
   2. A total of 568 species were found, of which 44 were alien and 28 were endemic. Alien species were present at 91 % of the surveyed locations, and were consistently more widespread at non-reference sites than at reference ones for both river types, with calcareous sites having a higher invasibility. Endemic species occurred at 45% of the sampling sites and displayed a significantly lower richness and cover than their alien counterparts.
   3. Alien richness and cover were positively related to direct human disturbance within the river systems, and with floodplain uses such as urban occupation, intensive agriculture, and nutrient inputs. Endemic species also respond to anthropogenic variables, rather than to climatic and geographical ones, with richness and cover increasing as human impacts on fluvial systems and related floodplains decrease.
   4. Comprehensive control of alien invasive species and the protection of endemic plant populations will require attempts at monitoring ecological river integrity, and the achievement of 'good ecological status' - one of the goals of the European Union's Water Framework Directive. Portuguese riparian areas must be managed in such a way as to protect the relatively few preserved riparian habitats by lowering the direct and indirect pressures in fluvial corridors and thus preventing future alien plant invasions.

AB  - The future of mammalian diversity in the tropics depends largely on the conservation value of human-dominated lands. We investigated the distribution of non-flying mammals in five habitats of southern Costa Rica: relatively extensive forest (227 ha), coffee plantation, pasture, coffee with adjacent forest remnant (35 ha), and pasture with adjacent forest remnant (35 ha). Of the 26 native species recorded in our study plots, 9 (35%) were restricted to forest habitat, 14 (54%) occurred in both forest and agricultural habitats, and 3 (11%) were found only in agricultural habitats. Species richness and composition varied significantly with habitat type but not with distance from the extensive forest. Interestingly, small forest remnants (35 ha) contiguous with coffee plantations did not differ from more extensive forest in species richness and were richer than other agricultural habitat types. Small remnants contiguous with pasture were species-poor. When clearing started, the study region likely supported about 60 species. Since then, at least 6 species (10%), one family (4%), and one order (11%) have gone extinct locally. The species that disappeared were the largest in their families and included carnivorous (e. g., jaguar [Panthera onca]), herbivorous (e. g., Baird's tapir, [Tapirus bairdii]), and arboreal (e. g., mantled howler monkey [Alouatta palliata]) species. Although there is no substitute for native forest habitat, the majority of native, nonflying mammal species use countryside habitats. The populations of many persist even >5 km from relatively extensive forest, at least over the 40 years since forest clearance. Moreover, if hunting ceased, we expect that at least one of the locally extinct species could be reestablished in the existing landscape. Thus, there is an important opportunity to maintain and restore the diversity, abundance, and ecosystem roles of mammals in at least some human-dominated regions of the Neotropics.

AB  - Urban-ecological study belongs to a complex of solutions to flood protection issues affecting urban areas in the Czech Republic. These solutions are largely a response to the destructive summer floods of 1997 and 2001. This presentation focuses on the Morava river in Olomouc (Czech Republic, Central. Moravia). The study's ecological component concentrates on the construction of the river's ecological continuum throughout an urban area being situated in the river's flood-plain, providing legitimacy to the principle requirement of inhabitant's flood protection. This idea is exercised partly on the river channel (lengthwise river continuum), partly on shore, in the corridor of the newly built inundation area. Restorations arise from the river's channel onto the alluvium, thereby the transverse and upright ecological continuum is renovated. Restorations rely on extant ecological structural elements and relationships and they pay attention to the concept of preservation and the next re-enforcement of ecological structure, including ecological relationships. In this way, the principles of renewal of the river landscape's ecological continuum are exerted. The goal is to arrive at that point where the inhabitants perceive the river as a positive natural element in the urban ecosystem while providing for the free movement of wildlife.

AB  - Urbanization of riparian corridors may alter or eliminate suitable freshwater turtle basking habitat due to fragmentation of shoreline vegetation, reduction of basking sites, or frequent human disturbance. We used 3 indices of shoreline urbanization at 2 spatial scales to assess the relationship between shoreline urbanization and basking turtle behavior. Indices included local-scale Shoreline Modification and Disturbance Frequency and broad-scale Building Density. The community of basking turtles included the Texas river cooter, Pseudemys texana (Baur); red-eared slider, Trachemys scripta elegans (Wied); Mississippi map turtle, Graptemys pseudogeographica kohnii (Baur); midland smooth softshell, Apalone mutica mutica (LeSueur); pallid spiny softshell, Apalone spinifera pallida (Webb); and a turtle from the family Kinosternidae that could not be identified to species during basking surveys. At the local scale, abundances of basking turtles were greatest in areas of high Shoreline Modification, characterized by a substantial reduction in woody shoreline vegetation. Disturbance Frequency of human intrusion limited turtle basking in areas with daily disturbance. At the broad scale, most turtles basked adjacent to shorelines with nearby buildings. All species of the turtle community basked in urban environments, but their tolerance of urbanization varied.

AB  - Headwater rivers are the predominant kind of aquatic ecosystem in South Africa's Cape Floristic Region. Invasion by alien woody taxa (especially Acacia longifolia and Acacia mearnsii) have altered these rivers in recent decades, replacing indigenous vegetation and altering ecosystem functioning. Aliens have been systematically cleared in watercourses since 1995 as part of a national program ("Working for Water") to increase water production and improve water quality. Cleared sites are mostly left to recover to their pre-invasion state without additional intervention. We compared the vegetation of seven rivers that vary in their extent of invasion and clearing to identify factors limiting recolonization. Dense invasions cleared 3-6 years before the survey differ in vegetation structure and composition from uninvaded or lightly invaded/cleared riparian reaches in the following ways: (1) diminished extent of indigenous trees in the canopy and increased importance of shrubs or reinvading alien trees, (2) reduced species richness, (3) reduced likelihood of occupancy for more than one-third of common, indigenous species, and (4) reduced incidence of indigenous tree regeneration. Overall, indigenous tree regeneration is very low and not disturbance-triggered which will likely result in slow recovery without additional intervention. We recommend focusing active revegetation on common riparian scrub trees (i.e., Metrosideros angustifolia, Brachylaena neriifolia, Brabejum stellatfolium, and Erica caffra). These species tolerate open habitats favored by alien trees, eventually forming closed canopies required by shade-tolerant species. Accelerating establishment of these small trees is likely critical for shifting cleared riparian corridors from a state that favors alien reinvasion. Effective establishment strategies will need to be developed in the context of hydrologic impairment, since alien-invaded rivers in this region typically have reduced flow. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Theoretical and applied research on the ecological consequences of deforestation has focused on the remnants of habitat in relative isolation, but recent thinking has theorized more realistic conditions in which the areas of altered habitat are not completely destroyed, in which they recover and the connectivity of the landscape changes, and in which disturbance regimes play a role. A competition-colonization simulation, in which these primary 2006 tradeoffs are represented in a spatially explicit model, is used to explore the consequences of additional aspects of landscape dynamics following deforestation for plant diversity and community structure. The dynamics are analyzed in terms of temporal aspects of community resilience and changes in its spatial pattern. Simulations indicate that the initial degree of habitat alteration has little effect on resilience. Allowing succession to follow disturbance has a strong effect, which differs among species. Adaptation to an ongoing disturbance regime, which should improve resilience, is not evident when the disturbance itself continues. Deforestation changes the spatial pattern of the landscape, and species respond differently because of their different dispersal abilities. The species in turn alter the spatial pattern. The basic lessons of competition-colonization models for deforestation stand, but the ensured extinction implied by the extinction debt concept is further ameliorated as more realistic pattern-process relations are theorized.

AB  - Deep Learning (DL) based identification and detection of elements in urban spaces through Earth Observation (EO) datasets have been widely researched and discussed. Such studies have developed state-of-the-art methods to map urban features like building footprint or roads in detail. This study delves deeper into combining multiple such studies to identify fine-grained urban features which define streetscapes. Specifically, the research focuses on employing object detection and semantic segmentation models and other computer vision methods to identify ten streetscape features such as movement corridors, roadways, sidewalks, bike paths, on-street parking, vehicles, trees, vegetation, road markings, and buildings. The training data for identifying and classifying all the elements except road markings are collected from open sources and finetuned to fit the study's context. The training dataset is manually created and employed to delineate road markings. Apart from the model-specific evaluation on the test-set of the data, the study creates its own test dataset from the study area to analyze these models' performance. The outputs from these models are further integrated to develop a geospatial dataset, which is additionally utilized to generate 3D views and street cross-sections for the city. The trained models and data sources are discussed in the research and are made available for urban researchers to exploit.

AB  - The carabid fauna of 28 derelict sites in the West Midlands (England) were sampled over the course of one growing season (April-October, 1999). The study aimed to investigate the relationship between carabid assemblages and five measures of landscape structure pertinent to derelict habitat. At each site measurements of landscape features pertinent to derelict habitat were made: (i) the proximity of habitat corridors; (ii) the density of surrounding derelict land; (iii) the distance between the site and the rural fringe; and (iv) the size of the site. Concurrent surveys of the soil characteristics, vegetation type, and land use history were conducted. The data were analysed using a combination of ordination (DCA, RDA), variance partitioning (using pRDA) and binary linear regression. The results suggest that:
   1. There is very little evidence that the carabid assemblages of derelict sites were affected by landscape structure, with assemblages instead being principally related to within-site habitat variables, such as site age (since last disturbance), substrate type and vegetation community.
   2. No evidence was found to support the hypothesis that sites away from railway corridors are more impoverished in their carabid fauna than sites on corridors.
   3. There are some suggestions from this study that rarer and non-flying specialist species may be affected by isolation, taking longer to reach sites. We infer from this that older sites with retarded succession, and sites in higher densities of surrounding derelict land may eventually become more species rich and that these sites may be important for maintaining populations of rarer and flightless species.
   4. Conservation efforts to maintain populations of these species should focus principally on habitat quality issues, such as maintaining early successional habitats that have a diversity of seed producing annuals and perennial plants and enhancing substrate variability rather than landscape issues.

AB  - Aim We investigated the relationship between geographic range size (GRS), longitude and latitude (Rapoport's rule) in Canadian freshwater fishes. We tested hypotheses regarding the phenotypic and phylogenetic determinants of GRS to unravel processes driving the spatial patterns of GRS in Canada. Because GRS is negatively correlated with extinction risk, we also aimed at identifying biological proxies that may be used to predict extinction risks.
   Location North-America, Canadian Shield.
   Methods We built a database combining range area, seven ecological traits, and a molecular phylogeny for native Canadian freshwater fishes. We tested latitudinal and longitudinal patterns in GRS by the mean of Pearson correlations. We combined phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) models and a model selection procedure to tease apart hypotheses (and hence ecological traits) that best explained GRS in our dataset. PGLSs were also used to explore relationships between ecological traits, phylogeny, and species mid-range latitude and longitude. Partial regressions were used to determine direct and indirect relationships driving spatial patterns of GRS in Canadian freshwater fishes.
   Results There was a significant and positive correlation between GRS, latitude and longitude. According to PGLSs, three ecological traits, related to the habitat use, migratory and thermal tolerance hypotheses, were significantly correlated with GRS, mid-range longitude and mid-range latitude. Two traits related to locomotion were further related to GRS. There was no phylogenetic effect on GRS (i.e. no phylogenetic conservatism). Partial regressions revealed complex direct and indirect relationships between ecological traits, mid-range latitude, mid-range longitude and GRS.
   Main conclusions Our results show that traits related to the ability to use dispersal corridors, as well as traits directly related to mobility, are useful in understanding biodiversity patterns such as Rapoport's rule. However, because of a weak explanatory power, we conclude that using biological proxies of GRS to predict species at risk of extinction would be premature.

AB  - Federal, state, and local governments construct thousands of kilometers of roads each year in the U.S.A., as well as undertaking widening, rerouting or repair projects. Under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), environmental impacts from such construction must be offset by mitigation measures (e.g., stream or wetland restoration). Unfortunately, restoration projects often are opportunistic, do not consider a broad landscape context, and have a low benefit-cost ratio. In 2007, the Maryland State Highway Administration asked The Conservation Fund, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to help identify and evaluate natural resource stewardship opportunities in four Maryland watersheds that could potentially be affected by construction of a highway bypass. Stewardship activities, including conservation, restoration, or management of natural resources, would go above and beyond required mitigation. After soliciting feedback from stakeholders and reviewing pertinent literature, we modeled and validated a conservation network of high-quality wildlife and plant habitat (core areas), large contiguous natural areas (hubs), and linkages to facilitate wildlife movement and gene flow (corridors). We then ranked elements of this network at multiple scales, and identified high priority areas for conservation and restoration. Finally, we developed and tested protocols for field assessment and benefit-cost optimization. We hope that this approach can be adapted and improved by highway agencies and other entities for environmental planning and protection, and have a report available upon request with full details.

AB  - Aim Many subtropical organisms exhibit an East Asian-Tethyan disjunction, a distribution split between East Asia and the Mediterranean. The underlying mechanisms and timing have remained unclear to date. The evolutionary history of Quercus section Ilex Loudon, a representative East Asian-Tethyan disjunct lineage with a rich and widespread fossil record, was investigated to understand the key drivers of this disjunction. Location Eurasia. Methods The phylogeny of Quercus section Ilex was reconstructed using RAD-seq. Divergence times were estimated based on three fossil calibrations. Ancestral range and niche were reconstructed on the calibrated tree to infer the timing of transitions in geographic distributions and niche. Convergence in ecological space was estimated by fitting alternative multiple-regime Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models. Leaf shape affinities among extant and fossil taxa of section Ilex were assessed using geometric morphometric approaches. Results Six clades were well resolved in section Ilex. Ancestral range reconstruction and divergence time dating suggest a wide distribution along the East Tethys seaway, with initial divergence at the mid-Eocene, and all six clades originating before the Miocene. The section dispersed from East Asia to the Mediterranean at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. A shift toward higher elevations was detected in the Himalayan clade during the middle or late Miocene. European fossil lineages during the early Miocene differ in leaf morphology from later lineages, which we infer to be a consequence of adaptive differentiation or species turnover. Main conclusions Quercus section Ilex was widespread along the East Tethys seaway from the middle Eocene onward. The European holly oaks originated from an East Asian ancestral lineage that dispersed to Europe via the Tibet-Himalaya corridor in the Oligocene. Lowlands along the margins of the Himalayas and through an Oligocene Tibetan valley served as the dispersal route(s) for these species. Changing climates drove Miocene extinction and local adaptation of European lineages.

AB  - We examined vegetative and thermal aspects of roost-site selection in urban Yellow-billed Magpies (Pica nuttalli) in Sacramento, California, from winter 2003 to spring 2004. Vegetation used for roosting included cultivated species such as glossy privet (Ligustrum lucidum), English ivy (Hedera helix), and white mulberry (Morus alba), and native species such as interior live oak (Quercus wislizeni), valley oak (Q. lobata), and California laurel (Umbellularia californica). Percent canopy cover was consistently high (mean = 94% +/- 1.9 SD). Mean roost height was 9.7 m +/- 3.5 SD and the mean height at which magpies roosted was 6.6 m +/- 2.0 SD. Communal roosts were generally located within or near riparian corridors. Magpies roosted in relatively warm microhabitats, but they did not appear to obtain a thermal advantage by roosting communally. The timing of roost occupancy was restricted primarily to times when the roost was thermally advantageous.

AB  - Aims
   Habitat connectivity is important in conservation since isolation can diminish the potential of a population for adaptation and increase its risk of extinction. However, conservation of naturally patchy ecosystems such as peatlands has mainly focused on preserving specific sites with exceptional characteristics, neglecting the potential interconnectivity between patches. In order to better understand plant dynamics within a peatland network, we assessed the effect of population isolation on genetic distinctiveness, phenotypic variations and germination rates using the peatland-obligate white-fringed orchid (Platanthera blephariglottis).
   Methods
   Fifteen phenotypic traits were measured for 24 individuals per population (20 distinct populations, Quebec, Canada) and germination rates of nearly 20 000 seeds were assessed. Genetic distinctiveness was quantified for 26 populations using single nucleotide polymorphism markers obtained via a pooled genotyping-by-sequencing approach. Geographic isolation was measured as the distance to the nearest population and as the number of populations occurring in concentric buffer zones (within a radius of 2, 5 and 10 km) around the studied populations.
   Important Findings
   All phenotypic traits showed significant differences among populations. Genetic results also indicated a pattern of isolation-bydistance, which suggests that seed and/ or pollen exchange is restricted geographically. Finally, all phenotypic traits, as well as a reduced germination rate, were correlated with either geographic isolation or genetic distance. We conclude that geographic isolation likely restricts gene flow, which in turn may affect germination. Consequently, it is imperative that conservation programs take into account the patchy nature of such ecosystems, rather than targeting a few specific sites with exceptional character for preservation.

AB  - The structure of pollination networks, particularly its nestedness, contain important information on network assemblages. However, there is still limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying nested pollination network structures. Here, we investigate the role of adaptive interaction switching (AIS), island area, isolation, age and sampling effort in explaining the nestedness of pollination networks across ten Galapagos Islands. The AIS algorithm is inspired by Wallace's elimination of the unfit, where a species constantly replaces its least profitable mutualistic partner with a new partner selected at random. To explain network structures, we first use a dynamic model that includes functional response of pollination and AIS, with only species richness and binary connectance as input (hereafter the AIS model). Thereafter, other explanatory variables (isolation, area, age and sampling effort) were added to the model. In four out of ten islands, the pollination network was significantly nested, and predictions from the AIS model correlated with observed structures, explaining 69% variation in nestedness. Overall, in terms of independent contribution from hierarchical partitioning of variation in observed nestedness, the AIS model predictions contributed the most (37%), followed by sampling effort (28%) and island area (22%), with only trivial contributions from island isolation and age. Therefore, adaptive switching of biotic interactions seems to be key to ensure network function, with island biogeographic factors being only secondary. Although large islands could harbour more diverse assemblages and thus foster more nested structures, sufficient sampling proves to be essential for detecting non-random network structures.

AB  - Artificial reefs have been deployed in France since 1968 with the principal objective of enhancing success and continuity of artisanal fishing. Over 50 % of the volume of reef material has been deployed since 2000. Because of significant expansion of reef construction and availability of new research results concerning their performance since the late 1990s, we examined status and trends of French artificial reefs. Since the review of Barnab, et al. (Artificial reefs in European seas, 2000), 35 reports have been published and are analyzed here. Fish assemblages on artificial reefs have been the focus of ecological research, with emphasis on species richness and abundance. Fish production has been associated with the age of artificial reefs and the reef's structural complexity. The perception of stakeholders toward artificial reefs is a notable area of investigation. Economic studies are absent. Other developments in French artificial reefs over the last 10-15 years include the discontinued use of waste materials in reef construction, more directed design of reef structure, and the inclusion of additional objectives concerning biodiversity and recreation. Recommendations here include development of long-term ecological studies of artificial reefs and the evaluation of fishery production, including issues such as trophic dynamics, ecological connectivity of habitats, and socio-economic studies.

AB  - Urban greenery is valued not only for its aesthetic value but also for environmental services and the overall health benefits that follows. A large portion of the world population now resides in built environments, and there is growing need to provide a conducive and healthy environment for the dwellers. Vertical greenery systems (VGS) provide greenery opportunities in cities even when there is limited land space especially as recent technology enables people to grow plants outdoors as well as indoors. Indoor vertical greenery (iVGS) was installed to monitor any alteration in the temperature, humidity, particulate matter and use of space. The present study used an actual environment, included paralled corridors in the same building. The movement in both corridors were significantly (p < 0.05) correlated and post green wall establishment data showed the relationship changed significantly (r(2) = 0.8748, P < 0.0001, RMSE = 23.4521) with relatively more people using the corridor after the iVGS installed. Significant difference was seen in the humidity levels but not in the temperature after the installation. Particulate matter levels dropped 48.5%, 82.6%, 5.5% (PM2.5, PM10, > PM10 respectively) in the corridor with iVGS by the end of the data collection. These findings suggest larger green coverage would have a greater positive impact on the environmental conditions of an indoor environment.

AB  - In Kenya knowledge of the relative severity of threats to protected areas and the vulnerability of these areas to any threats is lacking. Such information is required, however, for assessment of the effectiveness of management of the country's protected areas, and to help identify critical management and policy weaknesses and priorities for improving management and allocating resources. We therefore studied the relative severity of threats to Kenya's 50 protected areas and their relative vulnerability to such threats based on the perceptions of protected area managers. Ten threats were identified by these managers, of which the most severe were illegal bushmeat hunting, poaching of large mammals, human-wildlife conflicts, human encroachment, and loss of migration corridors and dispersal areas. Thirty-two (64%) protected areas were vulnerable to over half of the threats, 54% vulnerable to over six of the threats and 32% vulnerable to over seven of the threats. Protected areas in marine, forested/montane and inland wetland ecosystems were regarded as highly vulnerable to the perceived threats. Protected areas adjacent to urban/industrial and agricultural areas were vulnerable to most of the threats. Our findings demonstrate that protected areas in Kenya are increasingly threatened, that major threats needs to be mitigated, and that prioritization of protected areas for strategic actions is required for effective management.

AB  - In the Transylvanian region, the Aries Valley stretches along the course of the Aries River, ending as tributary of Mure River. As well as these areas of great biodiversity value, the Aries Valley (drainage area of 2,540 km(2)) also crosses the region where local people set their villages and towns and use the surrounding areas as grasslands for grazing, mowing and fields for agriculture. The grassland types are present in patches, those used for hay production are scattered among agricultural fields and human settlements.
   Evidence from statistical analysis of the vegetation cover of a riparian area of Aries River Valley indicates that in the inventorying plots with low species diversity, there is a dominance of one or two species with individuals unequally distributed within and between plots. The layer 1-5 m is dominated by alien invasive species: Fallopia japonica, Helianthus tuberosus, Impatiens glanduligera, the studied area of Aries River Valley becoming a source for these alien species to invade the surrounding grasslands and agricultural fields. Especially Fallopia japonica individuals form compact patches invading the pastures and agricultural fields and the local farmers cannot use the land any more for fulfilling their own needs. The invasive species replace the native species from the grasslands and make the agricultural field inappropriate for crops cultivation. The river acts as a migration corridor for the alien species helping them to spread by seeds or fragments and invade new places, especially during spring and/or autumn floods, and a contamination source for the surrounding grasslands and agricultural fields.

AB  - We compared the migratory bird assemblage at a high-elevation site in central New Mexico (Capilla Peak in the Manzano Mountains) with the bird assemblage at a low-elevation riparian corridor site (Rio Grande Nature Center State Park in Albuquerque). During fall 2001-2003, we used mist nets to sample these bird assemblages. We found greater species richness at the low-elevation site than at the high-elevation site, both overall and for most migratory and resident subgroups. However, at the high-elevation site we captured more species that may have had local origins at high elevations. Over the course of the study, capture rates were similar between sites, but there was greater annual variation in capture rates at the high-elevation site than at the low-elevation site. Several species were captured at higher rates at one site versus the other, and some were captured strictly at one or the other site. Our data showed that both sites supported many species in large numbers, and both riparian and montane habitats in the southwestern U.S.A. should be recognized for their importance as potential stopover sites for migrating birds.

AB  - Northern Australia is biologically diverse and of national and global conservation signicance. Its ancient landscape contains the world's largest area of savannah ecosystem in good ecological condition and its rivers are largely free-flowing. Agriculture, previously confined largely to open range-land grazing, is set to expand in extent and to focus much more on irrigated cropping and horticulture. Demands on the water resources of the region are thus, inevitably increasing. Reliable information is required to guide and inform development and help plan for a sustainable future for the region which includes healthy rivers that contain diverse fish assemblages. Based on a range of information sources, including the outcomes of recent and extensive new field surveys, this study maps the distribution of the 111 freshwater fishes (excluding elasmobranches) and 42 estuarine vagrants recorded from freshwater habitats of the region. We classify the habitat use and migratory biology of each species. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the diversity and distribution of fishes of the region within a standardised nomenclatural framework. In addition, we summarise the outcomes of recent phylogeographic and phylogenetic research using molecular technologies to identify where issues of taxonomy may need further scrutiny. The study provides an informed basis for further research on the spatial arrangement of biodiversity and its relationship to environmental factors (e.g. hydrology), conservation planning and phylogentic variation within individual taxa.

AB  - Understanding the degree of connectivity between coastal and island landscapes and nearby coral reefs is vital to the integrated management of terrestrial and marine environments in the tropics. Coral reef fish are capable of navigating appropriate settlement habitats following their pelagic larval phase, but the mechanisms by which they do this are unclear. The importance of olfactory cues in settlement site selection has been demonstrated, and there is increasing evidence that chemical cues from terrestrial sources may be important for some species. Here, we test the olfactory preferences of eight island-associated coral reef fish recruits and one generalist species to discern the capacity for terrestrial cue recognition that may aid in settlement site selection. A series of pairwise choice experiments were used to evaluate the potential role that terrestrial, water-borne olfactory cues play in island-reef recognition. Olfactory stimuli tested included near-shore water, terrestrial rainforest leaf litter, and olfactory cues collected from different reef types (reefs surrounding vegetated islands, and reefs with no islands present). All eight island-associated species demonstrated high levels of olfactory discrimination and responded positively toward olfactory cues indicating the presence of a vegetated island. We hypothesize that although these fish use a suite of cues for settlement site recognition, one mechanism in locating their island/reef habitat is through the olfactory cues produced by vegetated islands. This research highlights the role terrestrial olfactory cues play in large-scale settlement site selection and suggests a high degree of ecosystem connectivity.

AB  - Limiting climate change to less than 2 degrees C is the focus of international policy under the climate convention (UNFCCC), and is essential to preventing extinctions, a focus of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). The post-2020 biodiversity framework drafted by the CBD proposes conserving 30% of both land and oceans by 2030. However, the combined impact on extinction risk of species from limiting climate change and increasing the extent of protected and conserved areas has not been assessed. Here we create conservation spatial plans to minimize extinction risk in the tropics using data on 289 219 species and modeling two future greenhouse gas concentration pathways (RCP2.6 and 8.5) while varying the extent of terrestrial protected land and conserved areas from <17% to 50%. We find that limiting climate change to 2 degrees C and conserving 30% of terrestrial area could more than halve aggregate extinction risk compared with uncontrolled climate change and no increase in conserved area.

AB  - Habitat connectivity is important for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem processes yet globally is highly restricted by anthropogenic actions. Anthropogenic barriers are common in aquatic ecosystems; however, the effects of smallscale barriers such as floodgates have received relatively little study. Here we assess fish communities in ten tributaries over the spring-summer season of the lower Fraser River (British Columbia, Canada), five with floodgates and five reference sites without barriers, located primarily in agricultural land use areas. While the Fraser River supports the largest salmon runs in Canada, the lower Fraser river-floodplain ecosystem has numerous dikes and floodgates to protect valuable agricultural and urban developments. Floodgate presence was associated with reduced dissolved oxygen concentrations, threefold greater abundance of invasive fish species, and decreased abundances of five native fish species, including two salmon species. These findings provide evidence that floodgates decrease suitable habitat for native fishes, and become hotspots for non-native species. Given climate change, sea-level rise, and aging flood protection infrastructure, there is an opportunity to incorporate biodiversity considerations into further development or restoration of this infrastructure.

AB  - The present study aimed to analyze the importance of the Permanent Preservation Areas (PPA) for the forest remnants maintenance in the city of Sorocaba, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. A forest remnants map was made using aerial photographs from 2006, and hydrographic and slope maps were used to PPA determination. Two scenarios were compared with landscape metrics: real (with current forest) and ideal ( current forest adding the PPA restoration). The results showed that 19% of the city territory were classified as PPA, and from this area, only 45% have forest cover. The preserved PPA represents 50% of all forest cover in the landscape. Restoring the PPA would increase from 16.68% to 28% of forest cover landscape and enable the emergence of fragments larger than 3,000 ha. In the real scenario, the bigger fragments have 300 ha. The presence of forest remnants is closely related to PPA areas: riverbanks, floodplains and hillside, where urban occupation was hampered and there is legal protection. The situation shows that the PPA play a fundamental role in forest patches conservation in a largely urbanized city, where natural areas support pressure. The evaluation of the scenarios showed that the incorporation of the legal provisions in planning and territorial ordering subsides the strategies for the maintenance of natural habitats and, consequently the reduction of the negative effects on biodiversity. However, the recent changes in Forest Code may represent a retrocession in the environmental scenario against to the increasing urbanization.

AB  - Effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on the behavior of individual organisms may have direct consequences on population viability in altered forest ecosystems. The American marten (Martes americana) is a forest specialist considered as one of the most sensitive species to human-induced disturbances. As some studies have shown that martens cannot tolerate >3040% clear-cuts within their home range, we investigated marten space use (home range size and overlap) and habitat selection in landscapes fragmented by 2 different patterns of timber harvesting in the black spruce boreal forest: dispersed-cut landscapes (1080ha cut-blocks) and clustered-cut landscapes (50200ha cut-blocks). We installed radio-collars on female martens and determined 20 winter home ranges (100% minimum convex polygons and 6090% kernels) in dispersed-cut (n=8) and clustered-cut (n=12) landscapes. Home range size was not related to the proportion of clear-cuts (i.e., habitat loss), but rather to the proportion of mixedwood stands 70120 years old. However, female body condition was correlated to habitat condition inside their home ranges (i.e., amount of residual forest and recent clear-cuts). At the home range scale, we determined that mixedwood forests were also among the most used forest stands and the least used were recent clear-cuts and forested bogs, using resource selection functions. At the landscape scale, home ranges included more mixedwood forests than random polygons and marten high activity zones were composed of more residual forest and less human-induced disturbances (clear-cuts, edges, and roads). These results suggest that mixedwood forests, which occupy approximately 10% of the study area, play a critical role for martens in this conifer-dominated boreal landscape. We recommend permanent retention or special management considerations for these isolated stands, as harvesting mixedwood often leads to forest composition conversion that would reduce the availability of this highly used habitat.

AB  - Instream barriers (e.g. dams, weirs and road crossings) fragment aquatic habitat and prevent the upstream movement of fish, impairing the ability of fishes to complete critical life stages, access critical habitat and for dispersal among local populations. Mitigation efforts have improved aquatic connectivity to some degree, but it has been challenging to quantify the overall improvement in connectivity without long-term and costly field assessments. The development of spatially explicit habitat connectivity indices make it possible to evaluate current stream connectivity, and quantify the improvement prior mitigation projects have had on connectivity. We combined a list of instream barrier mitigation projects completed in five watersheds in the Toronto (Ontario, Canada) area from 1987-2016 (mitigated barriers) and a previously established inventory of all known instream barriers in 2016 (current barriers). The cumulative improvement to connectivity was measured for potadromous (remain in tributaries) and diadromous (move between tributaries and lake) fish species using the dendritic connectivity index. Aquatic connectivity improved for diadromous species between 0 and 14.5% and for potadromous species between 0.1 and 4.4% in the five studied watersheds. Some variation in improvement among the watersheds can likely be attributed to differences in mitigation strategies among the watersheds and a historical emphasis on mitigating instream barriers to benefit migratory salmonid species.

AB  - Faunal complexity is an impediment to understanding the function of fragmented coastal wetlands. Conceiving faunal communities as part of a larger network of communities (or a metacommunity) helps to resolve this complexity by enabling simultaneous consideration of local environmental influences and 'regional' dispersal-driven processes. We assessed the role of local vs. regional factors on the fish assemblage structure of a wetland system comprising 20 tidal pools. In equivalent freshwater metacommunities, regional factors often override local influences, resulting in patterns of nestedness among patches as species and individuals are progressively filtered out along gradients of isolation. While the tidal pool assemblage was primarily structured by regional processes, patterns deviated from freshwater systems, as 2 faunal groups exhibited contrasting responses to tidal connectivity. A subset of typical estuary channel fauna was restricted to better connected pools at lower elevations, which connect to the estuary channel or other pools on most neap high tides. Frequent connections among these pools subsequently enabled sorting of species relative to preferred environmental condition (including depth and substrate). Contradicting models of nestedness, a distinct faunal group including salt marsh residents and juvenile marine-spawned taxa occurred in greater abundances in more isolated, higher elevation pools, which connect to the estuary channel or other pools only on larger spring high tides. These higher elevation pools represent a functionally unique seascape component, and colonisation by marine-spawned taxa seems to reflect an innate drive to ascend upstream gradients to access them. This illustrates how seemingly similar patches within coastal wetlands may perform considerably different nursery functions because of their position in the landscape. Together, metacommunity and seascape frameworks offer complementary perspectives in understanding the role of spatial ecology in structuring coastal ecosystem function and productivity.

AB  - AimOur aim was to determine the age and dispersal history of Colorado pinon (Pinus edulis) in western Colorado during the early to late Holocene using radiocarbon-dated needles and nutshells from packrat (Neotoma spp.) middens.
   LocationThe Uncompahgre Plateau (UP) comprises more than 600,000ha of public and private lands in west-central Colorado, USA. Elevations within UP range from 1400 to 3140m and it is characterized by numerous deep canyons and flat-topped mesas. The Upper Gunnison Basin (UGB) encompasses a 243,000-ha area enclosed within the southern Rocky Mountains in south-western Colorado, USA. It spans 2200-4300m in elevation, with no outlet apart from the Black Canyon of the Gunnison lower than 2650m.
   MethodsMiddens were sampled by breaking off small sections of solidified deposits located in caves and crevices that were then disaggregated in water with repeated rinsing to separate all the plant remains. Single conifer needles and nutshells from 28 middens were radiocarbon dated to determine the age and timing of dispersal into western Colorado.
   ResultsThirty-two midden samples were collected, of which 28 produced identifiable plant remains that were radiocarbon dated. Pinon needles and/or nutshells were identified and radiocarbon dated from 20 of these middens from seven localities in UP. The results indicated that pinon did not become established in UP until c.6000yrbp, which contrasts with the nearby UGB, where pinon charcoal has been identified from seven archaeological sites with dates ranging from 8000 to 3000yrbp.
   Main conclusionsOur data are consistent with a model of late Pleistocene/early Holocene pinon migration into the Colorado Plateau from Arizona and New Mexico before becoming established in western Colorado. The timing of the pinon migration into south-central Colorado along the Rio Grande corridor from New Mexico remains uncertain. While pinon-juniper woodlands currently dominate the lower elevations of UP, pinon had disappeared from UGB by c.3000yrbp and remains absent there today except for a few isolated trees.

AB  - Long celebrated for its spectacular landscapes and strikingly high levels of endemic biodiversity, the Philippines has been studied intensively by biogeographers for two centuries. Concentration of so many endemic land vertebrates into a small area and shared patterns of distribution in many unrelated forms has inspired a search for common mechanisms of production, partitioning, and maintenance of life in the archipelago. In this review, we (a) characterize an ongoing renaissance of species discovery, (b) discuss the changing way biogeographers conceive of the archipelago, (c) review the role molecular phylogenetic studies play in understanding the evolutionary history of Philippine vertebrates, and (d) describe how a 25-year Pleistocene island connectivity paradigm continues to provide some explanatory power, but has been augmented by increased understanding of the archipelago's geological history and ecological gradients. Finally, we (e) review new insights provided by studies of adaptive versus nonadaptive radiation and phylogenetic perspectives on community ecology.

AB  - We reviewed 140 papers to assess the ecological effectiveness of South Africa's marine protected areas (MPAs). Evidence was assessed for coverage and representivity, protection of important biodiversity areas, other recognised elements of effectiveness, connectivity, and ecological effects-from the scale of individual MPAs to the MPA network scale. We conducted complementary novel analyses to supplement the review and to objectively determine where and how the MPA network can be improved. Evidence shows that South Africa's MPAs now provide some protection to all ecoregions and 87% of ecosystem types but to less than 50% of assessed species groups. MPAs are generally well-sited, but gaps were revealed on the west coast and in estuaries, the deep sea, and two ecologically and biologically significant areas. Enforcement emerged as a key concern, and many MPAs could be improved through expansion or by increasing no-take areas. The majority of relevant papers recorded beneficial ecological effects, detectable as increases in parameters such as the abundance, biomass, sizes or reproductive output of species. Few papers examined whether ecological benefits translate into adjacent fisheries benefits, but all those that did recorded positive effects. Full protection was more effective than partial protection, with effectiveness most clearly demonstrated for vulnerable target taxa. Further research and monitoring to achieve evaluations of effectiveness are recommended, with greater focus on neglected MPAs and species. Understanding the ecological connectivity between MPAs, an important dimension for climate-change adaptation and hence for the persistence and resilience of South Africa's marine biodiversity, is identified as a key area for future research and inclusion in MPA planning.

AB  - Amphibians are vital elements of ecosystems, serving as predator and prey. Their biphasic nature makes them dependent on aquatic and terrestrial habitats; as wet-skinned ectotherms, they are vulnerable to a range of environmental threats, including climate change. Yellowstone National Park (YNP) is becoming warmer and drier, and some wetlands important to amphibians have diminished. Continued climate change is predicted to reduce snowpack, soil moisture, and forest cover. We used data from models of future climate and vegetation cover to mechanistically model how climate change might affect the movements of Western Toads (Anaxyrus boreas) across the landscape of three test areas in YNP for the years 2050 and 2090, compared to 2000 as a baseline. Least-cost path analysis produced mixed results: for 2050 and 2090, physiological costs of movement increased in one test area and decreased in another; they were mixed in the third. These changes generally reflect the preference by toads for more open forests. Estimating costs for other species of YNP amphibians produced more negative results. For Columbia Spotted Frogs (Rana luteiventris) and Boreal Chorus Frogs (Pseudacris maculata) (both more aquatic and less adapted to terrestrial habitats), movement costs increased by about 2-15X. Reduced frequency or duration of rain events might limit the nocturnal movements of Western Tiger Salamanders (Ambystoma mavortium). Climate change may not have negative impacts on all amphibians throughout YNP, but increased movement costs for terrestrial habitats will accentuate effects of drying wetlands in at least parts of YNP. Land management actions that preserve habitat structure of both forest and low shrub cover may help mitigate continued drying conditions of climate change.

AB  - The western population of the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1987 due to extensive population declines. Declines have been linked to site conversion of native pine (Pinus spp.) forests for urban development, agriculture, and commercial forest management. We conducted surveys to detect tortoise burrows on corporate timberlands in southern Mississippi and southwestern Alabama during summer 1994. We surveyed 2,759 0.5-ha strip transects on soil types of 9 different suitability categories for gopher tortoises. We found 460 active and 264 abandoned burrows on the 1,380 ha surveyed. Edaphic and vegetative conditions, such as sandy soils and total and midstory canopy coverage, influenced gopher tortoise occurrence. Logistic regression analyses revealed that active burrow occurrence was related positively to deep, sandy soils and related negatively to total canopy closure and fine loam soils with limited sand content. Abandoned burrow occurrence was related positively to increasing midstory canopy closure and selected soil types. Sandy soils and open overstory canopy that created favorable burrowing, nesting, and foraging conditions were important influences in active burrow occurrence. Vegetation management techniques, such as prescribed fire, midstory control, and intermediate forest stand thinning, are recommended on gopher tortoise conservation areas and connective corridor habitats on commercial timberlands. We theorize that restoration of longleaf pine (P. palustris) forests on sandy ridges can produce desirable core habitats and dispersal corridors for gopher tortoises in landscapes dominated by intensively managed pine plantations.

AB  - Railway networks contribute to the direct mortality of wildlife through collisions with trains, which can threaten vulnerable wildlife populations even in protected areas, including grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in Banff and Yoho National Parks, Canada. Mitigation to reduce bear-train collisions requires information about how grizzly bears use the railway spatially and temporally and how particular types of use might increase collision vulnerability. We used data from 27 grizzly bears fitted with global positioning system (GPS) collars between 2000 and 2016 to relate railway use by bears via resource selection functions to variables that described land cover, human use, and topography. We used the same suite of explanatory variables to distinguish pairs of 4 types of steps, in which 3 successive GPS points (with 2-hr fix rates) included >= 1 within 30 m of the rail (hereafter on) and 2 others that defined locations where bears effectively entered the railway (first fix off rail, next 2 on), crossed it (only the middle fix on the rail), continued along the railway (all 3 fixes on), or exited the railway corridor (first 2 on, last off). We compared both sites of higher use and each of these 4 step types to the relative frequency of bear-train collisions, predicting a positive correlation for continue step types. Relative to available locations, bears were more likely to use the railway close to railroad sidings (sections of twinned track where trains sometimes stop), at intermediate distances from human-use features (e.g., town sites, highways, trails), in areas with lower values of the compound topographic index (a proxy for wetness; within 500 m), and within 90 m of rugged terrain. Seasonally, bears made greater use of the railway in spring and fall. Among 1,515 sequences of 3 steps, crossing locations comprised >50% and were most distinct from continue locations (about 20%), which occurred in areas with more rugged terrain (within 300 m), closer to railway sidings, in spring and fall, and with steps that were 60% shorter. Contrary to our prediction, past reports of bear-train collisions were negatively correlated with continue locations and unrelated to overall use or any other movement type. Our results suggest that railway use by bears increased where it provided increased forage or easier travel, particularly in spring and fall, but more work will be needed to determine the mechanistic basis of bear-train collisions. Meanwhile, mitigation efforts such as habitat alteration or warning systems might target locations where past strikes are concentrated for grizzly bears or other sensitive populations.

AB  - Planting of woody species is a commonly used method to restore road embankments. Given the importance of road verges as potential corridors and refuge for biodiversity, natural plant regeneration processes may also play an important role in establishing vegetation into these novel landscape elements. Most studies on woody colonization of roadsides have considered only a few sites covering a very limited environmental range. Therefore, it is unclear whether or not there are general patterns that may explain the development of woody vegetation. We analyzed woody vegetation colonization in embankments over a large and heterogeneous territory, using aerial photographs, available repositories of environmental and land management data sets and some embankment features. We addressed the following questions: (1) To what extent does the presence of planted woody plants influence patterns of natural recruitment in road embankments? and (2) What are the key factors underlying natural/passive plant colonization in road embankments? We used Multi-Model Inference (MMI) analysis to model woody vegetation cover. According to our results, woody-planted vegetation does not have a facilitating effect on natural colonization, questioning the efficiency of reforestation measures in the ecological integration of areas affected by road construction. Passive natural plant colonization occurs spontaneously in road verges and shows a highly site-dependent pattern, driven mainly by the age of embankments and the immediate surrounding vegetation. Therefore, we suggest that natural succession may be sufficiently effective as a passive restoration measure on embankments in the long term. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The spatial arrangement of reserves within a network is critical to the long-term persistence of dispersing species. In this paper, based on network environ analysis, an approach is presented to explicitly measure such ecological function, in which the dispersal-based interactions between reserves are considered from a holistic view by exploring not only species' direct dispersals but also their indirect ones. The proposed method first defines the ecological function of spatial arrangement of reserves as the probability that a species will survive for long time in a reserve network, and then expands this function by taking the reserve loss into account when evaluating a species' extinction probability at each reserve. A case study for L. nycthemera and M. thibetana from Wuyishan Nature Reserve, Fujian Province, China, is further conducted. The highest probabilities of lone-term survival are identified for both species in the reserve networks that contain several migrations with high successful dispersal probability. In addition, the path number of each common reserve under neighboring scenarios is found to be influenced by the changes of direct dispersal, from which the criteria for protecting and optimizing the spatial configuration of reserves in a nature reserve are derived. For Wuyishan Nature Reserve, these criteria may act as important bases to restrict and guide the development of tourism of surrounding cities and the socio-economic activities of local residents. It is concluded that the proposed method can provide an effective way to examine the ecological function of spatial arrangement of reserve network and contribute to species' long-term persistence in nature reserves.

AB  - The American tropical landscape is characterized nowadays by extensive areas of pastures and crop-fields, in which the remaining forest fragments are immersed. Although the areas cleared for cultivation and cattle raising are mainly covered by herbaceous plants, they are not devoid of trees. Pastures and crop-fields in many areas of tropical America are usually dotted with trees that were spared when the site was cleared. Trees of different species isolated in pastures or crop-fields are not only a common feature, but an integral part of the current fragmented landscape in the Neotropics. We maintain that isolated trees of rainforest species play a fundamental role in the ecological dynamics of fragmented landscapes. In this contribution, we describe the density and floristic composition of isolated trees in the pastures of Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. We examine the effects of these trees on local fauna and flora, and their role as facilitators of rainforest regeneration in pastures. Finally, we address the importance of these trees, together with other arboreal elements of the anthropogenic landscape, to connectivity and the maintenance of local diversity.

AB  - In a rapidly changing climate, conservation practitioners could better use geodiversity in a broad range of conservation decisions. We explored selected avenues through which this integration might improve decision making and organized them within the adaptive management cycle of assessment, planning, implementation, and monitoring. Geodiversity is seldom referenced in predominant environmental law and policy. With most natural resource agencies mandated to conserve certain categories of species, agency personnel are challenged to find ways to practically implement new directives aimed at coping with climate change while retaining their species-centered mandate. Ecoregions and ecological classifications provide clear mechanisms to consider geodiversity in plans or decisions, the inclusion of which will help foster the resilience of conservation to climate change. Methods for biodiversity assessment, such as gap analysis, climate change vulnerability analysis, and ecological process modeling, can readily accommodate inclusion of a geophysical component. We adapted others' approaches for characterizing landscapes along a continuum of climate change vulnerability for the biota they support from resistant, to resilient, to susceptible, and to sensitive and then summarized options for integrating geodiversity into planning in each landscape type. In landscapes that are relatively resistant to climate change, options exist to fully represent geodiversity while ensuring that dynamic ecological processes can change over time. In more susceptible landscapes, strategies aiming to maintain or restore ecosystem resilience and connectivity are paramount. Implementing actions on the ground requires understanding of geophysical constraints on species and an increasingly nimble approach to establishing management and restoration goals. Because decisions that are implemented today will be revisited and amended into the future, increasingly sophisticated forms of monitoring and adaptation will be required to ensure that conservation efforts fully consider the value of geodiversity for supporting biodiversity in the face of a changing climate.
   Incorporacion de la Geodiversidad en las Decisiones de Conservacion En un clima que cambia rapidamente, quienes practican la conservacion podrian usar la geodiversidad de mejor manera en una gama amplia de deciones de conservacion. Exploramos vias selectas por medio de las cuales esta integracion puede mejorar la toma de decisiones y las organizamos dentro del ciclo de manejo adaptativo de evaluacion, planeacion, implementacion y monitoreo. En pocas ocasiones se menciona a la geodiversidad en las leyes y la politica ambiental predominantes. Como la mayoria de las agencias de recursos naturales bajo mandato de conservar ciertas categorias de especies, el personal de las agencias se ve enfrentado a encontrar formas de implementar de manera practica nuevas directivas con miras a salir adelante frente al cambio climatico mientras se retienen los mandatos centrados en especies. Las ecoregiones y las clasificaciones ecologicas proporcionan mecanismos claros para considerar a la geodiversidad en los planes o decisiones. Esta inclusion ayudara a fomentar la resiliencia de la conservacion ante el cambio climatico. Los metodos para la evaluacion de la biodiversidad, como el analisis de intervalo, el analisis de vulnerabilidad ante el cambio climatico, y el modelado de procesos ecologicos, pueden adaptarse pronto a la inclusion del componente geofisico. Adaptamos las estrategias de otros para caracterizar paisajes de resistente, a resiliente, a susceptible, y hasta sensible, a lo largo de un continuo de vulnerabilidad ante el cambio climatico de la biota que presentan y despues resumimos las opciones para integrar a la geodiversidad en la planeacion en cada tipo de paisaje. En los paisajes que son relativamente resistentes al cambio climatico, existen opciones para representar completamente a la geodiversidad mientras se asegura que los procesos ecologicos dinamicos pueden cambiar a lo largo del tiempo. En los paisajes mas susceptibles, las estrategias que buscan mantener o restaurar la resiliencia ambiental y la conectividad son primordiales. Implementar acciones sobre el suelo requiere del entendimiento de las restricciones geofisicas sobre las especies y un enfoque cada vez mas agil para establecer objetivos de manejo y restauracion. Ya que las decisiones que se implementan hoy en dia seran reconsideradas y modificadas hacia el futuro, se requeriran de formas de monitoreo y adaptacion cada vez mas sofisticadas para asegurar que los esfuerzos de conservacion consideren de lleno el valor de la geodiversidad para apoyar a la biodiversidad de frente al clima cambiante.

AB  - Along the Magra River (Central-Northern Italy), human control at the local-scale appears to be the main driving factor of morphological changes observed since WWII. Our results, based on aerial photographs analysis and field survey, indicate that the reduction in channel width observed between the 1950s and the 1980s is probably due to local factors rather than to basin-scale factors. With regard to riparian landscape pattern, evolution from a braided pattern to a wandering/meandering pattern increases landscape diversity but some differences exist between reaches because of the different morphological trajectory and human impact. Moreover, this landscape diversity seems poorly linked to landform age, as we had expected. Evolution from a bar-braided pattern to a single-thread system generates some paradoxes from a conservation perspective: disappearance of a braided pattern but riparian woodland expansion and landscape diversity increase. This research suggests that landscape diversity is a complex attribute that should be considered with other attributes such as the specificity of habitats. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Watersheds draining the Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP) of Alaska are dominated by permafrost and snowmelt runoff that create abundant surface storage in the form of lakes, wetlands, and beaded streams. These surface water elements compose complex drainage networks that affect aquatic ecosystem connectivity and hydrologic behavior. The 4676 km(2) Fish Creek drainage basin is composed of three watersheds that represent a gradient of the ACP landscape with varying extents of eolian, lacustrine, and fluvial landforms. In each watershed, we analyzed 2.5-m-resolution aerial photography, a 5-m digital elevation model, and river gauging and climate records to better understand ACP watershed structure and processes. We show that connected lakes accounted for 19 to 26% of drainage density among watersheds and most all channels initiate from lake basins in the form of beaded streams. Of the >2500 lakes in these watersheds, 33% have perennial streamflow connectivity, and these represent 66% of total lake area extent. Deeper lakes with over-wintering habitat were more abundant in the watershed with eolian sand deposits, while the watershed with marine silt deposits contained a greater extent of beaded streams and shallow thermokarst lakes that provide essential summer feeding habitat. Comparison of flow regimes among watersheds showed that higher lake extent and lower drained lake-basin extent corresponded with lower snowmelt and higher baseflow runoff. Variation in baseflow runoff among watersheds was most pronounced during drought conditions in 2007 with corresponding reduction in snowmelt peak flows the following year. Comparison with other Arctic watersheds indicates that lake area extent corresponds to slower recession of both snowmelt and baseflow runoff. These analyses help refine our understanding of how Arctic watersheds are structured and function hydrologically, emphasizing the important role of lake basins and suggesting how future lake change may impact hydrologic processes.

AB  - The Sierra Madre sparrow Xenospiza baileyi, categorized as Endangered on the IUCN Red List, is endemic to Mexico. The subalpine bunch grasslands of the Transverse Volcanic Belt in the south of the Valley of Mexico are the last remaining habitat of this species. We conducted a detailed survey for the Sierra Madre sparrow using the point count method, and then described the species' habitat using a phytosociological approach. The two sets of information were pooled into a single analytical framework to identify priority habitats for the species. Eight vegetation communities were distinguished. The Festuca lugens-Muhlenbergia quadridentata and Stipa ichu bunch grassland communities had the highest densities of the Sierra Madre sparrow. Intensive burning and grazing activities and agricultural encroachment have restricted sparrow occupancy. Landscape analysis helped to delineate core grassland areas for the species and grassland strips and islands that could potentially act as habitat corridors. From the information generated in this study, which was shared with the local communities, we are establishing a participatory socioecological investigation for conservation of the Sierra Madre sparrow's habitat.

AB  - Linear infrastructures are known to facilitate the spread of undesirable species in ecosystems. Compared with other types of infrastructure, the role of power line rights-of-way (ROWs) as dispersal vectors remains poorly understood, especially with regard to peatlands. The aim of our study was to evaluate their impacts on the vegetation of ombrotrophic (bog) and minerotrophic (fen) peatlands. The vegetation communities within and adjacent to power line ROWs were sampled in 23 bogs and 11 fens in southern Quebec. In fens, invasive species were found in abundance along the first 250 m within ROWs, while native non-peatland species were able to spread into entire ROWs. Invasive species were also able to colonize the adjacent fen habitats but were mostly concentrated in the first 4 m from ROW edges. Some species were, however, able to establish at more than 43 m from ROWs. Invasive and native non-peatland species were mostly restricted to the first 31 m within ROWs intersecting a bog and almost none dispersed in the adjacent bog habitats. Overall, the average cover of native non-peatland and invasive species in ROWs was mostly related to intrinsic abiotic conditions such as water pH, water conductivity, and water table level, while landscape surrounding the peatland and historical variables (e. g., time elapse since the construction of the ROW) had few impacts in both bogs and fens.

AB  - Linear structures include fences, roads, railways, canalised water ways and power lines, all man-made. Fencing as a way of managing livestock began in the late 1800s, and by the early twentieth century was almost fully implemented throughout the Karoo sensu lato. The advent of these fences, and now in many instances, 'game proof' (similar to 2 m high) and electric fences have impacted native flora and fauna in various ways. Roads influence the quality and quantity of vegetation along corridors throughout the Karoo, with impacts on wildlife through increased mortality, but also provide foraging opportunities. Road-side structures, such as transmission poles, offer nest sites and perches in otherwise treeless landscapes, benefiting certain avifauna. Railway lines create similar corridors, carrying ungrazed vegetation along them. Their associated structures - culverts and (historically) steel frame bridges - provide nest sites for birds and some mammals. Transmission cables and pylons along power lines have mixed benefits to conservation, providing bird nest and perch sites, but can also cause bird mortalities. Unquestionably, these linear structures have had marked effects on the biota of the Karoo, through their effects on wildlife and livestock movement and mortality, plant demography and the spread of native and alien species.

AB  - Simple Summary The European hedgehog is one of the most popular and well-known wild animals, but its numbers are declining throughout Europe, especially in rural areas. Effective hedgehog conservation requires an understanding of the hedgehog's ability to adapt to a changing environment. Due to globally increasing urbanisation, the use of artificial light sources to illuminate the night, called light pollution, has spread dramatically. Light pollution significantly affects the behaviour and ecology of wildlife, but the hedgehog's behaviour towards light pollution remains unknown. We therefore investigated the effects of light pollution on the natural movement behaviour of hedgehogs living in an urban environment. Although hedgehogs can react very variably to environmental influences, the majority of hedgehogs studied here preferred to move in less illuminated rather than in strongly illuminated areas. This apparently rigid behaviour could be used in applied hedgehog conservation to connect isolated hedgehog populations or to safely guide the animals around places dangerous for them via dark corridors that are attractive for hedgehogs. With urban areas growing worldwide comes an increase in artificial light at night (ALAN), causing a significant impact on wildlife behaviour and its ecological relationships. The effects of ALAN on nocturnal and protected European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) are unknown but their identification is important for sustainable species conservation and management. In a pilot study, we investigated the influence of ALAN on the natural movement behaviour of 22 hedgehogs (nine females, 13 males) in urban environments. Over the course of four years, we equipped hedgehogs at three different study locations in Berlin with biologgers to record their behaviour for several weeks. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) tags to monitor their spatial behaviour, very high-frequency (VHF) loggers to locate their nests during daytime, and accelerometers to distinguish between active and passive behaviours. We compared the mean light intensity of the locations recorded when the hedgehogs were active with the mean light intensity of simulated locations randomly distributed in the individual's home range. We were able to show that the ALAN intensity of the hedgehogs' habitations was significantly lower compared to the simulated values, regardless of the animal's sex. This ALAN-related avoidance in the movement behaviour can be used for applied hedgehog conservation.

AB  - Following reports of dramatic declines in managed and feral honey bees from nearly every region of North America, scientists and resource managers from the U.S., Mexico, and Canada come together to review the quality of the evidence that honey bees as well as other pollinators are in long-term decline and to consider the potential consequences of these losses on the conservation of biodiversity and the stability of the yield of food crops. These experts in pollination ecology confirmed that the last 5 years of losses of honeybee colonies in North America leaves us with fewer managed pollinators than at any time in the last 50 years and that the management and protection of wild pollinators is an issue of paramount importance to our food supply system. Although there are conclusive data that indicate 1200 wild vertebrate pollination may be at risk, data on the status of most invertebrate species that act as pollination agents is lacking. The recommendations from a working group of over 20 field scientists, presented here, have been endorsed by 14 conservation and sustainable agriculture organizations, research institutes, and professional societies including the Society for Conservation Biology. Among the most critical priorities for future research and conservation of pollinator species are (1) increased attention to invertebrate systematics, monitoring, and reintroduction as part of critical habitat management and restoration plans. (2) multi-year assessments of the lethal and sublethal effects of pesticides, herbicides, and habitat fragmentation on the wild pollinator populations in and near croplands; (3) inclusion of the monitoring of seed and fruit set and floral visitation rates in endangered plant management and recovery plans; (4) inclusion of habitat needs for critically-important pollinators in the critical habitat designations for endangered plants; (5) identification and protection of floral reserves near roost sites along the "nectar corridors" of threatened migratory pollinators; and (6) investment in the restoration and management of a diversity of pollinators and their habitats adjacent to croplands in order to stabilize or improve crop yields The work group encourages increased education and training to ensure that both the lay, public and resource managers understand that pollination is one of the most important ecological services provided to agriculture through the responsible management and protection of wildland habitats and their populations of pollen-vectoring animals and nectar-producing plants.

AB  - The connectivity of fragmented landscapes is a function of the physical distance between suitable habitats and the characteristics of the habitat through which the animal is moving, i.e. the matrix. Experimental manipulations done to explain how spatial arrangement and composition of habitats affects biota remain scarce, particularly in marine systems. Holdfasts of the common kelp, Ecklonia radiata, are discrete units of habitat for small invertebrates (e.g. amphipods, isopods, molluscs, annelids) that can be isolated from other holdfasts by habitat, which may be less suitable (e.g. other species of algae or relatively bare space). We compared assemblages, which colonised defaunated holdfasts in experimentally created small-scale landscapes where patches of habitat (holdfasts) were distant versus close together and which had Sargassum spp. versus relatively bare space in the matrix. We also compared colonisation across matrices of crushed fucoid algae to assess whether the structural or chemical nature of algae in the matrix had the most influence on the colonisation. Assemblages in defaunted holdfasts differed between those that were close to and those that were distant from undisturbed holdfasts, where the matrix was devoid of vegetation. Where Sargassum spp. was present in the matrix, however, this difference disappeared and was possibly due to the chemical, rather than structural, characteristics of the fucoid matrix. The extent to which matrix habitat is a barrier to movement of invertebrates among holdfasts thus depends on not only how extensive it is but what type of habitat it contains. As within terrestrial systems, the nature of the matrix is also likely to be a fundamental component of the connectivity within marine systems.

AB  - The Primorje Gorski Kotar County is situated between Dalmatia, Central Croatia and Slavonia. The Bay of Kvarner (Port of Rijeka) is well connected with the Pannonian valley with the traffic routes passing through the Kupa River valley. The Primorje Gorski Kotar County is especially important when considering inland traffic connections between the Pannonian and the Adriatic territories, as well as for the traffic connection of the Mediterranean with the Central European territories. The nodes of the main road and railway traffic routes (Branch of the corridorVb and the Adriatic Ionian motorway), road, railway, sea and air traffic terminals are all concentrated in the Rijeka agglomeration. This fact, along with the relief characteristics of the coastal area and its abundant biodiversity characterize the complexity of the problem with regard to the solution of the overall traffic node.
   The complexity and management of individual traffic infrastructure segments at different administrative levels along with the spatial development of the area require a certain level of coordination and solution to the conflicts within the overall traffic network of the area.
   The already existing, planed elements of individual traffic networks are linked into an agglomerate of defined and composite traffic networks (road, railway, sea, air traffic etc.), and along with all adjoining elements (zones used for traffic etc.) form and integral traffic node the Rijeka node, which includes public and individual traffic, i.e. passenger and cargo traffic. An integral network of passenger and cargo traffic in the Rijeka node had to be outlined, as an element of development according to the spatial planning principles as well as general goals of overall development of the Primorje Gorski Kotar County. The aim of the Study was a long term and integrated definition of development of the Rijeka traffic node.

AB  - Archaeological research in the Philippines has significantly intensified over the past 20 years and is producing useful insights into the Prehistory of this diverse archipelago that is of relevance for entire Island Southeast Asia (ISEA). Variability in landscape formation, sea level and landmass influenced mobility, subsistence strategies and behavioural advancement of past human populations since the Late Pleistocene. The archipelago's proximity to Borneo, Sulawesi and Taiwan provided a favourable position to facilitate movements of people, material culture, technologies and innovations across Mainland and Island Southeast Asia. From this perspective, this paper reviews current research on human adaptation and interaction in the maritime environments of prehistoric Philippines and provides an update on ongoing research particularly on Late Pleistocene and Early/MidHolocene sites in Mindoro Island. It discusses the associated technological innovations, the efficient exploitation of a diversity of marine and terrestrial resources, an increase in plant use and processing, open sea faring and the establishment of maritime connections that spanned from the Southeast Asian Mainland across Island Southeast Asia and into Near Oceania. This connectivity between populations enabled the dissemination of information and ideas as evident in the dispersal of obsidian and shell tool technology as well as complex burial rituals. Such a widespread maritime network was established and utilized long before the arrival of early farming populations in the Late Holocene.

AB  - Land-use change associated with human development can alter aquatic habitat and imperil aquatic species. Fish are challenged when urban streams are altered, for example for stormwater conveyance, but little is known about how such activities influence the space use of individual fish. Electronic tagging and experimental displacement of fish can be used to explore site fidelity and homing behaviour of fish and can therefore be useful for testing hypotheses about space use and habitat selection. In this study, we used experimental displacement to determine how longnose dace (LND, Rhinichthys cataractae) utilize reaches within a watershed that have varying degrees of degradation. LND were tagged using passive integrated transponders (PIT tags), transported upstream, and released either into the natural stream reach, impaired stormwater drain reach, or at their confluence. Fixed PIT antennas were used to monitor movement of the PIT-tagged fish among the three reaches for a period of 3 weeks. LND exhibited dramatic and rapid selection against the stormwater drain. No LND moved into the drain and 97% of fish transported to the drain left within 24 h. LND were actively avoiding the stormwater drain, emphasizing the need for enhancement work to improve the biological connectivity of the system.

AB  - We investigated the population structure of Grosmannia clavigera (Gc), a fungal symbiont of the mountain pine beetle (MPB) that plays a crucial role in the establishment and reproductive success of this pathogen. This insectfungal complex has destroyed over 16 million ha of lodgepole pine forests in Canada, the largest MPB epidemic in recorded history. During this current epidemic, MPB has expanded its range beyond historically recorded boundaries, both northward and eastward, and has now reached the jack pine of Alberta, potentially threatening the Canadian boreal forest. To better understand the dynamics between the beetle and its fungal symbiont, we sampled 19 populations in western North America and genotyped individuals from these populations with eight microsatellite markers. The fungus displayed high haplotype diversity, with over 250 unique haplotypes observed in 335 single spore isolates. Linkage equilibria in 13 of the 19 populations suggested that the fungus reproduces sexually. Bayesian clustering and distance analyses identified four genetic clusters that corresponded to four major geographical regions, which suggested that the epidemic arose from multiple geographical sources. A genetic cluster north of the Rocky Mountains, where the MPB has recently become established, experienced a population bottleneck, probably as a result of the recent range expansion. The two genetic clusters located north and west of the Rocky Mountains contained many fungal isolates admixed from all populations, possibly due to the massive movement of MPB during the epidemic. The general agreement in northsouth differentiation of MPB and G. clavigera populations points to the fungal pathogens dependence on the movement of its insect vector. In addition, the patterns of diversity and the individual assignment tests of the fungal associate suggest that migration across the Rocky Mountains occurred via a northeastern corridor, in accordance with meteorological patterns and observation of MPB movement data. Our results highlight the potential of this pathogen for both expansion and sexual reproduction, and also identify some possible barriers to gene flow. Understanding the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of this fungusbeetle association is important for the modelling and prediction of MPB epidemics.

AB  - Roads often negatively affect terrestrial wildlife, via habitat loss or fragmentation, noise, and direct mortality. We studied moose (Alces alces) behavior relative to a road network, in an area with a history of moose-vehicle accidents, to determine when moose were crossing roadways or using areas near roads and to investigate if environmental factors were involved in this behavior. We tracked 47 adult moose with Global Positioning System collars in a study area crossed by highways and forest roads. We hypothesized that moose would avoid crossing roads but would make occasional visits to roadsides to feed on sodium-rich vegetation and avoid biting insects. Further, we expected moose avoidance to be greater for highways than forest roads. We recorded 196,710 movement segments but only observed 328 highway and 1,172 forest-road crossings (16 and 10 times lower than expected by chance). Moose usually avoided road proximity up to >= 500 in on each side but 20% of collared moose made visits to areas within 50 in of highways, which might have resulted from moose searching for sodium in vegetation and roadside salt pools. In fact, vegetation along highways had higher sodium concentrations and was browsed in similar proportions to vegetation in adjacent forest, despite moose avoidance of these zones. Moose, however, did not use areas near roads more during periods of biting insect abundance. Our results supported the hypothesis of scale-dependent selection by moose; avoidance of highways at a coarse scale may confer long-term benefits, whereas selection of highway corridors at finer scales may be part of a strategy to overcome short-term limiting factors such as sodium deficiency. We found a positive relationship between home-range size and the proportion of road axes they contained, Suggesting that moose either compensated for habitat loss or made specific movements along highways to gather sodium. The presence of sodium along highways likely increases moose-vehicle accident risks. Removal of salt pools or use of a de-icing salt other than sodium chloride should render highway surroundings less attractive to moose.

Reference wetlands scored higher in maintaining native plant community and structure than 1-year-old sites, and 12-year-old wetlands scored higher than reference sites for providing vertebrate habitat structure. Analysis of individual model variables showed that reference wetlands had greater vegetative biomass and higher soil organic matter content than both created wetland age classes. Created wetlands were farther from natural wetlands and had smaller mean forest patch sizes within a 1-km-radius circle around the site than did the reference sites, indicating less hydrologic connectivity. Created wetlands also had less microtopographic variation than reference wetlands. The 1-year-old created sites were placed in landscape settings with greater land use diversity and road density than reference sites. The 12-year-old sites had a higher gradient and a higher percentage of their surrounding area in urban land use. These results show that the created wetlands were significantly structurally different (if not functionally so) from reference wetlands even after 12 years. The most profound differences were in hydrology and the characteristics of the surrounding landscape. More attention needs to be focused on placing created wetlands in appropriate settings to encourage proper hydrodynamics, eliminate habitat fragmentation, and minimize the effects of stressors to the site.

T2  - WORLD ANIMAL REVIEW

AB  - This article explores the relationships between cattle ranching, landuse, deforestation, rural employment and biodiversity. If outlines a series of principles to initiate the transformation of the present system of cattle ranching into something more sustainable, less incompatible with biological diversity and more appropriate for human welfare. Although the analyses and the numbers are based on the Colombian case, they are typical of the situation in the Latin American tropics. The case of Colombia is perhaps extreme in all aspects and therefore particularly instructive. The enormous biological diversity, at risk from production systems, which are blamed for causing a concentration of landownership, inequalities, migration from the countryside to the cities, rural poverty and environmental degradation, demands imaginative and viable technological answers at all levels of production. But, in addition, in a country devastated by violence, the strategy for the environmental rehabilitation of cattle ranching must coincide with social reform. The article demonstrates, with examples, the application of each one of the principles for the transformation of the current cattle ranching system: abundant biomass and energy, diversity of plant species, intercropping, hedges, living fences and biological corridors, efficient use of manure, diversity of habitats, reduction in the use of pesticides and other toxic compounds and appropriate prairie management.
   These principles, and the examples outlined in the article, are applicable on any scale and in any environmental, social and cultural context, as long as the methodology is identified to incorporate the biological variables and economic parameters in an appropriate technological model.

AB  - We evaluated seed removal by terrestrial mammals and the fate of removed, threaded seeds (as a measure of dispersal) in two neighboring tropical rain forest sites in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica. Both sites have been selectively logged but differ in their degree of protection from human intrusion and habitat connectivity: La Selva is protected from hunting and connected to a national park, whereas Tirimbina remains unprotected and is not connected to a park. The two study sites are similar in logging intensity, elevation, and canopy tree structure and composition. We predicted that rates of seed removal and seed dispersal would be higher at the connected and protected site. For seven tree species (six of which are timber species), we determined that patterns of seed removal under an exclusion experiment (semipermeable cages vs. uncaged) varied both within species across sites and within sites across species, suggesting site differences in abundance, degree of animal activity, or presence of particular mammal seed consumers. Rates of seed removal and dispersal were largely species-specific. Most of the study species showed neither site nor treatment effect, whereas others had disproportionately higher removal rates at La Selva. For all species combined (covering a 6-month period due to phenological differences among the study species; n = 920 seeds per site), twice as many removed seeds were dispersed at La Selva (5.3%) than at Tirimbina (2.2%). Only one timber species, Pentaclethra macroloba, did not appear sensitive to site differences in rates of seed removal, most likely because its seeds are toxic to animals. Two timber species, Carapa nicaraguensis and Lecythis ampla, whose seeds are consumed by large scatterhoarding rodents, had 2.5% and 13%, respectively, of their removed seeds dispersed at La Selva, whereas no seeds were dispersed at Tirimbina. In northeastern Costa Rica, where forest cover is fragmented and selective logging is currently underway, the biological sustainability of timber species dispersed by terrestrial mammals may be more likely in sites protected from hunting and/or adjacent to protected areas than in forested patches subjected to hunting.

AB  - Identifying ecological drivers of tick-borne pathogen spread has great value for tick-borne disease management. However, theoretical investigations into the consequences of host movement behaviour on pathogen spread dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes remain limited because spatially explicit epidemiological models that incorporate more realistic mechanisms governing host movement are rare. We built a mechanistic movement model to investigate how the interplay between multiple ecological drivers affects the risk of tick-borne pathogen spread across heterogeneous landscapes. We used the model to generate simulations of tick dispersal by migratory birds and terrestrial hosts across theoretical landscapes varying in resource aggregation, and we performed a sensitivity analysis to explore the impacts of different parameters on the infected tick spread rate, tick infection prevalence and infected tick density. Our findings highlight the importance of host movement and tick population dynamics in explaining the infected tick spread rate into new regions. Tick infection prevalence and infected tick density were driven by predictors related to the infection process and tick population dynamics, respectively. Our results suggest that control strategies aiming to reduce tick burden on tick reproduction hosts and encounter rate between immature ticks and pathogen amplification hosts will be most effective at reducing tick-borne disease risk.

AB  - Conflicting definitions lead to confusion when people communicate about 'corridors'. particularly when they come from different disciplinary backgrounds. Usage of 'corridor' in game management, island biogeography, and metapopulation literature focused on function, namely, the movement of flora and fauna from one area to another. A structural usage of the term arose in the field of landscape ecology as it developed in North America with the matrix-patch-corridor paradigm of landscape structure. 'Corridor' is now used to describe both the structural and functional aspects of linear landscape features, often implicitly, in a wide range of disciplinary literature.
   Lack of a clear and consistent terminology leads to confusion about the goals or implied functions of corridors. Consequently, the manner in which corridors should be designed, managed, and evaluated is also unclear. proper design and management of a corridor depends critically on a clear and explicit statement of its intended functions. If corridors are not designed to perform well-defined functions, the outcome may be disappointing, or even deleterious. The roles corridors play derive from six ecological functions: habitat, conduit, filter, barrier. source, and sink. These ecological functions have been recognized widely and adopted by a number of disciplines, including conservation biology, wildlife management, landscape ecology, and landscape planning.
   We review briefly the history of the term 'corridor' in the context of conservation, catalog some of its definitions and uses, review the functions of corridors, and differentiate between the structural and functional aspects of corridors. We reject the notion of defining 'corridor' succinctly, because of the complex and multiple functions a corridor may serve. Instead, we suggest that conservationists and planners consider and document explicitly all of the possible functions of corridors when designing them. Addressing explicitly these functions when designing a corridor should eliminate much of the confusion surrounding their roles, and focus attention on establishing design criteria for corridors that function as intended.

AB  - We assessed whether peat mining intensity influences the use of bog ponds by green frogs (Rana clamitans). We selected 21 ponds in three areas undergoing different levels of peat mining: 1) mined (vegetation completely removed exposing bare peat, presence of drainage ditches with little or no water), 2) in preparation to be mined (vegetation intact but presence of drainage ditches filled with water), and 3) natural (vegetation intact, absence of drainage ditches). We estimated green frog abundance and reproduction using a combination of sampling techniques. Green frogs were detected more often at ponds in the moderately disturbed section than at ponds in either the mined bog or natural sections. Furthermore, no green frogs called at ponds on mined surfaces, as opposed to ponds on either natural or moderately disturbed surfaces. Tadpoles occurred only in the moderately disturbed section. This suggests that ponds on mined surfaces provide suboptimal habitat for green frogs. Within the moderately disturbed section, drainage ditches may provide additional breeding habitat and facilitate movements between ponds. However, if this positive effect occurs, it is only temporary because moderately disturbed sections are inevitably mined. Although preserving vegetated corridors or buffer zones around bog ponds within mined surfaces may not necessarily increase pond use by amphibians in the short term, it will facilitate the restoration phase of mined sites by providing a source of dispersers of bog plants and wildlife, including amphibians.

AB  - Bat surveys were conducted during 2006 and 2007 in the Willoughby Local Government Area (LGA) in the northern suburbs of Sydney to determine the occurrence and movement of microbats. Based on the frequency of bat detections and the direction of bat movements, two major and five minor bat flyways were identified in the study area. The two major flyways were north south movement corridors that occurred on the eastern and western margins of the LGA; each major flyway had minor flyways branching from them. The two major flyways were separated from each other by the Pacific Highway rise that runs north south through the centre of the study area. The rise acts as an effective flyway barrier as tree corridors are completely disrupted by an exposed, noisy, night-illuminated residential and commercial strip. Minor bat flyways approach the Pacific Highway rise from the east and west and are only separated by a relatively short distance. Extending these flyways to create an east west passage across the study area would greatly extend the foraging range of bats on either side of it. In order to link the major flyways, the eastern and western minor flyways need to be extended by the creation of a continuous tree canopy through residential areas to the Pacific Highway rise. Controlled street planting and supported private plantings of trees along strategic routes, together with modified street lighting could achieve this result. The crossing of the Pacific Highway would require the construction of a lightweight "flyover bridge" that commenced and ended in the extended tree canopies. This would provide a wind and light shielded crossing point for bats attempting to fly east west across the Willoughby LGA. The components of the "flyover bridge" are discussed along with other considerations in achieving an effective extended flyway through a densely populated residential area.

AB  - Parallel to the economical benefits brought by the oil industry in Mexico, there have been some negative environmental effects due to emission of pollutants to the atmosphere. Salamanca, a city located inside one of the most important industrial corridors of the country, has been frequently affected by elevated concentrations of sulfur dioxide and particle matter. However, little is known about volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which in this study are analyzed along with criteria pollutants and meteorological parameters during February-March 2003 at urban, suburban and rural sites. Although sulfur dioxide average levels were similar to 0.017 ppm, a high concentration event (similar to 0.600 ppm), attributable to emissions from the oil refinery and the thermoelectric power plant, was observed at the urban site at night time. The VOCs concentration varied from 170 +/- 50 ppbC (rural) to 699 +/- 212 (urban) and were constituted by 40% alkanes, 13% aromatics, 11% olefins and 11% of halogenated. The most abundant species were propane (167 +/- 40 ppbC), n-butane (91 +/- 23 ppbC), toluene (51 +/- 10 ppbC) and i-pentane (44 +/- 7 ppbC), that are related to combustion processes. Freon-114, methyl bromide and 1,2-dichloroethane which are likely emitted by application of pesticides, soil fumigation and fabrication of chemicals, showed high concentrations (48 +/- 10, 50 +/- 10 and 32 +/- 6 ppbC respectively) in the rural sites, highlighting the importance of control measurements implementation for these species, as they represent a potential hazard for public health. Moreover, these halocarbons showed similar ratios regardless the monitoring site, suggesting same source. Modeling results indicated that meteorological conditions generally transport air masses to the northeast rural areas where the highest concentrations of ozone were calculated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper we review current approaches and recent advances in research on climate impacts and adaptation in South Africa. South Africa has a well-developed earth system science research program that underpins the climate change scenarios developed for the southern African region. Established research on the biophysical impacts of climate change on key sectors (water, agriculture, and biodiversity) integrates the climate change scenarios but further research is needed in a number of areas, such as the climate impacts on cities and the built environment. National government has developed a National Climate Change Response White Paper, but this has yet to translate into policy that mainstreams adaptation in everyday practice and longer-term planning in all spheres and levels of government. A national process to scope long-term adaptation scenarios is underway, focusing on cross-sectoral linkages in adaptation responses at a national level. Adaptation responses are emerging in certain sectors. Some notable city-scale and project-based adaptation responses have been implemented, but institutional challenges persist. In addition, a number of knowledge gaps remain in relation to the biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change. A particular need is to develop South Africa's capacity to undertake integrated assessments of climate change that can support climate-resilient development planning. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB  - The City of Enid (City) is located in Northwest Oklahoma and services a population of over 50,000 residents. The City of Enid water supply infrastructure relies completely on an existing groundwater supply. Like many municipalities, aging public works infrastructure and increasing customer demands require continuous infrastructure maintenance, improvement, and expansion.
   The City of Enid proactively initiated a surface water supply program to supplement the existing ground water supply in order to meet increasing demands and diversity its water portfolio. In 2015, the City of Enid authorized Garver, LLC and Freese and Nichols, Inc. to perform a raw water transmission study and hydraulic analysis to deliver raw water from Kaw Lake to Enid's proposed water treatment plant, approximately sixty-eight (68) miles away.
   This paper will focus on the major analysis methods and lessons learned during the corridor study of the raw water transmission pipeline. The study includes data gathering from several public and private agencies. Preliminary corridor alternatives were produced on the basis of minimizing known potential environmental and archeological impacts, potential impact to landowners, constructability concerns, topographic characteristics that negatively impact hydraulic profile, and maximizing permanent easement access. The preliminary corridors were broken up by length into geographical classifications that represent specific construction challenges. A corridor evaluation matrix was developed utilizing geographical, environmental, maintenance, and installation characteristics to classify sections of the corridor as a means of comparing the alternatives. Hydraulic models of the recommended corridor were developed based on Kaw Lake water level data, contour data obtained, and previously developed flow requirements. These models were used to determine pumping alternatives, and potential pipeline sizing. A pipeline optimization analysis was performed to compare the capital cost of various pipeline sizes to the annual pumping (power) costs over a twenty-five (25) year span. Cost estimating was included in the study based on corridor characteristics linked with data obtained on recent market trends.

AB  - Roads function as prime habitats and corridors for invasive plant species, and can contribute significantly to the spread and establishment of weeds inside protected areas. Smooth bedstraw (Galium mollugo) populations have recently expanded in the abandoned agricultural fields of Bic National Park (Quebec, Canada), and may represent a threat to the preservation of plant diversity and to the quality of visitor experience. The main objective of this study was to map the distribution of the species in the park and to delineate factors influencing the abundance of the plant in fallow fields. We hypothesized that road proximity was the main factor explaining the presence and abundance (frequency of recording) of smooth bedstraw in fields. Vegetation surveys were conducted in abandoned agricultural fields, and two logistic regression models were built to examine the relationship between the presence and abundance of smooth bedstraw and environmental and historical variables. Smooth bedstraw populations were also mapped along transportation corridors. The abundance of smooth bedstraw significantly increases within 125 m (410 ft) of a paved road. The recent proliferation of smooth bedstraw in Bic National Park is likely associated with the construction of road embankments during the paving of gravel roads. The paved road network has probably acted as a dispersal corridor for smooth bedstraw, while the abandoned agricultural fields located close to the paved roads provided suitable habitats facilitating population establishment over large areas. We recommended to the park's authorities to cease paving all remaining gravel roads in the park, not only to stop smooth bedstraw invasion, but also the spread of other invasive species of concern.

AB  - Riparian areas are key ecosystems for conservation and protection because of the multiple and essential ecosystem services they provide despite occupying only a small percentage of the watershed. The greater soil water availability in the riparian areas compared to the adjacent terrestrial ecosystems leads to more productive, different and diverse terrestrial vegetation assemblages compared to the adjacent upland terrestrial ecosystems. Consequently, riparian areas have many services that range from reducing nonpoint sources pollutants, overland flows and floods, to wildlife and fish essential habitats, to recreational opportunities for humans. Humans have recognized these ecosystem services and have utilized them with various activities for thousands of years. This has led to the severe degradation of riparian areas that are considered as some of the most threatened ecosystems. In the European Union the importance of conserving and protecting riparian areas is recognized by the many riparian areas that have been designated as Natura 2000 sites. Additionally, the EU Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) has recognized their importance as essential features in the hydromorphological assessment of freshwater bodies. Riparian corridors are highly valuable and diverse habitats in Euro-Mediterranean-type environments, especially within agricultural dominant landscapes. In the Mediterranean region, large tracts of natural habitat have been replaced by agriculture and urban areas that has simplified their diversity and their ecosystem services. The objective of this study was to use an ocular protocol to estimate the condition of characteristic Mediterranean riparian habitats in agricultural dominated landscapes in Northern Greece. The characteristic riparian habitats surveyed were: a) natural woody vegetation along a stream with perennial flow adjacent to agricultural fields (Ste-Ag), b) natural woody vegetation along a torrent with intermittent flow adjacent to agricultural fields (Tor-Ag), and c) natural woody vegetation along a stream with perennial flow adjacent to forested areas (Ste-For). The Stream Visual Assessment Protocol (SVAP) was implemented in 20 survey plots in each studied riparian habitat. The protocol was developed in the United States and is widely used as an easy technique to evaluate riparian habitats adjacent to farmlands. For this study it was modified for the Euro-Mediterranean environments. Based on the average SVAP values of the 20 survey points the Ste-Ag and Ste-For were not statistically different. In contract, the Tor-Ag had significantly lower values that the other two habitats. Overall, this modified SVAP could be used with to meet the requirements to assess riparian Mediterranean ecosystems. This could be a valuable and easy to use tool that will help manage riparian areas more effectively in Greece.

AB  - We have a limited understanding of the effects that an increasing human population and urban and agricultural development are having on elephant movements in Botswana. Elephant movements are complex because they are influenced by a wide range of location-specific variables. This study aimed to investigate how elephants move through different human-dominated landscapes in the Chobe District, Botswana. The movements of four female elephants from the Chobe District were studied over a period of 13 months using GPS collars to follow them. Annual home ranges of the elephants were calculated using both the 100% minimum convex polygon (MCP) and 95% fixed kernel (FK) methods. Additionally, general estimating equation models were used to investigate which factors influenced the elephants' distance moved, both hourly and daily. We found the elephants' movement behaviour was dependent on the time of day and type of land use: whether agricultural areas, protected areas or wildlife management areas, trophy hunting blocks, and multi-use zones (e.g. game management areas). Overall, all of the elephants had smaller annual home ranges (similar to 450-1,750 km(2)) than seen in other studies within southern Africa, and there was a difference in seasonal movements, between individuals. Additionally, contrary to previously published studies, the elephants made larger diurnal movements than nocturnal movements. Movements were significantly different between different land-use areas, suggesting that elephants could be developing different strategies to move through differing levels of human disturbance.
   It is vital for any wildlife management plan that the spatial movements of key conservation species are thoroughly understood, in order to formulate informed management decisions and create an integrated land-use management plan that enables both development and elephant coexistence.

AB  - Fens represent a large array of ecosystem services, including the highest biodiversity found among wetlands, hydrological services, water purification and carbon sequestration. Land-use change and drainage has severely damaged or annihilated these services in many parts of North America and Europe; restoration plans are urgently needed at the landscape level. We review the major constraints on the restoration of rich fens and fen water bodies in agricultural areas in Europe and disturbed landscapes in North America: (i) habitat quality problems: drought, eutrophication, acidification, and toxicity, and (ii) recolonization problems: species pools, ecosystem fragmentation and connectivity, genetic variability, and invasive species; and here provide possible solutions. We discuss both positive and negative consequences of restoration measures, and their causes. The restoration of wetland ecosystem functioning and services has, for a long time, been based on a trial-and-error approach. By presenting research and practice on the restoration of rich fen ecosystems within agricultural areas, we demonstrate the importance of biogeochemical and ecological knowledge at different spatial scales for the management and restoration of biodiversity, water quality, carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services, especially in a changing climate. We define target processes that enable scientists, nature managers, water managers and policy makers to choose between different measures and to predict restoration prospects for different types of deteriorated fens and their starting conditions.

AB  - Amphibians are good indicators of human impact, declining steadily worldwide. We explored the relationships between the ponds and nearby landscape parameters and population size of the Agile Frog (Rana dalmatina), estimated from the number of egg masses, in a cultural landscape within the central section of Tarnava Mare Basin, Romania, Forty-three permanent ponds were surveyed in a 2600 km(2) area. The average number of egg masses per pond was 211.13 (SD = 426.41). The egg mass number was significantly and positively related to the emergent aquatic macrophyte cover (its effect peaks at around 50%) and the green connecting corridors between the ponds and forests, and negatively related to the extent of nearby urban areas. The proximity of the forest (positive effect) and the presence of high traffic roads (negative effect) were highly correlated with green corridors and further eliminated from the model due to multicollinearity. Both these variables had significant effects when incorporated in univariate models and multivariate models without green corridors. Since a large part of our study area was currently declared as Natura 2000 site, there is an increased need for management proposals and conservation applications for biodiversity, including amphibians. Rana dalmatina is an important species for monitoring because it is common in the studied area and is suited for short surveys. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The free-flowing Clinch and Powell watershed in Virginia, USA, harbors a high number of endemic mussel and fish species but they are declining or going extinct at an alarming rate. To prioritize resource management strategies with respect to these fauna, a geographical information system was developed and various statistical approaches were used to relate human land uses with available fish, macroinvertebrate, and native mussel assemblage data. Both the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera (EPT) family-level index, and the fish index of biotic integrity (IBI) were lowest in a subwatershed with the greatest coal mining activity (analysis of variance [ANOVA], p < 0,05). Limited analyses in two other sub watersheds suggested that urban and agricultural land uses within a specified riparian corridor were more related to mussel species richness and fish IBI than land uses in entire catchments. Based on land uses within a riparian corridor of 200 in X 2 kin for each biological site in the watershed, fish IBI was inversely related to percent cropland and urban area and positively related to pasture area (stepwise multiple regression, R-2 = 0.55, p < 0.05). Sites less than 2 km downstream of urban areas, 'major highways, or coal mine activities had a significantly lower mean IBI value than those more than 2 km away (ANOVA, p < .05). Land use effects included poorer instream cover and higher substrate embeddedness (t test, p < 0.05). Weaker land use relationships were observed for EPT and mussel species richness. Episodic spills of toxic materials, originating from transportation corridors, mines, and industrial facilities, also have resulted in local extirpations of native species, particularly mussels. The number of co-occurring human activities was directly related to stream elevation in the Clinch River, with more human land uses in headwater areas. Approximately 60% of known U.S. Fish and Wildlife mussel concentration sites in the watershed are located within 2 km of at least two land use sources identified as potentially stressful in our analyses. Our results indicate that a number of land uses and stressors are probably responsible for the decline in native species. However, protection of naturally vegetated riparian corridors may help mitigate some of these effects.

AB  - Societal needs for power generation, water management/use, and land uses (e.g., urban and agricultural) have often resulted in a significant departure from the natural processes of hydrologic regimes and material transport and deposition throughout most of the rivers flowing through arid and semi-arid landscapes of the western USA. We examine the compromised ecosystem integrity of one such river, the upper Snake River in eastern Idaho, below a large irrigation and power dam that has altered hydrologic regimes and reduced channel sediment supply. We review the ecological structure and function of gravel-bed rivers as they vary across a hierarchy of landscape scales with different spatial and temporal dimensions. Major linkages within the large, alluvial river systems of the western USA include exchange of water and materials along longitudinal connections from streams to rivers, lateral connections between river and floodplain systems, and vertical surface and subsurface (hyporheic) water exchanges. Longitudinal linkages dominate confined ( canyon) river reaches while unconfined ( floodplain) reaches show strong affinities for lateral and vertical exchange. Hydrogeomorphic processes, driven by river power and cut and fill alluviation, produce a dynamic landscape in floodplain reaches, which we refer to as a Shifting Habitat Mosaic (SHM). The SHM fosters high physical and ecological diversity of habitats, biotic communities, and ecosystem complexity. In this case study, we examine the dynamics of a series of floodplains along a 90 km river landscape, employing an airborne spectrophotometer, producing georeferenced hyperspectral imagery, coupled with ground truth measures of river hydraulics, river depth, riparian vegetation and other surface characteristics. From these data we derived estimates of the hydraulics and hydrographic regimes necessary to mobilize channel and riparian sediments, thus reestablishing the dynamics of the river SHM. We also evaluated subsequent variation in aquatic and riparian habitat characteristics. Evaluation of these factors, which affect interactions between the river channel and the surrounding river - riparian corridor, permitted us to develop a restoration strategy focused on normative variation among the various physical and biotic processes contributing to ecosystem integrity.

AB  - The energy landscape is experiencing accelerating change; centralized energy systems are being decarbonized, and transitioning towards distributed energy systems, facilitated by advances in power system management and information and communication technologies. This paper elaborates on these generations of energy systems by critically reviewing relevant authoritative literature. This includes a discussion of modern concepts such as 'smart grid', 'microgrid', 'virtual power plant' and 'multi-energy system', and the relationships between them, as well as the trends towards distributed intelligence and interoperability. Each of these emerging urban energy concepts holds merit when applied within a centralized grid paradigm, but very little research applies these approaches within the emerging energy landscape typified by a high penetration of distributed energy resources, prosumers (consumers and producers), interoperability, and big data. Given the ongoing boom in these fields, this will lead to new challenges and opportunities as the status-quo of energy systems changes dramatically. We argue that a new generation of holonic energy systems is required to orchestrate the interplay between these dense, diverse and distributed energy components. The paper therefore contributes a description of holonic energy systems and the implicit research required towards sustainability and resilience in the imminent energy landscape. This promotes the systemic features of autonomy, belonging, connectivity, diversity and emergence, and balances global and local system objectives, through adaptive control topologies and demand responsive energy management. Future research avenues are identified to support this transition regarding interoperability, secure distributed control and a system of systems approach.

AB  - Sylvatic plague (Yersinia pestis) is an exotic pathogen that is highly virulent in black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) and causes widespread colony losses and individual mortality rates >95%. We investigated colony spatial characteristics that may influence inter-colony transmission of plague at 3 prairie dog colony complexes in the Great Plains. The 4 spatial characteristics we considered include: colony size, Euclidean distance to nearest neighboring colony, colony proximity index, and distance to nearest drainage (dispersal) corridor. We used multi-state mark-recapture models to determine the relationship between these colony characteristics and probability of plague transmission among prairie dog colonies. Annual mapping of colonies and mark-recapture analyses of disease dynamics in natural colonies led to 4 main results: 1) plague outbreaks exhibited high spatial and temporal variation, 2) the site of initiation of epizootic plague may have substantially influenced the subsequent inter-colony spread of plague, 3) the long-term effect of plague on individual colonies differed among sites because of how individuals and colonies were distributed, and 4) colony spatial characteristics were related to the probability of infection at all sites although the relative importance and direction of relationships varied among sites. Our findings suggest that conventional prairie dog conservation management strategies, including promoting large, highly connected colonies, may need to be altered in the presence of plague.

AB  - Octocorals are relatively understudied than other coral reef organisms despite their ecological and economic values. The Philippines is known to have high marine biodiversity, but information on octocorals is lacking. This study investigated spatial and temporal variations in the assemblage of octocorals in selected reef sites in the West Philippine Sea (WPS)- the Kalayaan Island Group (i.e., Pag-asa, Sabina, Lawak, and Northeast Investigator) and Ulugan in 2017 and 2019. Results showed high octocoral taxonomic richness (at least 10 families) in the study sites. Mean percent octocoral cover in WPS was 5.35% SE +/- 0.55, with Sabina having the highest octocoral cover in both years. Significant differences in octocoral cover were observed among sites in both years, but among-station differences were only observed in 2017. Octocoral assemblage also differed among sites in both years (ANOSIM: R > 0.5, p < 0.05), wherein different octocoral taxa dominated in different sites. In particular, variations were driven by high cover of holaxonians, nephtheids, and coelogorgiids in Sabina, and clavulariids, tubiporiids, and xeniids in Northeast Investigator in 2017. In 2019, significant variations were driven by high cover of helioporiids in Pag-asa, while Sabina had higher abundance of holaxonians, nephtheids, alcyoniids, and xeniids. Short-term temporal variation on octocoral cover in monitoring stations in Pag-asa was not observed (Kruskal-Wallis, p > 0.05), although the overall mean octocoral cover increased from 1.23% +/- SE 0.47 in 2017 to 2.09% SE +/- 0.37 in 2019. Further, there was no significant change in the octocoral assemblage in Pag-asa between years (ANOSIM, R = 0.11, p = 0.07). This study highlights high octocoral taxonomic richness in the WPS relative to other sites in the Indo-Pacific Region and provides baseline information on the octocoral assemblages, which can be useful for future ecological studies and marine biodiversity conservation efforts.

AB  - Large cardamom (Amomum subulatum) is a perennial cash crop grown under the Himalayan alder (Alnus nepalensis) or mix forest tree species in the hills of Nepal, Darjeeling hills, Sikkim and Bhutan. The cardamom based agroforestry system in the Himalayas has proved to be a sustainable land use practice at the landscape level supporting multiple functions and ecosystem services. Large cardamom agroforestry is a mountain adaptive slope land management and production system that helps conserving soil and water, maintain soil fertility and high rate of carbon sequestration than any other land use systems in the region. The system is a major contributor of sustainable development in the mountain region by providing socio-ecological sustainability, watershed functions, and cultural, educational and recreational values in additional to the employment opportunities in ecotourism. Some of the ecological functions of the system are habitat and corridor for wild animals, conduit of water, energy, gene flow, seeds, etc. barrier for wind, nutrients and animals, etc. while the system also help augmenting sustainability and well being of the upstream and downstrearn communities.

AB  - Ecological surrogacy - here defined as using a process or element (e.g., species, ecosystem, or abiotic factor) to represent another aspect of an ecological system - is a widely used concept, but many applications of the surrogate concept have been controversial. We argue that some of this controversy reflects differences among users with different goals, a distinction that can be crystalized by recognizing two basic types of surrogate. First, many ecologists and natural resource managers measure "indicator surrogates" to provide information about ecological systems. Second, and often overlooked, are "management surrogates" (e.g., umbrella species) that are primarily used to facilitate achieving management goals, especially broad goals such as "maintain biodiversity" or "increase ecosystem resilience." We propose that distinguishing these two overarching roles for surrogacy may facilitate better communication about project goals. This is critical when evaluating the usefulness of different surrogates, especially where a potential surrogate might be useful in one role but not another. Our classification for ecological surrogacy applies to species, ecosystems, ecological processes, abiotic factors, and genetics, and thus can provide coherence across a broad range of uses.

AB  - This study investigates the diet of six breeding pairs of powerful owls in the Yarra Valley Corridor in Victoria, Australia, and compares prey consumption with prey availability. The six sites represent a continuum of habitats, ranging from urban Melbourne, through the urban fringe interface to a more forested landscape. We found that powerful owls in the Yarra Valley Corridor are reliant almost exclusively on arboreal marsupial prey as their preferred diet, with 99% of their overall diet comprising four arboreal marsupial species. These four species (the common ringtail possum, common brushtail possum, sugar glider and greater glider) were also the most abundant species observed while spotlighting; however, their abundance varied along the continuum. There was a strong positive relationship with the presence of these species in the diet and their site-specific availability, indicating that the powerful owl is a generalist hunter, preying on the most available prey at a given site and in a given season. This study suggests that food resources are high in these disturbed urban fringe sites and it is unlikely that food availability in urban environments will limit the potential survival of urban powerful owls.

AB  - The use of the concept of greenway can be identified in Portugal throughout the 20th century as a planning and design tool. Several examples, such as the 'Improvement Plans for Lisbon' by Ressano Garcia (1901), the continuum naturale concept [Cabral, F.C., 1980. O Continuum Naturale e a Conservacao da Natureza. Conservacao da Natureza. Servico de Estudos do Ambiente, Lisbon; Andresen, T., 2001. Francisco Caldeira Cabral. Landscape Design Trust, Surrey, UK, 213 pp.], the Green Plan for Lisbon [Telles, G.R., et al., 1997. Plano Verde de Lisboa. Ed. Colibri, Lisboa, 197 pp.], deal with the subjects of implementing vegetation corridors, pedestrian networks and landscape quality. These examples establish Portuguese planning and design tradition within the international greenway movement first identified by Fabos [Fabos, J.Gy., 1991. From Park to Greenways into the 21st Century. In: Proceedings from Selected Educational Sessions, ASLA Annual Meeting, Kansas City, Missouri]. Though several projects have been developed at the planning level, there is a need to analyze the applicability of such a concept at the regional, municipal and local level. We must consider the characteristics of Portugal's cultural landscape, recognition by other professions dealing with planning and involvement by politicians. By analyzing five case studies, this paper shows the significance of the greenway as a planning and design strategy, which coincides, with the current objectives of political and planning authorities at the municipal level. It also proves that it is possible to reconcile political objectives and urban development while safeguarding landscape quality and providing new opportunities for public recreation and education. Greenway planning and design is now undoubtedly a subject of growing significance in Portugal. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Bicknell's thrush (Catharus bicknelli) is among North America's migratory bird species of greatest conservation concern. Protecting habitat at both ends of its range has been identified as a high priority action. An estimated 90% of the species' global population overwinters on the island of Hispaniola, where ongoing habitat loss is a severe problem. Preventing further loss of Bicknell's thrush habitat on Hispaniola will require, among other efforts, establishing conservation areas on private lands, where success will depend on cooperation with landowners. This paper considers a voluntary incentive program to landowners in the Dominican Republic to yield a cost-effective network of protected habitat to sustain overwintering Bicknell's thrush populations. TAMARIN, a Geographic Information System (GIS) based model, evaluates the economic and ecological considerations for a voluntary bid scenario where landowners sell their property rights to a government agency or non-governmental organization. Results indicate that two scientific reserves in northeastern Dominican Republic could be connected under one viable forest fragment valued at US $5.5 x 10(6), increasing the total protected land by 87% to 19,357 ha. Incorporating the spatial variability of economic costs and biological benefits into a conservation program, such as the Bicknell's Thrush Habitat Protection Fund will help planners achieve habitat conservation at least cost.

We used radiotelemetry to study movement patterns of juvenile gopher frogs (Rana capito) emigrating from ponds that were surrounded by longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest that varied in structure as a result of fire suppression. Our primary purpose was to determine if frogs emigrate directionally from their natal ponds and select habitat at random during their first month following metamorphosis. We found that frogs emigrated in nonrandom directions from ponds that were surrounded by heterogeneous habitat and selected fire-maintained habitat that was associated with an open canopy, few hardwood trees, small amounts of leaf litter, and large amounts of wiregrass (Aristida beyrichiana). Fire-maintained habitat contained higher densities of burrows excavated by gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) and small mammals, which are the primary refuge sites for both juvenile and adult gopher frogs. Frogs moved up to 691 m from their natal ponds, frequently crossed dirt roads, and even seemed to use these roads as migration corridors. To maintain suitable terrestrial habitat for gopher frogs, including habitat used by migrating individuals, it is important to apply frequent prescribed fire to uplands surrounding breeding ponds that lead all the way to the edges of breeding ponds, as well as through ponds during periodic droughts.

AB  - Multivariate analyses and correlations revealed strong relations between watershed and riparian-corridor land cover, and reach-scale habitat versus fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages in 38 warmwater streams in eastern Wisconsin. Watersheds were dominated by agricultural use, and ranged in size from 9 to 71 km(2). Watershed land cover was summarized from satellite-derived data for the area outside a 30-m buffer. Riparian land cover was interpreted from digital orthophotos within 10-, 10- to 20-, and 20- to 30-m buffers. Reach-scale habitat, fish, and macroinvertebrates were collected in 1998 and biotic indices calculated. Correlations between land cover, habitat, and stream-quality indicators revealed significant relations at the watershed, riparian-corridor, and reach scales. At the watershed scale, fish diversity, intolerant fish and EPT species increased, and Hilsenhoff biotic index (HBI) decreased as percent forest increased. At the riparian-corridor scale, EPT species decreased and HBI increased as riparian vegetation became more fragmented. For the reach, EPT species decreased with embeddedness. Multivariate analyses further indicated that riparian (percent agriculture, grassland, urban and forest, and fragmentation of vegetation), watershed (percent forest) and reach-scale characteristics (embeddedness) were the most important variables influencing fish (IBI, density, diversity, number, and percent tolerant and insectivorous species) and macroinvertebrate (HBI and EPT) communities.

AB  - A greater understanding of how environmental factors and anthropogenic landscape features influence animal movements can inform management and potentially aid in mitigating human-wildlife conflicts. We investigated the movement patterns of 16 Florida black bears (Ursus americanus floridanus; 6 females, 10 males) in north-central Florida at multiple temporal scales using GPS data collected from 2011 to 2014. We calculated bi-hourly step-lengths and directional persistence, as well as daily and weekly observed displacements and expected displacements. We used those movement metrics as response variables in linear mixed models and tested for effects of sex, season, and landscape features. We found that step-lengths of males were generally longer than step-lengths of females, and both sexes had the shortest step-lengths during the daytime. Bears moved more slowly (shorter step-lengths) and exhibited less directed movement when near creeks, in forested wetlands, and in marsh habitats, possibly indicating foraging behavior. In urban areas, bears moved more quickly (longer step-lengths) and along more directed paths. The results were similar across all temporal scales. Major roads tended to act as a semipermeable barrier to bear movement. Males crossed major roads more frequently than females but both sexes crossed major roads much less frequently than minor roads. Our findings regarding the influence of landscape and habitat features on movement patterns of Florida black bears could be useful for planning effective wildlife corridors and understanding how future residential or commercial development and road expansions may affect animal movement.

AB  - Habitat loss is a critical factor driving extinction of biodiversity worldwide, with models of future land use anticipating increases in rates of destruction of native habitats worldwide. The Asian black bear (Ursus thibetanus) is a red-listed species with a broad geographic range that has been fragmented dramatically by land use change. Remaining populations of U. thibetanus occupy diverse habitats, ranging from highlands to coastal regions. We integrated ecological niche models (ENMs) with nighttime satellite imagery to identify areas suitable for U. thibetanus after anthropogenic alteration. We found that at least 10% of the potential distributional area for the species is not suitable owing to urban or suburban encroachment. U. thibetanus seems to persist in highland areas, characterized by low temperature and high precipitation, whereas humans concentrate in lowlands and less-extreme climatic conditions. ENMs based solely on climate frequently overestimate suitable areas available for species; nighttime light imagery offers a robust alternative to refining estimates of species' ranges, designing protected areas and corridors, prioritizing threatened species, and determining areas of human-wildlife conflict across broad areas. Our approach is transferable to other taxa and contexts, and should be considered in conservation planning and policy implementation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Based on data collected during the National Wolf Census in 2000-01, we analysed the main habitat factors influencing the distribution and abundance of the wolf, Canis lupus, in northern Poland. The study region forms the western border of the continuous Eastern European range of wolves, although attempts at westward dispersal have been observed. Using Geographic Information System techniques, we measured nine habitat variables and three parameters related to wolf occurrence in 134 circular sample plots (radius 7 km, area 154 km(2) each). We compared 72 plots where wolves were recorded and 62 plots with no signs of wolf presence. Wolf plots were characterized by significantly higher forest cover, less fragmentation of forests, lower density of villages, towns, motorways, and railways than wolf-free plots. We found a positive correlation between the sum of wolf observations in plots and forest cover. The number of domestic animals killed by wolves was higher in areas with higher indices of wolf abundance and lower forest area. In multiple regression analysis, four independent variables explained 59% of the variation in wolf distribution and abundance in northern Poland: straight-line distance to continuous range of wolves in Eastern Europe; forest cover; forest fragmentation; and length of major motorways. We conclude that protection of wolves in Poland (since 1998) may not be an adequate conservation measure, especially because of the increasing density of highways and express motorways. Existing forest corridors should be protected and new ones should be restored to ensure long-term conservation of wolves and allow range expansion into Western Europe.

AB  - Using a socioecological systems perspective, we advance a conceptual approach for characterizing trajectories of change in rural forest-based communities. We call attention to "communities in the middle," communities positioned within forested regions representing neither unpopulated wilderness nor heavily urbanized or densely populated places on the edge of urban areas. In 2010, these middle places accounted for 27.3% of the continental United States landscape yet less than 5% of the human population. Common shocks, such as the decline of traditional production industries, demographic shifts, new information technologies, climate change, invasive species, and demand for new energy resources, unite these areas. Yet, we observe variation in existing patterns of change across communities, which grows out of interactions between local contexts and larger drivers of change. Focusing on community dynamics, structure, and well-being in transitioning rural forested landscapes, we synthesize insights on three commonly identified development trajectories. We identify interactions among the resource base, connectivity to other places, and social adaptability as critical to these trajectories. Further, we describe vulnerabilities, opportunities, contingencies, diversity, novel recombinations, and mitigation as useful concepts for understanding community pathways within these trajectories. This framework provides a starting point to guide further synthesis, formal meta-analyses, and future interdisciplinary research on change in these important 'middle' places. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB  - The complex, interconnected, and non-contiguous nature of canopy environments present unique cognitive, locomotor, and sensory challenges to their animal inhabitants. Animal movement through forest canopies is constrained; unlike most aquatic or aerial habitats, the three-dimensional space of a forest canopy is not fully realized or available to the animals within it. Determining how the unique constraints of arboreal habitats shape the ecology and evolution of canopy-dwelling animals is key to fully understanding forest ecosystems. With emerging technologies, there is now the opportunity to quantify and map tree connectivity, and to embed the fine-scale horizontal and vertical position of moving animals into these networks of branching pathways. Integrating detailed multi-dimensional habitat structure and animal movement data will enable us to see the world from the perspective of an arboreal animal. This synthesis will shed light on fundamental aspects of arboreal animals' cognition and ecology, including how they navigate landscapes of risk and reward and weigh energetic trade-offs, as well as how their environment shapes their spatial cognition and their social dynamics.

AB  - Conservation of habitat patches and the related environment benefits both the focal species and human wellbeing. Many indices use the dispersal range to identify habitat patches with conservation priorities. However, there lacks approaches to identify environmental variables with conservation priorities (noted as target variables) in those identified patches. Therefore, this paper proposes an approach to identify environmental variables with conservation priorities in habitat patches using perception range and introduces the related assumption. It is assumed the agents select habitats based on their prior preference and perceived information in their perception ranges, which avoids the omniscient assumption of agents. Based on such assumptions, the proposed approach identifies the target variables by approximating how animals identify their habitats. It highlights the use of perception range and identifies target variables using the maximum information gain. The variables that contribute the largest reduction of uncertainty are regarded as the target variables in the habitat patches. Taking the Common Moorhen (Gallinula chloropus) living in Tianjin, China as the case, different scenarios with 100 m, 250 m and 500 m perception ranges are designed to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The proposed approach identifies the normalized vegetation index, rather than the distance to water surface, is the target variable in 42.3%, 58.9% and 72.1% habitat patches with given perception ranges. Adjustments are made on areas within the given perception range of each patch. More grid cells that has increased suitability index can be found in scenarios given 250 m perception range, which indicates the conservation area is not always the large the better. Optimizations are expected on both a better approximation method and a more thorough hypothesis of using perception range.

AB  - This review presents a summary of the influences of floods on river ecology, both instream and on the adjacent floodplain, mostly in a Canadian context. It emphasizes that ecological impacts and benefits can be highly dependent on flood-generation processes and their magnitude and timing. In Canada, floods can occur under open-water or ice-influenced river conditions. The ecological impacts of floods generated from ice jamming are particularly relevant in Canadian ecosystems due to the potentially higher water levels produced and suspended sediment concentrations that can be detrimental to instream aquatic habitat, but beneficial to floodplains. Large floods provide a major source of physical disturbance. Moderate floods with shorter return periods can be beneficial to aquatic habitats by providing woody debris that contributes to habitat complexity and diversity, by flushing fine sediments and by providing important food sources from terrestrial origins. Floods also influence water-quality variables such as sediment loads, metals and pH, which further influence river ecology. This review points out important links between floods and habitat connectivity and refugia, and the ability of aquatic resources to recover from flood disturbances. The floodplain vegetation also influences bank erosion and channel configuration, as well as many processes contributing to the river ecology, such as allochthonous inputs of carbon, preventing bank erosion, food-web dynamics and other effects. Many species of riparian trees are dependent on floods for reproduction, and floods can limit competitive encroachment of upland vegetation. Floods play a critical role in deltaic environments where high flows provide nutrient supplies and overflows maintain water balances within these environments. Two substantial factors that will likely influence future flood regimes in Canada are climate change and flow regulation. Future research should focus on enhancing our understanding of how floods affect river ecology, including under winter conditions, to better manage important natural resources.

AB  - Populations of helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris) have declined significantly within the Midlands of KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa, since the early 1980s. A three-phase project was initiated in 1995 to assess the possible cause(s) of this decline. Initial research investigated socioeconomic factors such as illegal hunting, whereas subsequent statistical analyses, based on questionnaires, revealed correlations between guineafowl population densities and certain land-use practices. Further research focused on other possible causal factors including hyper-fragmentation of the habitat matrix, misuse of agrochemicals, disease, genetic contamination and dietary constraints. Results indicate that, although all these factors might have proximal, negative effects on local populations, there is no evidence to suggest widespread action of any single factor. Radio-tracking of guineafowl at several sites revealed that healthy guineafowl populations thrive in moderately fragmented landscapes, and that hyper-fragmentation of these habitats through increased, intensive crop agriculture, coupled with modern, 'clean' farming techniques, is largely responsible for observed declines in guineafowl populations due to population fragmentation and an undermining of meta-population structure. Resuscitating guineafowl populations to sustainable levels involves creating suitable habitats on a landscape level through management strategies at the conservancy level, with the objective being to strive for habitat diversity and connectivity.

AB  - The endangered Florida Key deer (Odocoileus virginianus clavium.) is endemic to the Florida Keys, Florida, USA, with Big Pine Key (BPK) supporting most (approx 60%) of the population. Habitat loss and fragmentation have altered the amount of available habitat, creating areas of varying suitability; north BPK (NBPK) is believed to contain more optimal habitat than south BPK (SBPK), which is snore developed and fragmented. We evaluated the source-sink dynamics of Key deer using a sex- and stage-structured, stochastic matrix model. Model results indicated that the NBPK population of Key deer was increasing (lambda = 1.02), whereas the SBPK population was decreasing (lambda = 0.87). Without dispersal from the north, the SBPK population has a 97% probability of falling below 25 individuals (quasi-extinction threshold) in the next 20 years. The higher risk to Key deer in SBPK can be explained by relative habitat-quality differences between the 2 areas. House density, amount of roads, number of fences, and amount of development were all greater in SBPK. Collectively, study results indicate that SBPK can be described as an ecological sink with a nonviable population supplemented by deer dispersal from NBPK (source). Care should be taken to preserve the source population and its habitat. Thus, we propose limiting future development. in NBPK (high-quality, source habitat). The US 1 highway corridor project has the potential to decrease Key deer mortality due to vehicle collisions, and we recommend that future management goals continue to address mortality factors on SBPK (low-quality sink habitat).

AB  - P>1. Wolves Canis lupus recently recolonized the Western Alps through dispersal from the Italian Apennines, representing one of several worldwide examples of large carnivores increasing in highly human-dominated landscapes. Understanding and predicting expansion of this population is important for conservation because of its direct impact on livestock and its high level of societal opposition.
   2. We built a predictive, spatially explicit, individual-based model to examine wolf population expansion in this fragmented landscape, and livestock depredation risk. We developed the model based on known demographic processes, social structure, behaviour and habitat selection of wolves collected during a 10-year intensive field study of this wolf population.
   3. During model validation, our model accurately described the recolonization process within the Italian Alps, correctly predicting wolf pack locations, pack numbers and wolf population size, between 1999 and 2008.
   4. We then projected packs and dispersers over the entire Italian Alps for 2013, 2018 and 2023. We predicted 25 packs (95% CI: 19-32) in 2013, 36 (23-47) in 2018 and 49 (29-68) in 2023. The South-Western Alps were the main source for wolves repopulating the Alps from 1999 to 2008. The source area for further successful dispersers will probably shift to the North-Western Alps after 2008, but the large lakes in the Central Alps will probably act as a spatial barrier slowing the wolf expansion.
   5. Using the pack presence forecasts, we estimated spatially explicit wolf depredation risk on livestock, allowing tailored local and regional management actions.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our predictive model is novel because we follow the spatio-temporal dynamics of packs, not just population size, which have substantially different requirements and impacts on wolf-human conflicts than wandering dispersers. Our approach enables prioritization of management efforts, including minimizing livestock depredations, identifying important corridors and barriers, and locating future source populations for successful wolf recolonization of the Alps.

AB  - 1. Sea turtles are globally endangered, and face daily anthropogenic threats, such as direct take, by-catch, and habitat degradation. Current research efforts on sea turtles in the South China region mainly focus on captivity and husbandry, haematology and blood chemistry, and nesting ecology. Published information on the marine habitat use of wild populations is limited. 2. This situation therefore creates a pressing need for scientific research on freeranging sea turtles as a foundation for habitat management and species protection in South China. In this study, habitat use and oceanic movement of nesting, and bycatch or stranded green turtles, were determined by satellite tracking combined with home-range analysis. 3. Coupled with previous findings, the foraging grounds of several sea turtle species (green turtle Chelonia mydas, hawksbill turtle Eretmochelys imbricata and loggerhead Caretta caretta) were mainly distributed along the coasts of Hainan Island Province and Guangdong Province, mainland China, as well as Taiwan and the Philippines, and the outlying islands in the South China Sea and East China Sea. 4. Habitat hot spots and migratory corridors of green turtles, in particular nesting turtles in South China, were identified. Coastal waters near Wanning City of Hainan Island, the eastern Leizhou Peninsula, Iriomote-jima and Ishigaki-shima of the Ryukyu Islands of Japan, and Dao Bach Long Vi of Vietnam serve as foraging grounds for nesting green turtles from different origins in South China. Moreover, the Paracel (Xisha) and the Pratas (Dongsha) Islands in the South China Sea, Huidong Gangkou, and its vicinity in mainland China, and Liouciou Island and Penghu Island of Taiwan contain both nesting sites and foraging grounds for green turtles. 5. The sites that are associated with migratory corridors, in particular Hainan Island, eastern Leizhou Peninsula, and Liouciou Island, which currently lack conservation plans for sea turtles, should be given higher priority for habitat and species protection.

AB  - Many anthropogenic activities physically disturb urbanised coastal habitats. The functional response of ecosystems to physical disturbances remains largely unknown due to the lack of suitable quantitative tools for assessing impacts. We conducted a manipulative field experiment to investigate the short-term (i.e. temporally sensitive) response of estuarine sandflat trophodynamics to pulse anthropogenic physical disturbance, using combined chemical tracer (C-13), compartmental modelling and network analysis techniques. Pulse physical disturbance, as sediment pumping for an infaunal bait species, was applied at two disturbance intensities at the commencement of the experiment, in 0.09 m(2) quadrats. Six compartments and three trophic levels in the estuarine sandflat food web were sampled, including the microphytobenthos, four meiofaunal groups, and soldier crabs (Mictyris longicarpus). Compared with undisturbed controls, in the low disturbance intensity treatment: 1) carbon flow rates between compartments increased, 2) carbon cycling increased, 3) more carbon was retained in the food web, and 4) system indices reflecting ecosystem functioning and resilience were higher. Low disturbance intensity facilitated carbon transfer between organisms and apparently increased resilience. Conversely, high disturbance intensity reduced carbon flow among compartments and carbon cycling, thus lowering resilience. This is the first study with field data quantifying structural and functional changes of sandflat food webs in response to physical disturbance and showed that both ecosystem structure and processes may support the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis. This alternative approach to assessing the immediate functional response of estuarine trophic interactions to physical disturbances allows impact detection not possible using conventional approaches.

AB  - 1. Perennial woody invaders often form persistent patches that significantly alter the structure and composition of native plant communities. Given their long generation times compared with ruderal invaders, these species may experience prolonged establishment phases between successful introduction and spread. Gap dynamics of shade-tolerant invaders could lead to multiple lag phases during the invasion process.
   2. In order to investigate the potential for long or multiple lag phases, we reconstructed the invasion of Acer platanoides (a shade-tolerant, invasive, exotic tree) on an 1130-ha temperate forested island in Lake Huron, USA. We measured and mapped the spatial location of every A. platanoides >= 0.5 m in height that had successfully established within a 728-ha forested park on the island. A simple age-diameter relationship, developed from a randomly selected subsample of the population, was used to assign an establishment date to each individual.
   3. Following a 34-year establishment phase, the area occupied by >= 1 A. platanoides ha(-1) increased linearly at a rate of 5.6 ha year(-1) for 35 years, after which range expansion slowed. Population growth lagged behind range expansion, with rapid population growth associated with infill between parents. During the expansion phase, numerous satellite populations established but contributed little to population growth and spatial expansion because of the long time required for them to become reproductive. These satellite populations will most probably accelerate population growth and spread once they reach reproductive age.
   4. Roads and trails provided important corridors for propagule movement away from developed areas over the course of the invasion. They also appeared to facilitate longer distance dispersals than would be expected given the biology of the species.
   6. Synthesis and application. Our results suggest that shade-tolerant invaders with long generation times may undergo long establishment phases as well as periodic lags during the expansion phase. These lags may provide windows of opportunity for control but could easily be misinterpreted as signs that the population has reached an equilibrium density or the geographical extent of its spread. Additionally, roads and trails may provide important corridors for movement of propagules via non-standard means of dispersal.

AB  - 1. Current global changes make it important to be able to predict which interactions will occur in the emerging ecosystems. Most of the current methods to infer the existence of interactions between two species require a good knowledge of their behaviour or a direct observation of interactions. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by developing a method, inspired from the niche model of food web structure, using the statistical relationship between predator and prey body size to infer the matrix of potential interactions among a pool of species.
   2. The novelty of our approach is to infer, for any species of a given species pool, the three species-specific parameters of the niche model. The method applies to both local and metaweb scales. It allows one to evaluate the feeding interactions of a new species entering the community.
   3. We find that this method gives robust predictions of the structure of food webs and that its efficiency is increased when the strength of the body-size relationship between predators and preys increases.
   4. We finally illustrate the potential of the method to infer the metaweb structure of pelagic fishes of the Mediterranean sea under different global change scenarios.

AB  - The paper presents the results of Quaternary palaeoecology and geoarchaeology studies in the Zerkal'naya Basin, with new insights about sequenced natural shifts during the prehistoric occupation of this marginally explored NE Asian maritime territory. The Basin is part of the continental drainage system and the main physiographic and biotic corridor for peopling of the transitive coastal interior SE Primor'ye Region. The Final Pleistocene and Holocene environmental (biotic and abiotic) proxy records from the Upper/Final Palaeolithic to early historical sites document a dynamic climate change with vegetation cover transformations within riverine and mountain valley ecosystems of the Russian Far East. Most of the archaeological sites located on the low terraces and bedrock promontories along the main river channel and its tributary streams suggest traditional hunter gathered lifestyles based on seasonal salmon-fishing supplemented by pastoral economy.
   Tundra-forests with larch trees, dwarf birch thickets and polypod ferns from the basal stratigraphic units of the late Last Glacial occupation sites associated with the Upper Palaeolithic micro-blade and bifacial stone tool traditions (C-14-dated to 19,000-12,000 cal yrs BP) indicate rather pronounced conditions and much lower MAT comparing today. Following a final Pleistocene cooling event, a major climate warming marked the onset of Holocene accompanied by a regional humidity increase promoting the formation of a mixed broadleaved-coniferous oak-dominant taiga, and culminating in the mid Holocene Climatic Optimum. The appearance of mosaic parklands ca. 5,000-4,000 cal yrs BP. may be partly attributed to the expansion of the Far Eastern Neolithic cultures practicing forest clearance for pastures and dwellings. A progressing landscape opening indicated by the spread of light-demanding thickets and birch-dominated riverine 'biotopes with Artemisia suggests a further vegetation cover transformation during the late Neolithic and the early Palaeo-Metal (Bronze Age) periods. This trend corroborates the documented climate deterioration between 3,400 and 2,600 cal yrs BP, causing a regional aridification with a parkland-steppe broadening in the main SE Primor'ye river valleys. The late Holocene climate development persisted until the Little Ice Age which led to formation of the present settlement ecosystems with mixed (oak/cedar/fir-dominated) temperate maritime woodlands.

AB  - Ecosystems are changing in complex and unpredictable ways, and analysis of these changes is facilitated by coordinated, long-term research. Meeting diverse societal needs requires an understanding of what populations and communities will be dominant in 20, 50, and 100 yr. This paper is a product of a synthesis effort of the U.S. National Science Foundation funded Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) network addressing the LTER core research area of populations and communities. This analysis revealed that each LTER site had at least one compelling story about what their site would look like in 50 or 100 yr. As the stories were prepared, themes emerged, and the stories were grouped into papers along five themes for this special issue: state change, connectivity, resilience, time lags, and cascading effects. This paper addresses the resilience theme and includes stories from the Baltimore (urban), Hubbard Brook (northern hardwood forest), Andrews (temperate rain forest), Moorea (coral reef), Cedar Creek (grassland), and North Temperate Lakes (lakes) sites. The concept of resilience (the capacity of a system to maintain structure and processes in the face of disturbance) is an old topic that has seen a resurgence of interest as the nature and extent of global environmental change have intensified. The stories we present here show the power of long-term manipulation experiments (Cedar Creek), the value of long-term monitoring of forests in both natural (Andrews, Hubbard Brook) and urban settings (Baltimore), and insights that can be gained from modeling and/or experimental approaches paired with long-term observations (North Temperate Lakes, Moorea). Three main conclusions emerge from the analysis: (1) Resilience research has matured over the past 40 yr of the LTER program; (2) there are many examples of high resilience among the ecosystems in the LTER network; (3) there are also many warning signs of declining resilience of the ecosystems we study. These stories highlight the need for long-term studies to address this complex topic and show how the diversity of sites within the LTER network facilitates the emergence of overarching concepts about this important driver of ecosystem structure, function, services, and futures.

AB  - Aim
   Figs (Ficus, Moraceae) are exploited by rich communities of often host-specific phytophagous wasps. Among them, gall-inducing Sycophaginae (Hymenoptera, Chalcidoidea) may share a common history with Ficus and their mutualistic pollinators (Agaonidae). We investigate here, for the first time, the phylogeny and biogeographical history of Sycophaginae and compare the timing of radiation and dispersion of major clades with available data on Ficus and fig pollinators. Reconstructing the history of their host colonization and association over space and time is central to understanding how fig wasp communities were assembled.
   Location
   World-wide.
   Methods
   Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses were conducted on 4267 bp of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA to produce a phylogeny of all genera of Sycophaginae. Two relaxed clock methods with or without rate autocorrelation were used for date estimation. Analyses of ancestral area were also conducted to investigate the geographical origin of the Sycophaginae.
   Results
   The phylogeny is well resolved and supported. Our data suggest a post-Gondwanan origin for the Sycophaginae (50-40 Ma) and two independent out-of-Australia dispersal events to continental Asia. Given palaeoclimatic and palaeogeographic records, the following scenario appears the most likely. The ancestor of Idarnes+Apocryptophagus migrated to Greater India through the Ninetyeast Ridge (40-30 Ma). The ancestor of Anidarnes+Conidarnes dispersed later via Sundaland (25-20 Ma). Idarnes and Anidarnes subsequently reached the New World via the North Atlantic land bridges during the Late Oligocene Warming Event. Apocryptophagus reached Africa c. 20 Ma via the Arabic corridors and returned to Australasia following the expansion of Sundaland tropical forests (20-10 Ma).
   Main conclusions
   Sycophaginae probably invaded the fig microcosm in Australia c. 50-40 Ma after the origin of their host plant. Once associated with figs, they dispersed out of Australia and radiated together with their host fig and associated pollinator through the tropics. We recorded a good coincidence of timing between dispersal events of Sycophaginae and continental connections. Furthermore, fruit pigeons that disperse figs probably spread out of Australasia through the Indian Ocean via the Ninetyeast Ridge c. 38 Ma. Therefore, our study highlights the potential for combining molecular phylogenetics with multiple methods of dating of interacting groups to reconstruct the historical biogeography of plant-herbivore associations.

AB  - Populations of the North American Wood Turtle (Glyptemys insculpta) are often encountered in agricultural landscapes. We used thread-trailing techniques to record the movements of six adult male G. insculpta translocated to an experimental hayfield patch-matrix. We investigated the effects of patch size and habitat structure on path sinuosity, turning angles, and move length. Paths confirm the occurrence of three movement phases previously described in other animals: agitation dispersal, local search, and ranging. Within-patch movements revealed a left-turning bias that was not the result of a serial autocorrelation of turning angles. We propose that the arced paths observed are a result of handedness and/or diagonal sequence gait. As patch size had no effect on path sinuosity or move length, our results demonstrate the consistency of path characteristics within hayfield patches up to 30 m in diameter. Local search was characterized by a unidirectional series of zigzag moves. Habitat structure affected path sinuosity and move length. Generally, paths were straighter and move lengths longer in the harvested area. These results are consistent with the findings of studies on small mammals and insects moving through exposed or resource-poor areas. Boundary permeability was absolute, with all subjects crossing patch perimeters without any hesitation in movement. Translocated G. insculpta exhibit predetermined search phenotypes, and move to maximize the likelihood of locating resources, while minimizing the probability of revisiting previously searched areas.

AB  - Presence-only models can aid conservation and management of threatened, elusive species. A MaxEnt model has been developed for the great capricorn beetle (Cerambyx cerdo L., 1758) in south-western Poland and the variables identified best explaining the species' occurrence on a large scale. Once successfully validated, the model was used to (a) illustrate the expected location of the species' habitats in the region and in existing Natura 2000 sites (SACs) in S-W Poland and (b) assess the efficacy of the regional network of national protected areas (NPAs) versus Natura 2000 (SACs). Overall, information was gathered on 1025 localities of C. cerdo L., 1758 in Lower Silesia. All the records came from the pedunculate oak Quercus robur L., 1753. The occurrence of the great capricorn beetle in the study region is limited mainly to its eastern part, with a marked concentration in the valleys of the rivers Odra, Barycz and Bystrzyca. The kernel density estimation analysis also showed the high concentration of occupied trees in the north-western part of the region, clearly isolated from the above-mentioned main populations. Although a considerable part of the localities in the study region (74.2%) occurred within protected areas (PAs), their contribution to the species' conservation varied between the PAs groups. Natura 2000 SACs are the most important PAs, covering more than 30% of the predicted area of suitable habitats in the region and more than 45% of optimal habitats. In total, 384 localities of C. cerdo L., 1758 were found within the cities, most of them (n = 356) in the city of Wroclaw. Forty three percent (43%) of the urban localities of the species (n = 165) in the study region are protected within the regional network of protected areas (OPAs), while those unprotected are mainly concentrated in the city of Wroclaw (n = 207). Wroclaw also includes 17.1% of the area of suitable habitats and 29% optimal habitats of the species in the region outside the protected area network. To preserve C. cerdo L., 1758, forest corridors should be created or restored to bridge the otherwise impermeable gaps revealed by the authors' model and grant protection to the still largely unprotected area of the Lower Silesian territory. The species conservation programme in the region requires the cooperation of various authorities, not only those dealing with nature conservation, but also local governments, state forest management and flood protection authorities.

AB  - Amphibians are particularly sensitive to landscape fragmentation. Potential barriers between breeding sites can negatively influence the dispersal of individuals and increase genetic structure between populations. In this study, we genotyped 10 microsatellites for 334 marbled newts (Triturus marmoratus) at 11 different locations in Western France. Samples were collected in different regions with contrasting agricultural landscapes (low and high proportion of arable land in the north and south, respectively). We found a strong genetic structure between the northern and southern sampling sites. Isolation by distance was recorded after 62 km, but within the northern region, little or no genetic structure was detected over large distances (up to 114 km). Genetic structure at shorter distance (43 km) was found between sites situated in landscapes with larger amounts of arable lands. A significant positive relationship was found between the pairwise genetic distance (F-st) between sites and the amount of arable land together with the distance between sites. Our results suggest that the Loire River might act as a corridor for the marbled newt, while arable land might act as a barrier. Finally, although a large city is located between sampling sites, no effect was detected on population structure.

AB  - This study examined the influence of landscape heterogeneity on genetic differentiation between migratory bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) populations in Glacier National Park, Montana. An information-theoretic approach was used to compare different conceptual models of dispersal associated with barriers, different models of isolation by distance, and the combined effects of barriers, waterway distance, patch size, and intra- and inter-drainage distribution of populations on genetic differentiation between bull trout populations. The effect of distance between populations on genetic differentiation was best explained by partitioning the effects of mainstem and tributary stream sections. Models that categorized barriers as having a one-way effect (i.e. allowed downstream dispersal) or a two-way effect were best supported. Additionally, patch size and the distribution of populations among drainages influenced genetic differentiation. Genetic differentiation between bull trout populations in Glacier National Park is linked to landscape features that restrict dispersal. However, this analysis illustrates that modelling variability within landscape features, such as dispersal corridors, will benefit landscape genetic analyses. Additionally, the framework used for evaluating the effects of barriers must consider not just barrier presence, but also potential asymmetries in barrier effects with respect to the organism under investigation.

AB  - Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), raccoons (Procyon lotor), and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) are found throughout the United States, wherever there is suitable denning habitat and food resources. Densities of these predators have increased throughout the Intermountain West as a consequence of human alterations in habitat. Within the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge (hereafter, refuge), in northern Utah, USA, upland nesting habitat for ducks is limited to the levee banks and roadsides. Red foxes, raccoons, and striped skunks, which prey on upland nesting birds, are also abundant on the refuge. We studied red foxes, raccoons, and striped skunks' use of levees and the edges associated with them within a wetland environment. Red fox, raccoon, and striped skunk locations were negatively correlated with distance to the nearest dike (-0.78, -0.69, and -0.45, respectively). Animals incorporated more roads and/or levees into their home ranges than expected by chance (x overbar = 2.6; Z < 0.001); incorporation of levees was greater during the dispersal season than the rearing season (P = 0.03). Skunk home ranges (average size, 3. 0 km(2)) were oriented along roads and levees (P = 0.03), whereas raccoon (average size, 3.6 km(2)) and fox home ranges (average size, 3.5 km(2)) were not (P = 0.93, P = 0.13, respectively). Fox home ranges in the refuge were more oblong in shape than reported elsewhere (P = 0.03). However, home-range shapes of raccoons and striped skunks were similar to previous studies (P = 0.84, P = 0.97, respectively). The use of roads and levees within the refuge increases the possible travel distance and penetration of predators into wetland environments. This contributes to increased depredation of waterfowl nests and to decreased recruitment. Managers of similar areas might decrease depredation of waterfowl by disrupting the linear pattern of corridors, thereby decreasing the congestion of animal roads and levees. This would, then, decrease the encounter rates of predators and prey.

AB  - Ecosystem impacts due to invasive species continue to attract significant conservation effort worldwide. In aquatic ecosystems, physical interventions such as suppression and eradication of non-native species are typically expensive, long-term commitments, with few examples of lasting success in the absence of significant ongoing effort. Control of non-native species is a major conservation and restoration challenge, as a species' demographic resilience and connectivity within networks can limit the ability of suppression or eradication efforts to influence populations. Simulation tools can provide valuable insights for the management of these systems - from evaluation of tradeoffs between time and effort to prediction of relative success rates of alternative strategies In changing environments. In the Pacific Northwest region of the U.S., the eastern brook trout (EBT; Salvelinus fontinalis) is a non-native invasive species that competes with native fish species across a wide spatial scale due to extensive human-mediated introduction starting in the early 20th century. The goal of this study was to simulate the individual movement and demographics of EBT before, during, and following implementation of control efforts in tributaries within the Pend Oreille River watershed. The ultimate purpose of the model was to inform mitigation decisions through the investigation of alternative management actions in an adaptive management framework. Our results indicate that eradication of EBT is improbable in large systems via electrofishing, but suppression is a viable alternative given sustained management efforts. Changes to scheduling, effort, and length of electrofishing suppression treatments had minimal effects on EBT population recovery times. We reproduced the effects of compensatory responses to control treatments, including increases in juvenile survival and emigration rates, and demonstrated that these mechanisms are likely drivers of recovery following treatment. Our study highlights the many benefits of incorporating spatially explicit, individual-based models into management plans for the control of invasive species.

AB  - The common asparagus beetle, Crioceris asparagi (Linnaeus) and the twelve-spotted asparagus beetle, Crioceris duodecimpunctata (Linnaeus) are introduced Palearctic leaf beetles that feed exclusively on asparagus. The introduction history of these species in North America is reviewed and their dispersal to and distribution in the Maritime Provinces of Canada are described. Both species were first reported in Canada in 1899 in asparagus production areas in Queenston, Ontario, and other parts of the Niagara Peninsula where they caused serious crop damage. However, we discovered that both species were already found around Quebec City 22 years earlier. Populations now established in the Maritime Provinces of Canada probably originated from southwestern Ontario where most commercial asparagus production in Canada began and now occurs. Crioceris asparagi and C. duodecimpunctata spread steadily throughout eastern Canada by adult flight dispersal abetted by wind, by the dissemination of seeds by birds, and by commercial movement of root crowns and spears of asparagus. Asparagus escaped from cultivation, growing along transportation corridors (such as railway tracks, power utility right-of-ways and roads) and in vacant lands, which facilitated the spread and establishment of C. asparagi and C. duodecimpunctata throughout North America. Now, both these adventive pest species occur wherever asparagus is grown. Both C. asparagi and C duodecimpunctata are confirmed to occur in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, but not Newfoundland and Labrador. However, C duodecimpunctata is newly recorded from Prince Edward Island. These introduced beetles are not regulated by Canada or by the U.S.A., and they are readily controlled at economically acceptable damage thresholds.

AB  - Environmental managers have the difficult task of ensuring species persistence despite considerable uncertainty about their response to management. Spatially explicit population models provide one solution for simulating the dynamics of species and evaluating alternative management regimes. We used a Bayesian model to investigate wetland occupancy dynamics of the endangered growling grass frog Litoria raniformis at a wastewater treatment plant in southern Victoria, Australia. We coupled prior information from earlier research on this species with our survey data to quantify the effects of patch-scale variables and connectivity on the probabilities of occupancy, population extinction and colonization. Hydroperiods of 13 sites were experimentally enhanced to bolster occupancy rates by L.raniformis. We used simulations to assess the extent to which the enhanced hydroperiod regime improved the viability of the focal metapopulation. Occupancy rate increased by 15% among the enhanced sites in 2013-2014, whereas the rate of occupancy among unenhanced sites fell by 11% in that year. Forward simulation using the dynamic occupancy model suggested that the minimum occupancy rate across the metapopulation would be 18% higher if the enhanced hydroperiod regime was retained over the next 20years. Mean posterior effects of patch-scale variables and connectivity on the occupancy dynamics of L.raniformis were consistent with the prior effect in all cases, with only small changes to the size of these effects. There was no clear effect of water chemistry on occupancy dynamics.Synthesis and applications. This work suggests that managing the hydroperiod of constructed wetlands can be an effective tool for the conservation of amphibians and demonstrates the utility of spatially explicit models for assessing metapopulation viability. We encourage managers to experimentally test the efficacy of manipulating patch-scale variables to improve occupancy rates within amphibian metapopulations.

AB  - Food webs in riparian corridors are increasingly viewed as embedded in complex riverine landscapes characterized by an amalgam of aquatic, semi-aquatic, and terrestrial habitats. However, the influence of riverine landscape pattern on trophic dynamics of riparian consumers remains largely unknown. We used naturally abundant stable isotope ratios (N-15) to compare trophic structure of ants (Formica subsericea) among riparian patch types (crop, grass/herbaceous, gravel bar, lawn, mudflat, shrub, swamp, and woody vegetation) at 12 riverine landscapes distributed along an urban-rural landscape gradient of the Scioto River, Ohio, USA. We expected that the diet of F. subsericea, a common generalist consumer, would reflect local prey availability and thus differences in trophic dynamics among patch types. Mean ant N-15 was higher in crop patches than in any other patch type, and was lowest in grass/herbaceous, lawn, shrub, and woody vegetation patches, suggesting that patch type was associated with trophic position of F. subsericea. We also found that the range of N-15, and thus trophic breadth, was significantly different by patch type, with woody vegetation exhibiting the greatest spread. Variability in canopy, tree and shrub cover, and the degree of urban development was positively correlated with N-15 range (R-2=0.78), pointing to the role of habitat structure in mediating trophic breadth of riparian ants. These findings provide evidence that riverine landscape pattern can strongly influence trophic dynamics of riparian arthropods. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) was first isolated in California during July 2003 from a pool of Culex tarsalis collected near El Centro, Imperial County. WNV transmission then increased and spread in Imperial and Coachella Valleys, where it was tracked by isolation from pools of Cx. tarsalis, seroconversions in sentinel chickens, and seroprevalence in free-ranging birds. WNV then dispersed to the city of Riverside, Riverside County, and to the Whittier Dam area of Los Angeles County, where it was detected in dead birds and pools of Cx. pipiens quinquefasciatus. By October, WNV was detected in dead birds collected from riparian corridors in Los Angeles, west to Long Beach, and through inland valleys south from Riverside to San Diego County. WNV was reported concurrently from Arizona in mid-August, and from Baja, Mexico, in mid-November. Possible mechanisms for virus introduction, amplification, and dispersal are discussed.

AB  - When attempting to address the environmental problems of a catchment, it is important to consider changes in a long-term environmental context. However, the long-term data on the state of the environment that are required for such an examination are rarely documented. Such data collection typically requires several years of investigation and observation. In addition, as there may be a significant time lag between the occurrence of a phenomenon and its cause, subsequent environmental investigations of changing animal and plant states scaling up to 5 years may be inadequate. We conducted a long-term analysis of the environmental changes in five sub-catchments of the Nagara River, Japan, assessing a period of 30 years, using a questionnaire survey approach involving local communities. Four sub-catchments of the Yoshida River were also analyzed for comparison. In addition, we attempted to clarify the relationship between various environmental factors and the space-time response of animals and plants. The survey included eight topics: assumed information, hydrological characteristics, habitat conditions for living things, forest state, land cover conditions, river awareness, free-entry information, and respondent information. Our method also has academic significance in that it validates the environmental agent extraction technique using a questionnaire survey. Our results identify management strategies for minimizing biodiversity loss due to climate change. Forest management and human activities should be undertaken with care, and the environmental context going forward into the next century should be considered for integrated catchment management. Elsewhere, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, a much expanded network of protected areas, and/or efforts to provide corridors to ease species movements may be necessary at the global level.

AB  - Boom corridor thinning (BCT) has been proposed as a cost-effective technique for biomass thinning (BT) in young dense stands. The objective of this study was to determine how various BCT operations affect stand structure following biomass thinning and to compare the results with conventional selective thinning methods. Two series of field experiments were established; BCT 1-series: Three sites in south of Sweden (9 and 11 m in mean and dominating tree height) with five treatments, including a control, conventional selective thinning and three BCT treatments (1 m and 2 m wide corridors and selective BCT). The second BCT series: Three regions in Sweden (in the north, centre and in the south), with two stand sites in each region with different tree heights (4/9 m and 5/10 m in mean/dominating tree height). Treatments were control, pre-commercial thinning (PCT), conventional selective thinning and BCT (high and low thinning). Following the first biomass thinning, BCT regimes and selective thinning methods resulted in similar stand structures based on the number of possible future crop trees (>80 mm in diameter at breast height). However, BCT maintained a higher diversity of tree sizes as well as more stems per hectare, including deciduous species, than the selective thinning approaches. The stands after BCT should have more vertical complexity, especially when compared to pre-commercial thinning. The structural heterogeneity resulting from BCT may also increase stand biodiversity and ecosystem service values.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The presence of carnivores near human settlements is a poorly studied topic that generates concern and perception of risk in some human communities, especially for medium to large felids. Apart from the conflict of the potential predation of livestock, there is the insecurity perception of a potential attack on people. To gain a better understanding of how, when, and how close pumas approached human settlements, we analyze 51 puma records near populated areas over eight years in central Chile. The results show that pumas approached human-populated areas; in 23.5% of the records pumas are found between 0 and 999 m from the nearest human settlement, 25.5% are between 1000 and 4999 m, and 51% are over 5000 m. We associate puma records with landscape features, such as mountain ranges, land-use, road, and urban infrastructure; and based on previous knowledge of puma biology, behavior, and habitat preference, we identify their area of occupation and the potential biological corridor used for their movements from the Andes Range to the coast. Our results show the adaptability of pumas to human-dominated landscapes, and their capacity to overcome landscape barriers, such as human infrastructure, contributing to a better understanding of the population dynamics in the study area. Studies on human-carnivore coexistence, through formulas that consider local realities and the reduction of implicit risks for humans, are urgently needed, both globally and locally, and likely the only way to secure the long-term conservation of pumas in human-dominated landscapes.
   The wildland-urban interface lies at the confluence of human-dominated and wild landscapes-creating a number of management and conservation challenges. Wildlife sightings near human settlements have appeared to increase in the last years. This article reports 51 records of presences, sightings, and livestock attacks of Puma concolor, a large-sized felid, collected from 2012 to 2020 across the O'Higgins region in central Chile. Puma records were concentrated in the east of the region in the Andes Range and foothills (90%). The number of puma records is higher in the last four to six years than in previously studied years. Of the 51 records, 23.5% are between 0 and 999 m from the nearest human settlement (classified as very close), 25.5% are between 1000 and 4999 m (moderately close), and 51% are over 5000 m (distant). Most of the sightings are recorded in the summer (35%) and spring (29%). We identify an area of approximately 9000 km(2) of suitable habitat as the most probable corridor effectively connecting pumas moving between eastern and western areas, encompassing the Angostura de Paine mountain range. Our results contribute to the understanding of the presence and movements of P. concolor near urban areas and human settlements, confirming their persistence in and adaptation to human-dominated landscapes. We also provide insights into human-carnivore coexistence in the current global context in the densely populated central Chile.

AB  - The hyper-abundance of migratory wildlife in many ecosystems depends on maintaining access to seasonally available resources. In Eastern and Southern Africa, land-use change and a loss of connectivity have coincided with widespread declines in the abundance and geographic range of ungulate populations. Using photographic capture-mark-recapture, we examine the historical pattern of loss of connectivity and its impact on population trends in a partially migratory wildebeest population in northern Tanzania. To estimate abundance, we use a novel modeling approach that overcomes bias associated with photo misidentifications. Our data indicate (1) diminished connectivity within and between seasonal areas as a result of human activities, (2) a reduction in the overall population size compared to historical numbers, with high variability over time, (3) the continued use of highly constrained movement corridors between the three main seasonal ranges, (4) higher recruitment in the non-migratory subpopulation (Lake Manyara National Park) than in other areas of the ecosystem, and (5) an increase in the relative abundance of resident to migrant wildebeest. Recent conservation efforts to protect seasonal habitat and to enforce anti-poaching policies outside protected areas have likely helped stabilize the population, at least temporarily, but we caution that several key vulnerabilities remain.

AB  - The state of Amapa is a federative unit of Brazil, it has a large part of its territory governed by rules for the protection of natural resources, in such a way that it directly interferes in public policies in the cross-border region with French Guiana, French Department in South America. In this way, the study addresses the issue of land situation and the condition on the border between Amapa and French Guiana. The objective of the study was to analyze the characteristics of territorial management at the border, the environmental protection rules, the dynamics and confrontations of strategic actions. The methodological actions were based on data collection, biographical and documentary research techniques with a qualitative research approach. The results obtained identified the complex diversity of interests that affect the territory with the administrative overlap of the territorial management of the federal entity that holds the largest area in hectares of Amapa land, configured as protected areas. Territorial management is conflicting, caused by the inconsistency between the purposes of creating protected areas and the potential inherent in the cross-border corridor, and the third aspect, are the challenges of confrontation in the territorial organization of Amapa that are directly related to the process os strengthening governance, as competent institutions such as communities living in the vicinity of protected areas, do not participate much in improving the indicators of sustainability and social inclusion, and can provide the development inducing the conservation of natural and cultural resources of conservation units for full use in the state of Amapa. The conclusion of the article is that the territorial area where the biodiversity corridor is inserted is the same area where the Amapa cities that integrate the cross-border corridor are inserted, but the plans are not integrated, thus generating fragmented institutional actions.

AB  - Habitat diversity is considered as an expression of biodiversity at landscape level in addition to genetic and species diversity. Thus, effective methods for measuring habitat pattern at landscape level are crucial for understanding the ecological processes. In this paper we propose to extend the commonly used model Patch Corridor Matrix Model (PCMM) for spatial pattern analysis. Originally, this model assumes discrete structures within the landscape without explicit consideration of "gradients" between patches. The gradients, often called "ecotones", can be considered as "soft edges" which have a profound influence on adjacent ecosystems. Another part of information that has often been ignored are "small habitats" inside patches (e.g. hedgerows, tree rows, copse, and scattered trees), which leads to within-patch heterogeneity being underestimated. In this paper, the concept of landscape contrast is used to integrate the discrete and gradient landscape representations by incorporating small habitats and ecotones in methods to measure landscape heterogeneity. A height gradient is used to define the ecotones between forest and field. Then, patch contrast (i.e. Edge Contrast Index (ECON)) is calculated based on the height difference between adjacent vegetation patches. Artificial elements (e.g. traffic roads) are considered as barriers which are assigned with the highest edge contrast value. At the landscape level, a metric called Area-Weighted Edge Contrast (AWEC) is introduced to describe the landscape structure. The edge effects of ecotones, small habitats, and traffic roads are incorporated in the calculation of AWEC. Our test examples show that incorporation of ecotones and small habitats can smooth "edge effects" among patches and result in a more realistic quantification of habitat contrast. The contrast concept is especially useful in a vegetated landscape with less human impact. It could be understood as an additional interpretation to fragmentation of habitats with permeable edges among them. Consequently, this presented approach may enhance the understanding of the relationship between landscape pattern and process.

AB  - Good urban riverfronts have both ecological and social benefits in urban planning and development. With rapid increase of urban stream rehabilitation projects in developing countries, the concept of Public Accessibility of Riverfront (PAR) has become a highlight in evaluating river ecosystem improvement. In this study the Comprehensive Index of Public Accessibility of Riverfront (CIPAR) that consists of 4 sub-indexes and 12 indicators is designed for assessing the conditions of PAR. The index system is novel for its combined consideration of riverfront accessibilities and benefits. These four sub-indexes measure (1) spatial accessibility reflecting riverfront openness and main transportation convenience, (2) visual accessibility reflecting visual field openness, (3) corridor continuity reflecting riverfront vegetation condition, water-oriented settings, and spatial continuity, and (4) amenity reflecting comfortable experience of riverfront environment and diversity of riverfront activities. Based on the questionnaire and field data collected during March 1-15, 2011, 24 reaches of the Suzhou Creek and its distributaries were assessed with CIPAR, and the urban riverfront after rehabilitation was quantified. The result showed that most of the reaches of Suzhou Creek still suffered a poor-fair PAR condition, and that among the four sub-indexes, visual accessibility got the lowest score with an average score of 0.7. The unsatisfactory PAR condition along the Suzhou Creek mainly resulted from the failure in synchronizing the planning and management of riverfront land uses and river channels in previous phase of the rehabilitation project. This case study supports the use of CIPAR to assess the effectiveness of riverfront rehabilitation project. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. Vegetated islands within river corridors are pivotal landscape features and are among the first to disappear as a consequence of flow regulation and channelisation. However, how vegetated islands vary along human-impacted rivers is poorly understood. 2. We carried out a detailed analysis of the contemporary distribution, diversity and environmental state of vegetated islands within 12 human-impacted European rivers, using 75 Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite images (19992002), historical maps, DEM data and landscape metrics. We tested whether channel fragmentation, catchment land use and the environmental state of fringing floodplains determine the spatial patterns of the islands. We also analysed the historical change of islands within selected sections of the Upper Danube, Upper Rhine and Olt rivers. 3. We identified 2771 islands in the contemporary landscape, varying from 0.06 to 9828 ha. Islands covered up to 21% of the active channel area and contributed up to 32% of the total riparian ecotone length. Island density ranged from 0.06 islands per river-km (River Sava) to 1.6 islands per river-km (River Tagliamento). River regulation has led to a marked loss of island density: 94% in the Upper Danube, 93% in the Upper Rhine, and 69% in the Olt. The environmental state of the islands was significantly less altered by human activity than of their fringing floodplains; 93.4% of the vegetated islands exhibited a near-natural state, while 86% of the fringing floodplains were expansively converted to agricultural and urban land uses. 4. Our results highlight the ubiquitous presence of vegetated islands, their sensitivity to river regulation and their pivotal role for the future restoration and management of river corridors.

AB  - P>Roads and rivers may be dispersal corridors for invasive alien grass seeds that fly and float. These two systems interact at bridge interchanges that are also disturbed artificial habitats. The invasive grass Pennisetum setaceum (perennial fountain grass) establishes on roadsides and river banks and benefits from habitat conditions prevailing at these interchanges. The distribution of the grass across biomes and vegetation types and the influence of environmental variables were assessed. A road survey method was used to record and map the distribution of P. setaceum along 1 km roadside transects at 10 km intervals and at every road-river corridor interchange for 5112 km of South African national roads in the arid and semi-arid parts of the country. Pennisetum setaceum populations occurred in 10% of the total length sampled, including the interchanges. Fynbos Swartland Shale Renosterveld was the most significantly invaded amongst the vegetation types surveyed. Our results indicate that, although P. setaceum performs better on the interchanges, it does not preferentially colonise them over other parts of the landscape. The presence of P. setaceum was, however, closely associated with the presence of water bodies and disturbances away from the roads. Corridor interchanges should be considered important targets of both local and regional efforts to prevent and control P. setaceum invasions.

AB  - Snowpatches are disjunct arctic ecosystems scattered across the subarctic, particularly on wind-protected lee slopes, where a thick snow cover accumulates during the winter. These snow-rich treeless ecosystems are affected by delayed snowmelt, causing shorter growing seasons. Snow-tolerant plants occupy the centre of subarctic snowpatches, whereas black spruce trees grow at the margins. Snowpatches have shown sporadic expansion and shrinkage phases from tree establishment and mortality linked to climatic trends. Field surveys in the subarctic of eastern Canada are showing an afforestation process occurring in snowpatches. The origin and nature of this afforestation were investigated based on the hypothesis that tree colonization and growth were closely associated with recent changes in climate. Snowpatches were categorized into three types based on border trees: forested, semi-forested and tundra-like. In eight randomly selected snowpatches of each type, snowpatch borders and areas covered by deciduous shrubs or trees were mapped and chionophilous plants and frost-associated soil disturbances were recorded. Radial (tree-ring) and vertical growth were measured on stems to evaluate the impact of climate and local factors on snowpatch black spruce populations. Two waves of spruce colonization occurred in all forested and semi-forested snowpatches in the 1960s and in the 1980s to present. Spruce establishment was more frequent and abundant in recent years, near the forest margins and on moss and barren seedbeds. Expanding shrub (dwarf birch) cover inhibited spruce seedling establishment. Tree establishment and growth were positively correlated with growing season temperature and negatively correlated with annual maximum snow depth. More recently established spruce seedlings exhibited faster vertical growth than those established in the 20th century. Synthesis. Due to warmer conditions and earlier snowmelt in eastern Canada, black spruce trees and dwarf birch shrubs are racing through subarctic snowpatches. This afforestation could change biodiversity in the subarctic and affect watershed dynamics through a change in snowmelt pattern. Subarctic snowpatches are climate-sensitive ecosystems of the forest-tundra landscape, forming ideal biotopes for snow-tolerant, arctic-alpine species. Further tree encroachment in snowpatches in this century is potentially a threat to plant diversity, especially chionophilous species that have no corridors to migrate towards arctic ecosystems.

AB  - Examining the movement of apex predators is difficult in urban environments due to private land ownership; however, understanding their movement is critical given the current and rapidly increasing rate of urbanization globally. Of equal importance is the understanding of what landscape factors allow these movements to occur. We used the powerful owl (Ninox strenua), an urban apex predator in Melbourne, Australia, as a case study to understand their movement ecology in urban environments.
   Owl movement was recorded using automated GPS logging devices deployed on ten powerful owls, resulting in 10870 GPS locations. In combination with these positions, four environmental covariates, and a priori understanding of owl ecology were used to assign movements to three different states (prey handling/eating, foraging and transitory) based on step length and turning angles between sequential locations in a hidden Markov model. We demonstrate that the environmental covariate combination of time of night, Euclidean distance to riparian vegetation, and NDVI best described movement states. Owl movement states changed across the night. Shorter movements with many turns were made towards the beginning of the night in riparian areas with high NDVI. This behavior is most likely linked to prey handling, suggesting powerful owls are more likely to hunt early in the evenings and as such travel short distances while carrying large prey items. Transitory movements with limited changes in turning angles were the dominant movement state towards the end of the night. As owls leave areas of high NDVI, they quickly travel long distances across cleared land and impervious surfaces to connect to the next habitat patch where they then transition back into shorter step lengths where NDVI is higher.
   This research highlights the critical importance of riparian vegetation and high NDVI areas in driving powerful owl movement and foraging in urban landscapes. Conservation priority should be placed on retaining and restoring riparian corridors as areas not only for powerful owls and their prey, but also for many other species that utilize similar resources.

AB  - This paper assesses the occurrence of density-dependent habitat selection in an urban fragmented landscape, composed of forest fragments (urban parks) connected by corridors (wooded streets], to test the hypothesis that as population density increased in the parks their suitability decreased and individuals entered alternative habitats, such as wooded streets. Density variation of six species was studied during two consecutive breeding seasons. Vegetation structure in wooded streets was significantly less complex than in urban parks, supporting the view that wooded streets were less suitable for breeding birds. Five species (Coal Tit Parus ater, Spotless Starling Sturnus unicolor, Serin Serinus serinus, Black-billed Magpie Pica pica and Woodpigeon Columba palumbus) showed density-dependent habitat occupation of wooded streets, while the Common Blackbird Turdus merula did not. As park suitability decreased with rising densities, wooded streets became a profitable alternative in terms of foraging, breeding, or for moving between parks. However, the relationships varied both between and within species in different years. Such differences could have been caused by variable rates of human disturbance, renewal of resources and predation risks in wooded streets. More detailed studies are required to determine how birds perceive and regulate their population dynamics in fragments and associated corridors, particularly for species targeted for management.

AB  - We analyzed the presence and abundance of tropical resident pigeons and doves (Columbidae) in Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve, Veracruz, Mexico, during the breeding seasons of 2010 and 2011. We used different survey methods to maximize the detection of different species and overcome terrain and vegetation limitations. We surveyed the area mostly through transects and point counts in evergreen tropical forest, cloud forest, pine-oak forest, and agricultural areas, including the Reserve core areas, recording 512 individuals of 12 out of 17 columbid species reported historically for the area. We were able to confirm Patagioenas cayennensis, P. speciosa, P. flavirostris, P. nigrirostris, Columbina inca, C. talpacoti, Claravis pretiosa, Geotrygon montana, Leptotila verreauxi, L. plumbeiceps, Zentrygon carrikeri (endemic), and Zenaida asiatica. The tropical evergreen forest is the vegetation type with the highest species richness, and the most abundant species was L. verreauxi. Abundance varied significantly among vegetation types for L. verreauxi, L. plumbeiceps, and Zentrygon carrikeri, possibly due to differences in their tolerance to disturbance. Cloud forest stood out as the most important habitat as it was used more than expected by species such as P. flavirostris, C. pretiosa, L. verreauxi, L. plumbeiceps, and Z. carrikeri. The species with the broadest habitat preferences were P. flavirostris, C. pretiosa, and L. verreauxi. Three species were exclusive to a single vegetation type (P. cayennensis and P. nigrirostris to evergreen tropical forest; P. speciosa to cloud forest). The volcan San Martin Pajapan, one of the Bio-sphere Reserve core areas was surveyed for the first time, and we recorded L. verreauxi, L. plumbeiceps, as well as an important population of Z. carrikeri, the latter endemic species being previously only known from three other Mexican mountain ranges. The populations of doves and pigeons inhabiting the forest interior are mostly located in isolated primary forest fragments, therefore corridors should be established to avoid the isolation of the remaining endangered dove populations.

AB  - Capsule: Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus and Great Tits Parus major wintering in rural areas tended to move further to breed the following breeding season and more frequently cross the urban-rural boundary, than did those wintering in urban gardens.
   Aims: To explore and quantify the movements of birds from winter to breeding season locations across the urban-rural ecotone at the boundary of a large urban area.
   Methods: Birds were colour-ringed at rural and urban/suburban garden ringing sites during the winter. This was followed by breeding season surveys and resighting in the surrounding areas to quantify the movements of colour-ringed birds and changes in habitat selection between seasons.
   Results: Blue Tits and Great Tits ringed in winter in rural areas tended to move further and selected more urbanized breeding territories the following spring than did urban/suburban garden-ringed conspecifics. This shows that the populations were connected across the urban-rural ecotone by the seasonal movements of individuals, but that net movement was from rural wintering areas to urban breeding habitat.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that rural populations may not be subsidized by urban wintering birds and winter supplementary feeding, but that the resources in gardens within urban areas, perhaps spring/summer feeding and nestboxes, draw birds in to breed. Combined with independent evidence for lower breeding success in urban areas, this may show the operation of source-sink dynamics. The results suggest important implications for connections between populations, the conservation value of urban areas and potential for the spread of disease, but further work is required to extend evidence and inference to other regions and species. Nevertheless, the approach used here provides a scalable study model that can be applied in other contexts.

AB  - The Western Cape population of Blue Cranes Anthropoides paradiseus is the species' largest and most stable population. How this population utilises the agricultural landscape of the Western Cape, how far individuals disperse and the connectivity between subpopulations is unknown. Basic demographic parameters such as survival are also understudied. We explored movement patterns and survival using a long-term data set of 649 individually-marked birds. Resightings suggest that movements in the Western Cape were localised, with an average displacement of 24.6km from their natal point. Displacement varied with age but not season. Despite regional differences in resighting effort, only 3.8% of individuals were observed in both the Overberg and the Swartland, suggesting high regional fidelity. However, there was significant movement within the Overberg, so Blue Cranes appear to be resident to locally nomadic in the Western Cape. There was evidence that adults return to their natal site: 57% of adults were resighted in the area where they were ringed as chicks. The viability of Blue Cranes therefore depends on correct local management. Mark-recapture survival estimates were 0.6 for juveniles, 0.87 for immatures, and 0.72 for adults, although adult survival was underestimated due to ring loss. Future studies should use a different ringing technique.

AB  - The effects of widespread sagebrush removal treatments on pygmy rabbits (Brachylagus idahoensis) are not well understood. Due to reliance on sagebrush, pygmy rabbits are among the species for which these treatments may be detrimental. Our objectives were to evaluate the effects of experimental sagebrush treatment on 8 radio-collared pygmy rabbits between and within home range habitat selection using Monte Carlo simulation from null models. Pygmy rabbits were not extirpated from plots containing habitat treatments, and we found no evidence that treatments affected home range placement. The mean treatment distance of observed home range centers did not differ from repeated trials of random points. However, we found evidence of within home range selection against treatments from 2 of 8 rabbits located close to the treatments. The mean treatment distance of all observed locations for these 2 rabbits was greater than expected based on a null model. We also used snow tracking to show that pygmy rabbits entered treatments in 4 out of 21 trials, which was less often than expected by chance (G(2) = 8.662, P = 0.003). Conservatively, sagebrush removal treatments should not be conducted on active or recently active pygmy rabbit burrows. Elsewhere near known pygmy rabbit sites, treated patches should be small and connected by untreated corridors to prevent potentially limiting movement of rabbits among the untreated habitat.

AB  - Tiger, being a solitary and territorial animal, often tends to move out of protected areas into the surrounding forests. This is especially true in the case of sub-adult animals leading to escalating conflicts and deaths in the surrounding human-dominated landscapes. Unless adequately protected against various human activities, such corridors and surrounding forests will soon disappear, trapping the animals within protected areas with resultant local extinctions. In this paper we ascertain tiger presence, occupancy and numbers in one such partially protected area, the Sathyamangalam forest, located close to better known tiger reserves in India, through non-invasive faecal DNA analysis. Here we highlight the potential of Sathyamangalam as a tiger habitat. Tiger positive faecal samples were considered as evidence to establish occupancy in two different parts of Sathyamangalam, reserve forest and wildlife sanctuary. We collected 103 faecal samples out of which 69 were tiger positive. Species occupancy (psi), was 0.672 (+/- 0.197) with a detection probability of 0.2 (+/- 0.06) in the wildlife sanctuary area; while psi was 0.72 (+/- 0.2) with detection probability of 0.212 (+/- 0.6) in the reserve forest. Further, number of males and females, as determined in our study, was close to the ideal sex ratio in a healthy forest with good prey abundance. This study also highlights the presence of more females in the reserve forest (n = 10) than the wildlife sanctuary (n = 3) possibly indicating lesser disturbance and more prey availability. We recommend that the reserve forest to the north of Sathyamangalam wildlife sanctuary be declared as a tiger reserve. The wildlife sanctuary could serve as a buffer zone between this reserve and Sathyamangalam town which lies to the south of the forest. Proper protection of Sathyamangalam will go a long way in saving the entire landscape and tigers of the Western Ghats of India.

AB  - Reflecting the lack of critical information for most protected species, recovery plans for organisms listed as threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act tend to oversimplify habitat descriptions. Here we present our approach for improving the definition of habitat for rare and patchily distributed listed species. The valley elderberry longhorn beetle (Desmocerus californicus dimorphus) occurs in riparian and scrub communities in California's Central Valley. Habitat quality for the species currently is defined essentially exclusively in terms of presence and abundance of its larval host plant, elderberry (Sambucus spp.). Using detailed measures of physical and biological attributes at diverse sites occupied by the beetle, we characterized and defined habitat quality on the basis of not only host plants, but on an array of biotic and abiotic environmental characteristics. We identified four geornorphically distinct habitat associations: alluvial plain, narrow riparian corridor, upper riparian plain, and non-riparian scrub. Depending on habitat type, the environmental characteristics most strongly associated with beetle presence were host plant availability, topography and proximity to habitat edge. Increased local population size of beetles was associated with higher elderberry density and the presence of larger, more mature plants. Stochasticity in site occupancy over space and time confounds our ability to identify sites that are most able to contribute to long-term beetle survival, while underscoring the importance of unoccupied habitat to the beetle. Adopting a multivariate definition of habitat may facilitate more effective identification of locations critical to the recovery of the valley elderberry longhorn beetle, and prioritization of those management actions that can contribute effectively to meeting conservation goals for the species.

AB  - Evolution involves temporal changes in the characteristics of a species that are subsequently propagated or rejected through natural selection. In the case of parasites, host switching also plays a prominent role in the evolutionary process. These changes are rooted in genetic variation and gene flow where genes may be deleted, mutated (sequence), duplicated, rearranged and/or translocated and then transmitted through vertical gene transfer. However, the introduction of new genes is not driven only by Mendelian inheritance and mutation but also by the introduction of DNA from outside a lineage in the form of horizontal gene transfer between donor and recipient organisms. Once introduced and integrated into the biology of the recipient, vertical inheritance then perpetuates the newly acquired genetic factor, where further functionality may involve cooption of what has become a pre-existing physiological capacity. Upon sequencing the Trichinella spiralis (Glade I) genome, a cyanate hydratase (cyanase) gene was identified that is common among bacteria, fungi, and plants, but rarely observed among other eukaryotes. The sequence of the Trichinella cyanase gene clusters with those derived from the Kingdom Plantae in contrast to the genes found in some Glade III and IV nematodes that cluster with cyanases of bacterial origin. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the Trichinella cyanase was acquired during the Devonian period and independently from those of other nematodes. These data may help inform us of the deep evolutionary history and ecological connectivity of early ancestors within the lineage of contemporary Trichinella. Further, in many extant organisms, cyanate detoxification has been largely superseded by energy requirements for metabolism. Thus, deciphering the function of Trichinella cyanase may provide new avenues for treatment and control.

AB  - Leptospirosis is caused by spirochete bacteria of the genus Leptospira that affect one million and kill 60,000 persons annually in the world, who get infected through environmental mammal-excreted (notably rodent) pathogens. Using qPCR and DNA sequencing approaches, we here examine Leptospira occurrence and diversity in 971 commensal small mammals in urban and peri-urban habitats from south Benin, where socio-environmental conditions are favorable for human contamination. Prevalence reached 12.9% on average, but showed very important variations in both space and time, thus pointing toward a role of local processes in the maintenance and circulation of rodent-borne leptospires in the area. Prevalence peaks may occur during or one month after moderate (100-200 mm) monthly rainfall, suggesting that rodent-borne leptospires may be more prevalent when standing waters are present, but not at their highest levels (i.e., floods). However, this pattern will have to be confirmed through proper diachronic analysis. Finally, an incomplete but significant host-specificity was observed, with L. kirschneri retrieved only in African shrews, and the invasive Rattus norvegicus and the native Mastomys natalensis preferentially infected by L. interrogans and L. borgpeterseni, respectively. Our study highlights the urgent need for investigations on human leptospirosis in the extensively urbanized Abidjan-Lagos corridor.

AB  - The umbrella species concept posits that protection of a single, wide-ranging species may confer protection to a large number of sympatric species. Due to their large home ranges, widespread distribution in the Mesoamerican Biodiversity Hotspot (MBH), and status as the focal species of numerous conservation initiatives, the jaguar Panthera onca is an ideal species to evaluate the umbrella strategy. Alter ground-truthing jaguar corridors from 2009-2016, we tested the umbrella value of jaguars for endemic herpetofauna (Amphibia, Reptilia) in Nuclear Central America (NCA). a similar to 370 000 km(2) sub-region of the MBH. NCA contains the greatest density of threatened reptiles in the Western Hemisphere and harbors extraordinary high diversity of amphibians, the most threatened class of vertebrate worldwide. Of the 304 regional endemics in NCA, the distributions of 187 (61.5 %) species of amphibians and reptiles overlapped ground-truthed jaguar range. The distributions of 14 reptiles, including a critically endangered Bothriechis spp. and two endangered Norops spp., occur exclusively within jaguar distribution. Similarly, the distributions of 19 amphibians, including four critically endangered Craugastor spp. and two critically endangered Plectrohyla spp. occur entirely within jaguar distribution. Our results indicate greater effectiveness of ground-tnnhed jaguar distribution than modeled and randomly selected networks in overlapping the distributions of endemic herpetofauna, especially threatened amphibians, in NCA. Substantiation of multi-taxa dependence on habitat in jaguar distribution would strengthen justification for wider application of the umbrella strategy beyond NCA and aid conservation planning in the MBH.

AB  - Lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) winter in the Grand Calumet River-Indiana Harbor Canal (GCR-IHC) drainage into southern Lake Michigan, a polluted oasis in the highly urban and industrial corridor of northern Illinois and Indiana. The GCR-IHC is an important wintering area for lesser scaup in northwestern Indiana, especially after Lake Michigan freezes, because of the lack of other wildlife habitat in the area. We investigated the feeding and movement patterns of these wintering lesser scaup to better understand the ecological significance of this area to wintering waterfowl and to interpret contaminant levels in these lesser scaup. We implanted radio transmitters in 20 individuals in January 1994 and tracked them until early March 1994. Four lesser scaup disappeared and four died within the first 2 weeks after implantation; 12 lesser scaup remained in the GCR-IHC for the next 6-7 weeks. Individual radio-marked scaup (n = 12) were located in the GCR-IHC on an average of 62.2% (extreme values = 25-87%) of the searches. No radio-marked lesser scaup were located outside the GCR-IHC. Lesser scaup were feeding during 23% of the radio fixes.

AB  - The rapid progression of an invasive genotype of common reed along roads and other linear infrastructures in North America provides one of the most spectacular examples of the role of transportation corridors as invasion pathways. In this paper, we discuss ecological patterns and processes in roadside habitats important for understanding the invasion dynamics of common reed from coastal areas inland. Frequent disturbances in roadsides combined with potentially high levels of nutrients from adjacent land and stress conditions (from deicing salt and other pollutants) mimic the conditions unfortunately found more and more in natural wetlands. The novel contribution of roads is the creation of linear wetlands with an unprecedented level of connectivity. Genetic evidence shows that invasion inland coincides with the intensification of the road network. Time series analysis of remote sensing data reveals impressive rates of invasion of roadsides and other linear infrastructures, suggesting prime conditions for common reed in these novel habitats. Whereas reed dispersal along roads was thought to be largely due to rhizome transport, new evidence suggests a significant contribution of sexual reproduction and seedling establishment, likely enhanced by climate warming at northern latitudes. There is little evidence that other wetland plants can slow down vegetative expansion of common reed in roadside habitats, but plant cover could prevent seedling establishment and shading by shrubs and trees limit lateral clonal expansion. The fact that common reed possibly provides water treatment and other ecosystem services in roadsides must be carefully weighed against the threat to biodiversity in natural systems. All this begs for investigating urgently if, where, and how we should intervene without compromising the great value of wetlands of conservation interest intersected by roads.

AB  - The goals of landscape planning are multiple for rural ecosystems of the resettlement area in the Hubei Province of China. They relate to the types, diversity and patterns of the ecosystems, and to the conservation of ecosystem functions and biodiversity. We were interested in the improvement of socio-economic conditions, and the promotion of the development of farmland ecosystems and natural forest ecosystems. The landscape planning took into account the conservation and the restoration of forestlands, and the reconstructions of farmlands, towns and villages. The areas of towns and villages were assigned by trade-off analysis balancing ecological, economic and social benefits. The spatial pattern of used lands was designed by a multi-criteria optimal spatial planning, resulting in the strengthening of some primary ecosystem functions. In the resettlement area forests will expand to a matrix, and cropland patches together with tree fences will form patch-corridor systems. Significant ecological, economic and social benefits can be derived from this landscape pattern.

AB  - Anthropogenic habitat disturbances are causing large-scale declines in animal abundance. For many species, information on the drivers of decline is lacking or restricted to single sites, despite calls for regional approaches. In this study, we determined the effect of different types of habitat disturbance (natural or anthropogenic) and ecological factors on Geoffroy's spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) abundance using a regional approach. We selected this study species because of its high degree of social flexibility and its endangered status. We surveyed 4 sites in the Yucatan Peninsula and recorded the number of individual monkeys encountered along 72 line-transect segments each measuring 500 m. Habitat disturbance variables were obtained from open-access databases and included distance to roads, presence and number of hurricanes, forest loss, and presence of forest fires. Ecological factors were based on data collected during vegetation surveys and included number and basal area of feeding tree species, and canopy height. We ran generalized linear mixed models and found that monkey abundance was negatively affected by forest loss but positively affected by the basal area of feeding trees. We, therefore, suggest that a combination of anthropogenic and ecological factors affects spider monkey abundance. Spider monkey's high degree of social flexibility may be a mechanism allowing them to adjust to changes in their environment when canopy connectivity is not lost. Our results provide policy and conservation decision makers with key information to develop regional conservation plans. Additionally, our methods can be used to identify the factors that affect the abundance of other mammal species.

AB  - Corridors can favour range expansion of generalists. Specifically, roads have been suspected of facilitating invasion. In southern Africa, pied crows (Corvus alba) have either Colonised or increased in abundance, perhaps because climate warming has shifted their available habitat, assisted by roads. We investigated the link between abundance of this generalist bird species and roadkill, taking into account whether road infrastructure, socioeconomics and driving habits influence roadkill. We surveyed 1170 km of principal roads in South Africa (SA), Botswana, and Zimbabwe. SA has the most complex economy incorporating good roads, fast vehicles and more human activity. The economy of Botswana is intermediate and Zimbabwe's is smallest. Crows were sighted nearly 10 times more often in SA than Zimbabwe, although crows were historically rare in 60% of the SA area we surveyed. They were five times more abundant in Botswana than Zimbabwe. Roadkill was 20 times more frequent in SA and eight times more frequent in Botswana, than Zimbabwe. The average number of vehicle occupants in Zimbabwean vehicles was 5.5 and 2.8 times that of SA and Botswana, respectively. That is, the number people transported per roadkill was 4.5 in South Africa, compared to 433 in Zimbabwe. There was an interaction between roadkill and country. SA had the greatest increase in crow numbers per roadkill, indicating that crow densities were greater in SA because roads are particularly important for crows compared to the surrounding environment, and/or that the regular supply of roadkill on South African roads builds a "reservoir" of crows. Increased crow abundance places additional predation pressure on mammals, reptiles, birds and insects in the surrounding scrub-vegetation. Telegraph poles contribute to the problem, providing nest sites in an environment that provides few other nests and perches. An approach to socioeconomic development that considers contributing factors can be expected to reduce the spread of opportunist species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A myriad of factors affect stream fish assemblages, and most of them are intimately regulated by surrounding land uses. One of the most pernicious impacts on streams is the release of urban effluents. Accordingly, understanding the fish assemblage patterns as well as the environmental drivers that modulate them in the context of urban streams which also are exposed to other land uses is mandatory. We evaluated the longitudinal patterns of fish assemblages in an urbanised Neotropical prairie stream exposed to downstream patches of different surrounding land uses. Several variables of water quality, in-stream habitat and riparian corridors were measured, and their relationships with fish metrics were explored. A fish metric selection protocol was implemented, and several multivariate analyses were used. Three main patterns of fish response were observed. Assemblage-level attributes as diversity, richness, biomass, number of families and trophic guilds and proportion of Characiformes and intolerant species were responsive to the natural gradient in habitat (pools) and riparian (riparian width) conditions expected in non-impacted lotic ecosystems. Conversely, a downstream continuum of recovery in water quality (dissolved oxygen, conductivity, NO3:NH4 and bacteriological loads) and habitat structure (sediment depth) would influence the distribution of fish species regarding their environmental tolerance and habitat preferences. Finally, local habitat aspects (nitrites, submerged macrophytes, bare soil cover and bank incisions by livestock) seemed relevant for the trophic structure (omnivorous species) of fish assemblages. A complex natural and anthropic longitudinal scenario together with local disruptions imposed by surrounding land uses were directive for fish.

AB  - We tracked 39 western flyway white-naped cranes (Antigone vipio) throughout multiple annual cycles from June 2017 to July 2020, using GSM-GPS loggers providing positions every 10-min to describe migration routes and key staging areas used between their Mongolian breeding and wintering areas in China's Yangtze River Basin. The results demonstrated that white-naped cranes migrated an average of 2556 km (& PLUSMN;187.9 SD) in autumn and 2673 km (& PLUSMN;342.3) in spring. We identified 86 critical stopover sites that supported individuals for more than 14 days, within a 100-800 km wide migratory corridor. This study also confirmed that Luan River catchment is the most important staging region, where white-naped cranes spent 18% of the annual cycle (in both spring and autumn) each year. Throughout the annual cycle, 69% of the tracking locations were from outside of the currently protected areas, while none of the critical staging areas enjoyed any form of site protection. We see further future potential to combine avian tracking data and remote-sensing information throughout the annual range of the white-naped crane to restore it and other such species to a more favourable conservation status.</p>

AB  - The vision of rewilding is to return ecosystems to a "natural" or "self-willed" state with trophic complexity, dispersal (and connectivity) and stochastic disturbance in place. The concept is gaining traction, particularly in Europe where significant land abandonment has taken place in recent years. However, in reality, the purest form of rewilding (Rewilding Max) is constrained by a number of context-specific factors whereby it may not be possible to restore the native species that form part of the trophic structure of the ecosystem if they are extinct (for example, mammoths, Mammuthus spp., aurochs, Bos taurus primigenius). In addition, populations/communities of native herbivores/predators may not be able to survive or be acceptable to the public in small scale rewilding projects close to areas of high human density or agricultural land. Therefore, the restoration of natural trophic complexity and disturbance regimes within rewilding projects requires careful consideration if the broader conservation needs of society are to be met. Here we highlight the importance of herbivory as a key factor in rewilding. We argue that the use of the suite of livestock species, and in particular traditional breeds, offers the opportunity, under both land sharing/sparing strategies, to reinstate a more "natural" form of herbivory but still retain the option for management interventions (Rewilding Lite). It will even be possible to gain economic returns (ecotourism, sale of livestock products) from these systems, which will make them more acceptable to state and private landowners. We develop our case based on the advantages of using landraces versus de-domestication strategies, and on the implementation of eco-shepherding herbivory as a restoration tool in fine mosaics of agriculture/natural patches. If this approach is adopted, then larger areas can be given over to conservation, because of the potential broader benefits to society from these spaces and the engagement of farmers in practices that are closer to their traditions.

AB  - Fragmentation has negative effects on ecosystems and can cause loss of habitats, increase of edges and isolation. Forests in northern Italy have strongly declined, because of the development of urban land, infrastructures and crops. In suburban areas forest patches often perform a variety of functions. This study used scenarios integrating both ecological and social principles to improve landscape multifunctionality in a suburban area of Northern Italy, with a special focus on the role of woody patches. We evaluated how improving some functions of woody patches (suitability for forest species, mitigation for road impact and recreation) can help creating a multifunctional landscape. We combined the scenario visualisation through GIS, the maximization of functions based on ecological principles, and the use of fuzzy logic. The scenarios obtained show that improving existing woods can help to maximize multiple functions. The scenario improving recreation is the most suitable to increase biodiversity, and it can also help to mitigate road impact. The scenario approach can help decision-makers during the planning process, because it is user-friendly. Comparing multiple scenarios can allow assessing if managing the landscape for one function may also accomplish other function(s).

AB  - In August 2002, the presence of the Puma concolor began to be detected near Itapua State Park (PEI), in the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre. This study aimed at: registering the species in the regions using indirect methods; accessing the perception of local inhabitants about the recently-settled species, using free interviews based on semi-structured questionnaires; and identifying potential dispersion routes used by the species to reach the region, using spatial analyses in a geographic information system (GIS), evaluating the concentration of remaining forests in the areas surrounding the park. Field outings were conducted between September 2002 and May 2004 and twelve properties in the area immediately surrounding PEI were visited. Thirty-one traces of the species were recorded in the region. Most of the interviewed families proved to be detached from PEI's conservationist interests and unreceptive to the presence of the puma in the area, revealing the urgency in implementing educational programs geared towards the local community. Spatial analyses demonstrate the high probability of finding the puma in the northeast corner of PEI, generating subsidies for implementing corridors of wildlife that connect the region of the park to other remaining forests in the state.

AB  - We examined the influence of past and present landscape structure across five regions of northern and eastern Australia on phylogeographic structure in the freshwater fish Glossamia aprion. We predicted the geological isolation of North West Australia would promote the strongest phylogeographic structure, including highest endemism of candidate species and deepest divergences within species, and past low sea level riverine connections in the Carpentaria Region would greatly reduce phylogeographic structure. The allozyme data indicated five candidate species within Australian Glossamia, although the mtDNA data revealed only four of these taxa. Diversity and endemism of the candidate species was highest in North West Australia, but Carpentaria was not the only region to have low species diversity or an absence of endemic species. Three of the five candidate species were narrow range endemics and occurred in regions with known endemism of candidate species in other freshwater fauna. The reported subspecies Glossamia aprion gillii was clearly distinct based on the genetic data, while the fifth species, G. a. aprion, was widely distributed across four of the five regions. The intra-specific analyses for G. a. aprion showed highest phylogeographic structure in North West Australia and lowest phylogeographic structure in Carpentaria. Overall, the results demonstrate the long-term legacy of variable landscape structure on phylogeographic patterns and allopatric speciation.

TI  - TOWARD A NATIONAL CONSERVATION NETWORK ACT: TRANSFORMING LANDSCAPE CONSERVATION ON THE PUBLIC LANDS INTO LAW
T2  - HARVARD ENVIRONMENTAL LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - The United States has made a remarkable commitment to nature conservation on the federal public lands. The country's existing array of national parks, wilderness areas, national monuments, wildlife refuges, and other protective designations encompasses roughly 150 million acres, or nearly 40 percent of the "lower 48" federal estate. A robust land trust movement has protected another 56 million acres of privately owned lands. Advances in scientific knowledge reveal that these protected enclaves, standing alone, are insufficient to protect native ecosystems and at-risk wildlife from climate change impacts and unrelenting development pressures. Abetted by existing law, conservation policy is now focusing on the larger landscape to preserve biological diversity and to promote ecological resilience as principal management goals. This growing emphasis on landscape-scale conservation is evident in various protected area complexes that have arisen organically across the federal estate in places as diverse as the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, California's Mojave Desert, and Colorado's San Luis Valley.
   To fully capitalize on these ad hoc developments, this article makes the case for a new National Conservation Network Act to legitimize and expand upon these protected areas. It first reviews the origins and evolution of the nation's protected land systems and related nature conservation strategies, and then identifies the scientific and legal developments underlying landscape-scale conservation strategies. Next, it highlights several emergent protected area complexes evident on the public lands, explaining their diverse origins and important conservation contributions. It concludes by proposing new legislation that would place a statutory umbrella over these protected complexes, mandate effective interagency coordination within them, enlist private lands as voluntary "affiliates" in these conservation efforts, and establish new wildlife corridor and restoration area designations. The proposed law would validate the current movement toward landscape conservation, and thus amplify the federal commitment to nature conservation to meet the challenges looming ahead.

AB  - Environmentally sensitive areas (ESAs) are landscape elements or places which are vital to the long-term maintenance of biological diversity, soil, water or other natural resources both on the site and in a regional context. They include wildlife habitat areas, steep slopes, wetlands, and prime agricultural lands. When ESAs are interconnected, they could form greenway corridors consisting of networks of linked landscape elements that provide ecological, recreational, and cultural benefits to a community. By implication, the planning process which communities use in protecting ESAs could serve as a template for developing greenway corridors.
   Many communities faced with the pressures of balancing economic development with environmental protection recognize that uncontrolled development may lead to an irreversible loss of ESAs. Communities, therefore, develop local comprehensive plans that identify the geographical distribution of ESAs, and specify land-use strategies and regulations for protecting them. However, this traditional form of identifying and protecting ESAs inhibits the potential for connecting them into a greenway corridor for many reasons: (1) the rationale for identifying and protecting ESAs is based on an exclusionary process that designates areas not appropriate for development; (2) the procedures for assessing ESAs are based predominantly on their geographical distribution, with little consideration of their functioning or the flow of nutrients, species, and energy between the landscape elements; (3) the identification and protection of ESAs focus on individual landscape elements such as flood plains and steep slopes, resulting in habitat fragmentation. Fragmentation is perpetuated further by the implementation of land-use controls such as conventional zoning, which focuses predominantly on protecting individual landscape elements rather than integrating them with adjacent landscape elements and land uses. Moreover, communities vary in their capacity to develop and implement appropriate land-use controls that would minimize further fragmentation.
   This paper documents a pilot study that demonstrates the application of a modified abiotic-biotic-cultural (ABC) strategy for assessing ESAs and connecting them into greenway corridors in Walton County, Georgia. The ABC method permits assessment of the structure (descriptive) and function (relational) characteristics of the landscape for relative ecological values, which become the basis for designing greenways that serve specific ecological functions. Application of the method reveals that assessing ESAs and the interconnected landscape elements provides a vehicle for developing greenway corridors that serve primarily as a conduit for the movement of animals and secondarily as areas for the protection of water quality. To provide for the sustained management of the proposed greenway corridors, procedural guidelines are prescribed for integrating the resultant greenway plan into Walton County's comprehensive plan.

AB  - Riparian wetland areas often represent critical corridors for animal and plant dispersion in wildland watersheds and downstream river systems. It is essential that integrated management of riparian wetland areas bc developed to reverse the loss of biological diversity. Agricultural and urban uses, and related water developments, have led to a marked decline of stream-side wetland habitats. Six major ways are discussed in which conventional agriculture alters wetlands and aquatic habitats: wetland drainage, water diversions, stream channelization, bank stabilization, grazing, and the release of agricultural pollutants. This article discusses these practices and suggests ways biological diversity can be protected, or even enhanced. In addition, aquaculture is discussed as a new force which affects the diversity of aquatic organisms. Aquaculture methods range in intensity of management from low to high. The higher the intensity the potentially more disruptive practices can be to surrounding aquatic systems. Management for biological diversity as well as for food production should be encouraged.

AB  - An effective management tool for the spatial prioritization of the Cozumel Reefs National Park (CRNP), using a systematic approach, is an urgent need for the conservation of one of the most important Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in Mexico. In this study, we integrated a model using seascape metrics, the spatio-temporal variation of substrate coverage, and frequency of reef use for SCUBA diving, to systematically identify priority areas for conservation within the CRNP. We identified seven habitat types: sand beds, reef, two habitats of macroalgae beds (high and low cover), and seagrass beds with three different densities, using a supervised classification on a SPOT 7 (2017) satellite image (overall accuracy of 84%, Kappa of 0.79). Matlab and Fragstats were used to calculate seascape metrics (habitat beta-diversity, shape complexity and connectivity). A change detection analysis, comparing the SPOT 7 with an Ikonos image, was utilized to estimate seascape change between 2004 and 2017. Interviews with diving operators were also obtained, to calculate the frequency of visits to different reefs within the CRNP. A weighted overlay analysis, integrating the metrics mentioned above, was used to identify priority areas for conservation. We identified five areas, where management strategies need to be strengthened (e.g. limiting the number of visitors). The current subzonation of the protected area does not reflect the conservation priorities identified by our analysis. However, given that the CRNP management plan is in the process of being updated, the obtained results can help the CRNP managers improve the conservation efforts based on a systematic and robust approach, ensuring the design and implementation of cost-effective strategies for the conservation of the MPA.

TI  - Evaluating impacts to Florida panther habitat: How porous is the umbrella?
T2  - SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST

KW  - FORESTS
AB  - The endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi) shares its shrinking habitat with agriculture, surface mining, and rapid urban growth. Although panthers have extensive home ranges and use diverse land covers, methods that dominate panther habitat evaluation for Endangered Species Act (ESA) consultations and regional land use planning consider only forested day-use elements within the landscape mosaic. Maehr and Deason (2002) present a Panther Habitat Evaluation Model (PHEM) that, in addition to excluding nonforested habitat, reduces the assessed value of forest patches based on criteria for patch size, forest type, proximity to a "core" area, and connectivity to other patches. An examination of the foundations of PHEM is therefore warranted. Building oil earlier work that included an evaluation of panther habitat selection studies (Comiskey et al. 2002), we examine PHEM in light of data quality criteria and the panther's known life history requirements. We conclude that the precepts and rules of the PHEM methodology are based on unwarranted assumptions, nonstandard methods of analysis, and exclusion of relevant data, leading to an undue emphasis on day-use land cover and forest patches larger than 500 ha. Large areas of southern Florida that have abundant prey and are intensively used by panthers would score low in PHEM habitat assessments because they lack large forest patches. We discuss the conservation implications of applying a methodology that discounts substantial portions of Occupied panther habitat as unsuitable, and describe all alternative approach to habitat definition and evaluation that is both consistent with panther habitat requirements and applicable to conservation decision-making. Conserving sufficient habitat for recovery of the panther extends an umbrella of protection to the many species that dwell within its range.

AB  - Background: Long-term expatriates from low to high tuberculosis (TB) incidence countries get high rates of active TB and latent TB infection (LTBI). TB screening for expatriates is important for occupational health. Interferon-gamma release assays are more accurate than tuberculin skin test (TST). Rifapentine plus isoniazid for 3 months (3HP) is as effective as 9 months of isoniazid (9H) with a higher treatment-completion rate.
   Methods: Decision trees and Markov models were constructed using a societal perspective on a lifetime horizon. The target population was a hypothetical cohort of 30 year-old expatriates. Seven strategies; TST with 3HP or 9H, QuantiFERON (R)-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) with 3HP or 9H, T-SPOT (R).TB (TSPOT) with 3HP or 9H and chest X-ray examination (CXR) were modeled. The main outcome measure of effectiveness was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained.
   Results: QFT with 3HP yielded the greatest benefits with the lowest cost ($US 674.8; 25.95660 QALYs [year 2012 value]). CXR was the least cost-effective ($US 13,666.8; 24.62917 QALYs). Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to adherence rate of 3HP and QFT specificity, but not to BCG vaccination rate.
   Conclusions: Entry LTBI screening using QFT treated with 3HP is recommended on the basis of cost effectiveness among long-term expatriates from low to high incidence countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soils and sediments downstream of Midland, Michigan, USA have elevated polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDF) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) concentrations. To determine if the PCDD/DF concentrations have the potential to adversely affect terrestrial avian predators, a site-specific, multiple lines of evidence risk assessment was conducted for the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus; GHO). As long-lived resident top predators, the GHO has the potential to be exposed to relatively great concentrations of bioaccumulative compounds such as PCDD/DF. From 2005 to 2008, concentrations of PCDD/DF were measured in blood plasma of adult and nestling GHOs and addled eggs. Indicators of the condition of the population, including abundance and reproductive success, were collected along 115 km of river corridor. Fifty-five active 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) equivalents (TEQ(WHO-Avia)) nests were monitored in 21 breeding territories from 2005 to 2008. The geometric mean concentration in blood plasma of GHOs was greater in the study area (SA) than in the reference area (RA) for both adults (RA: 3.1; SA: 9.4 ng TEQ(WHO-Avian)/kg) and nestlings (RA: 0.82 ng TEQ(WHO-Avian)/kg, SA: 2.1 ng TEQ(WHO-Avian)/kg) GHOs, but less than concentrations expected to cause adverse effects based on laboratory studies. Concentrations of TEQ(WHO-Avian) in addled GHO eggs were also greater in the SA than the RA (50 and 7.3 ng/kg, wet weight, respectively), but were less than concentrations expected to cause adverse effects. The GHO population condition and productivity were both greater in the study area than in the reference area and were similar to other GHO populations. This result suggests the GHO population in the Tittabawassee River floodplain is consistent with what would be expected for this area. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2010;29:2341-2349. (C) 2010 SETAC

AB  - The Sunda stink-badger Mydaus javanensis is a small carnivore inhabiting the Southeast Asian islands of Borneo, Java, Sumatra, and the Natuna Archipelago. Documented sightings are relatively common, yet the species' behavioural ecology remains poorly understood. Whilst the species is reported to be broadly nocturnal, its detailed activity pattern has never been quantified. This study analysed photographic events from a large scale, long-term camera trapping study to assess times of activity for the Sunda stink-badger. The study took place within the lowland riparian forest corridor of the Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary (LKWS) in the Northeast Bornean state of Sabah. Through 2010-2015, 24,506 potential trap nights collected 2,268 Sunda stink-badger images across 470 unique events. Sunda stink-badger activity pattern was modelled using kernel density estimation, and indicated a highly nocturnal activity pattern with no detected activity during the diurnal hours, consistent with previous records. All photographs were taken between 1839 hours and 0627 hours, and modelling indicated two clear peaks in nocturnal activity, the first at 2100 hours and the second at 0500 hours. Overlap in activity patterns was found to be high (>= 80%) between wet and dry seasons, and also between moon phases, indicating a lack of seasonal or lunar effects on Sunda stink-badger activity. An encounter rate of 1.92 unique Sunda stink-badger events per 100 potential trap nights was recorded for the LKWS. This encounter rate was lower than those found in other regional studies with lower levels of anthropogenic disturbance, suggesting extensive anthropogenic disturbance may pose a potential negative impact to the species. Whilst activity patterns derived from camera trapping are restricted to movement through the environment, these results have established a baseline for Sunda stink-badger activity patterns within a fragmented habitat subjected to high levels of anthropogenic disturbance, and have improved the basic ecological understanding of the species.

AB  - In the Brazilian Pantanal, wildfire occurrence has increased, reaching record highs of over 40,000 km2 in 2020. Smoke from wildfires worsened the situation of isolated, as well as urban communities, already under an increasing toll of COVID-19. Here we review the impacts and the possible causes of the 2020 mega-fires and recommend improvements for public policies and fire management in this wetland. We calculated the amount of area burnt annually since 2003 and describe patterns in precipitation and water level measurements of the Paraguay River. Our analyses revealed that the 2020 wildfires were historically unprecedented, as 43% of the area (over 17,200 km2) had not been burnt previously in the last two decades. The extent of area affected in 2020 represents a 376% increase compared to the annual average of the area burnt annually in the last two decades, double than the value in 2019. Potential factors responsible for this increase are (i) severe drought decreased water levels, (ii) the fire corridor was located in the Paraguay River flood zone, (iii) constraints on firefighters, (iv) insufficient fire prevention strategy and agency budget reductions, and (v) recent landscape changes. Climate and land use change will further increase the frequency of these extreme events. To make fire management more efficient and cost-effective, we recommend the implementation of an Integrated Fire Management program in the Pantanal. Stakeholders should use existing traditional, local ecological, and scientific knowledge to form a collective strategy with clear, achievable, measurable goals, considering the socio-ecological context. Permanent fire brigades, including indigenous members, should conduct year-round fire management. Communities should cooperate to create a collaborative network for wildfire prevention, the location and characteristics (including flammability) of infrastructures should be (re)planned in fire-prone environments considering and managing fire-catalysed transitions, and depending on the severity of wildfires. The 2020 wildfires were tackled in an ad-hoc fashion and prioritisation of areas for urgent financial investment, management, protection, and restoration is necessary to prevent this catastrophe from happening again.

AB  - Birds of conservation concern breed in suburban greenways, yet abundant populations of mammals that depredate bird nests might reduce nest success. We evaluated how three factors influenced the abundance of mammalian nest Predators in thirty-four 300-m long forested greenway segments in Raleigh and Cary, North Carolina, USA: (1) the width of the forested corridor containing the greenway, (2) the land-use adjacent to the forested corridor, and (3) the habitat structure within the greenway. Forest corridor width and adjacent land-use were measured using aerial photographs. Attributes of adjacent land use included categorical measures of development intensity (low-density residential, high-density residential, office/institutional), and the proportions of forest canopy, grass, buildings, and pavement. Several measures of habitat structure within the greenway were collected in the field, including trail width and surface type, and percentage of mature forest. We measured the relative abundance of mammalian nest predators with scent-station transects, operated for five nights during the 2002 breeding bird season.
   Total abundance of mammalian nest predators increased significantly as forest corridor width decreased. We found no relationship between categorical measures of land-use and total abundance of mammalian nest predators. Specific attributes of the landscape adjacent to the greenway, however, did have an effect. Greenways adjacent to landscapes with fewer buildings had a higher abundance of mammalian nest predators. The abundance of individual species varied with the amount of canopy,)awn, and pavement in the adjacent landscape. Some measures of habitat structure of greenways also were correlated with the abundance of mammalian nest predators. Greenway segments with wider trails had a higher abundance of mammalian nest predators, as did segments with a higher percentage of mature forest. No habitat structure variables were significant for all species.
   To reduce the overall risk of avian nest predation by mammals, forested greenways should be designed with wider forest corridors and narrower, unpaved trails. Some greenway characteristics that favor high-nest predator populations also favor birds of conservation concern. Similarly, some characteristics correlated with lower predator occurrence are also correlated with lower abundance of birds of conservation concern. Thus, management of greenways and the surrounding landscape must balance reduction of predator communities with the promotion of desired bird communities and other conservation goals.

AB  - The review discusses the potential of mechanized thinning operations with variable corridor patterns as a method to secure multiple ecosystem services. The focus is on young and dense forests, which are increasingly abundant in Northern Europe and a potential source of renewable biomass for the needs of future bioeconomy. Conventional selective (motor-manual) pre-commercial thinning (PCT) without outtake of cut biomass is used as a benchmark to evaluate a new mechanized thinning method: boom corridor thinning (BCT). The paucity of specific studies on the environmental effects of BCT limits systematic and quantitative comparisons. However, information extrapolated from studies on selective or other corridor thinnings suggests that BCT potentiates early outtake of forest biomass for energy or biorefineries while simultaneously maintaining the stand structure's vertical heterogeneity and thereby supporting biodiversity. More experimental evidence is urgently needed to elucidate the detailed environmental consequences of BCT, and especially its effects on biodiversity and carbon balance. The increasing need to evaluate the pros and cons of silvicultural operations against a broad range of ecosystem benefits necessitates a holistic approach and the development of new typologies and indices that better reflect the structural properties of forest stands.

AB  - Riparian vegetation depends on hydrological resources and has to adapt to changes in water levels and soil moisture conditions. The origin and mixing of water in the streamside corridor were studied in detail. The development of riparian woodland often reflects the evolution of hydrological events. River water levels and topography are certainly the main causes of the exchange between groundwater and river water through the riverbank. Stable isotopes, such as 180, are useful tools that allow water movement to be traced. Two main water sources are typically present: (i) river water, depleted of heavy isotopes, originating upstream, and (ii) groundwater, which comes mainly from the local rainfall. On the Garonne River bank field site downstream of Toulouse, the mixing of these two waters is variable, and depends mainly on the river level and the geographical position. The output of the groundwater into the river water is not diffuse on a large scale, but localised at few places.
   At the confluence of two rivers, the water-mixing area is more complex because of the presence of a third source of water. In this situation, groundwater supports the hydrologic pressure of both rivers until they merge, this pressure could influence its outflow. Two cases will be presented. The first is the confluence of the Garonne and the Ariege Rivers in the south-west of France, both rivers coming from the slopes of the Pyrenees mountains. Localised groundwater outputs have been detected about 200 m before the confluence. The second case presented is the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamuna Rivers in the north of India, downstream of the city of Allahabad. These rivers are the two main tributaries of the Ganges, and both originate in the Himalayas. A strong stream of groundwater output was measured at the point of confluence. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Human interventions that limit channel mobility such as bank stabilization are frequent in riparian zones in urban or agricultural environments. This is potentially problematic because channel mobility is an important geomorphological and ecological agent that structures natural instream and riparian ecosystems. This study aims to (1) quantify the relationship between mobility and three types of habitat-related features, namely bars, oxbow lakes and log jams, for a 54-km-long reach of the Yamaska Sud-Est River (Quebec, Canada), which runs from the forested Appalachian Mountains to the agricultural St-Lawrence lowlands, and (2) evaluate the impact of human interventions and geomorphological characteristics on these three features. Channel mobility was measured from historical aerial photos for the period 1950-2009. A combination of high-resolution aerial photos, LiDAR digital elevation model, and field observations was used to measure and map sediment bars, oxbow lakes and log jams, as well as several geomorphological characteristics (channel width, slope, sinuosity and floodplain width). A strong link between the mobility and the presence of habitat features is revealed, but local geomorphological contexts result in different mobility patterns responsible for specific habitats. Floodplain to channel width ratio appears as the best geomorphological factor predicting habitat diversity. Human intervention, mostly through bank stabilization, also appears to be a key factor limiting mobility and its related habitats. These results highlight the importance of defining a protected mobility corridor along rivers where geomorphic processes such as bank erosion can freely occur, as it is an essential process that should be integrated in land use planning and river management.

AB  - Indirect biotic interactionssuch as intransitive competitionare increasingly recognized as being important in shaping ecological patterns in natural systems. Over long time-scales, such indirect interactions may affect the evolution of species phenotypes, which in turn can modify these interactions, thereby begetting eco-evolutionary feedbacks. If indirect intransitive interactions can emerge in situ during lineage diversification, they could profoundly affect species' phenotypic diversity, temporal stability, and subsequent diversification rates. We address these questions by investigating the conditions under which indirect intransitive competition can emerge from a lineage diversifying in sympatry. We use an adaptive dynamics model to study the ecological and evolutionary properties of this lineage under different scenarios where competition for resources between phenotypes varies in strength and (a)symmetry. Results show that weak-intransitive competition can emerge during the sympatric diversification of a single lineage. Weak-intransitivity here refers to situations where species interactions are not perfectly transitive, that is, there is no strict hierarchy in species competitive abilities. The strength of such weak-intransitivity increases when the competition between phenotypes increases in strength and asymmetry. The strength of intransitivity also correlates with other system properties. We notably found that the strength of intransitivity increases with the number of phenotypes, and that greater intransitivity correlates with the evolution of greater functional trait divergences between phenotypes, greater resistance to invasion by new phenotypes but lower resistance to disturbances as well as slower evolutionary rates. Synthesis. This theoretical exploration of the evolution of intransitive competition provides the first formal bridge between the ecological and evolutionary aspects of intransitive competition. We show that, when competitive interactions are strong enough, weak-intransitive competition is more likely to emerge through adaptive diversification than from a random community assembly. Intransitive competition is, therefore, not only restricted to between-species interactions but can also function as a regulator of diversification within species, thereby affecting lineage functional diversity, and ecological and evolutionary stability.

AB  - Guidelines for landscape management acknowledge woodland edges for providing important biological and amenity functions, as well as functional and economical benefits for farmland and forestry production. Afforestation of many areas of European agricultural landscapes, due to changes in agricultural politics, will lead to a considerable increase in woodland edges over the next decades. In many countries this development coincides with an increasing emphasis on the multiple use of forest landscapes, e.g. a combination of recreation, biodiversity and production objectives. The potential role of woodland edges in nature conservation and landscape planning is raised. This paper focuses on woodland edges in agricultural landscapes and examines their major biological and amenity functions in the context of multiple-use management and design. The structural properties important for biological diversity and amenity values are discussed and compared for compatibility. We argue that the factors of greatest significance in determining the functions of woodland edges are width, physical structure and the composition of woody species, as well as their spatial dynamics at both site and landscape levels. Aspects of the design and management of woodland edges to achieve multi-functional objectives are discussed.

AB  - We explored the phylogeographic patterns of intraspecific diversity in the Red-crowned Ant Tanager (Habia rubica) throughout its continent-wide distribution, in order to understand its evolutionary history and the role of evolutionary drivers that are considered to promote avian diversification in the Neotropics. We sampled 100 individuals of H. rubica from Mexico to Argentina covering the main areas of its disjunct distribution. We inferred phylogenetic relationships through Bayesian and maximum parsimony methodologies based on mitochondrial and nuclear markers, and complemented genetic analyses with the assessment of coloration and behavioral differentiation. We found four deeply divergent phylogroups within H. rubica: two South American lineages and two Mexican and Middle American lineages. The divergence event between the northern and southern phylogroups was dated to c. 5.0 Ma, seemingly related to the final uplift of the Northern Andes. Subsequently, the two South American phylogroups split c. 3.5 Ma possibly due to the development of the open vegetation corridor that currently isolates the Amazonian and Atlantic forests. Diversification throughout Mexico and Middle America, following dispersion across the Isthmus of Panama, was presumably more recent and coincident with Pleistocene climatic fluctuations and habitat fragmentations. The analyses of vocalizations and plumage coloration showed significant differences among main lineages that were consistent with the phylogenetic evidence. Our findings suggest that the evolutionary history of H. rubica has been shaped by an assortment of diversification drivers at different temporal and spatial scales resulting in deeply divergent lineages that we recommend should be treated as different species.

AB  - Riverine ecosystems are recurrently rejuvenated during destructive flood events and vegetation succession starts again. Poplars (i.e. species from Populus genera) respond to hydrogeomorphological constraints, but, in turn, also influence these processes. Thus, poplar development on bare mineral substrates is not exclusively a one-way vegetative process. Reciprocal interactions and adjustments between poplar species and sediment dynamics during their life cycle lead to the emergence of biogeomorphological entities within the fluvial corridor, such as vegetated islands, benches and floodplains. Based on a review of geomorphological, biological and ecological literature, we have identified and described the co-constructing processes between riparian poplars and their fluvial environment. We have explored the possibility that the modification of the hydrogeomorphological environment exerted, in particular, by the European black poplar (Populus nigra L.), increases its fitness and thus results in positive niche construction. We focus on the fundamental phases of dispersal, recruitment and establishment until sexual maturity of P. nigra by describing the hierarchy of interactions and the pattern of feedbacks between biotic and abiotic components. We explicitly relate the biological life cycle of P. nigra to the fluvial biogeomorphic succession model by referring to the 'biogeomorphological life cycle' of P. nigra. Finally, we propose new research perspectives based on this theoretical framework. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Landscapes are mosaics of patches that differ in ecologically important properties. The presentation of Romanian landscape will reveal the concepts and characteristics of landscape that aid in understanding and quantifying landscape interaction. The Romanian landscape is characterized by a large biogeographically diversity, with natural resource which constitute a natural heritage able to assure a harmonious and sustainable development of the Country now and in the future. As a consequence of its geographical setting and the evolution of human society in the region, Romania has a unique and high level of biodiversity and intact ecological systems. The extensive range of ecosystems types in Romania is largely the result of the influence of climate and elevation.
   Romania is a meeting place for many ecosystems and a territory through which many species have spread their distribution. The largely unbroken Carpathian mountain chain and the Danube River and its tributaries are particularly important in providing a corridor for spread of biodiversity.

AB  - Landscape fragmentation caused by the main transport infrastructure network in Navarra (north of Spain) is analysed on both regional and local scales. Regional scale analysis identifies the overloaded zones (cloverleaves and corridors) and the territorial imbalance due to transportation infrastructures. In order to achieve an holistic approach. this information could be compared to other fragmentation-related regional activities. The study of the fragmentation caused by the two northern dual carriageways is carried out at a local scale, analysing the surrounding landscape., the potential permeability and the road-kill rates of medium-sized terrestrial wildlife. The black spots and the funnel effect sites are identified. As both regional and local scales are complementary, the two-scale analysis could improve landscape management. Finally, it is concluded that visual landscape study does not guarantee a functional integration. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The basin of the Sinos River, located in the northeastern part of Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, has been highly impacted by industrial and urban activities. Water quality is low because of domestic and industrial sewage discharges. Most of the tributaries have suffered drastic structural interventions like canalisations and the removal of riparian vegetation. The aims of this study were to: 1) assess the diversity of fish at 34 sampling sites in twenty-four tributaries of the Sinos River basin; 2) quantify impact level by the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and an adapted Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI); and 3) check the interference of environmental impacts, formerly quantified in a Stream Corridor Assessment Survey (SCAS), on the fish assembly and 4) compare the relationship between the IBI with stream order. Fish sampling was performed by electric fishing in the period from April 2004 to August 2006. A total of 4,869 individuals were sampled, representing 61 species, 14 families and six orders. Significant relationships of the Shannon-Wiener index and IBI with SCAS scores and stream orders were found. Of all impacts that make up the SCAS score, only channel modifications were significantly correlated with IBI. These results indicate that the adaptation of the IBI was effective and performed better than the Shannon-Wiener diversity index when related directly to specific impact categories. The application of the IBI with the SCAS and the other variables was efficient in the tributaries of the Sinos River basin because it showed the biotic degradation in accordance with changes in physical habitat.

AB  - New major road infrastructure projects are planned or underway across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and are expected to have complex, and often deleterious, impacts on natural ecosystems across the region. For this reason, it is necessary to review evidence of how and through which mechanisms, roads might affect these landscapes. We reviewed 137 peer reviewed articles and documented 271 reported effects of roads and their underlying mechanisms inside and outside protected areas across SSA. Our findings show that (a) the study of the effects of roads on ecosystems in SSA is growing and not limited to the field of road ecology; (b) the negative effects of roads on species were reported at a similar frequency within and outside of protected areas; (c) the road-effect zone varied with effect but typically is between 1 and 7 km for larger mammals; (d) access to surrounding ecosystems through roads was the main mechanism driving effects; studies found accessibility influenced land use patterns and illegal hunting and harvesting; (e) other mechanisms by which roads affect (animal) species include, through functioning as a foraging site, and a habitat, and by acting as barriers to and corridors for movement; and (f) there was far more evidence on how roads can negatively impact ecosystems; in contrast, there was less certainty around mechanisms by which roads had no significant or a positive impact, since many of these were either speculated or unknown. An understanding of the underlying mechanisms can assist researchers and environmental assessment practitioners to predict how and where future road development might drive changes in biodiversity and land cover. Moving forward, we suggest that future research build a better understanding of the cumulative effects on different mammal and non-mammal communities and ecosystems more broadly and examine the socioeconomic contexts that characterize different road impacts in SSA.

AB  - While many avian populations follow narrow, well-defined "migratory corridors," individuals from other populations undertake highly divergent individual migration routes, using widely dispersed stopover sites en route between breeding and wintering areas, although the reasons for these differences are rarely investigated. We combined individual GPS-tracked migration data from Mongolian-breeding common shelduck Tadorna tadorna and remote sensing datasets, to investigate habitat selection at inland stopover sites used by these birds during dispersed autumn migration, to explain their divergent migration patterns. We used generalized linear mixed models to investigate population-level resource selection, and generalized linear models to investigate stopover-site-level resource selection. The population-level model showed that water recurrence had the strongest positive effect on determining birds' occupancy at staging sites, while cultivated land and grassland land cover type had strongest negative effects; effects of other land cover types were negative but weaker, particularly effects of water seasonality and presence of a human footprint, which were positive but weak or non-significant, respectively. Although stopover-site-level models showed variable resource selection patterns, the variance partitioning and cross-prediction AUC scores corroborated high inter-individual consistency in habitat selection at inland stopover sites during the dispersed autumn migration. These results suggest that the geographically widespread distribution (and generally rarity) of suitable habitats explained the spatially divergent autumn migrations of Mongolian breeding common shelduck, rather than the species showing flexible autumn staging habitat occupancy.

AB  - Shifts in the geographic distribution of habitats over time can promote dispersal and vicariance, thereby influencing large-scale biogeographic patterns and ecological processes. An example is that of transient corridors of suitable habitat across disjunct but ecologically similar regions, which have been associated with climate change over time. Such connections likely played a role in the assembly of tropical communities, especially within the highly diverse Amazonian and Atlantic rainforests of South America. Although these forests are presently separated by open and dry ecosystems, paleoclimatic and phylogenetic evidence suggest that they have been transiently connected in the past. However, little is known about the timing, magnitude and the distribution of former forest connections. We employ sequence data at multiple loci from three codistributed arboreal lizards (Anolis punctatus, Anolis ortonii and Polychrus marmoratus) to infer the phylogenetic relationships among Amazonian and Atlantic Forest populations and to test alternative historical demographic scenarios of colonization and vicariance using coalescent simulations and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). Data from the better-sampled Anolis species support colonization of the Atlantic Forest from eastern Amazonia. Hierarchical ABC indicates that the three species colonized the Atlantic Forest synchronously during the mid-Pleistocene. We find support of population bottlenecks associated with founder events in the two Anolis, but not in P. marmoratus, consistently with their distinct ecological tolerances. Our findings support that climatic fluctuations provided key opportunities for dispersal and forest colonization in eastern South America through the cessation of environmental barriers. Evidence of species-specific histories strengthens assertions that biological attributes play a role in responses to shared environmental change.

AB  - Equids are among the most common mammals found in faunal assemblages of Late Pleistocene age in Mexico. Much of what is known about the Equus species is the result of studies conducted in central and northern Mexico; much less is known about species in lower latitudes of Mexico. Here we describe three species that inhabited Oaxaca and Chiapas states. The fossil localities are in northwestern and central Oaxaca, as well as the central part of Chiapas. In Oaxaca, the largest species, Equus mexicanus, and the medium-sized Equus conversidens are represented by mandibles, skulls, diverse isolated teeth and some postcranial bones, while the smallest species, Haringtonhippus francisci is represented by a skull fragment and few isolated teeth. In Chiapas, E. mexicanus is represented by a mandible and several isolated teeth, E. conversidens by several mandibles and diverse isolated teeth, and H. francisci by isolated teeth and two mandibles. AMS radiocarbon and uranium dating of some of the equid localities in Oaxaca and Chiapas indicate that they were at least present since similar to 44,000 Cal BP years, they were common around 30,000 Cal BP years, and were still present at the end of the Pleistocene, around 12,000 years ago. The record of H. francisci from Chiapas is the youngest in North America. A cluster analysis of extended mesowear data and a discriminant analysis showed that Equus conversidens from Chiapas was obligate grazer, whilst the rest of the equids were variable grazers. Geographic distribution of localities in southern Mexico indicates that during the Pleistocene the equid species moved across the Transvolcanic Belt-Sierra Madre del Sur temperate biogeographic corridor and the Tamaulipas-Central America Gulf Lowlands tropical corridor.

AB  - New, productive fluvial marshes may develop along regulated canyon rivers through reduction in flood frequency, thereby increasing diversity, production, and wildlife habitat availability. Few fluvial marshes occurred along the eddy-dominated Colorado River in the Grand Canyon prior to construction of Glen Canyon Dam in 1963. Reduction of flooding after 1963 permitted widespread marsh development. Fluvial marshes exhibited low stability but high resilience, quickly redeveloping after scouring by high flows between 1983 and 1986. In 1991, 253 fluvial wet marshes (cattail/reed and horseweed/Bermuda-grass) and 850 dry marshes (horsetail/willow) occupied 25.0 ha (1%) of the 363 km mainstream riparian corridor between Lees Ferry and Diamond Creek, Arizona.
   Fluvial marsh development and composition Varied in relation to local and reach-based geomorphology, and microsite gradients in inundation frequency and soil texture. Colorado River marsh density (number/km(2)) increased with distance downstream, and marshes were larger and more abundant in wide reaches. Wet marsh cattail/reed stands developed on silty loam soils in low velocity depositional environments that were inundated 54% of the days from 1986 to 1991, whereas dry horsetail/willow marshes occupied less frequently inundated sites with sandy soils. Mean marsh standing mass (641 g C/m(2)) was comparable with values from regulated alluvial river marshes, but litter retention appeared limited by flow variability in both regulated and unregulated fluvial marshes. We discuss implications of flow management on the four marsh assemblages, and the need for consensus on priorities for management of regulated fluvial wetlands.

AB  - It has been suggested that differences in body size between consumer and resource species may have important implications for interaction strengths, population dynamics, and eventually food web structure, function, and evolution. Still, the general distribution of consumer-resource body-size ratios in real ecosystems, and whether they vary systematically among habitats or broad taxonomic groups, is poorly understood. Using a unique global database on consumer and resource body sizes, we show that the mean bodysize ratios of aquatic herbivorous and detritivorous consumers are several orders of magnitude larger than those of carnivorous predators. Carnivorous predator-prey body-size ratios vary across different habitats and predator and prey types (invertebrates, ectotherm, and endotherm vertebrates). Predator-prey body-size ratios are on average significantly higher (1) in freshwater habitats than in marine or terrestrial habitats, (2) for vertebrate than for invertebrate predators, and (3) for invertebrate than for ectotherm vertebrate prey. If recent studies that relate body-size ratios to interaction strengths are general, our results suggest that mean consumer-resource interaction strengths may vary systematically across different habitat categories and consumer types.

AB  - The dire wolf was one of the successful top predators in North America during the Pleistocene. It is best known from the southern part of North America, and it even immigrated to South America. Fossils of dire wolves are very rare north of 42- North latitude in North America. That distribution supported the belief that the low temperatures and ice sheets in the higher latitudes of North American formed an insurmountable barrier for the dispersal of dire wolves. Here we report the first record of the dire wolf fossil in Eurasia. The fossil is a partial mandibular fragment with a tooth recovered from a Late Pleistocene underwater sand mine site near the city of Harbin in Northeastern China. Other mammalian fossils from the same site suggest that this dire wolf coexisted with the typical Mammuthus-Coelodonta fauna of Eurasia. The newly discovered specimen has a huge m1; much larger than gray wolves and other large canids from the same region. The massive m1 trigonid accounts for a high percentage of its overall length. The m1 talonid is reduced, but retains a small entoconid. The m2-3 alveoli suggest that the two teeth were smaller than those of the gray wolf. The combination of these morphologies is present only in the dire wolf. When the body mass spectra of medium and large-bodied carnivores from Asia and North America were compared, the Asian dire wolf occupies a position nearly overlapping the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta ultima). During the Late Pleistocene, C. crocuta ultima was one of the most widely distributed and dominant carnivores in Asia. Competition from hyenas may have kept dire wolf Asian populations at very low levels leading to their rarity as fossils rare in Asia.

AB  - Floristic and structural patterns of a forest fragment in the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. Urban areas result in fragmentation, species loss and ecosystem changes. However, natural ecosystem remnants in urban zones may be refuges or corridors for many species. This study presents floristic and structural features of the tree and understory strata of an urban forest fragment in Cachoeirinha, Rio Grande do Sul. Ninety tree and 15 shrub species were recorded, of which two were endangered, two protected, and nine exotic. In the quantitative sample, 54 species were contemplated in the tree stratum and 45 in the understory. The fragment is characterized as a Semideciduous Seasonal Forest and presents high tree species diversity, reflecting density evenness. Structurally, there are no features of a more conserved core area, although some species tend to occur close to the edges. We believe that conserving semi-natural urban areas like this contributes to maintaining habitats, species diversity, and connectivity among forest remnants in the regional extent, because it maintains the features of the regional forests, including the flora.

AB  - A population survey during the general flowering (GF) of the critically endangered ornamental tree species locally known as Philippine teak (Tectona philippinensis Benth. & Hook. f., Lamiaceae) was conducted in four adjoining municipalities and across 14 barangays of Lobo in southern Batangas, Philippines in 2008. During the mass flowering episode of Philippine teak, 4,479 trees were counted based on plotless-ocular canopy density count. Natural population was pictured along coastal forests, littoral cliffs and inland exposed limestone ridges (5-200 m above sea level) in the municipality of Lobo (2,963) and adjoining Batangas City (946), Taysan (98) and San Juan (464). At least 62% (170 of 275 individuals) in the sampled habitats belonged to large diameter at breast height (DBH) class-size that exhibits GF. Flowering in at least >30 cm DBH class was observed during the arrival of the northeast monsoon in June until mid-July while masting started in August and drupes matured in September. Vegetative phenology (major leaf flushing) was observed from September to January until the population became leafless snags in summer.

AB  - A number of forests in agroforestry environments are at risk due to urban development or agricultural expansion. These forests often consist of patches of wooded areas scattered in the agricultural and urban grid, and often constitute green corridors that enable a flow between animal and plant species (migration corridors). This study evaluates the composition and structure of riparian forests in agroforestry areas that are subject to various natural and anthropogenic disturbances. This study aims to understand the dynamics of these riparian forest populations and evaluate the effects of the disturbances on the tree stands (e.g. floods, partial cutting), while taking into account their development over space and time based on a diachronic assessment from 1945 to 2010. Although these woodlands are subject to various disturbances, a fairly large diversity of tree species can be noted, and the regeneration of the saplings and small trees follows a normal growth curve (asymmetric) with a high contingency of young tree population comparable to a typical reverse-J distribution. However, lower densities are observed for riparian stands subject to frequent flooding, which could over time compromise recruitment and forest regeneration for some tree species (e.g. woody plants with weak adaptive strategies). The multivariate analyses (Redundancy Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis) conducted over all the soil, environmental and forest data reveal that some variables are more strongly related to the composition of the forest populations, including pH, ground litter and soil drainage. However, these variables must still be considered as being part of a set of interacting soil conditions. Lastly, the future of these woodlands may appear uncertain because there are no government policies or measures to ensure their protection and preservation.

AB  - As part of an Urban Buzz scheme, strips of teasel (Dipsacus fullonum) and greater knapweed (Centaurea scabiosa) have been established along a sea wall flood defense in the UK to provide a corridor of flower-rich habitat for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The cutting of tall grassland and planting of dicotyledons also created a suitable short sward environment (c. 30 cm height) for Orthoptera nymphs in the establishment year (2018). I lowever, by 2019, the grassland in the pollinator strips was taller (c. 75 cm) and suboptimal for grasshoppers; in contrast to Roesel's bushcricket (Roeseliana roeselii), which inhabited the taller vegetation in greater abundance. The progression to established grassland with flowering D. fut.lonztm saw the pollinator strips attract significantly higher numbers of bees and butterflies than the floristically poor control strips. This small-scale study illustrates that pollinator strips can have multi-functional benefits for ecosystems beyond pollination, with Orthoptera of tall grassland (R. roeselii) likely to persist alongside planted wildflowers.

AB  - Sparrows have colonized areas modified by humans since the onset of agriculture and seed storage. In fact, present day distributions of the sparrow populations are directly related to urban areas, farms and villages. Consequently the sedentary behaviour of sparrows, in pristine areas, with low densities of specimens, can act as a barrier to gene flow among populations. We analyzed the genetic variability and gene flow rates in four Italian sparrow populations sampled in areas affected by different levels of human activity Population variability was analyzed by DNA fingerprinting with M13 multilocus minisatellite probe, which yielded multibanded fingerprints (the average number of bands was 25, ranging in size from 23 kb to 0.3 kb). The population located within the pristine area of the Cilento-Vallo di Diano National Park (San Marco) showed the higher value of within-population similarity (Sw = 0.73). This suggests a probable higher level of inbreeding in comparison with the other localities. The genetic isolation of the San Marco population is also imputable to the between-populations similarity values (Sb), that seem to be related with a preferential direction of gene circulation along urbanised corridors. The results show that population variability and gene flow rate in the Italian sparrow are directly related to the presence of urbanised areas. The results also show that the M13 multilocus fingerprinting probe represents a advantageous marker for the detection of genetic variability within a small geographical scale in passerine birds.

AB  - An extractive industries boom in Africa is driving unprecedented expansion of infrastructure into sparsely populated regions. Much of the investment is in high-volume minerals such as iron and coal that will require heavy infrastructure and large settled workthrces. New roads and railways are being built to support these industries. Mineral infrastructure is reinforcing the dynamic of designated "growth corridors", which are increasingly determining settlement patterns and rural land use in Africa. These corridors are penetrating into areas where agriculture has been constrained by lack of access to markets. They could unleash a major expansion of arable crops in the Guinea and Miombo savannahs, tropical tree crops in Congo Basin rainforests and irrigated agriculture on the floodplains of several African river systems. Rapidly growing African cities are largely dependent on imported food but growth corridors linking them Lo hinterland areas could favour shifts Lo African-sourced foods. Governance weaknesses may allow outside investors to make land grabs along growth corridors and further marginalise poor smallholders. New pressures on environmentally sensitive areas may emerge. Policy changes are needed to avoid negative impacts of this major new development trend and to exploft the potential for poverty alleviation and food-security benefits. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With the rapid growth of agricultural areas globally, forest birds increasingly encounter fragmented landscapes in which forest patches are surrounded by an agricultural plantation matrix, yet how birds respond behaviourally to this fragmentation is poorly understood. Information on microhabitat requirements of birds is scarce, but nevertheless essential to predicting adaptation of bird species to the patchy landscapes. We investigated foraging patterns of three tropical insectivorous birds, Green bra Aegithina viridissima, Pin-striped Tit-Babbler Macronus gularis and Chestnut-winged Babbler Cyanoderma erythropterum, to determine whether they vary in foraging methods in different forest patches. Our study area encompassed old-logged lowland forest; one continuous forest and three forest patches. Observations were performed for 15 days every month for a period of 13 months. Information on foraging height, substrate, attack manoeuvres, and foliage density was collected independently for each foraging bird individual. All three species used different foraging substrates and attack manoeuvres in different habitat types. The Green bra frequently used lower strata when foraging in forest patches as opposed to continuous forest, while the Pin-striped Tit-Babbler tended to forage in more dense vegetation in patches. Only Chestnut-winged Babbler displayed complete foraging plasticity across all study parameters. Different habitat features (e.g., edges, microclimates) between continuous forest and forest patches significantly influenced the foraging strategies of the study species. These changes in foraging strategies suggest that some Malaysian forest birds (e.g. generalist species) can respond behaviourally to fragmentation and habitat loss. Although continuous forest has critically important characteristics that need to be conserved, remnant forest patches are also important as ecological movement corridors and foraging grounds for birds.

AB  - Animal movement along repeatedly used, "habitual " routes could emerge from a variety of cognitive mechanisms, as well as in response to a diverse set of environmental features. Because of the high conservation value of identifying wildlife movement corridors, there has been extensive work focusing on environmental factors that contribute to the emergence of habitual routes between protected habitats. In parallel, significant work has focused on disentangling the cognitive mechanisms underlying animal route use, as such movement patterns are of fundamental interest to the study of decision making and navigation. We reviewed the types of processes that can generate routine patterns of animal movement, suggested a new methodological workflow for classifying one of these patterns-high fidelity path reuse-in animal tracking data, and compared the prevalence of this pattern across four sympatric species of frugivorous mammals in Panama. We found the highest prevalence of route-use in kinkajous, the only nocturnal species in our study, and propose that further development of this method could help to distinguish the processes underlying the presence of specific routes in animal movement data.

AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of respiratory mortality worldwide. Genetic risk loci provide new insights into disease pathogenesis. We performed a genome-wide association study in 35,735 cases and 222,076 controls from the UK Biobank and additional studies from the International COPD Genetics Consortium. We identified 82 loci associated with P < 5 x 10(-8); 47 of these were previously described in association with either COPD or population-based measures of lung function. Of the remaining 35 new loci, 13 were associated with lung function in 79,055 individuals from the SpiroMeta consortium. Using gene expression and regulation data, we identified functional enrichment of COPD risk loci in lung tissue, smooth muscle, and several lung cell types. We found 14 COPD loci shared with either asthma or pulmonary fibrosis. COPD genetic risk loci clustered into groups based on associations with quantitative imaging features and comorbidities. Our analyses provide further support for the genetic susceptibility and heterogeneity of COPD.

AB  - In this paper we endeavor to test the controversial ideas that exist about the role of fragmentation in a conservation context. In line with earlier understanding, we find that habitat fragmentation alone results in a strong detrimental effect (especially for the predator population). Connecting the fragmented habitats facilitates predator survival and hence prey survival as compared to the unconnected fragmented case. Our main result is counterintuitive: in the presence of a high quality predator, connected fragmented habitats ensure a better chance for coexistence than does even the unfragmented case. We explain why a connected fragmented habitat might thus be beneficial for the stabilization of the system, and how connections between sub-habitats are able to protect prey population from over-exploitation. In the model, habitat fragmentation is separated from the effects of habitat destruction, in order to better understand how populations react to habitat transformation. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM.

AB  - Breeding birds in forest ecosystems are generally diverse, habitat selective, and easily sampled. Because they must integrate environmental variables over space and time, local populations of forest birds (like other animal and plant taxa) may provide meaningful signals of local forest health or degradation. We evaluated 949 breeding bird surveys in areas ranging from degraded urban/suburban forest remnants to relatively pristine old growth forests in the western Laurentian Great Lakes region of North America. The "human footprint'' across this landscape was represented by a one-dimensional numeric gradient derived from land cover variables, forest fragmentation metrics, and publicly available data on housing density and transportation corridors. We used an iterative, maximum likelihood approach to quantify species-specific responses to this human disturbance gradient. Many species showed significant directional responses, consistent with known life history attributes. Other species were most commonly detected at intermediate levels of anthropogenic disturbance, yielding unimodal responses. Relationships between the "human footprint'' and occurrences of 38 bird species were illustrated by general Gaussian functions that represented both unidirectional and unimodal patterns. These biotic response (BR) functions were combined into a bird-based index of ecological condition (IEC) ranging from 0 (maximally degraded) to 10 (minimally degraded). We described a successful application of the IEC method at the Wild Rivers Legacy Forest (WRLF), a >260 km(2) conservation landscape in northeastern Wisconsin, USA, managed primarily under a working forest conservation easement established in 2006. In general, areas within the WRLF yielded high IEC values (7.0-9.0), but nearby forest areas not under the conservation easement were characterized by significantly lower IEC values based on breeding bird assemblages.

FX  - This project was a collaboration involving the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay (UW-Green Bay), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and Timber Investment Management Organizations (TIMOs). Data used in our analysis came from many other contributors representing the U.S. Forest Service, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Marshfield Clinic, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and volunteer birders in Wisconsin and Michigan. The original IEC model was developed in collaboration with Gerald Niemi and others at the Natural Resources Research Institute at the University of Minnesota Duluth, particularly Nick Danz, Ron Regal, JoAnn Hanowski, and Terry Brown. We are very grateful for research funding provided by TNC and UW-Green Bay's Cofrin Center for Biodiversity (CCB) and Department of Natural and Applied Sciences and for administrative support provided by the UW-Green Bay and CCB.

AB  - The fourth industrial revolution (Industrie 4.0) is distinguished by a growing network and intelligence of machines, products, services and data. This results in new business models and value chains, but also various risks, e.g. by hacker attacks, data theft or manipulation. Many companies consider Industrie 4.0 much as a security challenge other than an opportunity or enabler for new business models. Therefore, effective security methods to protect the Industrie 4.0 systems and its associated values and assets are needed. One of the aims of Industrie 4.0 is identifying and developing new, appropriate security practices for enterprises and especially for their production systems. Based on the connectivity infrastructure in the shop floor, the diversity in the corporate landscape of the global mechanical and plant engineering ultimately causes that every company has to develop its own way of IT and production security management.
   In the context of Industrie 4.0, an integral concept is needed, that connects the requirements from manufacturing automation and mechanical engineering to process engineering with the properties of cyber-physical systems as an Industrie 4.0 component and well-established core elements of IT security descriptions. Standards from industry associations and standardization committees have to be included.
   In this paper, a process model is developed, which consults RAMI 4.0 and well-established core elements of safety and IT security considering the standards IEC 61508 and IEC 62443. A use case driven approach is developed with the goal to demonstrate the functionalities and validation of the process model. In different iterations, the dynamic change of the system by mapping IT security requirements on system assets and processes will be presented. The purpose of the developed process model is to assign security measures to vulnerabilities and threats of a system for Industrie 4.0. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The IUNO research project identifies threats and risks for the intelligent factory, develops protective measures, and implements them in four use cases. One of the use cases is to develop a secure technology data marketplace focus on secure data. The aim is to develop a general-purpose solutions as possible to meet the challenges of IT security in the industrial application field. The tested and transferable IT security solutions are combined into a toolbox.

AB  - We describe a new species of scincid lizard of the genus Brachymeles from montane forests (1400-1450 m) of Mt. Palali, Caraballo Mountain Range, in central Luzon Island, Philippines. The new species is the second known species of Brachymeles that has only three digits on both the forelimb and hindlimbs. Additional morphological characters include unique scales pigmentation and absence of a pineal eyespot and an auricular opening. The new species is the eighth known Brachymeles from Luzon Island and the twelfth non-pentadactyl species. With this new discovery, the Luzon Faunal Region holds the greatest diversity of species of the genus Brachymeles in the world.

AB  - Extensive acreage loss of coastal sage scrub (CSS), isolation of surviving stands, and the federal listing of several animal species with obligate relationships to this plant community, particularly the threatened California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica), have led to attempts to create CSS to mitigate habitat lost to urban development and other causes. Many of these creations lie within habitat conservation plan (HCP) sites, and they could play a more prominent role by being repositories for plants taken from a single site having site-specific genetics.
   Among others, one technique that increases initial resemblance to natural stands uses digitized, to-scale photography, which has been ground-truthed to verify vascular plant associations, which appear as mosaics on a landscape. A combination of placing patches of salvaged, mature canopy plants within larger matrices of imprinted or container plant plots appears to significantly enhance immediate use by CSS obligate bird species, accelerate "spread" or expansion of CSS, and can also introduce many epiphytic taxa that otherwise would be slow or unable to occupy developing CSS creations. Reptile, amphibian, butterfly, and rodent diversity in a salvaged canopy restoration case study at the University of California, Irvine, showed CSS species foraging and inhabiting transplanted canopy patches.
   Using restoration techniques to expand existing CSS stands has more promise than creating isolated patches, and the creation of canopies resembling CSS mid-fire cycle stands is now common. Gnatcatchers and other birds use restorations for foraging and occasional nesting, and in some cases created stands along "biological corridors" appear to be useful to bird movement. Patches of transplanted sage scrub shrubs along habitat edges appear to break up linear edge effects. There are no data on which long-term survival, succession, or postfire behavior can be predicted for CSS restoration sites, and postfire community changes are not part of either mitigation or restoration planning at present. Long-term planning including burning is needed so that a lire-adapted habitat will develop. Restoration is important in retaining genetic resources, for ameliorating edge effects, as habitat extenders in buffer zones around HCP sites, and by providing areas into which natural stands can expand.

AB  - Source types or source regions contributing to the concentration of atmospheric fine particles measured at Brigantine National Wildlife Refuge, NJ, were identified using a factor analysis model called Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF). Cluster analysis of backward air trajectories on days of high- and low-factor concentrations was used to link factors to potential source regions. Brigantine is a Class I visibility area with few local sources in the center of the eastern urban corridor and is therefore a good location to study Mid-Atlantic regional aerosol. Sulfate (expressed as ammonium sulfate) was the most abundant species, accounting for 49% of annual average fine mass. Organic compounds (22%; expressed as 1.4 x organic carbon) and ammonium nitrate (10%) were the next abundant species. Some evidence herein suggests that secondary organic aerosol formation is an important contributor to summertime regional aerosol.

AB  - Asian elephants are threatened throughout their range due to habitat loss, fragmentation, and conflict with humans. Limited data on spatial and temporal use of habitats in largely intact forests by elephants in Sumatra is a major hindrance for conservation and land use planning, and consequently human-elephant conflict mitigation. We analysed GPS data from collared elephants to investigate their use of habitat in relation to available land cover and human disturbance in Aceh, Sumatra, Indonesia. We applied remote sensing techniques to extract environmental variables to use in state-space Hidden Markov Models and integrated Step Selection Function to analyse foraging strategies and land use selectivity, while using dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models and Minimum Convex Polygons to determine used and available habitat features within their home ranges. Our results show that Sumatran elephants in Aceh preferred areas with lower elevation (< 200 m) and slopes (0-10 degrees), with minimal terrain ruggedness, which also happen to be areas selected by humans. Elephants closely adhered to rivers and mountain valleys when utilizing homogenous dense natural forests, and expanded from the rivers in heterogenous forests toward open, resource-dense, land use types. Overall, slope, vegetation, and human disturbance had the largest impact on each of the clans' foraging strategies. Areas closer to human settlements were used more by night and less by day, indicating that human presence and activities influence elephant habitat use and avoidance. Our findings conclude future management decisions should focus on protecting the remaining lowland forests and preventing further urban encroachment in areas with lower elevation and slope, particularly in proximity to rivers which act as corridors between natural habitats, in order to mitigate human-elephant conflict and protect the species from extinction.

AB  - The African leopard (Panthera pardus pardus) has lost much of its historical range within South Africa. The remaining suitable habitat for the species includes both protected and unprotected areas in a fragmented landscape mosaic, bringing the species into close contact with human settlements. In order to make successful management decisions for the conservation of the species, more information is needed on leopard populations that exist in these highly fragmented habitats. The aim of our study was to determine the density of a population of leopards on Loskop Dam Nature Reserve (LDNR), Mpumalanga, South Africa. LDNR is located in a highly fragmented landscape and is surrounded by a variety of human settlements including game farms, livestock farms and rural towns. There are several smaller reserves 20-45 km away from LDNR, which may allow leopard movement and connectivity within the region. We determined population density by running a 164-day camera trap survey that covered a total area of 148.77 km(2) within the reserve. Leopard density was estimated using Spatially Explicit Capture-Recapture models implemented in the program 'secr' in R using four different models. The most supported model was a sex-based model that allowed for differences in detection probabilities between males and females. The population density estimated with this model was 7.7 +/- 2.0 (range 4.7-12.6) leopards per 100 km(2). This density estimate in LDNR is comparable to other leopard populations in protected areas with similar habitat types and fragmented landscapes within South Africa. This study highlights that isolated, protected natural areas have the potential to harbour significant populations of leopards, which is important for the management and conservation of the species.

AB  - Camera trapping can detect and monitor rare species in landscapes spanning thousands of square kilometres but placement of cameras in areas where the animals most likely occur will increase detection success. This vital information is lacking for the critically endangered Arabian leopard (Panthera pardus nimr) that has undergone a 90% decline across its range in Saudi Arabia. We aimed to identify suitable Arabian leopard habitat and potential population capacity in Saudi Arabia using data from leopards living in ecologically analogous habitat in South Africa and Oman. We developed a resource selection function (RSF) from 14 leopards' GPS data in the Cederberg, South Africa, and validated the model using three leopards in the Little Karoo, and two Arabian leopards in Oman. We then projected the model to the historical range of Arabian leopards in Saudi Arabia to estimate likely leopard locations and potential population sizes based on home range metrics. The RSF successfully discrimi-nated between used and available locations (specificity = 96.7%) and had high predictive ability (Rho > 0.9). Leopards selectively used areas away from human settlements and roads, with high enhanced vegetation index, and intermediate slopes and elevations. Saudi Arabia could theoretically host 4 distinct populations totalling 162-362 Arabian leopard females, depending on home range size. Camera traps deployed in the south-western mountains of Saudi Arabia may be most likely to detect remnant populations of Arabian leopards. Further research is needed into the local abundance of prey species and human activity to ensure the persistence of suitable leopard ranges and inform conservation actions.

AB  - Human influence extends across the globe, from the tallest mountains to the deep bottom of the oceans. There is a growing call for nature to be protected from the negative impacts of human activity (particularly intensive agriculture); so-called "land sparing". A relatively new approach is "rewilding", defined as the restoration of self-sustaining and complex ecosystems, with interlinked ecological processes that promote and support one another while minimising or gradually reducing human intervention. The key theoretical basis of rewilding is to return ecosystems to a "natural" or "self-willed" state with trophic complexity, dispersal (and connectivity) and stochastic disturbance in place. However, this is constrained by context-specific factors whereby it may not be possible to restore the native species that formed part of the trophic structure of the ecosystem if they are extinct (e.g., mammoths, Mammuthus spp., aurochs, Bos primigenius); and, populations/communities of native herbivores/predators may not be able to survive or be acceptable to the public in small scale rewilding projects close to areas of high human density. Therefore, the restoration of natural trophic complexity and disturbance regimes within rewilding projects requires careful consideration if the broader conservation needs of society are to be met. In some circumstances, managers will require a more flexible deliberate approach to intervening in rewilding projects using the range of tools in their toolbox (e.g., controlled burning regimes; using domestic livestock to replicate the impacts of extinct herbivore species), even if this is only in the early stages of the rewilding process. If this approach is adopted, then larger areas can be given over to conservation, because of the potential broader benefits to society from these spaces and the engagement of farmers in practises that are closer to their traditions. We provide examples, primarily European, where domestic and semi-domestic livestock are used by managers as part of their rewilding toolbox. Here managers have looked at the broader phenotype of livestock species as to their suitability in different rewilding systems. We assess whether there are ways of using livestock in these systems for conservation, economic (e.g., branded or certified livestock products) and cultural gains.

AB  - Marine reserves are viewed as flagship tools to protect exploited species and to contribute to the effective management of coastal fisheries. Yet, the extent to which marine reserves are globally interconnected and able to effectively seed areas, where fisheries are most critical for food and livelihood security is largely unknown. Using a hydrodynamic model of larval dispersal, we predict that most marine reserves are not interconnected by currents and that their potential benefits to fishing areas are presently limited, since countries with high dependency on coastal fisheries receive very little larval supply from marine reserves. This global mismatch could be reversed, however, by placing new marine reserves in areas sufficiently remote to minimize social and economic costs but sufficiently connected through sea currents to seed the most exploited fisheries and endangered ecosystems.

AB  - This paper presents a geographic information system (GIS)-based multi-criteria decision making approach for forest conservation planning at a landscape scale. This approach enables decision makers to evaluate the relative priorities of conserving forest areas based on a set of preferences, criteria and indicators for the area. Compromise programming techniques are used to integrate the forest conservation priority maps of decision groups where a separation distance is calculated. A clustering analysis was applied to identify potential conservation areas as the basis of delineating potential new protected areas. The study was conducted in the Kinabalu area, Sabah, Malaysia where two polygons neighboring the Kinabalu Park were delineated. A group of 11 polygons totaling 2050 ha has also been detected in the western part of Kinabalu Park. The study recommends the inclusion of a forest polygon (359 ha) neighboring Kinabalu Park and another (4361 ha) to the west of the park as new protected areas. A green corridor linking the potential new protected areas and Kinabalu Park should also be constructed to facilitate animal movement and interaction. This study reveals that riparian vegetation is an important aspect to forest conservation and the legislation to protect riparian zones should be strengthened. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - On 25 April 1998, the mineral waste retaining wall at the Swedish-owned pyrite mine at Aznalcollar (Seville, Spain) burst, 2 causing the most harmful environmental and socio-economic disaster in the history of the River Guadiamar basin. The damage was so great that the regional government decided in May 1998 to finance a comprehensive, multidisciplinary research initiative with the objective of eradicating or at least minimising all of the negative social, economic and environmental impacts. This paper utilises a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis to identify eight strategic measures aimed at providing policymakers with key guidelines on implementing a sustainable development model, in a broad sense. Empirical evidence, though, reveals that, to date, major efforts to tackle the negative impacts have centred on environmental concerns and that the socio-economic consequences have not been completely mitigated.

AB  - Gaps in forest cover, created by agriculture, forestry, and other anthropogenic activities, are assumed to impede the movements of many forest songbirds. Little is known, however, about the reluctance of different species of birds to cross habitat gaps. We studied this by inducing birds in the post-fledging period to cross gaps of varying widths and to choose between routes through woodland or across open areas by attracting them to a recording of mobbing calls by Chickadees (Parus atricapillus). In 278 experiments conducted in boreal forest and agricultural landscapes near Quebec city, 157 birds or flocks of birds of five species were attracted. Overall, birds were twice as likely to travel through 50 m of woodland than through 50 m in the open to reach the recording. When given a choice of traveling through woodland or across a gap, the majority of respondents preferred woodland routes, even when they were three times longer than shortcuts in the open. However, species differed greatly in their response to gaps. Our results show that woodland links significantly facilitate movements of birds across fragmented landscapes.

AB  - In 1956, and again in 1988, breeding pairs of rock wrens (Salpinctes obsoletus) were observed in Churchill, Manitoba, beyond their previously known breeding extent. It has been suggested that these and other vagrant rock wrens might have been accidentally transported in railroad boxcars. Alternative explanations include: 1) that rock wrens are prone to vagrancy during migration and dispersal, and 2) that the species is expanding its range via hydrographic or human-made corridors. I compiled northern and eastern vagrancy records from May 1898 through November 2015 for rock wrens and four other bird species with similar ranges. I calculated the distance of each sighting to the nearest railway and hydrographic features, compared these distances among species, and identified vagrant clusters. Rock wren vagrants were not significantly different from vagrants of lazuli buntings (Passerina amoena) or Bullock's orioles (Icterus bullockii) in their proximity to railways. Results suggest that vagrancy rates of rock wrens are similar to those of sage thrashers (Oreoscoptes montanus) and green-tailed towhees (Pipilo chlorurus), and vagrancy is likely driven by landscape factors rather than the use of railway corridors or accidental transport in freight cars. Proximity of vagrant rock wrens to lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and streams indicates that these and associated habitat features may act as travel and dispersal corridors.

AB  - Homestead Cave, a paleontological site located in a low-elevation arid setting in the northern Bonneville Basin of northcentral Utah, documents the local extinction of Neotoma cinerea during the Middle Holocene. N. cinerea is present there today, and the Homestead Cave record suggests that recolonization likely occurred sometime prior to 1,000 years ago. This history supports the view (forwarded by T. E. Lawlor) that cross-valley dispersal by mammals that generally are most abundant in cooler and moister land therefore higher elevation) parts of the Great Basin is still occurring, showing that Brown's model of Great Basin montane mammalian biogeography is incorrect. These dispersal patterns suggest that conservation efforts directed toward montane mammals in the Great Basin must include low-elevation access corridors to mountain masses.

AB  - Populations of mammals that depend on early successional forests or shrub-dominated habitats are declining in portions of the eastern United States. Although much of this decline can be attributed to maturation of young forests that once dominated the East, fragmentation and suppression of natural disturbances also have been implicated. Responses by habitat specialists (e.g., New England cottontails [Sylvilagus transitionalis]) and carnivores with large area requirements that rely on prey associated with early successional habitats (e.g., bobcats [Lynx rufus]) have been most extreme. Populations of facultative or opportunistic users of early successional habitats (e.g., black bears [Ursus americanus] and little brown bats [Myotis lucifugus]) apparently have not been affected by fewer young stands. As eastern forests mature, biotic and abiotic forces will increase abundance of early successional habitats. However, maturation of these forests will take a century or more. In the meantime, using even-aged silviculture and applying controlled burns to native shrublands may be useful to alleviate current shortages. In landscapes modified substantially by suburban-urban developments and dense networks of roads, conventional management efforts likely will be insufficient. In these regions, increased populations of generalist predators are of exerting intense predation on mammalian herbivores that are restricted to small patches, and movement between patches by small mammals is limited. Mammals large area requirements also are hampered in these landscapes by frequent road crossings. These limitations may require implementing habitat management programs for mammals that differ from those developed for other disturbance-dependent taxa. Large (>10-ha), clustered patches of early successional habitat may be necessary to maintain viable populations. The effectiveness of these managed habitats will be further enhanced by positioning them close to existing land uses that are characterized by early successional habitats (e.g., powerline corridors). In agricultural landscapes, the representation of old-field habitats could be increased in set-aside programs.

AB  - The relationship between walking, the contemplation of the landscape and the network of roads and livestock trails is argued by resorting to the origin of these roads, that is, trails designed to facilitate the movement of animals at the slow pace of herds and shepherds. Although the function of transhumance is currently residual, the livestock trails are being recovered and used by the competent administrations, with the aim of improving the articulation of the territory through which they pass, favoring biodiversity and landscape diversification in urban environments and, to a large extent, responding to the new citizen demands related to leisure, sports and recreational activities typical of today's society. This work makes a methodological proposal for these public itineraries from the intervention in the landscape, taking as a case study a livestock trail of the Metropolitan Green Corridor of Seville, the Cordel de Gambogaz, which runs between the capital of Seville and the town of Santiponce.

AB  - The Juarez Complex is in the Historic Centre of Mexico City, facing the Alameda Central. Covering a total surface area of 27,500m2 the complex is adjacent to the Avenida Juarez to the north, to the south to the Calle Independencia, the east to the Calle Dolores and to the west with the Calle Luis Moya.
   The aim of the Juarez Complex is to regenerate an important area of the Historic Centre of the City which suffered serious damage in the 1985 earthquakes. The Complex is made up of open spaces, walkways and squares.
   The new headquarters of the Foreign Affairs Secretariat, "Secretaria de Relaciones Exteriores - Torre Tlatelolco" and the High court Building "Tribunal Superior de Justicia del D.F." as well as some mixed usage buildings and car parks are found there.
   Due to its position, the complex finds itself in a transitional area between the Paseo de la Reforma with its larger scaled buildings and the Historic Centre characterised by lower-level buildings and more pedestrian-friendly spaces. The architectural aim is to reflect this context in terms of position and age, which is why a 12.65 m Perla Huxquilucan stone plinth base was designed. This height is exactly that of the Corpus Christi Temple, the design, materials and scale of which are clearly linked to those of the Historic Centre. Coordinating with the Fideicomiso (trusts responsible for the order of certain types of buildings) del Centro Historico and the INAH, The Corpus Christi Temple was redesigned to give it a new use working as an attraction to the centre.
   The flat roofs the base describes are treated as terraces and gardens to be used as expansion areas for the taller buildings. The Plaza Juarez is the main one of these outside areas surrounding the Corpus Christi Temple. The Square is the focal point for the rest of the complex radiating to and from the main pedestrian access points to each. With the collaboration of the artist and sculptor Vicente Rojo a great fountain was built in the centre of the square complementing the vegetation to be found in the Parque Alameda with the element of water.
   It forms a 35 x 30 metre mirror with over a thousand red concrete pyramids which, with the movement of the water via a series of injectors in each pyramid, transforms it into a fountain of great movement.
   As well as Vicente Rojo's fountain, along the outside areas is the "SPEED Mural" el Mural VELOCIDAD - by David Alfaro Siqueiros as well as other works of are, placed there to try and rekindle the tradition of public/street art in our city.
   EXTERNAL AFFAIRS SECRETARIAT "TORRE TLATELOLCO"
   The building is part of the Juarez Complex - el Conjunto Juarez which is contained in the block bordered by the Juarez, Independencia, Dolores and Luis Moya Avenues. It is a 23-storey building adjacent to the Plaza Juarez to the north and to the south with the Plaza Independencia.
   On the ground floor is the lobby, the "treaties vault" - boveda de tratados, conference and press rooms and some public offices. In this level there is a pedestrian portico, which leads to all the different elements of the complex.
   On the first floor, there are reception and meeting rooms within the space forming a 12.65 m high base, the height corresponding exactly to the scale of the Corpus Christi Temple and which, therefore links the project to the Historic Centre and the other buildings in the complex.
   Executive dining-rooms are on the second floor and the 19 floors above contain the sub-secretariats distributed at present in different buildings.
   Finally on top is a floor for the building services, under which are the executive offices.
   The facade of the building on the two base floors is in the Huixquilucan quarry type stone. From the second level the facade is covered with a decorative cladding.
   For the specifications criteria for the staircases, corridors, toilets, car parking and other elements, standards are at the least those of the Federal district building rules when use by the user is required.

AB  - Recent archeobotanical work has shed light on prehistoric food globalization across the Eurasian landmass; however, much less research has focused on the foodways of the historical cities and settlements found throughout Central Asia on various portions of the 'Silk Road'. Here, we present archeobotanical and isotopic results from recent excavations at Shichengzi, a Han dynasty (202 BC-AD 220) military garrison. Our archeobotanical results recovered from 11 samples reveal that four types of cereals, naked barley, wheat, common millet, and foxtail millet, were the most common crops at the site. Naked barley, a drought and cold resistant crop, comprised 79% of the crop assemblage recovered from Shichengzi, and the rest of the assemblage is composed of wheat and millet. The reliance on drought resistant crops indicates that people at Shichengzi oriented their agricultural strategy toward mitigating environmental risks. In addition, our isotopic analyses (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of charred cereal grains (n = 22), animal and human remains (n = 12) recovered from excavations at Shichengzi suggests that the delta N-15 values of cereals were enriched by human or livestock dung. Moreover, the delta C-13 data from Shichengzi suggest that farmers preferentially planted their crops in wide areas that would have received the highest amounts of water available on the northern piedmont of the Tianshan mountains. Our research contributes to the growing understanding of the diversity of agricultural strategies used along the Silk Road.

AB  - The invasive Tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) has long been targeted for removal by land managers in the western United States. Biocontrol of the non-native tamarisk started in 2001 by introducing the tamarisk leaf beetle (Diorhabda spp.) to the riparian ecosystems. Since then, the beetles quickly established and substantial tamarisk defoliation was subsequently observed along river corridors in the western states. The ability to monitor and track the patterns of beetle-induced tamarisk defoliation across space and time is key to understand its impact on ecosystem functioning and processes. In the present study, spatiotemporal patterns of tamarisk defoliation caused by the subtropical tamarisk leaf beetle (D. sublineata) were successfully detected using a classification based method along the Lower Rio Grande in West Texas from 2009 to 2014. Our results indicated that the subtropical beetle species can sustain a dispersal rate of approximately 102 km yr(-1) during the first year after release. Tamarisk abundance was the most important factor in directing beetle dispersal. We also found that the beetles preferred to forage within dense, connected tamarisk stands along wide sections of the riparian river corridors. These new findings of our study will help inform the land managers of the possible outcomes of tamarisk biocontrol to make effective management plans. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. Population structure, distribution, abundance and dispersal arguably underpin the entire field of animal ecology, with consequences for regional species persistence, and provision of ecosystem services. Divergent migration behaviours among individuals or among populations are an important aspect of the ecology of highly mobile animals, allowing populations to exploit spatially or temporally distributed food and space resources.
   2. This study investigated the spatial ecology of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) within the barrier free Huron-Erie Corridor (HEC), which connects Lake Huron and Lake Erie of the North American Laurentian Great Lakes.
   3. Over 6years (2011-2016), movements of 268 lake sturgeon in the HEC were continuously monitored across the Great Lakes using acoustic telemetry (10years battery life acoustic transmitters). Five distinct migration behaviours were identified with hierarchical cluster analysis, based on the phenology and duration of river and lake use.
   4. Lake sturgeon in the HEC were found to contain a high level of intraspecific divergent migration, including partial migration with the existence of residents. Specific behaviours included year-round river residency and multiple lake-migrant behaviours that involved movements between lakes and rivers. Over 85% of individuals were assigned to migration behaviours as movements were consistently repeated over the study, which suggested migration behaviours were consistent and persistent in lake sturgeon. Differential use of specific rivers or lakes by acoustic-tagged lake sturgeon further subdivided individuals into 14 contingents (spatiotemporally segregated subgroups).
   5. Contingents associated with one river (Detroit or St. Clair) were rarely detected in the other river, which confirmed that lake sturgeon in the Detroit and St. Clair represent two semi-independent populations that could require separate management consideration for their conservation. The distribution of migration behaviours did not vary between populations, sexes, body size or among release locations, which indicated that intrapopulation variability in migratory behaviour is a general feature of the spatial ecology of lake sturgeon in unfragmented landscapes.

AB  - Background: With the increasing demand for forest tourism and forest leisure space in recent years, providing a high-quality forest landscape space to participants has become an increasingly important topic for designers and managers of forest parks.
   Main purpose: To clarify differences in the visual behavior characteristics and psychological cognitive evaluation of participants when viewing different types of forest landscape spaces and to explore the relationship between them in order to identify the psychological evaluation factors that affect visual behavior. This analysis will provide a theoretical basis and a basis for the construction and reconstruction of forest park landscape spaces, even for new forests in the future. Methods: This study used eye-tracking technology and cognitive questionnaires for participants. ANOVA and Spearman's rho correlation analysis in SPSS 23.0 were used to statistically analyze the data.
   Main results: 1. There are differences in participants' visual behavior, especially in visual spans, when participants appreciate different types of forest landscape spaces. The visual span of forest waterscape space is small, while the visual span of in-forest landscape space is large. 2. There are differences in participants' psychological cognitive evaluations of different types of forest landscape spaces. The forest waterscape space is evaluated highly on multiple indicators, especially for dynamic water space, whereas for in-forest landscape space, participants also pay attention to unique or interesting landscape elements, with the exception of color and plants. 3. There are correlations between the mean visual span, mean pupil diameter and psychological cognitive evaluation of participants in different types of forest landscape spaces. When people admire scenes with diverse plant species, rich landscape content, good landscape depth and permeability, rich and bright color, open and tidy spaces, and good landscape permeability and layering, their mean pupil diameter and lateral and portrait visual span are small. Based on the above analysis, we recommend that when planning and designing forest landscape space, we should consider not only the characteristics of different types of landscape spaces and their visual and cognitive effects for participants but also the combination of some iconic elements or interesting landscape elements.

AB  - The origin of taxa presenting a disjunct distribution between Africa and Asia has puzzled biogeographers for more than a century. This biogeographic pattern has been hypothesized to be the result of transoceanic long-distance dispersal, Oligocene dispersal through forested corridors, Miocene dispersal through the Arabian Peninsula or passive dispersal on the rifting Indian plate. However, it has often been difficult to pinpoint the mechanisms at play. We investigate biotic exchange between the Afrotropics and the Oriental region during the Cenozoic, a period in which geological changes altered landmass connectivity. We use Baorini skippers (Lepidoptera, Hesperiidae) as a model, a widespread clade of butterflies in the Old World tropics with a disjunct distribution between the Afrotropics and the Oriental region. We use anchored phylogenomics to infer a robust evolutionary tree for Baorini skippers and estimate divergence times and ancestral ranges to test biogeographic hypotheses. Our phylogenomic tree recovers strongly supported relationships for Baorini skippers and clarifies the systematics of the tribe. Dating analyses suggest that these butterflies originated in the Oriental region, Greater Sunda Islands, and the Philippines in the early Miocene c. 23 Ma. Baorini skippers dispersed from the Oriental region towards Africa at least five times in the past 20 Ma. These butterflies colonized the Afrotropics primarily through trans-Arabian geodispersal after the closure of the Tethyan seaway in the mid-Miocene. Range expansion from the Oriental region towards the African continent probably occurred via the Gomphotherium land bridge through the Arabian Peninsula. Alternative scenarios invoking long-distance dispersal and vicariance are not supported. The Miocene climate change and biome shift from forested areas to grasslands possibly facilitated geodispersal in this clade of butterflies.

AB  - Road construction fragments the landscape, reduces connectivity, and drives land use changes. To our knowledge, little is known about the scope and intensity of the effects of cross-border roads on changes in land use. Here, with the land use data products provided by the US Agency for International Development's SERVIR Mekong project, using the GIS-based spatial analysis to quantitatively analyze and compare the effects of the cross-border road on land use changes within a 30 km buffer area along the Kunming-Bangkok Highway between Laos and Thailand. The results show the following: The greater the distance was from the highway, the smaller were the overall changes in land use within the buffer zone. A comparison of the situation before and after the road was opened in 2013 revealed significant differences in the most influential land use types of agricultural expansion, i.e., from 47.07% to 52.07% (the buffer zone was 1 km). In particular, 57.32% (1381.93 ha) and 40.08% (966.46 ha) of the land occupied by forests had been converted into land for plantation and agriculture, respectively, from 2013 to 2018. The scope of the impact of the operational route on the dynamics of land use was inconsistent. The largest impact before the road became operational was within 4 km of the buffer zone (0.26 to 0.24). Once the road had been opened, the range of its impact was beyond 10 km (0.63 to 0.57). The work here can provide a scientific basis for regional transportation planning and the sustainable use of land resources.

AB  - Soil quality is critical to the management of urban green space, in particular, along traffic corridors where traffic-related air pollution is significant. Soil quality can be evaluated by soil enzyme activities, which show quick responses to both natural and anthropogenic disturbances. In this study, we investigated three soil enzyme activities (i.e., dehydrogenase, catalase and urease) along the major roads in urban areas of Beijing. Results show the activities of dehydrogenase, catalase and urease in urban samples were 58.8%, 68.2% and 48.5% less than the rural sample, respectively. The content of fluorescent amino acids as indicators of microbial activities was also consistently lower in urban samples than the rural. We observed two times greater exposure of particulate material along the roadsides in urban areas than rural areas. Although traffic air pollutants provide some nutrient sources to stimulate the URE activity, the exposure to traffic-related air pollution leads to the substantial decrease in enzyme activities. There were significant negative correlations for exposure to PM10 with DHA (r = -0.8267, p = 0.0017) and CAT (r = -0.89, p = 0.0002) activities. For the urban soils URE activity increased with the increasing of PM. We conclude that the degraded soil quality can negatively affect the target of developing plants and green spaces along the traffic corridors to mitigate the traffic impact. This study suggests the investigation of integrated strategies to restore the soil quality, reinforce the ecological service functions of green spaces along the traffic corridors and reduce the traffic pollutants.

AB  - Mountain social-ecological systems (MtSES) are transforming rapidly due to changes in multiple environmental and socioeconomic drivers. However, the complexity and diversity of MtSES present challenges for local communities, researchers and decision makers seeking to anticipate change and promote action towards sustainable MtSES. Participatory scenario planning can reveal potential futures and their interacting dynamics, while archetype analysis aggregates insights from site-based scenarios. We combined a systematic review of the global MtSES participatory scenarios literature and archetype analysis to identify emergent MtSES archetypal configurations. An initial sample of 1983 rendered 42 articles that contained 142 scenarios within which were 852 'futures states'. From these future states within the scenarios, we identified 59 desirable and undesirable futures that were common across studies. These 'common futures' were grouped into four clusters that correlated significantly with three social-ecological factors (GDP per capita, income inequality, and mean annual temperature). Using these clusters and their associated significant factors, we derived four MtSES scenario archetypal configurations characterized by similar key adaptation strategies, assumptions, risks, and uncertainties. We called these archetypes: (1) "revitalization through effective institutions and tourism"; (2) "local innovations in smallholder farming and forestry"; (3) "upland depopulation and increased risk of hazards"; and (4) "regulated economic and ecological prosperity". Results indicate risks to be mitigated, including biodiversity loss, ecosystem degradation, cultural heritage change, loss of connection to the land, weak leadership, market collapse, upland depopulation, increased landslides, avalanches, mudflows and rock falls, as well as climate variability and change. Transformative opportunities lie in adaptive biodiversity conservation, income diversification, adaptation to market fluxes, improving transport and irrigation infrastructure, high quality tourism and preserving traditional knowledge. Despite the uncertainties arising from global environmental changes, these archetypes support better targeting of evidence-informed actions across scales and sectors in MtSES.

AB  - Russian-olive is a nitrogen-fixing tree invading riparian corridors in western North America. The premise of revegetation after weed removal is that revegetation is required to return native species to a removal site and that revegetation improves site resistance to invasion or reinvasion via competitive exclusion. Therefore, we expected that revegetation would reduce invasive species cover and increase native species cover compared with non-revegetated controls. Native understory species diversity increased with time since removal. We recorded 18.2 native species in 2012, and 28.2 native species in 2016. Out of 22 planted species, 2 did not establish. Diversity in revegetated plots did not differ from unplanted controls, likely because species spread quickly across plot boundaries. Native perennial grass, seeded species, and annual bromes increased over time, while nonnative forbs and native forbs decreased over time. Only invasive perennial grass cover responded to the revegetation treatment with cover much higher in controls compared with revegetated plots (25.7% vs. 7.7%); this was likely a response to a preplanting herbicide treatment. All categories of species diversity except invasive species diversity increased over time. Only 4% of Russian-olive stumps resprouted in the first year of removal, less than 1% resprouted 2 yr after removal. There was no Russian-olive emergence from seed in the removal year, and seed emergence varied exponentially among following years. Seeded native species did not have trouble establishing once adequate spring moisture occurred in the second growing season after Russian-olive removal, indicating that removal did not present substantial obstacles to successful revegetation. Follow-up control of Russian-olive is critical after initial treatment.

AB  - Protected areas are crucial for biodiversity conservation because they provide safe havens for species threatened by land-use change and resulting habitat loss. However, protected areas are only effective when they stop habitat loss within their boundaries, and are connected via corridors to other wild areas. The effectiveness of protected areas is threatened by development; however, the extent of this threat is unknown. We compiled spatially-detailed housing growth data from 1940 to 2030, and quantified growth for each wilderness area, national park, and national forest in the conterminous United States. Our findings show that housing development in the United States may severely limit the ability of protected areas to function as a modern "Noah's Ark." Between 1940 and 2000, 28 million housing units were built within 50 km of protected areas, and 940,000 were built within national forests. Housing growth rates during the 1990s within 1 km of protected areas (20% per decade) outpaced the national average (13%). If long-term trends continue, another 17 million housing units will be built within 50 km of protected areas by 2030 (1 million within 1 km), greatly diminishing their conservation value. US protected areas are increasingly isolated, housing development in their surroundings is decreasing their effective size, and national forests are even threatened by habitat loss within their administrative boundaries. Protected areas in the United States are thus threatened similarly to those in developing countries. However, housing growth poses the main threat to protected areas in the United States whereas deforestation is the main threat in developing countries.

TI  - Phylogeographic Origin of California Slender Salamanders (Batrachoseps attenuatus) in the Sutter Buttes
T2  - JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The phylogeny of California Slender Salamanders (Batrachoseps attenuatus), which inhabits Northern California's Coast Ranges and Sierra Nevada foothills, was previously investigated by Martinez-Solano et al. (2007), who recovered a monophyletic species that contained five geographically cohesive major clades. However, a population isolate of B. attenuatus found in the Sutter Buttes, a geographically isolated volcanic mountain range within the Sacramento Valley, was not available in their phylogenetic analysis. We sequenced the similar to 780-base pair segment of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b (cytb) gene used in Martinez-Solano et al. (2007) to examine the phylogenetic placement of this isolated population within the B. attenuatus complex. Our results, based on a single mitochondrial marker, indicate that the Sutter Buttes population of B. attenuatus is genetically distinct and falls within the Martinez-Solano et al. (2007) "East Bay/Sierra subclade'' that, in turn, is nested within their "Eastern'' major clade. Although we cannot accurately estimate how long the Sutter Buttes population has been isolated, B. attenuatus was likely able to colonize the Sutter Buttes during pluvial Pleistocene interglacials when more contiguous woodlands may have opened dispersal corridors across the Great Central Valley.

AB  - Development of regional policies to reduce net emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) would benefit from the quantification of the major components of the region's carbon balance fossil fuel CO2 emissions and net fluxes between land ecosystems and the atmosphere. Through spatially detailed inventories of fossil fuel CO2 emissions and a terrestrial biogeochemistry model, we produce the first estimate of regional carbon balance for the Northeast United States between 2001 and 2005. Our analysis reveals that the region was a net carbon source of 259 Tg C/yr over this period. Carbon sequestration by land ecosystems across the region, mainly forests, compensated for about 6% of the region's fossil fuel emissions. Actions that reduce fossil fuel CO2 emissions are key to improving the region's carbon balance. Careful management of forested lands will be required to protect their role as a net carbon sink and a provider of important ecosystem services such as water purification, erosion control, wildlife habitat and diversity, and scenic landscapes.

AB  - The objective of this study was to analyze the structural changes of the landscape in the River Basin of the Aguapei River/MT, in the years 1991 and 2011, through the use of geotechnologies and metrics. This study is based on a categorical approach, which classes discrete belonging to the vegetation cover and land use were identified and mapped by means of geotechnologies and characterized quantitatively by indices of Landscape Ecology, adopting the conceptual model of "stain-corridor-matrix'. It was found that the landscape of the study area form a mosaic, showing an array consisting of savanna (Cerrado), with several spots of livestock, and an area of influence urban, being that the latter class did not exist in 1991, and the corridor formed by alluvial forest in River Basin of the Aguapei. The data showed a decrease in the area occupied by savanna vegetation and the growth of the agricultural activity in the period analyzed. In case of this pattern is maintained, indicates that in the next 20 years may be the matrix of the basin be constituted by agricultural activity resulting in simplification of ecosystems. Thus, there is a need for regional development policies of Mato Grosso prioritize environmental conservation, which will reflect in land use planning, to improve the permeability of the landscape.

AB  - In recent years there have been concerns over the conservation and management of freshwater turtle populations in the state of Texas. In 2008 and 2009, we completed several investigations addressing anthropogenic impacts on freshwater turtles in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of Texas. Here, we use a model selection approach within an information-theoretic framework and simple linear regressions to investigate effects of road density and number of surrounding water bodies on relative abundance and sex ratio of Red-eared Sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans). We sampled 36 sites across three counties in the LRGV. We used a GIS (Geographic Information System) and county road maps to estimate the total length of road within 1 km radius circular buffers centered on the midpoint of trap lines at each site and hydrology maps to estimate number of water bodies within the 1 km buffer. Based on model selection results, the number of surrounding water bodies best explained the relative abundance of turtles, while road density best explained sex ratio differences. However, predictors in both models showed little explanatory power. Our failure to identify road density as a strong predictor of decreased turtle abundance gives additional weight to conclusions drawn from our recent work that suggested declines of Red-eared Sliders in the LRGV are due to commercial harvest and land use changes.

AB  - In humans and other mammals, the stillness of sleep is punctuated by bursts of rapid eye movements (REMs) and myoclonic twitches of the limbs.(1) Like the spontaneous activity that arises from the sensory periphery in other modalities (e.g., retinal waves),(2) sensory feedback arising from twitches is well suited to drive activity dependent development of the sensorimotor system.(3) It is partly because of the behavioral activation of REM sleep that this state is also called active sleep (AS), in contrast with the behavioral quiescence that gives quiet sleep (QS)-the second major stage of sleep-its name. In human infants, for which AS occupies 8 h of each day,(4) twitching helps to identify the state;(5-8) nonetheless, we know little about the structure and functions of twitching across development. Recently, in sleeping infants,(9) we documented a shift in the temporal expression of twitching beginning around 3 months of age that suggested a qualitative change in how twitches are produced. Here, we combine behavioral analysis with high-density electroencephalography (EEG) to demonstrate that this shift reflects the emergence of limb twitches during QS. Twitches during QS are not only unaccompanied by REMs, but they also occur synchronously with sleep spindles, a hallmark of QS. As QS-related twitching increases with age, sleep spindle rate also increases along the sensorimotor strip. The emerging synchrony between subcortically generated twitches and cortical oscillations suggests the development of functional connectivity among distant sensorimotor structures, with potential implications for detecting and explaining atypical developmental trajectories.

AB  - The impact of changing environments on the evolution and dispersal of Homo sapiens is highly debated, but few data are available from equatorial Africa. Lake Victoria is the largest freshwater lake in the tropics and is currently a biogeographic barrier between the eastern and western branches of the East African Rift. The lake has previously desiccated at similar to 17 ka and again at similar to 15 ka, but little is known from this region prior to the Last Glacial Maximum. The Pleistocene terrestrial deposits on the northeast coast of Lake Victoria (94-36 ka) are ideal for paleoenvironmental reconstructions where volcaniclastic deposits (tuffs), fluvial deposits, tufa, and paleosols are exposed, which can be used to reconstruct Critical Zones (CZ) of the past (paleo-CZs). The paleo-CZ is a holistic concept that reconstructs the entire landscape using geologic records of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, biosphere, and pedosphere (the focus of this study). New paleosol-based mean annual precipitation (MAP) proxies from Karungu, Rusinga Island, and Mfangano Island indicate an average MAP of 750 +/- 108mm year(-1) (CALMAG), 800 +/- 182 mm year(-1) (CIA-K), and 1,010 +/- 228 mm year(-1) (PPM1.0) with no statistical difference throughout the 11 m thick sequence. This corresponds to between 54 and 72% of modern precipitation. Tephras bracketing these paleosols have been correlated across seven sites, and sample a regional paleo-CZ across a similar to 55 km transect along the eastern shoreline of the modern lake. Given the sensitivity of Lake Victoria to precipitation, it is likely that the lake was significantly smaller than modern between 94 and 36 ka. This would have removed a major barrier for the movement of fauna (including early modern humans) and provided a dispersal corridor across the equator and between the rifts. It is also consistent with the associated fossil faunal assemblage indicative of semi-arid grasslands. During the Late Pleistocene, the combined geologic and paleontological evidence suggests a seasonally dry, open grassland environment for the Lake Victoria region that is significantly drier than today, which may have facilitated human and faunal dispersals across equatorial East Africa.

AB  - Manor parks are characteristic objects in the agricultural landscape of Poland. Lack of proper management after World War II, however, led to their devastation from a cultural point of view, but may allow the regeneration of rare and endangered species. The aim of our study was to determine if the presence of forests in the vicinity of manor parks will work as an accelerator of the regeneration process of oak-hornbeam and ancient forest species. Phytosociological analyses were conducted in manor parks adjacent to forests and not adjacent to the forest as well as natural forests. The total number of plant species, number and percentage share of ancient forest species, and plant species consistent with oak-hornbeam habitat were analyzed using a GLM model. Characteristic species were identified using detrended correspondence analysis. Parks adjacent to forests and natural forests showed higher numbers of total species, ancient forest species, and oak-hornbeam species compared with parks not adjacent to forests, but there were no differences in percentage shares of ancient forest species and oak-hornbeam species. For all three types of studied objects, characteristic species could be identified. We conclude that adjacent forests allow greater regeneration of ancient forest species and oak-hornbeam forest species in manor parks.

AB  - Within the southeastern region of Queensland, Australia, native forest cover (bushland) has been greatly reduced and fragmented, and clearing is still occurring. Many of the region's bird species are being increasingly restricted to isolated habitat remnants. However, little is known about the habitat value of these remnants and whether their value is influenced by their degree of connection. We investigated bird use of riparian corridors in pastoral and urban surroundings and riparian linear remnants within an urban context. We compared the avifauna of these remnants with dryland and riparian sites within continuous bushland. We also assessed their use by previously derived response-guilds of birds to bushland clearing. We counted 3567 individuals of 102 bird species. Riparian bushland supported more species and had greater bird abundances than dryland bushland. Corridors and linear remnants supported densities of many bushland-dependent species similar to those in bushland; this varied with species' patterns of large-scale migration and residency. Bushland-dependent winter migrants used both corridors and linear remnants extensively. Bushland-dependent residents were most abundant in continuous bushland and least abundant in linear remnants, possibly reflecting the constraints of central place foraging. Effects of isolation were only evident in resident bushland-dependent species. Local habitat variables were significantly associated with variation in abundance of some types of birds within corridors and linear remnants; however, the differences in bird abundances attributable to spatial characteristics were greater than those attributable to habitat characteristics. The effects of bushland fragmentation and isolation were mediated by the extent to which species are dependent upon bushland and their patterns of large-scale migration or residency. Local habitat, and possibly more importantly altitude, may influence site use by winter migrants and generalist species.

AB  - 1. Feedbacks between vegetation and geomorphic processes can generate alternative stable states and other nonlinear behaviours in ecological systems, but the consequences of these biogeomorphic interactions for other ecosystem processes are poorly understood. In this study, we describe the changes in the hydrological, geomorphic and biogeochemical characteristics of the hyporheic zone of a Sonoran desert stream (Sycamore Creek, Arizona, U.S.A.) in response to a transition from an unvegetated gravel-bed state to densely vegetated wetlands (cienegas).
   2. A survey of the entire length of Sycamore Creek indicated that cienegas occupied c. 18% of the stream, and were disproportionately represented in constrained canyons rather than wide, unconstrained valleys.
   3. Vegetated patches were characterized by low concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) and nitrate and high concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane in the hyporheic zone. In contrast to unvegetated areas, hyporheic DO in cienegas exhibited no relationship with vertical hydraulic gradients.
   4. Increases in hyporheic DO following removal of vegetation by floods supports the hypothesis that these reduced conditions were the result of biogeochemical and geomorphic changes associated with vegetation establishment. In locations where vegetation persisted, hyporheic DO exhibited no response to flooding; in sections where vegetation was removed hyporheic DO closely tracked post-flood increases in surface stream DO.
   5.Shallow sediments in vegetated patches were finer and more organic-rich than in unvegetated patches, due to increased deposition during floods. Conservative tracer additions indicated that hydrological exchange between the surface stream and hyporheic zone was much lower in cienegas than in gravel-bed reaches.
   6. Vegetation establishment in desert streams not only alters the physical and chemical characteristics of the hyporheic zone, but also the nature of interactions between surface and hyporheic subsystems.

AB  - The South Coast Renosterveld has been fragmented extensively by agriculture. The extent of this fragmentation in terms of overall habitat loss, fragment sizes and fragment numbers has not been described previously, thereby limiting the development of conservation strategies for this vegetation type. Patterns of renosterveld loss in three sectors along a west-east gradient were described using LANDSAT imagery and a Geographical Information System-based program (FRAGSTATS) for spatial pattern analysis. These patterns were then correlated with rainfall and topography measures, which are indicators of agricultural potential. Over 80% of the South Coast Renosterveld has been cultivated. Fragmentation levels increased significantly from east to west, with 33% of natural vegetation remaining in the east and only 4% in the west. Topographical variables were the strongest predictors of patterns of renosterveld loss, with fragments being largely confined to slopes too steep for ploughing; they therefore face little risk of future cultivation. These results have implications for conservation planning options for the South Coast Renosterveld. There is the potential for large reserves in the east, as well as corridor reserves along major river valleys, but for only small, isolated reserves in the west.

AB  - Pollinators play a key role within most terrestrial communities in maintaining plant populations, as well as pollinating many agricultural crops for seed and fruit production. The mobility of pollinating animals is significant to their importance but we know little about how landscape structure influences pollinator movements. Linear landscape features such as hedgerows and embankments are conspicuous features of agricultural landscape structure and are important artificial habitats in their own right. However, there has been some debate as to the function of these landscape elements as corridors between larger expanses of semi-natural habitat separated by urban and agricultural habitats. Few studies have specifically studied insect flight responses to linear landscape elements. By observing bumblebee flight behaviour along hedgerows and, by creating a medium-scale experimental array of flower patches using an artificial linear feature, we examined whether such structures can elicit an oriented flight response along them and therefore facilitate insect movement through the landscape. We found that both hedgerows and artificial linear landscape features can influence the flight directions of bumblebees (Bombus spp. Hymenoptera, Apidae), one of Europe's most important groups of pollinators. A bioassay experiment in which Salvia pratensis (Lamiaceae) was planted into landscape patches with differing numbers of connecting hedgerows showed that this directional response can have a profound effect on plant reproductive success plants had increased pollinator activity, pollen receipt and subsequent seed set in patches with more connections. The overall hedgerow connectedness of a landscape is therefore important both to bumblebee movement and to those plants which depend on bumblebees for pollination services.

AB  - Digital elevation models (DEMs) are fundamental data infrastructure that support a large range of applications in environmental modelling. The distribution of solar radiation, patterns of wetness and water movement, mobility of animals and evolution of soils are all intimately linked to topographic form. DEMs for the Australian continent have progressed from 1/10th degree resolution in 1982 to 1/40th degree in 1991, 9 second (1/400th degree) in 1996 and now 1 second (about 30 m) derived from the NASA Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM). Each improvement in resolution and accuracy enables new applications as more detail and structure are revealed.
   The 1 second SRTM-derived DEMs for Australia are now publicly available through the Geoscience Australia National Elevation Data Framework (NEDF) portal (http://nedf.ga.gov.au). The raw SRTM data has been processed through a series of steps to provide several products suitable for different purposes:
   DEM-S is a bare-earth elevation model with stripes and voids removed, offsets due to trees treated and noise substantially reduced in flatter areas by adaptive smoothing, which is suitable for most applications where connectivity of flow is not the primary concern such as calculation of slopes and topographic position
   DEM-H is a hydrologically conditioned elevation model derived from DEM-S with drainage enforcement using 1: 250,000 scale stream lines, which is suitable for applications where hydrological connectivity is of primary concern such as calculation of contributing areas and catchment delineation
   DEM is the pre-cursor to DEM-S before adaptive smoothing, which may be useful when the retention of detail is more important than smoothness.
   There is also a cleaned digital surface model (DSM) that is the precursor to DEM-S before tree offsets are removed, which is restricted to Australian government use only.
   Most users of DEMs need information about the shape of the landscape, not just height, so we are producing a set of standard derived products including slope, aspect, curvatures, topographic position, relief, contributing area and wetness index. These derived surfaces are key inputs for continental scale prediction of soil properties and ecological patterns. Predictions of a suite of key soil properties on a 3 second grid for the Australian continent, using the 1 second terrain layers, are being developed and will contribute to the GlobalSoilMap. net global grid of soil properties. Catchments and stream lines derived from DEM-H will form the basis for future versions of the Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (http://www.bom.gov.au/water/geofabric/index.shtml).
   Digital elevation data continues to improve as measurement technology improves. Airborne lidar already provides high precision terrain data with vertical accuracy of 20 cm or better at 1 m horizontal resolution or better. This data is available in parts of Australia where the better accuracy justifies the high cost, such as urban areas, coastal lowlands, wetlands and floodplains. We need to develop ways of using high resolution data covering limited areas in combination with lower resolution data covering the continent. New global DEMs are being acquired and will replace SRTM in the years ahead. The TANDEM-X satellite radar system will potentially produce global elevations at 2-3 times better resolution and accuracy than SRTM, and other systems will follow. Higher resolutions bring further technical challenges, not least in data volume: each 1 second DEM product for Australia is a 40 GB dataset and finer resolutions will be correspondingly larger.

AB  - Urban and agricultural development has resulted in drastically modified riverine corridors that are often considered to be detrimental to the recovery of anadromous salmonid populations. Although mitigation features (e.g., large wood and shallow-water areas) are frequently incorporated in flood control infrastructure to offset the impacts of streambank stabilization, little is known regarding their effectiveness and the habitat characteristics associated with enhanced nearshore rearing conditions in large rivers. We evaluated two measures of habitat use by emigrating juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha relative to different shoreline types (rock revetment [riprap], mitigated, and natural) and analyzed associations between environmental characteristics and habitat occupancy using a large number of presence/absence samples in the lower Sacramento River, California. We found both measures of habitat use to be significantly higher at natural shorelines and those including mitigation features than at shorelines consisting predominantly of rock revetment. A predictive logistic regression model suggested that the density of woody material and inundated terrestrial vegetation, depth, and substrate type significantly affected habitat occupancy. Despite a moderate predictive capability (62% of correctly classified records in a leave-one-out simulation), the model was useful in identifying habitat characteristics associated with significantly increased habitat use in this large, low-gradient river, most notably the presence of instream cover (wood or vegetation), gently sloping streambanks, fine substrate, and variable nearshore current velocity. Conversely, habitat occupancy by juvenile Chinook Salmon diminished with large, rocky substrate and increased depth, characteristics favored by introduced predatory Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu. This study illustrates the value of incorporating mitigation features and identifies characteristics that enhance habitat use by emigrating juvenile Chinook Salmon.

AB  - Coastal rivers and estuaries provide habitat and migratory corridors for freshwater estuarine-opportunists. We evaluated movement patterns of 61 blue catfish (Ictalurus furcatus) in the tidal York and Rappahannock rivers in Virginia, USA with acoustic telemetry from July 2015 to June 2016. To evaluate river-specific movements, we utilized a multistate Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) model within a Bayesian framework to estimate probabilities of detection and transition (movement) among established salinity zones (i.e., tidal-fresh (0%-0.5%), oligohaline (>0.5%-5%), mesohaline (>5%-18%)). We considered flow as an environmental covariate. Despite high site fidelity in tidal-fresh zones, some individuals displayed movements into oligohaline and mesohaline habitats indicative of partial migration. Once downstream movement occurred, the probability of staying in the new salinity zone was higher than the probability of movements to other salinity zones. In the Rappahannock River only, movement upstream from mesohaline habitats was associated with below average flow. As flow increased, the probability of remaining in oligohaline and mesohaline zones increased. Our study shows blue catfish can move into downstream areas of tidal rivers with elevated salinities and that increased freshwater flow may allow them to remain in these habitats for extended durations.

AB  - Spatial heterogeneity in environmental conditions may restrict the spread of invasive species to narrow corridors between extensive patches of suitable habitat; thus, we may be able to curtail invasions by identifying such corridors, and focusing control efforts in these areas. Invasive cane toads Rhinella marina have spread rapidly through northern Australia, but to invade further into Western Australia, the toads must traverse a narrow arid corridor where artificial waterbodies may serve as critical stepping stones for range expansion. We focus on the cane toads' imminent expansion into north-western Australia and use stochastic simulation to identify areas in which removal of artificial waterbodies would be most effective at stopping their spread. Our model predicts that toads will spread from the Kimberley to the Pilbara regions of Western Australia through a narrow coastal corridor, but that they will depend upon artificial waterbodies to do so. Importantly, excluding toads from artificial waterbodies is predicted to prevent toads from colonizing c. 268200km2 of their potential range in Western Australia. We identified three locations where closure of a relatively small subset of artificial waterbodies is predicted to halt the spread of toads. Synthesis and applications. We present a modelling framework that can be used to focus management activities within invasion corridors. Our analyses suggest that strategic removal of potential invasion hubs along such corridors can halt the spread of an invasive species.

AB  - Coyotes (Canis latrans) are now ubiquitous throughout most of the eastern United States; however, little information exists on how they are able to exploit and thrive in fragmented landscapes. We investigated home ranges, movements, and scale-dependent resource selection of coyotes along a gradient (suburban/exurban/rural) of anthropogenic disturbance. Home-range sizes varied along a suburban-to-rural gradient and were inversely correlated to urbanization (R-2 = 0.79, P < 0.001). Habitat composition and coyote use of 95% (home range) and 50% (core area) contours were nonrandom. Coyotes used corridor habitat extensively and avoided urban and crop-field habitats. Forested habitat was used extensively for diurnal cover. Rural coyotes traveled greater distances at faster rates than did suburban/exurban coyotes. Diet activity patterns were similar along the gradient, suggesting that coyotes responded similarly to differing levels and types of human activity. Coyotes appeared to assess habitat quality, at the landscape scale and exploited small, disjunct resource patches present in developed landscapes. We believe that the availability of foraging habitat and travel corridors is critical to movement of coyotes in areas of high human activity.

AB  - The environmental conflict throughout land development varies for every landform. In hilly areas, the ecological effects, such as the properties of the land surface and the diversity of flora and fauna cannot be reflected through assessment indexes, which include the building density, green areas ratio, etc. This paper is to provide the impervious index and the corridor index as a complement to the master planners. The indexes is an approach that integrates ecological landscape principles and methods for analyzing the eco-rationality of the master planning using ecological indexes which provides a measure for adjusting development density. An application of the indexes to the residential development of Kunming Expo Eco-town in Yunnan Province, China is provided. The result shows that the indexes can be used to quantify the interrelationship between the development project and the environment and that the required regulatory measures for land development can be implemented via master plans.

AB  - Two new records of gomphotheriid proboscideans, one identified as Rhynchotherium and the other as Cuvieronius, are reported in Mexico. Both records are in the southwesternmost points of their known distributional range.
   The remains of both genera consist of molars and tusks. Their measurements were compared with data available from the literature and collection specimens. The molar index of Rhymchotherium shows statistical differences between m2 and M2, and ru3 and M3. However, differences between the m3 from both genera are not statistically significant, despite, light morphological differences.
   This suggests that metric and morphological information Should be included for a reliable identification of isolated molars and, if available, any other data of the associated tusk.
   All known records relating to both genera Suggest that they found Southwestern Mexico favorable for use as a dispersal corridor to South America, likely due to the region's tropical Or Subtropical climate. However, some distributional gaps in central Mexico need to be resolved for Rhynchotherium. There are also important populations of Cuvieronius in central Mexico, and preliminary information Suggests that they occupied at least parts of eastern Mexico. as well.

AB  - Exotic species can threaten native ecosystems and reduce services that ecosystems provide to humans. Early detection of incipient populations of exotic species is a key step in containing exotics before explosive population growth and corresponding impacts occur. We report the results of the first three years of an exotic plant early detection and treatment program conducted along more than 3,000 km of transportation corridors within an area > 1.5 million ha in the Mojave Desert, USA. Incipient populations of 43 exotic plant species were mapped using global positioning and geographic information systems. Brassica tournefortii (Sahara mustard) infested the most soil types (47% of 256) surveyed in the study area, while Nicotiana glauca (tree tobacco) and others currently occupy less than 5% of soil types. Malcolmia africana (African mustard) was disproportionately detected on gypsum soils, occurring on 59% of gypsum soil types compared to 27% of all surveyed soils. Gypsum soils constitute unique rare plant habitat in this region, and by conventional wisdom were not previously considered prone to invasion. While this program has provided an initial assessment of the landscape-scale distribution of exotic species along transportation corridors, evaluations of both the survey methods and the effectiveness of treating incipient populations are needed. An exotic plant information system most useful to resource mangers will likely include integrating planning oriented coarse-scale surveys, more detailed monitoring of targeted locations, and research on species life histories, community invasibility, and treatment effectiveness.

AB  - Spatially stratified integrated population models (IPMs) can account for fine-scale demographic processes and support spatial management for complex, heterogeneous populations. Although spatial IPMs may provide a more realistic representation of true population dynamics, few studies have evaluated the consequences associated with incorrect assumptions regarding population structure and connectivity. We utilized a simulation-estimation framework to explore how mismatches between the true population structure (i.e. uniform, single population with spatial heterogeneity or metapopulation) and various parametrizations of an IPM (i.e. panmictic, fleets-as-areas or a spatially explicit, tag-integrated model) impacted resultant fish population estimates. When population structure was incorrectly specified in the IPM, parameter estimates were generally unbiased at the system level, but were often biased for sub-areas. Correctly specifying population structure in spatial IPMs led to strong performance, whereas incorrectly specified spatial IPMs performed adequately (and better than spatially aggregated counterparts). Allowing for flexible parametrization of movement rates (e.g. estimating age-varying values) was more important than correctly identifying the population structure, and incorporation of tag-recapture data helped movement estimation. Our results elucidate how incorrect population structure assumptions can influence the estimation of key parameters of spatial IPMs, while indicating that, even if incorrectly specified, spatial IPMs can adequately support spatial management decisions.

AB  - In recent years populations of howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata) in southeastern Mexico have decreased substantially due to the transformation and loss of natural habitats. This is especially evident in the Santa Marta mountain range, Veracruz, Mexico where several studies have evaluated the impact of fragmentation on howler monkey populations in order to propose management programs for their conservation. The conditions generated by fragmentation likely change the rates of parasitic infection and could decrease howler survival. In this study, gastrointestinal parasite species richness, prevalence, and egg density of infection were determined in howler groups inhabiting five forest fragments at the Santa Marta mountain range. Two hundred and seventy-eight fresh fecal samples were collected between October 2002 and April 2003. Three parasite species were found during the dry and the wet season in all forest fragments sampled: one unidentified species of Eimeriidae; Topanoxyuris minutus (Oxyuridae); and Controrchis biliophilus (Dicrocoeliidae). Both the prevalence of T. minutus and infection density for all parasites differed between seasons and fragments (the largest fragment consistently differed from other fragments). Host density, distance to the nearest town, fragment size, fragment shape, and total basal area of food trees explained parasite prevalence, but each species had a different pattern. Although parasite richness was lower, prevalence and density were higher than values reported for howlers in conserved forests. These results suggest that the establishment of biological corridors and animal translocation programs must take into account the parasite ecology of each fragment to avoid higher infection rates and preclude potential consequent mortality.

AB  - Motor vehicle collisions with white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) present several problems including danger to humans, vehicle damage, and deer mortality. Knowledge of factors influencing deer movements onto or across roads and highways may reduce deer/vehicle collisions on existing roads, and improve planning for future roads. We used remotely sensed data to determine characteristics associated with high accident areas. Topographic features and highway construction variables considered conducive to deer/vehicle accidents were measured around high accident road segments (greater than or equal to 15 accidents from 1989-1993) and randomly selected control sites. Variables were measured on aerial photographs and topographic maps within a 0.8 km radius of the road segments. Landscape composition and spatial structure were quantified with the computer program FRAGSTATS, using a statewide land cover classification derived from Landsat V TM satellite imagery. A logistic regression model composed of site variables predicted that greater distance to forest cover decreased the probability of a road segment being a high deer/vehicle accident site. The presence of adjacent gullies, riparian travel corridors crossing the road, and public recreational land within the 0.8 bm radius increased this probability. A model using only landscape metrics derived from satellite imagery predicted that greater landscape diversity and shorter distances between nearby forest patches increased the probability of a road segment being a high deer/vehicle accident site. Both models discriminated between high and low deer kill sites. Therefore, proactive management of negative deer/human interactions may be accomplished through remote sensing and geographical information systems, (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Conservation organizations and public agencies are interested in identifying and prioritizing areas for conservation action, often acquisition or easements. Typically, this requires the use of uncertain data and vaguely defined decision criteria. I developed a decision support system to address these uncertainty issues and assist in evaluating conservation opportunities for the endangered California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) in Santa Barbara, California. Functionally defined planning units were used to aggregate data on land suitability, land cover change, salamander presence, and movement risk along potential linkages between breeding ponds. I used a fuzzy-logic-based inference engine to evaluate the planning units and rank the relative suitability of interpond linkages for conservation action. The sensitivity of the rankings was considered with respect to uncertainty in salamander occurrence data and the relationship between land-cover-change threats and site suitability. All linkages were substantially degraded, but five areas were consistently identified with high relative suitability for conservation action despite differences in assumptions and uncertainty in biological data. The combination of functionally defined planning units and a fuzzy-logic-based decision support system provides a general framework for considering the suitability of sites for conservation action.

AB  - Humans have long favored settlement along rivers for access to water for drinking and agriculture, transport corridors, and food sources. Settlement in or near montane tropical (and other) forests include additional benefits such as food and wood supply, and high quality water derived from watersheds where upstream human disturbance and environmental degradation are generally low. However, the advantages afforded by these floodplain and montane settings are offset by episodic risks to communities located there as floods, landslides, wildfires, volcanoes, (and tsunamis for coastal communities), cause loss of life and damage or destroy infrastructure and crops. A basic understanding of rainfall and flood patterns, as well as hillslope stability, by residents in these environments mitigates these risks. Modern global urbanization, particularly in regions of rapid economic growth, has resulted in much of this "organic" knowledge being lost, as megacities encroach on floodplains and mountain fronts. Moreover, the most likely occupants of these hazardous locations are often marginalized economically, which increases their vulnerability. Effective stewardship of river floodplains and upstream montane forests maintains a key ecosystem service, which in addition to the well-described services, (i.e. water, food, hydroelectric energy, wood products, carbon sequestration, maintenance of biodiversity, etc.) is the mitigation of natural hazards and vulnerability.

AB  - California statewide West Nile virus (WNV) minimum infection rates in Culex thriambus Dyar mosquitoes are high; however, few specimens are submitted and tested each year, as their distribution seems limited to larval habitats along riparian systems. To evaluate the role of Cx. thriambus in the amplification, maintenance, and overwintering of WNV in Lake County, CA, the bionomics and vector potential of the species was investigated during 2014 and 2015. Culex thriambus was the most abundant mosquito species, with 1,153 adults and 7,624 immatures collected by vacuum aspiration and dip sampling, respectively, at the primary study site. Detection of WNV in four mosquito pools during September through November coincided with peak seasonality. Females entered and maintained a reproductive diapause during winter under field and seminatural conditions. Diapause was initiated in the majority of Cx. thriambus females by October and was terminated by 30 March. Some parous females (7.1%) and those in host-seeking arrest (7.1%) were collected throughout the winter period. An accrual of 679.51 degree-days (degrees D) was necessary for diapause termination under seminatural conditions. Culex thriambus females fed on 16 different avian species during spring and summer, and no mammalian feeds were detected. West Nile viral RNA was detected in four of 42 Cx. thriambus pools tested during June through November and infection rates ranged from 3.53-28.15/1,000 tested. In summary, WNV transmission may be increased along riparian corridors throughout California where Cx. thriambus mosquitoes remain relatively abundant.

AB  - Floodplains are highly diverse landscape elements within river systems and among the most endangered ecosystems worldwide. In this paper we complement indices developed to assess the ecological status of floodplain systems, compliant with the EU Water Framework Directive, to an overall "Benthic Invertebrate Floodplain Index" (BIFI). With the addition of taxa (mainly oligochaetes, chironomidae and amphipoda) to the floodplain index (FI), caddisfly (CHI), and dragon fly (OHI) indices a new extended BIFI can be calculated. We provide values for the calculation of the index derived from a comprehensive dataset of Austrian floodplain waters complemented by literature data. Values are given for those taxonomic groups which are abundant in the Austrian Danube and determinable in reasonable time. The new index was compared to published floodplain indices and tested with an independent data set at two floodplain segments along the Austrian Danube. The newly classified benthic invertebrates (NCB') showed a good performance in comparison to the so far published indices and extend these to a better coverage of dynamic water bodies. Further the inclusion of abundant and species rich taxa improves the robustness of calculated values already with a low sampling effort. Altogether it is a promising tool for the integrated assessment of the ecological status of river-floodplain systems according to the EU Water Framework Directive.

AB  - fragmented woodlands in agricultural regions of Australia, roadside environments (road verges) provide important refuges for threatened native fauna and isolated populations of plant species. However, as roads are transport corridors for humans and their vehicles; species survival is affected through destruction, fragmentation and modification of remaining habitat by human activity. Few studies have recognised the effects of anthropogenic disturbances, in the form of historical roadworks activities, on adjacent roadside plant populations. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of soil disturbance from roadworks on the spatial patterns and structural dynamics of roadside Acacia populations in an agricultural area in southeastern Australia. Stem size and disturbance data were collected from 135 roadside populations of three species of Acacia shrubs in the Lockhart Shire area. Spatial pattern analysis using the Network K-function and Discriminant Function analyses showed that road verge width, road category, disturbance intensity and distance to nearest town were highly significant variables in relation to disturbance from roadworks and shrub structural dynamics. Colonising populations were more abundant along gravel roads where soil disturbance intensity was high, whereas stable populations were more abundant where soil disturbance intensity was low. Senescent populations were more abundant in narrow, little used road verge corridors 4-6 km from nearby towns. These results suggest that anthropogenic disturbance regimes may be critical to shrub recruitment and persistence in roadside environments, which has important consequences for conservation of threatened native flora and fauna in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - Several canid fossils, which were originally discovered and described in the early 20th century, are known from Early and earliest Middle Pleistocene of Java (Indonesia). Here we revise the taxonomy and relative age of the Javanese canid fossils in light of recent developments in the taxonomy and phylogeny of Canidae, and new insights in the evolution of island mammals. Results show that Cuon was absent during the Early and earliest Middle Pleistocene while the large-sized Xenocyon (previously Megacyon) was present in the Early Pleistocene and replaced by the small-sized Xenocyon (previously Mececyon) during the earliest Middle Pleistocene. The latter is probably an anagenetic dwarf derived from the larger form of the preceding period. The change in body size of Xenocyon on Java over time is likely the effect of increased competition within the carnivore guild within the restricted boundaries of the island. Simultaneously with a pronounced body size shift, a dietary shift from large-sized prey to much smaller prey must have taken place in order to meet energetic constraints. The degree of endemism of terrestrial mammals of the earliest Middle Pleistocene horizon of the site Trinil, which has also yielded Homo erectus fossils, indicates that during this period, Java was marginally isolated which allowed for a corridor dispersal to the island with subsequent vicariance. The nature and degree of isolation may have been similar to that of Late Pleistocene Sicily, but of a longer duration, given the higher degree of dwarfism of the stegodon, antilope and canid. The following continentalisation enabled the invasion by mainland terrestrial mammals, as is seen in younger layers at Trinil, and eventually by Homo sapiens and Cuon in the Late Pleistocene / Holocene.

AB  - Recent assessments by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) indicate the existence of about 612 recognized primate species and subspecies (IUCN RedList, 2012), but close to 50% of these taxa are at risk of extinction as a result of human action. In this article, I call attention to underlying regional and global socioeconomic contexts of primate conservation. Using information from FAO and UN databases and other sources, I examine, for the Neotropics, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia, trends in forest loss and human demographics and social condition, discuss the impact of global market pressures upon primate habitats, and examine land-use patterns that may favor primate conservation. Between 1990 and 2010, an estimated 149 million ha of forest were lost in the three regions and additional losses are expected in the future. Global human population will increase from 7 billion in 2012 to 9 billion in 2050. Currently, 2 billion people live in the three primate range regions under high levels of poverty. Large-scale deforestation is related to global market demands, especially from developed and developing nations, for food (e.g., cattle), domestic animal feed (e.g., soybeans), biofuel-based crops (e.g., oil palm), and industrial round wood. The growth of protected areas in the three regions has been steady for several decades, but it is not enough to ensure long-term conservation of many primate taxa. Other conservations tools involving sustainable land use and biodiversity conservation corridors are required at the landscape level. The above assessment can easily be applied at the local level by primatologists, giving more precision to conservation initiatives. Am. J. Primatol. 75:30-45, 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The Regional Connector Transit Corridor (RCTC) project consists of an 89-m long, 17.7-m wide, and 11-m high span crossover cavern constructed beneath critical infrastructure using the sequential excavation method (SEM) at relatively shallow depth (15 m below ground surface) in downtown Los Angeles. The cavern construction involved a complex three-drift, two-sidewall configuration and was excavated in the Fernando formation, a weak clayey siltstone. This paper presents a comprehensive case study of the cavern excavation and initial support construction. The performance of the urban SEM was assessed and complex ground behavior was examined once per excavation step during the construction process. The overall average surface settlement was 20 mm and the largest single-stage incremental movements occurred in the center bench and invert excavation, accounting for 30%-40% of the total deformation. The subsurface experienced less differential settlement during the side drift excavations due to the ovate excavation profile and the restriction from surrounding infrastructure. The measured center crown vertical displacement varied between 5 and 10 mm and the center invert initial support was recorded to heave 8-12 mm. A systematic procedure was developed to apply a deliberate observational method. The lessons learned support that appropriate real-time analysis improves the quality of regular data review, continuously updating the knowledge of risk and enabling prompt adaptions and optimizations of the design and construction along the SEM tunneling process.

AB  - Structures of habitat fragments interact with autecologies of resident species to produce patterns in taxonomic richness. Understanding this interaction is crucial to habitat conservation. We studied the vertebrates inhabiting fragments of the severely threatened sand pine scrub habitat of interior peninsular Florida. We surveyed 16 scrubs in south-central Florida that were categorized as either ''large,'' ''medium,'' or ''small.'' For each scrub, we determined (1) vegetational structure, (2) vegetational composition, (3) distance to the nearest scrub, (4) distance to the nearest larger scrub, (5) presence/absence of potential ''corridor'' habitats between scrubs, (6) types of habitats between scrubs, (7) distance to the nearest permanent water, (8) percent coverage of surrounding habitats, and (9) area reduction over time. The principal methods used to census nonavian taxa were pitfall and double-ended funnel traps, while the principal method for avian taxa was transect surveys.
   Many of the nine scrub attributes were intercorrelated. Scrub size was the only attribute that correlated strongly with vertebrate richness. Distance, both to permanent water and to the nearest scrub, correlated strongly with nonavian richness after the influence of size was removed, however. We detected significant nestedness, but when the taxon-area relationship was taken into consideration, we could not demonstrate that any taxa were excluded from small scrubs. We constructed joint lists of taxa from various hypothetical ''archipelagos'' of the 16 individual scrubs, and found that the archipelagos often supported more taxa than large individual scrubs. We found no tendency for small scrubs to be depauperate, in general, and no matter how rare taxa were identified, they were more common than expected in medium and small scrubs, and less common than expected in large scrubs.
   The mere observation of either a taxon-area relationship or a nested taxonomic composition reveals little about underlying ecological processes. Our detailed analysis leads us to conclude that no evidence indicates the need for single large scrub reserves for resident vertebrates: an archipelago of individually smaller reserves could support at least as many taxa. This conclusion is based solely on the simple presence-absence of taxa in scrubs that were treated as replicates within size categories, however, and consideration of the abundances and distributions of individual taxa, and of the variation among scrubs of similar size, may lead to a different conclusion.

AB  - Endemic species face a variety of threats including predation from non-native invaders. In some cases, however, invasive species can be managed by directly suppressing populations, and tracking technologies that allow researchers to identify movement patterns and aggregations representative of the population can facilitate suppression activities. In Yellowstone Lake (Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming), invasive lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) have been the target of a population suppression program for over two decades. For this form of management, the reproductive period is particularly important because fish migrate to and from spawning grounds. From 2011 to 2014, adult lake trout (n = 317) in Yellowstone Lake were tracked using acoustic biotelemetry. After controlling for spatial and temporal dependency in the data, total abundance of unique individuals was estimated where migratory trajectories occurred at confirmed spawning sites. Aggregations and migratory trajectories were further estimated at locations where spawning had not previously been observed. Across years, the greatest number of individuals was observed along a migration corridor in the southwestern area of the lake. Novel strategies for analyzing acoustic telemetry data provided insights into the behavior of an invasive fish species. By betraying the positions of conspecifics, tagged fish revealed potentially important reproductive habitats and migration corridors that warranted further investigation as possible sites for population suppression.

AB  - Current data seem to suggest that the earliest hominins only occupied the Northwest of Europe during favourable climatic periods, and left the area when the climate was too cold and dry, in the same way as Neandertal and even Homo sapiens. However, several sites in England and the North of France indicate that the earliest hominins, possibly Homo antecessor and/or Homo heidelbergensis, could adapt to cool environments and open grasslands without the use of fire. Recent discoveries of Acheulean lithic assemblages in early glacial fluvial deposits at Moulin Quignon in the Somme Valley in the Northwest of France reveal new knowledge on the earliest occupations in north-western territories and indicate hominins' capacity to live above the c. 45th N. under a cold climate. The site shows evidence of occupations at the beginning of MIS 16 at around 650-670 ka. These findings bring to the forefront the possible ability, flexibility and resilience of Acheulean hominins at around 700 ka to extend to northern territories during transitional climatic periods (interglacial/glacial events), even if the climate was not fully favourable. Recent fieldwork has changed our interpretation of the timing and characteristics of the earliest Acheulean techno-complexes in Western Europe over a large geographical area, from Northwest Europe to the Mediterranean coast. In Western Europe, the earliest evidence, Moulin Quignon, is now dated to a narrow timeframe, between 700-650 ka, and is the northernmost evidence of biface production. This latter is earlier than British Acheulean records. Based on new findings at Moulin Quignon, we explore whether Acheulean traditions and associated new technological abilities could have facilitated the dispersal of hominins in Western Europe over large territories, regardless of climatic conditions. Changes in behavioural flexibility, and not only phenotypic changes in Homo groups, have to be investigated. Here, we examine the behavioural and technological abilities of hominins in north-western Europe in light of the available environmental data and compare them to those in southern areas between 700 and 600 ka. This event occurred at the end of the "Middle Pleistocene Transition" (MPT), a period marked by cyclical climate changes and vegetation and faunal turnovers (less competition with big carnivores). The extension of the grassland habitat into higher latitudes could have led to the opening and/or closing of migration corridors in these regions, probably favouring hominin expansion depending on tolerance to climate variability.

AB  - Effective conservation of amphibian populations requires the prediction of how amphibians use and move through a landscape. Amphibians are closely coupled to their physical environment. Thus an approach that uses the physiological attributes of amphibians, together with knowledge of their natural history, should be helpful. We used Niche Mapper (TM) to model the known movements and habitat use patterns of a population of Western toads (Anaxyrus (=Bufo) boreas) occupying forested habitats in southeastern Idaho. Niche Mapper uses first principles of environmental biophysics to combine features of topography, climate, land cover, and animal features to model microclimates and animal physiology and behavior across landscapes. Niche Mapper reproduced core body temperatures (T-c) and evaporation rates of live toads with average errors of 1.6 +/- 0.4 degrees C and 0.8 +/- 0.2 g/h, respectively. For four different habitat types, it reproduced similar mid-summer daily temperature patterns as those measured in the field and calculated evaporation rates (g/h) with an average error rate of 7.2 +/- 5.5%. Sensitivity analyses indicate these errors do not significantly affect estimates of food consumption or activity. Using Niche Mapper we predicted the daily habitats used by free-ranging toads: our accuracy for female toads was greater than for male toads (74.2 +/- 6.8% and 53.6 +/- 15.8%, respectively), reflecting the stronger patterns of habitat selection among females. Using these changing to construct a cost surface, we also reconstructed movement paths that were consistent with field observations. The effect of climate warming on toads depends on the interaction of temperature and atmospheric moisture. If climate change occurs as predicted, results from Niche Mapper suggests that climate warming will increase the physiological cost of landscapes thereby limiting the activity for toads in different habitats.

AB  - Ailanthus alrissima (Tree of Heaven), an invasive tree species native to China and East Asia. was first introduced into the US ca. 1784 by William Hamilton at his Philadelphia, PA estate. However, the means and temporal progression of spread from this and other early points of introduction are not clear. This species now occurs in >40 US states, primarily as an urban and roadside weed. The Northeast supports the highest densities of Ailanthus within the US, mainly in transportation corridors and urban areas, where it has become the dominant tree species. A recent, widespread increase in Allan thus incidence in eastern hardwood forests, not unlike prior invasions along railways and roadsides, suggests that current conditions favor invasion in natural environments. To help elucidate the life history of Ailanthus in Pennsylvania and the northeastern US, as well as answer fundamental biological questions concerning this species, we conducted dendrochronological (tree-ring) studies and floristic surveys beginning in 2010. Although we studied population dynamics, age structure, and tree-ring characteristics of Ailanthus primarily in Pennsylvania, we supplemented our studies using trees from adjacent northeastern states. Floristic studies, conducted between 2010 and 2011, revealed Ailanthus to be present in 60 of 67 Pennsylvania counties, including nine previously unreported counties. Tree-ring studies of these trees, as well as of trees from adjacent states, indicated Ailanthus was a suitable species for tree-ring analyses, although false rings were observed in >20% of trees examined. Our results also revealed Ailanthus to be longer-lived than previously reported, reaching ages >100 years, at which time female trees still produced viable seed. However, extant Ailanthus did not exceed 120 years in age, and therefore could not be directly linked with any documented late 18th-century or early 19th-century plantings. Nevertheless, continuous colonization in southeastern Pennsylvania, spanning two centuries, by overlapping generations of Ailanthus was supported by observations at Bartram's garden in Philadelphia. Regression analysis revealed that tree diameter was a significant predictor (le = 0.80) of Ailanthus age and could be used to estimate ages of historic trees whose diameters were reported in early literature, which revealed establishment of Ailanthus in six Pennsylvania counties 70-118 years earlier than previously reported. Tree-ring studies of extant trees revealed that Aar/nth/is had gone unreported in some counties for 50 years, during which subsequent invasions occurred. Lastly, we report that widespread invasion of forests by Ailanthus is a relatively recent phenomenon in Pennsylvania, with most invasions occurring after 1965, following major forest disturbances such as salvage logging in the aftermath of widespread insect defoliator outbreaks, especially Lymantria c//spar (Gypsy Moth) defoliations. These findings are consistent with previously reported lag times between initial colonization and the onset of rapid range expansion for other invasive plant species. Our results emphasize the need for more thorough inventories of A ilanthus within forests prior to harvesting. Such inventories will afford forest managers opportunities to preemptively eradicate Ailanthus and mitigate future invasions by this species.

AB  - This paper describes the transitional zones of vernacular and modern buildings in Abu Dhabi. A transitional zone is described as non steady-state spaces like entrance lobbies, corridors, lift-lobbies and landings, which allow occupants to transition through to more steady-state spaces. In particular, this paper draws from literature the effect vegetation-based microclimates may have on the vicinity of a dwelling, which may reduce the indoor cooling load. This study will involve a summary history of earlier transitional zones in vernacular architecture in Abu Dhabi, which uses little energy and purely by design, creates a comfortable environment. Passive designs in particular, allow a comfortable environment for occupants in high-heat desert conditions. This paper discusses the use of vernacular designs for present-day Abu Dhabi to create intermediate non-steady state spaces for relief from the heat. The Kansara Transitional Zone Survey was used to ask occupants (guests or otherwise) how their behaviour, comfort, satisfaction and productivity were affected in the transitional zones. The questions were asked upon immediate entry into the transitional zone. This paper discusses the format and content of the questions. The results of the survey are displayed followed by a discussion. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The entire region of Vojvodina (region in northern Serbia) is an agricultural - steppe - forest zone. The area of Vojvodina covers 2,150,000 ha of which arable land is 1,579,643 ha (73,45 %). Total forested area is about 130,000 ha or 6% of the total area. At present, all the ecosystems (agro and forest ecosystems), in this region are highly endangered. This is the consequence of local and global economic activities after 1945, which altered societies relationship with the natural environment (Bouma et al., 1998). The soils in Vojvodina are affected by aridification, acidification, eutrophication and pollution. As a region with highly productive agricultural soil, it is subject to and endangered by, different destructive processes, primarily wind erosion, that is climatic extremes, because of which its maximal productive potential cannot be utilised. Wind erosion, as a very destructive factor, causes the detachment and transport of the most fertile particles of the arable topsoil, permanently changing its fertility properties. In addition droughts might also reduce yield. This is multiplied by potential effects of climate changes. Environmental improvement is only possible by integral understanding of urban, non-urban and green spaces, rural landscapes, protective green areas, diversity in agro-ecological areas and protected areas. That is why afforestation is planned over almost 100,000 ha by the establishment of different types of forest plantations and other plantations, such as greenways, shelterbelts, bee-keeping plantations, buffer plantations, eco-corridors, etc. By the implementation of planned afforestation, it could be possible to increase the yield in agriculture, timber production, protection against wind, to improve the environmental conditions, production of honey, development of hunting, sports, recreation tourism and sustainable land use.

AB  - At the land surface, the availability of water controls the evolution of life as well as the morphological development. It is currently hardly known how far both evolutionary processes interact in water-limited environments. While it is well considered that biotic processes contribute to weathering and therewith also prepare the landscape for erosion, little is known to what degree different landforms form barriers and corridors of life across geological time scales. Here, we present an example of how to tackle this complex interplay of biology and landscape evolution by introducing the Collaborative Research Centre CRC 1211 'Earth - Evolution at the dry limit'. A CRC is a German Research Foundation funding program, bringing together scientists from different disciplines to tackle jointly complex emergent research questions for up to twelve years. The CRC 1211 focuses on the arid cores of the Atacama Desert and the Namib Desert. Main objective is to disentangle how the shaping of land-surfaces by past episodes of wetter climate coevolved with the evolution of life. It is hypothesized that aridity was interrupted by punctuated wetter periods, which left fingerprints in surface processes and the radiation of the biota, with climatic thresholds beyond which biota could adapt to and influence landscape development. Specific desert landscape elements such as soil surface crusts, desiccation cracks and subsoil water potentially form underexplored refugia of life at particular sites, while old channels and alluvial fan systems potentially structure its dispersal at small to intermediate scales (< 100 m(2)), In addition, there are large-scale (> 10,000 km(2)) gradients in surface processes and biodiversity, likely controlled by the intensity and duration of fog or rainfall. To substantiate these hypotheses we combine expertise from the fields of population and (phylo-) genetics, molecular biology, biogeography, ecology, soil sciences, Earth-surface sciences, geomorphology, meteorology, (paleo-) climatology, (isotope-) geochemistry and physical dating to discover and evaluate the trajectories and thresholds of the evolution and isolation of life. While presenting here our current research strategy, we invite scientists from all over the world to link their research on related questions for the joint development of a global picture on how evolution of life was triggered and regulated by land-surface processes.

AB  - Phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses can enhance our understanding of multispecies interactions by placing the origin and evolution of such interactions in a temporal and geographical context. We use a phylogenomic approach-ultraconserved element sequence capture-to investigate the evolutionary history of an iconic multispecies mutualism: Neotropical acacia ants (Pseudomyrmex ferrugineus group) and their associated Vachellia hostplants. In this system, the ants receive shelter and food from the host plant, and they aggressively defend the plant against herbivores and competing plants. We confirm the existence of two separate lineages of obligate acacia ants that convergently occupied Vachellia and evolved plant-protecting behaviour, from timid ancestors inhabiting dead twigs in rainforest. The more diverse of the two clades is inferred to have arisen in the Late Miocene in northern Mesoamerica, and subsequently expanded its range throughout much of Central America. The other lineage is estimated to have originated in southern Mesoamerica about 3 Myr later, apparently piggy-backing on the pre-existing mutualism. Initiation of the Pseudomyrmex/Vachellia interaction involved a shift in the ants fromclosed to open habitats, into an environment with more intense plant herbivory. Comparative studies of the two lineages of mutualists should provide insight into the essential features binding this mutualism.

AB  - Understanding the spatial ecology of sturgeon (Acipenseridae) has proven to be a challenge due to the life history characteristics of these fish, especially their long life span, intermittent spawning, and long-distance migrations. Within the Huron-Erie Corridor (HEC) of the Laurentian Great Lakes, habitat use of 247 lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) was monitored over a three-year period (2015-2017) with acoustic transmitters. Extensive spatial coverage of receivers throughout the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, and Detroit River between Lake Huron and Lake Erie (similar to 150 km) allowed for continuous monitoring of the movements of acoustic-tagged individuals. Sequence analysis of individual detection histories was used to describe lake sturgeon habitat use and to determine (1) whether distinct habitat-use patterns occurred within the HEC; (2) whether the range of habitats occupied varied across seasons among sturgeon grouped by common patterns; and (3) whether variation identified was related to tagging sites in the two rivers or sex. Lake sturgeon were active throughout the HEC, but five distinct habitat-use patterns were identified. River residents were not broadly distributed across entire rivers, but rather associated with particular segments (middle Detroit River, St. Clair River delta). Variations in habitat-use sequences were in part related to three river tagging sites, but not sex, and did not produce groups with sequences that reflected all five habitat-use patterns derived from cluster analysis. Lake sturgeon distribution was reduced to fewer habitat segments during winter and expanded to the maximum extent during the spring and summer. Conservation planning that incorporates behavioral diversity of habitat use is relatively rare due to a lack of observations on movements of individuals at biologically relevant spatial and temporal scales, but using telemetry and sequence analysis methods may promote the success of conservation and restoration efforts.

AB  - The Appalachian Trail traverses 3300 km (2050 miles) of the Appalachian Mountains from Maine to Georgia in the eastern USA. Except for the Cumberland Valley (the Great Valley of the Ridge and Valley region of the Appalachian Mountains) in Pennsylvania, and a few other valley crossings, the Trail passes primarily along forested ridges. The Cumberland Valley is the longest valley crossing of the Trail-26 km (16 miles) of intensively cultivated prime farmland undergoing residential and commercial development. To secure public ownership of the Trail through this urbanizing landscape, the US Department of the Interior, through the National Park Service, acquired a 600 ha (1500 acre) corridor through the Cumberland Valley to be managed and maintained by the volunteers of the Appalachian Trail Conference. This study was developed by a project team from the Department of Landscape Architecture of The Pennsylvania State University, for the Appalachian Trail Conference, as a set of planning, design, and management recommendations for the newly acquired trail corridor. The method of study involves developing (1) an understanding of the Trail, its history, and its users; (2) a general understanding of the natural and cultural conditions of the region; (3) a more specific inventory, analysis, and assessment of the natural and cultural, elements of the trail corridor. This process reveals a corridor landscape containing the interpretable evidence of 250 years of agrarian landscape history and a diverse set of physical environments and biotic communities that have been fragmented by that land use.
   The two central ideas explored in this paper that underlie the planning and design of the Trail greenway across the Cumberland Valley are, first, the conservation and interpretation of the cultural landscape, and, second, the reduction of habitat fragmentation and enhancement of biological diversity. The product of the planning and design of the corridor land is a set of recommendations intended to direct future actions within the valley corridor. The cultural landscape recommendations focus on maintaining the fabric and interrelationships of the cultural landscape by including a complete representation of both the structural and biotic cultural resources. The ecological recommendations focus on protection of existing natural resources, establishment of forest habitat linkages, and restoration of native plant communities. Finally, two examples of the corridor planning, design, and management study are presented as a case study in greenway planning and design in response to cultural landscape conservation and landscape ecology.

AB  - Ranunculus ficaria is an invasive plant species in the northeastern United States, especially in urban riparian habitats. Changes in the frequency and intensity of flooding events in these urban riparian corridors create patches of heavy litter and patches of bare ground. Many plant species either cannot penetrate deep litter, or they are susceptible to freezing temperatures and drying conditions on bare ground. This can result in competitive advantages for invasive species that are adapted to these varying conditions. We conducted a field experiment to test the effects of leaf litter depth on R. ficaria biomass, bulbil production, flower production, and seed production under deep (20 cm) litter, intermediate (10 cm) litter, shallow (5 cm) litter, and bare ground along an urban stream in Louisville, Kentucky. Deep litter and lack of litter decreased plant biomass compared with shallow litter. Bulbil production was not significantly different across treatments. Flower and seed production were only reduced in deep litter. Ranunculus ficaria's ability to maintain production across a large range of litter depths may provide a competitive advantage over plant species not adapted to varying litter depths.

AB  - Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), is the most destructive pest of potato in many countries of the world. It first invaded China from Kazakhstan in 1990s and now is a major pest of potato in many areas of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang). The objective of this study was to determine the effect of temperature on the spread of Colorado potato beetle in China after its invasion. Cold temperature in winter (December) and high temperature in summer (July) were analyzed in accordance with the absence and presence of Colorado potato beetle in Xinjiang. The boundary between the absence and presence of Colorado potato beetle in Xinjiang nearly coincided with the -8 degrees C isotherm of monthly mean minimum temperature in winter. The stress of the low temperature in winter for Colorado potato beetle basically disappeared in the southeastern Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province of China, suggesting that the Hexi Corridor is the best channel to prevent any long-distance invasions of Colorado potato beetle into the Central Plains region. However, in Turpan City in northeastern Xinjiang, the extremely hot weather in the summer prevents the local colonization of Colorado potato beetle. Furthermore, according to our monitoring, high temperature in summer also limited Colorado potato beetle to diffuse eastward through Turpan. Results of this study suggest that it is essential to strengthen inspection and quarantine measures to prevent any artificial transmissions of Colorado potato beetle spreading eastward and thus to ensure the sustainable production of potato and other Solanaceae crops in northwest regions of China.

AB  - We investigated spatial use patterns of 77 Caribbean reef sharks (Carcharhinus perezi) at Lighthouse Reef Atoll, Belize over 7 years using residency patterns, kernel density (KD) estimation and network analysis. We found a high degree individual variation in spatial use of the atoll, but there were significant differences in residency and activity space between sexes, with females being overall more resident. Ontogenetic shifts in movement and residency were largely limited to females, as the residency index increased and activity space estimates decreased as females matured, while for males there was no relationship between space use or residency and size. KD analysis revealed many mature females were highly resident to discrete locations, and average activity space of the intermediate-sized sharks was significantly larger than that of the adults, but not the smallest sharks. Markov chain analyses indicated that the southwestern portion of the atoll was the most important movement corridor for all sharks. Both the Blue Hole and Half Moon Caye Natural Monuments provide some protection for larger Caribbean reef sharks; however, a gear ban on longlines on the southwestern forereef between Long Caye and the channel entrance to the Blue Hole would maximize the benefits for all sharks.

AB  - This study draws on the local ecological knowledge of 58 hunters from seven communes in the Ngoc Son Ngo Luong Nature Reserve (Hoa Binh province, North Vietnam) to examine the local status of 40 threatened vertebrates. The reserve forms part of a biodiversity-rich mountainous corridor. Respondents were shown photographs of the species and asked to rate their abundance on a scale of 0-3 (0, extinct; 3, very abundant) in two periods: pre-1975 (before Doi Moi) and in 2009. The results show that 39 species have lived in the area and five are now extinct (Delacour's langur Trachypithecus delacouri, northern white-cheeked crested gibbon Nomascus leucogenys, dhole Cuon alpinus, oriental small-clawed otter Aonyx cinereus, Indochinese tiger Panthera tigris corbetti) and the presence of another six is doubtful (Phayre's leaf-monkey Trachypithecus phayrei ssp. crepuscula, sun bear Helarctos malayanus, binturong Arctictis binturong, fishing cat Prionailurus viverrinus, leopard Panthera pardus, wreathed hornbill Anorrhinus undulatus). The results show a general decline in numbers and abundance, with mammals declining fastest, especially carnivores and primates. The differences in abundance between species have narrowed since 1975, converging towards trends of general impoverishment at similar low abundances. The survey results were similar among communes and also concord with the findings of research in nearby areas. This study demonstrates the usefulness of local ecological knowledge for planning, decision-making and management of protected areas in the absence of historical records or financial resources for conducting intensive fieldwork in remote and little-known areas.

AB  - Aim: Invasive species are of increasing global concern. Nevertheless, the mechanisms driving further distribution after the initial establishment of non-native species remain largely unresolved, especially in marine systems. Ocean currents can be a major driver governing range occupancy, but this has not been accounted for in most invasion ecology studies so far. We investigate how well initial establishment areas are interconnected to later occupancy regions to test for the potential role of ocean currents driving secondary spread dynamics in order to infer invasion corridors and the source-sink dynamics of a non-native holoplanktonic biological probe species on a continental scale.
   Location: Western Eurasia.
   Time period: 1980s-2016.
   Major taxa studied: 'Comb jelly' Mnemiopsis leidyi.
   Methods: Based on 12,400 geo-referenced occurrence data, we reconstruct the invasion history of M. leidyi in western Eurasia. We model ocean currents and calculate their stability to match the temporal and spatial spread dynamics with large-scale connectivity patterns via ocean currents. Additionally, genetic markers are used to test the predicted connectivity between subpopulations.
   Results: Ocean currents can explain secondary spread dynamics, matching observed range expansions and the timing of first occurrence of our holoplanktonic non-native biological probe species, leading to invasion corridors in western Eurasia. In northern Europe, regional extinctions after cold winters were followed by rapid recolonizations at a speed of up to 2,000 km per season. Source areas hosting year-round populations in highly interconnected regions can re-seed genotypes over large distances after local extinctions.
   Main conclusions: Although the release of ballast water from container ships may contribute to the dispersal of non-native species, our results highlight the importance of ocean currents driving secondary spread dynamics. Highly interconnected areas hosting invasive species are crucial for secondary spread dynamics on a continental scale. Invasion risk assessments should consider large-scale connectivity patterns and the potential source regions of non-native marine species.

AB  - Background: For millennia, the southern part of the Mesopotamia has been a wetland region generated by the Tigris and Euphrates rivers before flowing into the Gulf. This area has been occupied by human communities since ancient times and the present-day inhabitants, the Marsh Arabs, are considered the population with the strongest link to ancient Sumerians. Popular tradition, however, considers the Marsh Arabs as a foreign group, of unknown origin, which arrived in the marshlands when the rearing of water buffalo was introduced to the region.
   Results: To shed some light on the paternal and maternal origin of this population, Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation was surveyed in 143 Marsh Arabs and in a large sample of Iraqi controls. Analyses of the haplogroups and sub-haplogroups observed in the Marsh Arabs revealed a prevalent autochthonous Middle Eastern component for both male and female gene pools, with weak South-West Asian and African contributions, more evident in mtDNA. A higher male than female homogeneity is characteristic of the Marsh Arab gene pool, likely due to a strong male genetic drift determined by socio-cultural factors (patrilocality, polygamy, unequal male and female migration rates).
   Conclusions: Evidence of genetic stratification ascribable to the Sumerian development was provided by the Y-chromosome data where the J1-Page08 branch reveals a local expansion, almost contemporary with the Sumerian City State period that characterized Southern Mesopotamia. On the other hand, a more ancient background shared with Northern Mesopotamia is revealed by the less represented Y-chromosome lineage J1-M267*. Overall our results indicate that the introduction of water buffalo breeding and rice farming, most likely from the Indian subcontinent, only marginally affected the gene pool of autochthonous people of the region. Furthermore, a prevalent Middle Eastern ancestry of the modern population of the marshes of southern Iraq implies that if the Marsh Arabs are descendants of the ancient Sumerians, also the Sumerians were most likely autochthonous and not of Indian or South Asian ancestry.

AB  - We examined subadult humpback chub densities along 24 kms of the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon to: (1) identify geomorphic conditions in the study area; (2) determine associations between subadult humpback chub (< 200 mm TL) habitat use and geomorphic differences; and (3) determine how discharge, during base flow conditions, was related to subadult humpback chub habitat conditions.
   Habitat was categorized at two nested spatial scales: geomorphic reach and shoreline type. Within reaches, shoreline types were categorized according to geomorphology. We measured water depth, velocity and cover attributes along all shoreline types over a range of discharges to determine if habitat quality of reaches and shoreline types varied with discharge.
   Reaches 1 and 3 had narrow, deep corridors, whereas Reach 2 was a wide, shallow reach. Among shoreline types, depth, velocity and cover varied; however, differences were not consistent between reaches. Fish densities also varied among shoreline types and reaches. Vegetation, talus and debris fan shorelines had the highest densities of subadult humpback chub in a pattern similar to that of cover. In addition, subadult humpback chub presence was associated with a high frequency of cover regardless of shoreline designation. However, these relationships explained little of the overall variation in subadult densities.
   Lack of a strong association between fish density and geomorphology may be partially due to effects of discharge on habitat quality. The overall trend among shorelines (without regard to type) showed that cover decreased with increasing discharge, whereas depth and velocity increased. However, no consistent pattern between discharge and depth, velocity and cover among individual shoreline types was evident.
   Vegetated shorelines, consisting mainly of non-native tamarisk (Tomarix chinensis), had nearly twice the fish densities of talus and debris fan. Reasons are discussed as to why subadult humpback chub occupy naturalized habitat like vegetated shorelines in greater densities than natural habitats. The relationships observed in this study have important implications for humpback chub recovery and management of the Colorado River through Grand Canyon. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Refueling performance is the primary currency of a successful migration as birds must maintain energy stores to achieve an optimal travel schedule. Migrating birds can anticipate heightened energy demand, not to mention increased uncertainty that energy demands will be satisfied, especially within an urbanizing landscape following long-distance flights. We tested the expectation that refueling performance of songbirds is reduced as densities increase at stopover sites in an urbanizing coastline of the Gulf of Mexico. We measured the density of migrating birds, their refueling performance, and arthropod abundance in two large tracts of contiguous forest paired with two small isolated patches embedded within residential settings throughout spring migration over the course of 2 years. Refueling performance declined with increasing migrant densities, even though the overall daily densities of birds stopping in these landscapes were relatively low and arthropod densities were low throughout. Habitat patch size alone did not account for differences in refueling performance, but smaller habitat patches more often concentrated migrants in higher densities where they experienced reduced refueling performance. We found support for density-dependent refueling performance during spring migration through a region where overall passage and stopover densities are low; suggesting that larger contiguous forest tracks within urban landscapes provide higher quality habitat for refueling and that effect is likely even more pronounced in landscapes within higher density migratory corridors. The nutritional challenges encountered during migration influence the overall pace of migration and changes in access to food resources due to increasing urbanization may ultimately impact optimal travel schedules.

AB  - Previous studies of distribution and habitat use by meadow jumping mice (Zapus hudsonius) have focused on local habitat associations. Our objectives were to predict occupancy of meadow jumping mice and identify local-, patch-, and landscape-specific factors correlated with the species' occurrence. We livetrapped for 5 consecutive days at each of 922 sites during summers of 2001-2003 in thirty-five 23-km(2) landscapes located across the upper Wabash River basin, Indiana. At 474 of these sites (300 forest and 174 grassland), we measured local habitat variables and computed metrics of patch size, shape, and isolation. Meadow jumping mice were captured 242 times at 69 of the 474 sites. The species did not associate with grassland habitat more frequently than forest habitat and was slightly more likely to be captured in forested corridors than in forest patches. Occupancy models fitted separately for grassland and forest sites revealed positive effects of stern density <1 m (forest) and 1-2 m (grassland) aboveground, but no effects of patch attributes. Probability of detection increased with lower temperatures at forest sites. Surprisingly, the extent of grasslands in landscapes had no effect on overall occupancy rates. Instead, variation in mean site-specific occupancy estimates among landscapes was related to the amount of forest cover; more heavily forested landscapes exhibited greater overall occupancy probabilities. Tests failed to identify a critical threshold of forest cover below which occupancy declined at an accelerated rate. More powerful tests are needed, because the existence of a threshold could have important implications for long-term viability of meadow jumping mice across the basin.

AB  - Modeling suggests that excluding invasive cane toads from artificial water points (e.g., pastoral dams) along an arid coastal corridor in Western Australia would create a "waterless barrier" halting their spread. In this study, we explored one critical assumption of these models: that toads cannot persist in the corridor during the dry season without access to artificial water points. We explicitly tested this assumption by translocating and radio-tracking 78 male cane toads in the proposed barrier region during the dry season. Telemetered toads moved substantial distances (maximum distance >2.5 km/night) and were adept at finding shelter. Nonetheless, toads experienced high water loss rates (1.89%/hr) and rapid mortality in both desert (mean +/- SD = 43.6 hr +/- 1.4) and coastal (24.5 hr +/- 1.2) habitats. Survival analysis suggested that toads could survive a maximum of 5 days without access to surface water and would move a maximum of 5.35 km in this time. Our results confirm that artificial water points are a critical resource for toads in the proposed barrier region and provide further evidence that the waterless barrier could successfully halt toad expansion in Western Australia.

AB  - As more high occupancy toll (HOT) facilities are planned and under development, a comprehensive understanding of HOT operations is required for establishing appropriate HOT policies. To enhance the understanding, this study attempts to investigate the factors affecting drivers' choices on HOT lane use and carpooling in the Atlanta I-85 HOT corridors. The investigation utilizes a questionnaire-based survey addressed to 12,000 households/commuters in the corridors by employing a mail-out/mail-back method. A total of 642 surveys were retrieved and about 300 surveys after data screening were utilized for developing classification tree and logistic regression models that explain commuters' HOT lane and carpool choices. The estimated models indicate that HOT lane and carpool choices can be affected by various factors including age, gender, income, commute distance, education, number of household workers and car ownership. In addition, the models show that respondents' positive perception of commute condition changes after the HOT installation can substantially increase the chance of using the HOT lanes. The results also imply that the HOT installation cannot always boost carpool formation, requesting policy makers to develop appropriate strategies that encourage drivers to carpool.

AB  - An understanding of the consequences of long-term environmental change for higher levels of biological organisation is essential for both theoretical and applied ecology. Here, we present four decades of data from the well-characterised Broadstone Stream community, detailing biological responses to amelioration of acidification and the recent invasion of a top predator (brown trout, Salmo trutta L.) that was previously excluded by low pH. After several decades of reductions in acidifying emissions, species characteristic of less acid conditions have started to invade or recolonise Broadstone and other European freshwaters, but these signs of biological recovery are still patchy and have lagged behind chemical recovery. One possible explanation for slow recovery is ecological inertia arising from the internal dynamics of the food web, a hypothesis we investigate here using a combination of surveys, experiments and mathematical modelling.
   The invasion of this hitherto invertebrate-dominated system by a large, generalist vertebrate predator could be expected to alter the structure and stability of the food web. Long-term survey data revealed that the community has experienced waves of invasions or irruptions of progressively larger predators since the 1970s, as pH has risen. Intra-annual fluctuations in prey populations have become increasingly damped and the mean abundance of many species has declined, although none of the previously common taxa have been lost. This suggests that predation, rather than simple chemical tolerance, plays a key role in determining the trajectory of recovery, as the top-down effects of the generalist predators spread diffusely through the reticulate food web. Dynamical simulations indicate that the food web may have become less robust over time as pH has risen and larger predators have become dominant. These results suggest that, though none of the original suite of large invertebrate predators has been driven to local extinction, such an eventual outcome is feasible.
