AB  - A rapidly changing climate and frequent human activity influences the distribution and community structure of forests. Increasing our knowledge about the genetic diversity and distribution patterns of trees is helpful for forest conservation and management. In this study, nSSRs (nuclear simple sequence repeats) were integrated with a species distribution model (SDM) to investigate the spatial genetic patterns and distribution dynamics of Quercus chungii F.P.Metcalf, a rare oak in the subtropics of southeast China. A total of 188 individuals from 11 populations distributed across the natural range of Q. chungii were genotyped using nine nSSRs. The STRUCTURE analysis indicated that genetic admixture was present in all populations, but the population genetic variation and genetic differentiation were related to their geographical distributions. The SDM result indicated that Q. chungii retreated to the Nanling Mountains and adjacent areas during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) period, which corresponds to higher genetic diversity for populations in this region. Landscape genetic analysis showed that the Nanling Mountains served as a corridor for organism dispersal at the glacial and interglacial periods within the Quaternary. Based on these results, we propose that establishing nature reserves to protect the ecological corridor across the Nanling Mountains is necessary for the conservation of regional species genetic diversity, as well as the ecosystem of evergreen broadleaved forests in southern China. The study combines species distribution models and genetic diversity to provide new insight into biodiversity conservation and forest management under future climate change.

AB  - Genetic diversity is estimated to be declining faster than species diversity under escalating threats, but its spatial distribution remains poorly documented at the global scale. Theory predicts that similar processes should foster congruent spatial patterns of genetic and species diversity, but empirical studies are scarce. Using a mined database of 50,588 georeferenced mitochondrial DNA barcode sequences (COI) for 3,815 marine and 1,611 freshwater fish species respectively, we examined the correlation between genetic diversity and species diversity and their global distributions in relation to climate and geography. Genetic diversity showed a clear spatial organisation, but a weak association with species diversity for both marine and freshwater species. We found a predominantly positive relationship between genetic diversity and sea surface temperature for marine species. Genetic diversity of freshwater species varied primarily across the regional basins and was negatively correlated with average river slope. The detection of genetic diversity patterns suggests that conservation measures should consider mismatching spatial signals across multiple facets of biodiversity.

AB  - The management of population size and genetic diversity in fragmented landscapes is the central issue in conservation biology. Functional connectivity between remnant habitat patches affects these parameters. However, the functional connectivity for genetic diversity would be characterised by a greater spatial scale than population size even within the same habitat network. The reason for this difference is that while dispersal frequency generally decreases with increasing distance, only a few immigrants may effectively contribute to gene flow, whereas a certain number of dispersers may be required to influence population abundance. Here, we investigated the effects of habitat network structures on population abundance and genetic diversity of the ninespine stickleback, Pungitius pungitius, in remnant wetland ponds in northern Japan. We tested (i) whether both population abundance and genetic diversity are positively related not only to habitat size but also to connectivity and (ii) whether the dispersal effect extends to greater spatial scales in genetic diversity than in population size. We employed a graph theoretical index to measure the degree of pond connectivity. This index can evaluate the connectivity threshold distance above which individuals cannot disperse and clarify the difference in the spatial scale of effective dispersal between population abundance and genetic diversity. Pond connectivity significantly affected the spatial variation of both population abundance and genetic diversity. In contrast, pond size was related only to population abundance. As we predicted, the connectivity threshold distance for genetic diversity was more than two times greater than that for population abundance (12.5km versus 5km, respectively). Our findings indicate that the landscape managers should consider various spatial scales as a conservation unit for the management of a habitat network in accordance with the conservation targets that they establish. We also found that small artificial agricultural ditches and streams may play important roles in sustaining the population networks of wetland organisms.

AB  - Analyzing the genetic diversity of a population can be useful in identifying some of the silent effects of habitat fragmentation. We examined and compared 4 mitochondrial loci of the near threatened Short-tailed Babbler (Pellorneum malaccense), a rainforest understory bird, between a highly fragmented population in Singapore and populations from elsewhere in the Sundaic region. We found that the fragmented Singaporean population is genetically impoverished, with <20% of the intrapopulation genetic diversity present in a comparable sample from Borneo within intact forest. Differences in haplotype diversity among Singaporean sites of occurrence suggest that there may be extremely poor genetic diversity and connectivity among Singaporean subpopulations. These findings highlight the importance of connectivity in maintaining population genetic diversity in urban tropical forest patches. Our results also corroborate previous findings that there are 3 deeply diverged lineages of Short-tailed Babbler across the Sundaic region.

AB  - Apex predators are important indicators of intact natural ecosystems. They are also sensitive to urbanization because they require broad home ranges and extensive contiguous habitat to support their prey base. Pumas (Puma concolor) can persist near human developed areas, but urbanization may be detrimental to their movement ecology, population structure, and genetic diversity. To investigate potential effects of urbanization in population connectivity of pumas, we performed a landscape genomics study of 130 pumas on the rural Western Slope and more urbanized Front Range of Colorado, USA. Over 12,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped using double-digest, restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq). We investigated patterns of gene flow and genetic diversity, and tested for correlations between key landscape variables and genetic distance to assess the effects of urbanization and other landscape factors on gene flow. Levels of genetic diversity were similar for the Western Slope and Front Range, but effective population sizes were smaller, genetic distances were higher, and there was more admixture in the more urbanized Front Range. Forest cover was strongly positively associated with puma gene flow on the Western Slope, while impervious surfaces restricted gene flow and more open, natural habitats enhanced gene flow on the Front Range. Landscape genomic analyses revealed differences in puma movement and gene flow patterns in rural versus urban settings. Our results highlight the utility of dense, genome-scale markers to document subtle impacts of urbanization on a wide-ranging carnivore living near a large urban center.

AB  - The Mugger Crocodile (Crocodylus palustris) is a threatened reptile inhabiting the Indian Sub-continent and Western Asia. Despite its "Vulnerable" conservation status, data about population genetic structure and connectivity are unavailable. This study makes a preliminary assessment of the genetic diversity, population structure and habitat connectivity of C. palustris in Iran. Ten tissue samples collected along the Sarbaz-Bahukalat basins were analysed and a set of 12 microsatellites was genotyped. Genetic diversity indices were estimated and population substructuring was assessed through Bayesian clustering analysis. Potential connectivity was verified through Remote Sensing water indexes, further implemented in a circuit analysis. Low genetic diversity was observed (mean observed heterozygosity = 0.35; mean expected heterozygosity = 0.43) and no population structure was found (K = 1). Water index and circuit analysis suggested possible connection among sites. This study highlights the potential vulnerability of crocodile populations and the importance of habitat connectivity for their persistence in the arid regions of Iran.

AB  - Natural habitats, and the populations they sustain, are becoming increasingly fragmented by human activities. Parallels between 'true' islands and 'habitat' islands suggest that standing levels of individual genetic diversity in naturally fragmented populations may predict the genetic fate of their anthropogenically fragmented counterparts, but this hypothesis remains largely untested. We compared neutral-locus genetic diversity of individual song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) breeding in a naturally fragmented landscape (small coastal islands) to that of song sparrows in similar-sized 'urban islands' separated by roads and housing developments rather than by water. Individuals on coastal islands were more heterozygous and less inbred than those in urban islands. Estimates of population genetic structuring (assessed by pairwise genetic differentiation and Bayesian clustering methods) and contemporary dispersal (based on assignment tests) revealed little structure within either landscape, suggesting that lack of connectivity at the geographic scale we investigated cannot explain the reduced heterozygosity of urban birds. However, within-site genetic similarity was higher in the urban than the coastal landscape. Assuming that historic genetic diversity was similar in these two environments, our findings suggest that anthropogenically fragmented populations may lose genetic diversity faster than their naturally fragmented counterparts.

AB  - Aim There is a dearth of evidence that determines the genetic diversity of populations contained within present-day protected areas compared with their historical state prior to large-scale species declines, making inferences about a species' conservation genetic status difficult to assess. The aim of this paper was to demonstrate the use of historical specimens to assess the change in genetic diversity over a defined spatial area. Location Like many other species, African lion populations (Panthera leo) are undergoing dramatic contractions in range and declines in numbers, motivating the identification of a number of lion-conservation strongholds across East and southern Africa. We focus on one such stronghold, the Kavango-Zambezi transfrontier conservation area (KAZA) of Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Methods We compare genetic diversity between historical museum specimens, collected during the late 19th and early 20th century, with samples from the modern extant population. We use 16 microsatellite markers and sequence 337 base pairs of the hypervariable control region (HVR1) of the mitochondrial genome. We use bootstrap resampling to allow for comparisons between the historical and modern data. Results We show that the genetic diversity of the modern population was reduced by 12%-17%, with a reduction in allelic diversity of approximately 15%, compared to historical populations, in addition to having lost a number of mitochondrial haplotypes. We also identify a number of "ghost alleles" in the historical samples which are no longer present in the extant population. Main Conclusions We argue a rapid decline in allelic richness after 1895 suggests the erosion of genetic diversity coincides with the rise of a European colonial presence and the outbreak of rinderpest in the region. Our results support the need to improved connectivity between protected areas in order to prevent further loss of genetic diversity in the region.

AB  - Both intrinsic and extrinsic forces work together to shape connectivity and genetic variation in populations across the landscape. Here we explored how geography, breeding system traits, and environmental factors influence the population genetic patterns of Triodanis perfoliata, a widespread mix-mating annual plant in the contiguous US. By integrating population genomic data with spatial analyses and modeling the relationship between a breeding system and genetic diversity, we illustrate the complex ways in which these forces shape genetic variation. Specifically, we used 4705 single nucleotide polymorphisms to assess genetic diversity, structure, and evolutionary history among 18 populations. Populations with more obligately selfing flowers harbored less genetic diversity (pi: R-2 = .63, p = .01, n = 9 populations), and we found significant population structuring (F-ST = 0.48). Both geographic isolation and environmental factors played significant roles in predicting the observed genetic diversity: we found that corridors of suitable environments appear to facilitate gene flow between populations, and that environmental resistance is correlated with increased genetic distance between populations. Last, we integrated our genetic results with species distribution modeling to assess likely patterns of connectivity among our study populations. Our landscape and evolutionary genetic results suggest that T. perfoliata experienced a complex demographic and evolutionary history, particularly in the center of its distribution. As such, there is no singular mechanism driving this species' evolution. Together, our analyses support the hypothesis that the breeding system, geography, and environmental variables shape the patterns of diversity and connectivity of T. perfoliata in the US.

AB  - The anthropization of the landscape of the Cerrado biome that has occurred over the past few decades has fragmented its natural environments, impacting the connectivity of the plant populations and altering their gene flow. Plant species may also reduce population size in response to sub-optimal climatic and environmental conditions, and observed distribution patterns may align with theoretical schemes, such as the center-periphery model, that is, it is possible that populations on the edge have lower genetic diversity than center populations, theoretically submitted to environmental conditions closer to the optimum. In this context, we evaluate whether the genetic diversity and inbreeding coefficients of Cerrado plant species are affected by landscape features and climate characteristics, and in particular, if the distribution of the genetic diversity of these plants is consistent with the center-periphery model. To do this, we conducted a literature search for genetic studies of Cerrado plant populations using Scopus, Web of Science, and Scielo databases and the species found were used as a proxy to explore patterns throughout the biome. The data were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and multiple matrix regressions (MMRRs) to evaluate the effects of landscape features and climatic variables on the observed (H-O) and expected heterozygosity (H-E), allelic richness (AR) and inbreeding (Fis) patterns of the local populations. The landscape was evaluated in terms of the percentage land cover of agriculture (AG), forestry (FO), remnant vegetation (RV), urban areas (UA), pasture (PA), and water (WA) within buffers of 1 km, 3 km, and 5 km around the study populations. We analyzed 121 populations of 31 plant species. The GLMMs showed that H-O was affected by FO regardless of buffer size, while H-E was also affected by FO, but also by WA and UA. AR was affected by WA and UA in all three buffer zones while the Fis was affected by FO and AU. The MMRRs showed that WA may affect H-O, H-E, and Fis within the 1 km buffer, while FO affects H-O and UA affects AR within the 5 km buffer. In the case of the 1 km and 3 km buffers, however, the geographic distance between populations was identified as a factor determining the genetic diversity and inbreeding indices, indicating that isolation by distance may be an important factor defining the breeding patterns of the Cerrado plant populations. The GLMMs and MMRRs also showed that the mean annual temperature (MAT) and, to a lesser extent, isothermality (ISO) can explain the variation in genetic diversity observed in the Cerrado plant populations. We also found that the center-periphery model fits the distribution pattern observed in most of the species evaluated, including Annona crassiflora, Annona coriacea, Copaifera langsdorffii, and Eugenia dysenterica. Our results indicate that changes in the climate and the landscape of Brazilian Cerrado must be considered carefully to guarantee minimizing the impacts of these processes on the genetic diversity of Cerrado plant species and ensuring the long-term conservation of these species in this biome.

AB  - Species with high mobility may have low genetic differentiation among populations due to historical long-distance dispersal, but recent studies show that bat dispersal may be affected by habitat loss and fragmentation. Here, we analyze the effects of landscape contemporary changes and dynamics in paleodistribution during the Quaternary on genetic diversity and differentiation in the Pallas' long-tongued bat, Glossophaga soricina. We sampled 18 populations in landscapes with different land cover, and used nine microsatellite loci and the sequence of a fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b (CYB) to obtain genetic data. We performed ecological niche modelling and used general linear mixed models and optimization of multiple resistance surfaces to analyze how landscape structure and climatic suitability affect genetic diversity and differentiation. Our results show that the conversion of natural vegetation, such as forests and savannas, to agriculture, pastures or urban matrices (unsuitable habitats) decreases genetic diversity and increases inbreeding, but has no effect on genetic differentiation among populations, that was likely affected by spatial distance. Our findings point to the importance of maintenance of large areas of natural vegetation remnants to conserve genetic diversity of G. soricina, an important bat pollinator in the Neotropics.

AB  - Magnolias are representative shrub and tree species of the tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) in Mexico, which is one of the most endangered ecosystems due to anthropogenic landscape degradation and climate change. Magnolia schiedeana is a vulnerable and restricted endemic TMCF species, occurring in scattered TMCF fragments in the Sierra Madre Oriental. In this study, we investigated spatial patterns of genetic diversity across the M. schiedeana species range and assessed whether gene flow was influenced by topographic and environmental factors. We sampled 11 remnant populations across the species range and genotyped 180 individuals at eight nuclear microsatellite loci. Our data showed a strong spatial structure in five genetic clusters, which match the patchy geographic distribution of M. schiedeana. Contemporary migration rates between these genetic clusters were very low. Levels of genetic diversity within populations were moderate to high, and no evidence of inbreeding was found. Our results from landscape genetic analysis showed that isolation by distance, rather than topography or environmental variation, was the main process shaping genetic differentiation. Urgent actions are needed to protect M. schiedeana populations as most of them persist isolated within agricultural and urban landscapes. Ex situ management actions would be crucial to ensure the conservation of genetically diverse germplasm for the in situ propagation where it has gone locally extinct.

AB  - Revealing patterns of genetic diversity and barriers for gene flow are key points for successful conservation in endangered species. Methods based on molecular markers are also often used to delineate conservation units such as evolutionary significant units and management units. Here we combine phylo-geographic analyses (based on mtDNA) with population and landscape genetic analyses (based on microsatellites) for the endangered yellow-bellied toad Bombina variegata over a wide distribution range in Germany. Our analyses show that two genetic clusters are present in the study area, a northern and a southern/central one, but that these clusters are not deeply divergent. The genetic data suggest high fragmentation among toad occurrences and consequently low genetic diversity. Genetic diversity and genetic connectivity showed a negative relationship with road densities and urban areas surrounding toad occurrences, indicating that these landscape features act as barriers to gene flow. To preserve a maximum of genetic diversity, we recommend considering both genetic clusters as management units, and to increase gene flow among toad occurrences with the aim of restoring and protecting functional meta-populations within each of the clusters. Several isolated populations with especially low genetic diversity and signs of inbreeding need particular short-term conservation attention to avoid extinction. We also recommend to allow natural gene flow between both clusters but not to use individuals from one cluster for translocation or reintroduction into the other. Our results underscore the utility of molecular tools for species conservation, highlight outcomes of habitat fragmentation onto the genetic structure of an endangered amphibian and reveal particularly threatened populations in need for urgent conservation efforts.

AB  - Context Conversion of forest ecosystems to human-modified landscapes threatens the persistence of forest-specialist species. However, the local and landscape drivers of population abundance and genetic diversity of these species are largely unknown, especially for elusive and critically endangered species, such as the salamander Pseudoeurycea robertsi-a species microendemic to the Nevado de Toluca volcano, Mexico. Objectives We assessed the relative influence of local- and landscape-scale habitat amount and habitat spatial configuration on the number of individuals and genetic diversity of P. robertsi. Given its low vagility, we expected stronger responses to local habitat amount than to landscape variables, with habitat configuration showing the weakest effects on all responses. Methods Using multiscale and multimodel inference approaches, we tested the relative effect of local habitat amount (fallen logs volume), landscape habitat amount (forest cover) and landscape configuration (forest edge density and forest fragmentation per se) on the number of salamanders and its genetic diversity. Results The number of individuals was more strongly related to local and landscape variables than genetic diversity. As predicted, local habitat amount showed stronger positive effects on number of individuals and number of alleles than forest cover. In addition, all response variables increased in landscapes with lower edge density. Fragmentation per se showed weak influence on all responses. Conclusions Fallen logs volume is a major driver of this forest-specialist salamander. Yet, edge density also shapes salamander populations, especially the number of individuals. Retaining fallen logs in forests and increasing forest core areas are critical for salamander conservation.

AB  - Over the past century, human activities and their side effects have significantly threatened both ecosystems and resident species. Nevertheless, the genetic patterns of large felids that depend heavily on large and well-conserved continuous habitat remain poorly studied. Using the largest-ever contemporary genetic survey of wild jaguars (Panthera onca), we evaluated their genetic diversity and population structure in natural (Brazilian Amazon) and highly modified habitats (e.g. Cerrado, Caatinga) including those close to the northern (Yucatan, Mexico) and southern (Pantanal) edge of the species' distribution range. Data from our set of microsatellites revealed a pronounced genetic structure, with four genetically differentiated geographic areas. Geographic distance was not the only factor influencing genetic differentiation through the jaguar range. Instead, we found evidence of the effects of habitat deterioration on genetic patterns: while the levels of genetic diversity in the Amazon forest, the largest continuum habitat for the species, are high and consistent with panmixia across large distances, genetic diversity near the edge of the species distribution has been reduced through population contractions. Mexican jaguar populations were highly differentiated from those in Brazil and genetically depauperated. An isolated population from the Caatinga showed the genetic effects of a recent demographic decline (within the last 20-30 years), which may reflect recent habitat degradation in the region. Our results demonstrate that the jaguar is highly sensitive to habitat fragmentation especially in human-dominated landscapes, and that in Brazil, the existing but limited genetic connectivity in the central protected areas should be maintained. These conclusions have important implications for the management of wide-ranging species with high dispersal and low population density. The restoration of ecological connectivity between populations over relatively large scales should be one of the main priorities for species conservation.

AB  - Rain forests are expected to be amongst the ecosystem types most affected by fragmentation due to their high species diversity, high endemism, complexity of interactions, and contrast with surrounding altered matrix. Due to their shorter life cycles and dependence on canopy cover, rain forest understory herbs are expected to indicate the effects of recent fragmentation more rapidly than canopy trees. This study investigated all four known species of the genus Romnalda, all of which are rare rain forest herbaceous species, to investigate the possible effects of habitat fragmentation and isolation on genetic diversity and gene flow. Allozymes were used as genetic markers and regional remnant vegetation maps were used to compare landscape fragmentation. We found that R. strobilacea populations in a highly fragmented landscape were genetically depauperate compared with those of its congeneric species that are found within continuous rain forest habitats and that allelic diversity decreased with decreasing population size but not geographic distance in R. strobilacea. Given the similarity among the species, our results indicate that all Romnalda species are potentially susceptible to loss of genetic diversity due to habitat fragmentation within relatively short timeframes. The results indicate that populations are not highly genetically differentiated and there is little evidence of genetic provenance where the species have restricted geographic ranges. Thus, species recovery programs would be better to focus on maintaining population size and genetic diversity rather than population differentiation.

AB  - Little is known regarding the effect of fragmentation and human agricultural management on the genetic variation and gene flow of Cucurbita pepo L., 1753 in moderate fragmented areas in central Guatemala. We hypothesize that the genetic variation of C. pepo is affected by forest fragmentation and by traditional agricultural management. Therefore, we aim to determine: (1) the genetic diversity and genetic structure of C. pepo in the Cloud Forest Corridor (CFC) (2) the extent of genetic admixture between commercial variety (CV) and traditional landraces (TL) of C. pepo, (3) the effect of habitat fragmentation in the population genetics of C. pepo with a landscape approach, and (4) the potential relationship between traditional management practices and genetic diversity of C. pepo in the CFC. We detected the existence of high level of genetic diversity (AR = 3.43; He = 0.50), inbreeding (Fis = 0.25) and moderate population structure of C. pepo in the CFC (Fst = 0.16). No correlation between landscape and genetics was found. Also, we found high genetic admixture between CV and TL. It seems that human practices, mainly related with seed exchange patterns, could affect genetic diversity of C. pepo in the CFC. C. pepo populations in the CFC are structured, with inbreeding, and show admixture with the CV, an aspect that could affect its genetic diversity. The agricultural management influenced the population genetics of C. pepo in the CFC, but the landscape did not. We suggest that special efforts should be made to preserve the diversity of this important indigenous food source for Guatemalan people as well as their management practices.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are among the greatest threats to biodiversity since unsuitable habitat can be a significant barrier to gene flow, disrupting the connectivity of populations. In this scenario, landscape genetic approaches have been applied as invaluable tools to demonstrate how contemporary habitat alterations affect gene flow. In this study, we used nine microsatellite genotypes to determine the landscape features driving genetic diversity, structure, and functional connectivity among eleven sampling sites of a micro-endemic, and critically endangered salamander (Pseudoeurycea robertsi) in the Nevado de Toluca Volcano. We also modelled the ecological niche of P. robertsi to assess the most important habitat features associated with its probability of presence and analyzed the corridor network to identify important core areas and corridors to keep the network connected, as well as points where the network connection is lost or tightened. Moreover, we performed a redundancy analysis to assess the effect of genetic distance and habitat resistances on gene flow. We found the highest levels of genetic diversity and connectivity at the northwestern part of the Volcano. Meson Viejo sampling site was of especial importance to overall network connectivity. We found low levels of migration rates and low levels of genetic structure. The most important habitat feature associated with probability of presence of Pseudoeurycea robertsi was the Abies forest, and two models were significant under the RDA analysis: Abies forest and Abies forest+Grasslands. We recommend prioritizing the areas of the northwestern and central parts of the volcano in conservation programs. Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

AB  - In a simulation study of genotypes conducted over 100 generations for more than 1600 butterfly's individuals, we evaluate how the increase of anthropogenic fragmentation and reduction of habitat size along urbanisation gradients (from 7 to 59% of impervious land cover) influences genetic diversity and population persistence in butterfly species. We show that in areas characterised by a high urbanisation rate (> 56% impervious land cover), a large decrease of both genetic diversity (loss of 60-80% of initial observed heterozygosity) and population size (loss of 70-90% of individuals) is observed over time. This is confirmed by empirical data available for the mobile butterfly species Pieris rapae in a subpart of the study area. Comparing simulated data for P. rapae with its normal dispersal ability and with a reduced dispersal ability, we also show that a higher dispersal ability can be an advantage to survive in an urban or highly fragmented environment. The results obtained here suggest that it is of high importance to account for population persistence, and confirm that it is crucial to maintain habitat size and connectivity in the context of land-use planning.

AB  - Vagility, ecological requirements, and forest patches can all influence gene flow among populations. These aspects are critical for the maintenance of genetic diversity in populations. Ectophylla alba is a fruit bat belonging to the family Phyllostomidae with specialized feeding and habitat requirements. Studies examining population genetics in this specialist bat are lacking. In this study, ten microsatellite loci were used to evaluate the current genetic structure of this bat species. Six localities in Costa Rica were evaluated. These localities are included in a landscape with remnants of lowland forests surrounded by cattle pastures, plantations, urban areas, and roads. Our results suggest a genetic population with moderate genetic diversity that was observed at most studied loci, with a statistically non-significant difference between the observed and expected heterozygosity. Most of the genetic variation was observed within rather than among sampled populations. The Mantel test showed a non-significant correlation between genetic diversity and geographic distance. These results suggest that E. alba populations have not shown an effect of habitat fragmentation in the studied area. We argue that the increase of forest patches is too recent to alter genetic diversity among sampled localities. Current migration among populations appears to be high enough to balance allele frequencies among localities.

AB  - Little is known about the effects of habitat fragmentation on the patterns of genetic diversity and genetic connectivity of species in the remaining tropical forests of Southeast Asia. This is particularly evident in Cebu, a Philippine island that has a long history of deforestation and has lost nearly all of its forest cover. To begin filling this gap, data from 13 microsatellite loci developed for Tetrastigma loheri (Vitaceae), a common vine species in Philippine forests, were used to study patterns of genetic diversity and genetic connectivity for the four largest of the remaining forest areas in Cebu. Evidence of relatively high levels of inbreeding was found in all four areas, despite no evidence of low genetic diversity. The four areas are genetically differentiated, suggesting low genetic connectivity. The presence of inbreeding and low genetic connectivity in a commonly encountered species such as T. loheri in Cebu suggests that the impact of habitat fragmentation is likely greater on rare plant species with more restricted distributions in Cebu. Conservation recommendations for the remaining forest areas in Cebu include the establishment of steppingstone corridors between nearby areas to improve the movement of pollinators and seed dispersers among them.

AB  - Premise of the study: Urbanization is one of the main factors contributing to loss of genetic diversity, as the resulting landscape fragmentation and habitat loss induce species isolation. However, studies of genetic structure and diversity in urbanized landscapes are still rare. We characterized microsatellite primers for Parietaria judaica to study this environment.
   Methods and Results: Eleven microsatellite loci from P. judaica, an urban plant, were isolated using shotgun pyrosequencing, and the simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were screened in 20 individuals of P. judaica. The loci were tested on 166 individuals from three populations in different cities. The number of alleles ranged from two to 19, and expected and observed heterozygosity values ranged from 0.019 to 0.912 and 0.019 to 0.448, respectively.
   Conclusions: The markers amplified well in the species and will be useful for examining genetic diversity and population genetic structure in this urban plant.

AB  - Anthropogenic landscape changes resulting in habitat degradation, loss and fragmentation might decrease connectivity and effective sizes of wild populations, threatening local biodiversity. Assumed large distributions of both species and habitats have probably discouraged studies correlating altered landscapes' structure and composition to patterns of genetic diversity in the Neotropics. Yet, considering the increasingly high rates of deforestation and habitat conversion in Amazonia, investigating local and regional-scale effects of habitat conversion on Amazonian mammals is of paramount importance. Here, we use widespread, non-threatened, phyllostomid bats to understand how current forest dynamics are influencing genetic diversity patterns and functional connectivity of eastern Amazonian volant mammals. Four frugivorous species, Carollia perspicillata, Rhinophylla pumilio, Dermanura gnoma and Artibeus obscurus, were sampled across a heterogeneously fragmented region. Twelve more or less isolated rainforest remnants surrounded by urban areas, pastures, crops, secondary forests and other land uses comprise the studied landscapes, and are compared using a landscape genetics approach applied to mitochondrial DNA loci. Here, we report species-specific consequences of habitat fragmentation. Although the overall levels of genetic diversity were high, our data show that (i) population structure is heterogeneous across the altered landscapes; (ii) landscapes with higher habitat availability harbour populations with higher genetic diversity; and (iii) the populations assessed might be demographically declining.

AB  - Orchid bees (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Euglossini) are important pollinators of many plant families in Neotropical forests, habitats that have become increasingly degraded and fragmented by agricultural practices. To understand the extent to which loss of natural habitat and isolation has affected the genetic diversity and diploid male production (DMP) of two orchid bee species, Euglossa dilemma and Euglossa viridissima, we collected and genotyped 1686 males at five microsatellite loci and tested for differences in allelic richness, heterozygosity and DMP across three different types of land use (natural, agricultural and urban) and between mainland and island populations in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. We also investigated the impact of land use and geographic isolation on gene flow. Euglossa dilemma and E. viridissima seemed to be particularly resilient to loss of natural habitat; in locations with human impact, we did not find reduced genetic diversity, and populations generally showed very little population genetic structure. Only on islands did E. dilemma show significantly reduced genetic diversity. Even after accounting for putative null alleles, DMP was very low (0.2-1.3%) across all sampling sites, including on islands. We therefore suggest that DMP is an insensitive measure of inbreeding and population decline in our two study species.

AB  - AimWe investigated changes in distribution of cloud forests during the last 130 kyr, and tested whether these changes explain the spatial patterns of genetic diversity of the tree fern Alsophila firma (Cyatheaceae), a species restricted to this habitat.
   LocationMexican cloud forests.
   MethodsWe sampled 204 individuals from 16 localities. Genetic data consisted of DNA sequences for five chloroplast microsatellites and one nuclear gene. We used distribution modelling to predict the historical distribution of cloud forests during the last glacial period, using two palaeoclimate models: the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) and the Community Climate System Model (CCSM). We tested the correlation between temporal cloud forest stability and genetic diversity and used an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework to test two plausible demographic scenarios.
   ResultsThe range fluctuations observed for cloud forests during the last 130 kyr are key factors affecting the distribution of genetic variation in A. firma. Increased genetic diversity in areas with high temporal environmental suitability is probably the result of increased population sizes and higher interpopulation connectivity. In accordance with the expansion of cloud forests predicted by CCSM, the genetic data supported the scenario of a population expansion occurring c.110 ka, followed by population divergence c.20 ka. However, population dynamics involving expansion of suitable microclimates could reconcile the stability of cloud forests predicted by MIROC and the observed genetic patterns.
   Main conclusionsThe predicted changes in the distribution of cloud forests were congruent with the population genetics of A. firma. However, the choice of palaeoclimate model has a substantial impact on the inferences drawn from the observed genetic and demographic patterns. The use of alternative palaeoclimate hypotheses and biome modelling can provide a common analytical framework for evaluating the historical cohesiveness of forest communities.

AB  - The Sado wrinkled frog (Glandirana susurra) is a recently described threatened amphibian species found only on Sado Island, a small island located off the north coast of Honshu, Japan. We conducted an extensive field survey and genetic analysis of G. susurra to identify its (1) large-scale distribution patterns, (2) remaining levels of genetic diversity, (3) major genetic groups (i.e., regional populations), and (4) levels of genetic differentiation and gene flow within and between its populations on the island. G. susurra was most prevalent in the central part of the island but was also observed in some areas to the east and west. We found a strong, hierarchical genetic structure that includes three genetically distinct groups of populations ('eastern', 'central' and 'western'). The eastern and western regional populations had significantly lower genetic diversity than the central population. We found, however, that many local populations in the central population had experienced several recent bottleneck events. Conservation recommendations for G. susurra include (1) considering the three major groups of G. susurra populations as separate units for purposes of conservation planning, (2) increasing the population sizes of the eastern and western populations which showed relatively lower genetic diversity, and (3) increasing habitat connectivity to facilitate gene flow among local populations in the central part of the island.

AB  - This study aimed to use the applications of Ensemble Species Distribution Modelling (eSDM), Geographical Information Systems (GISs), and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) for the design of a protected area (PA) for the critically endangered yellow-spotted mountain newt, Neurergus derjugini, by tracking and excluding the effects of climate and landscape changes in western Iran and northeastern Iraq. Potential recent and future distributions (2050 and 2070) were reconstructed by eSDM using eight algorithms with MRI-CGCM3 and CCSM4 models. The GIS-based MCDA siting procedure was followed inside habitats with high eSDM suitability by eliminating the main roads, cities, high village density, dams, poor vegetation, low stream density, agricultural lands and high ridge density. Then, within the remaining relevant areas, 10 polygons were created as "nominations" for PAs (NPAs). Finally, for 10 different NPAs, the suitability score was ranked based on ratings and weights (analytical hierarchy process) of the number of newt localities, NPA connectivity, NPA shape, NPA habitat suitability in 2070, NPA size, genetic diversity, village density and distance to nearest PAs, cities, and main roads. This research could serve as a modern realistic approach for environmental management to plan conservation areas using a cost-effective and affordable technique.

AB  - Urbanisation and agriculture dramatically modify the landscapes available for use by wildlife, affecting key aspects of their ecology such as survival, foraging, predation, competition and reproductive success. Relatively little is known about the effects of urbanisation and agriculture on the genetic structure, gene flow and genetic diversity of wild species. Here, landscape genetic techniques were applied to compare local genetic diversity and gene flow between wood mouse populations in urban and arable landscapes. Using nine microsatellite markers, individuals were genotyped from six arable and seven urban sample sites. Inter-population genetic differentiation was significantly greater in urban than arable habitat, while allele richness, private allele richness and heterozygosity were higher for arable sample sites, with varying degrees of significance. These suggest that urban habitat was sufficiently fragmented to limit gene flow. To test the effect of landscape features on gene flow, several cost-distance measures were generated. Overland distance and Euclidean distance correlated best with inter-population genetic differentiation in arable habitat, whereas distances that accommodated differences in habitat quality better explained differentiation in urban habitat. There was no evidence that margins adjacent to roads, rivers or railways facilitated gene flow. Together, the results indicate that urban landscapes expose wood mice to greater fragmentation in habitat quality than arable areas, leading to greater population isolation that is not mitigated by the presence of dispersal corridors.

AB  - The success of species reintroductions can depend on a combination of environmental, demographic, and genetic factors. Although the importance of these factors in the success of reintroductions is well-accepted, they are typically evaluated independently, which can miss important interactions. For species that persist in metapopulations, movement through and interaction with the landscape is predicted to be a vital component of persistence. Simulation-based approaches are a promising technique for evaluating the independent and combined effects of these factors on the outcome of various reintroduction and associated management actions. We report results from a simulation study of bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) reintroduction to three watersheds of the Pend Oreille River system in northeastern Washington State, USA. We used an individual-based, spatially explicit simulation model to evaluate how reintroduction strategies, life history variation, and riverscape structure (e.g., network topology) interact to influence the demographic and genetic characteristics of reintroduced bull trout populations in three watersheds. Simulation scenarios included a range of initial genetic stocks (informed by empirical bull trout genetic data), variation in migratory tendency and life history, and two landscape connectivity alternatives representing a connected network (isolation-by-distance) and a fragmented network (isolation-by-barrier, using the known existing barriers). A novel feature of these simulations was the ability to consider the interaction of both demographic and genetic (i.e., demogenetic) factors in riverscapes with implicit asymmetric movement probabilities across the barriers. We found that connectivity (presence or absence of barriers) had the largest effect on demographic and genetic outcomes over 200 yr, with a greater effect than both initial genetic diversity and life history variation. We also identified regions of the study system in which bull trout populations persisted across a wide range of demographic, life history, and environmental connectivity parameters. Finally, we found no evidence that initial neutral genetic diversity influenced genetic diversity and structure after 200 yr; instead, genetic drift due to stray rate and population isolation dominated and erased any initial differences in genetic diversity. Our results highlight the utility of spatially explicit demogenetic approaches in exploring and understanding population dynamics and their implications for management strategies-in fresh waters.

AB  - Premise of the study: Wild populations of domesticated species constitute a genetic reservoir and are fundamental to the evolutionary potential of species. Wild papaya (Carica papaya) is a rare, short-lived, gap-colonizing, dioecious tree that persists in the forest by continuous dispersal. Theoretically, these life-history characteristics render wild papaya highly susceptible to habitat fragmentation, with anticipated negative effects on its gene pool. Further, species dioecy may cause founder effects to generate local biases in sex ratio, decreasing effective population size.
   Methods: We contrasted the genetic diversity and structure of C. papaya between wild populations from rainforest fragments and continuous forest at Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. We evaluated recent migration rates among populations as well as landscape resistance to gene flow. Finally, we calculated the sex ratio of the populations in both habitats.
   Key results: Populations of wild papaya in rainforest fragments showed lower genetic diversity and higher population differentiation than populations in continuous rainforest. Estimates of recent migration rates showed a higher percentage of migrants moving from the continuous forest to the forest fragments than in the opposite direction. Agricultural land and cattle pasture were found to be the most resistant matrices to gene flow. Finally, biased sex ratios were seen to affect the effective population size in both habitats.
   Conclusions: The mating system, rarity, and short life cycle of C. papaya are exacerbating the effects of rainforest fragmentation on its genetic diversity, threatening the persistence of its natural populations in the proposed place of origin as well as its genetic reservoir.

AB  - Road networks and human density are major factors contributing to habitat fragmentation and loss, isolation of wildlife populations, and reduced genetic diversity. Terrestrial mammals are particularly sensitive to road networks and encroachment by human populations. However, there are limited assessments of the impacts of road networks and human density on population-specific nuclear genetic diversity, and it remains unclear how these impacts are modulated by life-history traits. Using generalized linear mixed models and microsatellite data from 1444 North American terrestrial mammal populations, we show that taxa with large home range sizes, dense populations, and large body sizes had reduced nuclear genetic diversity with increasing road impacts and human density, but the overall influence of life-history traits was generally weak. Instead, we observed a high degree of genus-specific variation in genetic responses to road impacts and human density. Human density negatively affected allelic diversity or heterozygosity more than road networks (13 vs. 5-7 of 25 assessed genera, respectively); increased road networks and human density also positively affected allelic diversity and heterozygosity in 15 and 6-9 genera, respectively. Large-bodied, human-averse species were generally more negatively impacted than small, urban-adapted species. Genus-specific responses to habitat fragmentation by ongoing road development and human encroachment likely depend on the specific capability to (i) navigate roads as either barriers or movement corridors, and (ii) exploit resource-rich urban environments. The nonuniform genetic response to roads and human density highlights the need to implement efforts to mitigate the risk of vehicular collisions, while also facilitating gene flow between populations of particularly vulnerable taxa.

AB  - We analyzed the genetic structure of the tropical tree Dendropanax arboreus (Araliaceae) in relation to habitat fragmentation. Genetic variation, structure, and genetic differentiation among populations from Los Tuxtlas tropical rainforest were estimated using ISSRs as molecular markers. DNA from 219 individuals belonging to 9 populations was amplified with 4 primers yielding a total of 75 loci. Adults and juveniles from each population were analyzed to assess the genetic diversity and structure pre and post-fragmentation, respectively. Dendropanax arboreus showed high levels of genetic diversity (h = 0.253) and significant but low genetic differentiation among populations (0 = 0.062). A hierarchical analysis of the gvenetic structure showed that 91.5% of the genetic variation is attributable to individual differences within populations. The average Nei's genetic distance among populations was low (D = 0.034) and genetic distance among pairs of populations increased with geographic distance separating them. Because genetic diversity is similar between adult and juvenile trees at all but 2 populations, we suggest that seed dispersal prevented genetic differentiation and maintains genetic connectivity among fragments and continuous forest populations. Juvenile populations showed a higher genetic differentiation (theta = 0.15) than adult trees, indicating a role of genetic drift via reduced population size.

AB  - Urban expansion is creating environmental stressors through land use change, habitat fragmentation, and habitat loss. These stressors, along with a host of others, are driving precipitous declines in vertebrate taxa around the world. Amphibians, often requiring a narrow range of environmental conditions, can be especially susceptible to the stressors of environmental change. Despite habitat loss and degradation, some amphibian species continue to persist in altered urban landscapes. The red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) is one such- species and in this study, we assess how habitat patch size affects population density and genetic diversity of salamander populations in and around an urban center in Ohio, United States. Further, we examined patterns of genetic differentiation and landscape connectivity to understand gene flow between populations and tested for historic demographic bottleneck effects. Populations were sampled from 9 urban forest patches ranging in size from less than 1 ha to approximately 250 ha. There was no apparent effect of contiguous habitat patch size on salamander density nor genetic diversity, but we did observe significant genetic differentiation between 97% of pairwise population comparisons. The differentiation observed was not a result of overland distance or effective distance due to landscape resistance. There was evidence of historic bottlenecks at every site. These results suggest that density is driven by within-patch heterogeneity and that genetic diversity is affected by drivers other than patch size or contemporary population density. Our study demonstrates that red-backed salamanders can persist in wooded, urban parks, but that genetic diversity remains susceptible to demographic changes.

AB  - Genetic studies constitute a powerful approach to study the introduction and expansion of invasive species. Senecio inaequidens DC is one of the Europe's fastest plant invaders and is suspected to use railway corridors to expand. In France, the species has first been observed in the city of Paris in the late 1990's and today it is present throughout the region. In order to assess the role of railways in S. inaequidens invasion, we used innovative multivariate analyses to study population genetic diversity of this allotetraploid species. We analyzed the genetic diversity at 11 microsatellite markers of a total of 450 individuals sampled at 15 locations along railways connecting the city of Paris to the surrounding suburban/rural areas. Geographical distances among locations ranged from 1 to 83 km with four locations within Paris at the departure train stations of the national/international train lines studied. To our knowledge, studies on invasive allotetraploid plants where data were kept in the tetraploid format are still scarce. Our analyses revealed substantial genetic diversity and clear genetic differentiation among some populations, with a genetic gradient detected along one railway line. Results also showed no genetic bottleneck between Parisian populations and the historically introduced population located in South of France. Our study thus revealed the role of railways as a corridor among S. inaequidens populations within central Paris. However, connecting networks appeared more complex in the suburban and rural areas suggesting other potential vectors.

AB  - Urban landscapes contain many barriers to wildlife movement and gene flow, particularly for large terrestrial mammals with extensive natural home ranges. Eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) are a large macropodid, whose biological range partially coincides with areas subjected to high rates of urban expansion, including the Southeast Queensland (SEQ) bioregion of Australia. Within this region, M. giganteus populations have had recent, rapid declines in numbers with ongoing urbanisation posing a significant threat due to the isolation of populations. Therefore, we investigated the genetic profile of kangaroos in a rapidly urbanising SEQ region (Sunshine Coast) by comparing them to other SEQ kangaroos (Greater Brisbane) and to higher density kangaroo populations in a landscape matrix with greater levels of connectivity (Australian Capital Territory; ACT). We utilised a targeted genetic probe of genome-wide SNPs to obtain baseline genetic profiles of M. giganteus using scat samples collected from 24 sites in the Sunshine Coast (n = 103) and compared these to Greater Brisbane (n = 20) and ACT (n = 29) scat samples. Genetic diversity was similar when comparing the ACT, Sunshine Coast and Greater Brisbane regions (HE: 0.224 & ndash;0.238), yet effective population size was markedly higher for the ACT region (Ne = 3453) than for both the Sunshine Coast and Greater Brisbane (Ne = 43.3 and 25.0, respectively), with clear genetic differentiation on a regional scale. We also identified six genetic groups within our SEQ study area, with significant differences in genetic diversity (HE: 0.188 & ndash; 0.289). The presence of high numbers of private alleles in all regions and within some SEQ populations highlights the conservation significance of preserving local populations. We also identified natural and anthropogenic barriers, which may have impacted genetic processes such as gene flow in the region. Therefore, this research highlights the need for localised management of kangaroo pop-ulations to preserve genetic diversity and structure in the SEQ region, by maintaining and improving landscape connectivity. We emphasise that for the conservation of local and global biodiversity, it is imperative to assess baseline genetic status of both common and threatened species, particularly when declines and extirpations are occurring across these species & rsquo; ranges.

AB  - Oryzomys couesi cozumelae is an endemic, threatened rodent from Cozumel Island, Mexico. We estimated its genetic diversity and structure by analyzing microsatellite loci in 228 samples from 12 sampling sites widely distributed throughout the island. Unexpected high levels of genetic and allelic diversity were found: a total of 54 alleles, an average of 10.8 alleles per locus, and high heterozygosity values (mean H-o = 0.624, H-E = 0.690 and H-Nei = 0.689). These values are higher than those reported for small sized insular mammals, higher than that found in 37 individuals of the mainland O. couesi from southern Mexico (H-o = 0.578) that we analyzed for comparative purposes, and similar to those of other mainland small mammal populations. Despite factors that affect Cozumel's biota, such as exotic predators and competitors, hurricanes, seasonal population fluctuations and anthropogenic activities, no evidence of genetic bottlenecks was found. A significant population structure was observed and a model of isolation-by-distance was supported. our findings render O. c. cozumelae a high conservation value, not only for its high genetic diversity and structure, but because available data suggests that its population has declined significantly in recent years. Further habitat fragmentation and population isolation could result in a higher genetic structure and loss of genetic diversity. The protection of habitat, the maintenance of habitat connectivity and the removal of introduced competitors and predators are a conservation priority. Acknowledging that the genetic structure of populations has crucial conservation implications, the present genetic information should be taken into account in management plans for the conservation of O. c. cozurtielae.

AB  - The anthropogenic fragmentation of habitats has altered the distribution and size of populations of many species worldwide. To predict fate of populations and establish management practices that ensure their viability, we need to understand the demographic and genetic consequences of fragmentation. In this study, we analyzed whether the spatial configuration of remnant habitat patches within a fragmented landscape has shaped the patterns of genetic diversity and differences in local populations of the Montane brown frog (Rana ornativentris) in Tokyo, Japan. The species inhabits secondary forests and is particularly affected by fragmentation due to its habitat selectivity and low dispersal capability. We determined allele frequencies of six microsatellites to estimate genetic diversity of 33 local populations and pairwise genetic distances among them. Habitat suitability maps were developed based on two models, one with only climatic and topography as predictor variables (HSn), the second incorporating the potential barrier effect of urbanization as an additional variable (HSu). Ecological distances were calculated using the circuit theory applied to the habitat suitability maps. We found that within-population genetic diversity decreases as the HSu habitat suitability decreases. Moreover, pairwise population genetic distance showed the highest correlations with resistance (i.e., ecological) distances when the HSu map was used. Our results confirmed the expectation that urbanized lands are barriers to gene flow, and that habitat fragmentation restricts inter-population dispersal, thus reducing the genetic diversity of local populations. Our results also demonstrate that landscape genetics is a useful approach for identifying key factors affecting dispersal.

AB  - As a Nature-Based Solution, urban forests deliver a number of environmental ecosystem services (EESs). To quantify these EESs, well-defined, reliable, quantifiable and stable indicators are needed. With literature analysis and expert knowledge gathered within COST Action FP1204 GreenInUrbs, we proposed a classification of urban forest EESs into three categories: (A) regulation of air, water, soil and climate; (B) provisioning of habitat quality; and (C) provisioning of other goods and services. Each category is divided into EES types: (a) amelioration of air quality; restoration of soil and water; amelioration of the microclimate; removal of CO2 from the air; (b) provision of habitat for biodiversity; support for resilient urban ecosystems; provision of genetic diversity; and (c) provision of energy and nutrients; provision of grey infrastructure resilience. Each EES type provides one or more benefits. For each of these 12 benefits, we propose a set of indicators to be used when analyzing the impacts on the identified EESs. Around half of the 36 indicators are relevant to more than one single benefit, which highlights complex interrelationships. The indicators of wider applicability are tree and stand characteristics, followed by leaf physical traits and tree species composition. This knowledge is needed for the optimization of the EESs delivered by urban forests, now and in the future.

AB  - Multiethnicity in Teopancazco, Teotihuacan, is supported by foreign individuals found in the neighborhood center as well as by the diversity observed in funerary rituals at the site. Studies of both stable and strontium isotopes as well as paleodietary analysis, suggest that the population of Teopancazco was composed by three population groups: people from Teotihuacan, people from nearby sites (Tlaxcala-Hidalgo-Puebla), and people from afar, including the coastal plains. In an attempt to understand the genetic dynamics in Teopancazco we conducted an ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis based on mtDNA. Our results show that the level of genetic diversity is consistent with the multiethnicity phenomenon at the neighborhood center. Levels of genetic diversity at different time periods of Teopancazco's history show that multiethnicity was evident since the beginning and lasted until the collapse of the neighborhood center. However, a PCA and a Neighbor-Joining tree suggested the presence of a genetically differentiated group (buried at the Transitional phase) compared to the population from the initial phase (Tlamimilolpa) as well as the population from the final phase (Xolalpan) of the history of Teopancazco. Genetic studies showed no differences in genetic diversity between males and females in the adult population of Teopancazco, this data along with ample archaeological evidence, suggest a neolocal post-marital pattern of residence in Teopancazco. Nevertheless, genetic analyses on the infant population showed that the males are significantly more heterogeneous than the females suggesting a possible differential role in cultural practices by sex in the infant sector. Regarding interpopulation analysis, we found similar indices of genetic diversity between Teopancazco and heterogeneous native groups, which support the multiethnic character of Teopancazco. Finally, our data showed a close genetic relationship between Teopancazco and populations from the "Teotihuacan corridor" and from Oaxaca and the Maya region, in agreement with previous archaeological evidence.

AB  - Although habitat fragmentation is recognized as a primary threat to biodiversity, the effects of urban development on genetic population structure vary among species and landscapes and are not yet well understood. Here we use non-invasive genetic sampling to compare the effects of fragmentation by major roads and urban development on levels of dispersal, genetic diversity, and relatedness between paired bobcat populations in replicate landscapes in coastal southern California. We hypothesized that bobcat populations in sites surrounded by urbanization would experience reduced functional connectivity relative to less isolated nearby populations. Our results show that, bobcat genetic population structure is affected by roads and development but not always as predicted by the degree that these landscape features surround fragments. Instead, we suggest that urban development may affect functional connectivity between bobcat populations more by limiting the number and genetic diversity of source populations of migrants than by creating impermeable barriers to dispersal.

AB  - Aim Drivers of extant population genetic structure include past climate-driven range shifts and vicariant events, as well as gene flow mediated by dispersal and habitat continuity. Their integration as alternative or complementary drivers is often missing or incomplete, potentially overlooking relevant processes and time scales. Here we ask whether it is the imprint of past range shifts or habitat connectivity driven by oceanographic transport that best explain genetic structure in a poorly understood model, a forest-forming African kelp. Location Southwestern coast of Africa (Benguela current region). Taxon Laminaria pallida. Methods We estimated genetic variability along the species distributional range using 14 microsatellite markers. This genetic variability was compared to estimates of past range shifts derived from species distribution modelling for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the mid-Holocene (MH) and the present, and estimates of habitat connectivity derived from oceanographic biophysical modelling. Results The species is structured in two clusters, a southern cluster with much richer (allelic richness A: 10.40 +/- 0.33) and unique (private alleles PA: 56.69 +/- 4.05) genetic diversity, and a northern cluster (A: 4.75 +/- 0.17; PA: 6.70 +/- 1.45). These clusters matched well-known biogeographical regions and their transition coincided with a dispersal barrier formed by upwelled offshore transport. No major range shifts or vicariant events were hindcasted along the present range, suggesting population stability from the LGM to the present. Main conclusions Habitat connectivity, rather than past range shifts, explains the extant population structure. Future environmental requirements of the species along the Benguela upwelling system are projected to persist or even intensify, likely preserving the observed genetic patterns for the years to come. Yet, the differentiation and endemicity between clusters, and the isolation structured by the regional oceanography, implies high conservation value for genetic biodiversity, and even more if considering the ecological, social and economic services provided by kelp forests.

AB  - The influence of Pleistocene climatic cycles on Southern Hemisphere biotas is not yet well understood. Australia's eastern coastal margin provides an ideal setting for examining the relative influence of landscape development, sea level fluctuation, and cyclic climatic aridity on the evolution of freshwater biodiversity. We examined the impact of climatic oscillations and physical biogeographic barriers on the evolutionary history of the wide-ranging Krefft's river turtle (Emydura macquarii krefftii), using range-wide sampling (649 individuals representing 18 locations across 11 drainages) and analysis of mitochondrial sequences (similar to 1.3-kb control region and ND4) and nuclear microsatellites (12 polymorphic loci). A range of phylogeographic (haplotype networks, molecular dating), demographic (neutrality tests, mismatch distributions), and population genetic analyses (pairwise F-ST, analysis of molecular variance, Bayesian clustering analysis) were implemented to differentiate between competing demographic (local persistence vs. range expansion) and biogeographic (arid corridor vs. drainage divide) scenarios. Genetic data reveal population genetic structure in Krefft's river turtles primarily reflects isolation across drainage divides. Striking north-south regional divergence (2.2% ND4 p-distance; c. 4.73Ma, 95% higher posterior density (HPD) 2.08-8.16Ma) was consistent with long-term isolation across a major drainage divide, not an adjacent arid corridor. Ancient divergence among regional lineages implies persistence of northern Krefft's populations despite the recurrent phases of severe local aridity, but with very low contemporary genetic diversity. Stable demography and high levels of genetic diversity are inferred for southern populations, where aridity was less extreme. Range-wide genetic structure in Krefft's river turtles reflects contemporary and historical drainage architecture, although regional differences in the extent of Plio-Pleistocene climatic aridity may be reflected in current levels of genetic diversity.

AB  - Understanding the timescales that shape spatial genetic structure is pivotal to ascertain the impact of habitat fragmentation on the genetic diversity and reproductive viability of long-lived plant populations. Combining genetic and ecological information with current and past fragmentation conditions allows the identification of the main drivers important in shaping population structure and declines in reproduction, which is crucial for informing conservation strategies. Using historic aerial photographs, we defined the past fragmentation conditions for the shrub Conospermum undulatum, a species now completely embedded in an urban area. We explored the impact of current and past conditions on its genetic layout and assessed the effects of genetic and environmental factors on its reproduction. The historically high structural connectivity was evident in the genetics of the species. Despite the current intense fragmentation, we found similar levels of genetic diversity across populations and a weak spatial genetic structure. Historical connectivity was negatively associated with genetic differentiation among populations and positively related to within-population genetic diversity. Variation partitioning of reproductive performance explained similar to 66% of the variance, showing significant influences for genetic (9%), environmental (15%), and combined (42%) fractions. Our study highlights the importance of considering the historical habitat dynamics when investigating fragmentation consequences in long-lived plants. A detailed characterization of fragmentation from 1953 has shown how low levels of genetic fixation are due to extensive gene flow through the non-fragmented landscape. Moreover, knowledge of the relationships between genetic and environmental variation and reproduction can help to implement effective conservation strategies, particularly in highly dynamic landscapes.

AB  - Phylogeographic barriers, together with habitat loss and fragmentation, contribute to the evolution of a species' genetic diversity by limiting gene flow and increasing genetic differentiation among populations. Changes in connectivity can thus affect the genetic diversity of populations, which may influence the evolutionary potential of species and the survival of populations in the long term. We studied the genetic diversity of the little known Northern rufous mouse lemur (Microcebus tavaratra), endemic to Northern Madagascar. We focused on the population of M. tavaratra in the Loky-Manambato region, Northern Madagascar, a region delimited by two permanent rivers and characterized by a mosaic of fragmented forests. We genotyped 148 individuals at three mitochondrial loci (D-loop, cytb, and cox2) in all the major forests of the study region. Our analyses suggest that M. tavaratra holds average genetic diversity when compared to other mouse lemur species, and we identified two to four genetic clusters in the study region, a pattern similar to that observed in another lemur endemic to the region (Propithecus tattersalli). The main cluster involved samples from the two mountain forests in the study region, which were connected until recently. However, the river crossing the study region does not appear to be a strict barrier to gene flow in M. tavaratra. Finally, the inferred demographic history of M. tavaratra suggests no detectable departure from stationarity over the last millennia. Comparisons with codistributed species (P. tattersalli and two endemic rodents, Eliurus spp.) suggest both differences and similarities in the genetic clusters identified (i.e., barriers to species dispersal) and in the inferred demographic history. These comparisons suggest that studies of codistributed species are important to understand the effects of landscape features on species and to reconstruct the history of habitat changes in a region.

AB  - In order to conserve forest plant species under the particularly high constraints that represent urban surroundings, it is necessary to identify the key factors for population persistence. This study examined within- and between-population pollen dispersal using fluorescent dye as pollen analogue, and genetic variation and structure using 15 allozyme loci in Centaurium erythraea, an insect-pollinated, early-successional forest biennial herb occurring in a peri-urban forest (Brussels urban zone, Belgium). Dye dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution, with most dye transfers occurring at short distances (< 15 m), and only a few long-distance events (up to 743 m). Flowers of C. erythraea are mainly visited by Syrphids (Diptera) and small bees, which are usually considered as short-distance pollen dispersers, and occasionally by bumblebees, which are usually longer-distance pollen dispersers. Small and large dye source populations differed in dye deposition patterns. The populations showed low genetic diversity, high inbreeding coefficients (F-IS) and high genetic differentiation (F-ST), suggesting restricted gene flow, which can be expected for an early-successional biennial species with a predominantly selfing breeding system and fluctuating population sizes. The positive relationship between recruitment rate and allelic richness and expected heterozygosity, and the absence of significant correlations between genetic variation and population size suggest seedling recruitment from the seed bank, contributing to maintain genetic diversity. Long-distance dye dispersal events indicate pollinator movements along urban forest path and road verges. These landscape elements might therefore have a potential conservation value by contributing to connectivity of early-successional species populations located in patchy open habitats.

AB  - Genetic diversity and haplotype composition of the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus) population from the San San Pond Sak (SSPS) wetland in Bocas del Toro, Panama, was studied using a segment of the mitochondrial DNA (control region). No genetic information to date has been published for manatee populations in Panama. Due to the secretive behavior and small population size of the species in the area, DNA extraction was conducted from opportunistically collected fecal (N = 20), carcass tissue (N = 4), and bone (N = 4) samples. However, after DNA processing, only 10 samples provided enough quality DNA for sequencing-three fecal, four tissue, arid three bone samples. We identified three haplotypes in total: J01. was previously published (N = 3), while the other two haplotypes, J02 (N = 3) and J03 (N = 4), are reported for the first time. The genetic diversity was similar to previous analyses conducted in the Caribbean with moderate values of nucleotide (pi = 0.00152) and haplotypic (Hd = 0.57) diversity Connectivity assessment between the SSPS population with published range-wide manatee haplotypes was based on sequence similarity, genetic distance, and genetic differentiation. The identified J01 haplotype is also found in populations to the north along the Central American and Gulf of Mexico coasts indicating reduced differentiation (Fst = 0.0094). In contrast, comparisons between SSPS sequences and South American populations (not including Colombia), the West Indies, and Florida showed fewer similarities (Fst = 0.049 and 0.058, respectively). These results corroborate previous phylogeographic patterns already established for manatee populations and situate the manatee population in Panama within the Belize/Mexico cluster. In addition, these findings provide a baseline for comparative studies of manatees in other areas of Panama and Central America. These results can assist with management decisions regarding conservation of genetic diversity, future introductions, connectivity, and effective population size of manatee populations along the Central American corridor.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is particularly severe in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of Texas, where greater than 90% of the native wetland habitat has been replaced by agriculture and urban development. The Brownsville Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas insperata), a rare subspecies of the Common Yellowthroat restricted to this area, is a good model for studying the effects of this extensive fragmentation on avian genetics and ecology. In this study, three hypotheses addressing genetics and habitat fragmentation were tested: (1) the density of Brownsville Yellowthroats is greatest along the Rio Grande rather than away from the river; (2) individuals found on or near the Rio Grande are more closely related than individuals farther away; and (3) a source-sink metapopulation model is the best fit to describe the population dynamics of the subspecies. We used 15 microsatellites to examine the genetic diversity of 128 individuals from Cameron and Hidalgo Counties (Texas) sampled during 2008-2009. The densities of yellowthroats at sites near the Rio Grande were not significantly different from densities at sites farther from the river. Genetic analysis indicated that individuals were as related to each other as would be expected in distant relatives and indicated the presence of a single, admixed population. The results suggest that the Brownsville Common Yellowthroat is able to move freely among isolated habitat patches and that wetlands along the Rio Grande do not act as an exclusive corridor for this species.

AB  - Assuming that genetically diverse populations of bees are less likely to suffer the harmful effects of inbreeding and better able to avoid an extinction vortex related to the sex determination mechanism, the identification of putative areas in which diversity is concentrated should be focus of a discussion. Models of historical climate stability constitute an elegant manner of inferring such areas. The aim of the present study was to model the potential distribution of stingless bees in different periods of climate extremes of the Late Quaternary and the current day. A spatially-explicit model was designed to predict areas in which genetic diversity is putatively concentrated in an assemblage of nineteen species in the southern Atlantic Forest, Brazil. These climatically-stable areas (i.e., refuges) were mainly recorded in three portions of coastal forests in southeastern Brazil, regions that concentrate areas of high to extreme importance to the conservation of biological diversity. Such regions have differences regarding size and suitability scores and are distributed within the southern Atlantic Forest Central Corridor (SCC), as well as the northern (NSM) and southern Serra do Mar Corridor (SSM). Considering that refuges historically harbor high degrees of genetic diversity, these three regions are indicated as those of high importance to the conservation of stingless bees in the Atlantic Forest.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of how urbanization influences the evolution of native species is vital for urban wildlife ecology and conservation in the Anthropocene. With thousands of years of agriculture-dominated historical urbanization followed by 40 years of intensive and rapid urbanization, Shanghai provides an ideal environment to study how the two-stage urbanization process influences the evolution of indigenous wildlife, especially of anuran species. Therefore, in this study, we used mitochondrial Cyt-b gene, microsatellite (SSR), and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data to evaluate the demographic history and genetic structure of the eastern golden frog (Pelophylax plancyi), by sampling 407 individuals from 15 local populations across Shanghai, China. All local populations experienced bottlenecks during historical urbanization, while the local populations in urban areas maintained comparable contemporary effective population sizes (N-e) and genetic diversity with suburban and rural populations. Nevertheless, the rapid modern urbanization has already imposed significant negative effects to the integrity of populations. The 15 local populations were differentiated into eight genetic clusters, showing a spatial distribution pattern consistent with the current urbanization gradient and island-mainland geography. Although moderate gene flow still occurred from the rural peripheral cluster to urban and suburban clusters, population fragmentation was more serious in the urban and suburban populations, where higher urbanization levels within 2-km radius areas showed significant negative relationships to the N-e and genetic diversity of local populations. Therefore, to protect urban wildlife with limited dispersal ability, improving conditions in fragmented habitat remnants might be most essential for local populations living in more urbanized areas. Meanwhile, we highlight the need to preserve large unfragmented rural habitats and to construct corridor networks to connect discrete urban habitat remnants for the long-term wildlife conservation in intensively urbanizing environments.

AB  - Conversion and fragmentation of wildlife habitat often leads to smaller and isolated populations and can reduce a species' ability to disperse across the landscape. As a consequence, genetic drift can quickly lower genetic variation and increase vulnerability to extirpation. For species of conservation concern, quantification of population size and connectivity can clarify the influence of genetic drift in local populations and provides important information for conservation management and recovery strategies. Here, we used genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and capture-mark-recapture methods to evaluate the genetic diversity and demography within seven focal sites of the endangered San Francisco gartersnake (Thamnophis sirtalis tetrataenia), a species affected by alteration and isolation of wetland habitats throughout its distribution. The primary goals were to determine the population structure and degree of genetic isolation among T. s. tetrataenia populations and estimate effective size and population abundance within sites to better understand the present and future importance of genetic drift. We also used temporally sampled datasets to examine the magnitude of genetic change over time. We found moderate population genetic structure throughout the San Francisco Peninsula that partitions sites into northern and southern regional clusters. Point estimates of both effective size and population abundance were generally small (<= 100) for a majority of the sites, and estimates were particularly low in the northern populations. Genetic analyses of temporal datasets indicated an increase in genetic differentiation, especially for the most geographically isolated sites, and decreased genetic diversity over time in at least one site (Pacifica). Our results suggest that drift-mediated processes as a functiyon of small population size and reduced connectivity from neighboring populations may decrease diversity and increase differentiation. Improving genetic diversity and connectivity among T. s. tetrataenia populations could promote persistence of this endangered snake.

AB  - The Utah prairie dog (Cynomys parvidens), listed as threatened under the United States Endangered Species Act, was the subject of an extensive eradication program throughout its range during the 20th century. Eradication campaigns, habitat destruction/fragmentation/conversion, and epizootic outbreaks (e.g., sylvatic plague) have reduced prairie dog numbers from an estimated 95,000 individuals in the 1920s to approximately 14,000 (estimated adult spring count) today. As a result of these anthropogenic actions, the species is now found in small isolated sets of subpopulations. We characterized the levels of genetic diversity and population genetic structure using 10 neutral nuclear microsatellite loci for twelve populations (native and transplanted) representative of the three management designated recovery units, found in three distinct biogeographic regions, sampled across the species' range. The results indicate (1) low levels of genetic diversity within colonies (H-e=0.109-0.357; H-o=0.106- 0.313), (2) high levels of genetic differentiation among colonies (global F-ST=0.296), (3) very small genetic effective population sizes, and (4) evidence of genetic bottlenecks. The genetic data reveal additional subdivision such that colonies within recovery units do not form single genotype clusters consistent with recovery unit boundaries. Genotype cluster membership support historical gene flow among colonies in the easternmost West Desert Recovery Unit with the westernmost Pausaugunt colonies and among the eastern Pausaugunt colonies and the Awapa Recovery unit to the north. In order to maintain the long-term viability of the species, there needs to be an increased focus on maintaining suitable habitat between groups of existing populations that can act as connective corridors. The location of future translocation sites should be located in areas that will maximize connectivity, leading to maintenance of genetic variation and evolutionary potential.

AB  - Urbanization is a pervasive process causing habitat fragmentation, spatial isolation of populations, and reduction of biological diversity. In this study, we applied 11 microsatellite loci and Bayesian analyses to investigate genetic diversity and population structure in marsh frogs (Pelophylax ridibundus) living in two types of environment-highly fragmented urban landscapes, and landscapes characterized by the presence of a river and artificial canals. Our results show reduced genetic diversity, lower effective population sizes, and higher genetic differentiation for spatially isolated urban populations in comparison with populations outside intensely urbanized areas. Reduction of allelic diversity in urban localities isolated for 13-37 generations is more conspicuous than reduction of expected heterozygosity. Populations living close to the River Danube, its branches, and artificial canals are genetically more homogenous. Our results also suggest that the Danube in Bratislava is not a natural barrier to gene flow. In contrast, it acts as a natural corridor for water frog dispersal. Population structure of P. ridibundus also shows higher genetic connectivity within water paths than between them, suggesting limited overland dispersal, and reflects the historical landscape structure associated with the distribution of the lost river branches.

AB  - In the Sierra Nevada, distributions of forest tree species are largely controlled by the soil-moisture balance. Changes in temperature or precipitation as a result of increased greenhouse gas concentrations could lead to changes in species distributions. In addition, climatic change could increase the frequency and severity of wildfires. We used a forest gap model developed for Sierra Nevada forests to investigate the potential sensitivity of these forests to climatic change, including a changing fire regime. Fuel moisture influences the fire regime and couples fire to climate. Fires are also affected by fuel loads, which accumulate according to forest structure and composition. These model features were used to investigate the complex interactions between climate, fire, and forest dynamics. Eight hypothetical climate-change scenarios were simulated, including two general circulation model (GCM) predictions of a 2 x CO(2) world. The response of forest structure, species composition, and the fire regime to these changes in the climate were examined at four sites across an elevation gradient. Impacts on woody biomass and species composition as a result of climatic change were site specific and depended on the environmental constraints of a site and the environmental tolerances of the tree species simulated. Climatic change altered the fire regime both directly and indirectly. Fire frequency responded directly to climate's influence on fuel moisture, whereas fire extent was affected by changes that occurred in either woody biomass or species composition. The influence of species composition on fuel-bed bulk density was particularly important. Future fires in the Sierra Nevada could be both more frequent and of greater spatial extent if GCM predictions prove true.

AB  - Context Deciphering how the complex environmental dynamics of highland temperate forests drive local patterns of genetic variation is key to understanding species diversity and distribution. Objectives Evaluate how the environmental complexity of La Malinche volcano influences patterns of genomic variation in Peromyscus melanotis, across two mountain slopes and global and regional geographic scales. Methods Using reduced representation genomic sequencing we estimated population genetic diversity, subdivisions and migration rates. Remote sensing data and drone image processing were used to characterize landscape variables. We evaluated their effect on connectivity, based on a landscape analyses framework, using resistance surfaces, circuit theory and omnidirectional connectivity. Results In our global analysis assessing multiple elevation levels on two mountain slopes, we identified three genetic clusters differentiating two elevation levels of the north mountain slope (ECLM; 3150 m, 3300 m) from the rest of sampled areas. Within the northeast mountain slope (CVM), we found reduced genetic variation, limited connectivity, fewer migrants and isolation in higher elevation populations. ECLM populations showed higher genetic diversity and lowest connectivity at intermediate levels. NDVI and tree height were the main factors promoting connectivity in CVM, while tree height and litter cover were most important in ECLM. Conclusions Our findings showed how the forest environmental complexity across different geographic scales drives dispersal, genomic structure and connectivity patterns in this rodent, where dirt roads and disturbed areas limit its connectivity, while exhibiting higher connectivity at the highest elevations where the forest is less disturbed. Notably, that our 3D variable of tree height was significant demonstrates the utility in incorporating 3D vegetation structure variables into landscape genetic analyses.

AB  - A major concern in conservation biology today is the loss of genetic diversity in structured populations, which is often a consequence of habitat contraction and restricted gene flow over time. These dynamic biological processes require monitoring with temporal environmental and landscape genetic data. We compared the spatial genetic variation of a relict, umbrella species, the capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), in two different demographic periods, as represented by older museum specimens (1960-1990) and recent non-invasive samples (2011-2015) collected from the Carpathian Mountains, where habitat connectivity has dramatically decreased in the past decade. Using a combination of species distribution modelling and spatial genetic inference, we analysed how climatic and environmental constraints shaped population structures of the species. Environmental and climate niche models confirmed that relict Carpathian capercaillie populations are temperature sensitive, and they occur in a narrow range of mountain forest habitats at the highest altitudes. We found that the environmental and climatic constraints led to genetically isolated populations, but we also detected clusters that did not match relatively interrupted areas of niche habitats. We observed a similar disruption of gene flow in both periods; however, a stronger signal of genetic structuring in recent samples indicated that the processes negatively affecting connectivity are ongoing. The effective population size of the Carpathian population has declined in recent years, but it has been low for at least the last five decades in the Western Carpathians. This study demonstrates the importance of temporal ecological and genetic data as an effective warning tool for the conservation and management of wildlife species.

AB  - Fragmentation of wildlife populations can have detrimental effects, including genetic differentiation of populations, loss of genetic diversity, and inbreeding depression We evaluated the genetic structure among isolated colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) along an urban gradient in southern Denver, Colorado. Urban colonies are important ecologically and for educational purposes, and they serve as source populations for relocation efforts Levels of genetic differentiation between colonies were high relative to colonies in natural habitat at comparable or greater distances Prairie clog colonies depend on dispersal among colonies for long-term persistence, and we found evidence for reduced but measurable rates of movement of individual prairie dogs among urban fragments We observed a trend for smaller and more isolated colonies to exhibit lower genetic diversity, but we did not detect Inbreeding in any of the colonies sampled. Isolation-by-distance measures, including measures based on permeability of various features of urban habitat such as roads and development, did not explain genetic differences. Our system represents a possible end point in the genetic consequences of continued loss and Isolation of prairie clog colonies as fragmentation Increases in both urban and natural landscapes Urban development could affect dispersal in unexpected and complex ways and requires further study, hut prairie dog colonies and their associated wildlife communities in urban areas have the potential for long-term persistence if not extirpated by human activity DOI 10.1644/09-MAMM-A-019.1.

AB  - Understanding the patterns of population connectivity and level of genetic diversity can facilitate the identification of both ecologically relevant populations and the spatial scales at which conservation management may need to focus. We quantified genetic variation within and among populations of black-throated finches across their current distribution. To quantify genetic structure and diversity, we genotyped 242 individuals from four populations using 14 polymorphic microsatellite markers and sequenced 25 individuals based on a 302-base-pair segment of mitochondrial control region. We found modest levels of genetic diversity (average allelic richness r=4.37 +/- 0.41 (standard error) and average heterozygosity H-O=0.42 +/- 0.040 (standard error)) with no bottleneck signature among sampled populations. We identified two genetic groups that represent populations of two subspecies based on Bayesian clustering analysis and low levels of genetic differentiation based on pairwise genetic differentiation statistics (all F-ST, R-ST and Nei's unbiased D values <0.1). Our data suggest that genetic exchange occurs among sampled populations despite recent population declines. Conservation efforts that focus on maintaining habitat connectivity and increasing habitat quality to ensure a high level of gene flow on a larger scale will improve the species' ability to persist in changing landscapes. Conservation management should also support continuous monitoring of the bird to identify any rapid population declines as land-use intensification occurs throughout the species' range.

AB  - Introduction. Theory predicts that habitat fragmentation, by reducing population size and increasing isolation among remnant populations, can alter their genetic diversity and structure. A cascade of effects is expected: genetic drift and inbreeding after a population bottleneck, changes in biotic interactions that may affect, as in the case of plants, pollen dynamics, mating system, reproductive success. The detection of the effects of contemporary habitat fragmentation on the genetic structure of populations are conditioned by the magnitude of change, given the few number of generations since the onset of fragmentation, especially for long-lived organisms. However, the present-day genetic structure of populations may bear the signature of past demography events. Here, we examine the effects of rainforest fragmentation on the genetic diversity, population structure, mating system (outcrossing rate), indirect gene flow and contemporary pollen dynamics in the understory herb Aphelandra aurantiaca. Also, we assessed its present-day genetic structure under different past demographic scenarios.
   Methods. Twelve populations of A. aurantiaca were sampled in large (4), medium (3), and small (5) forest fragments in the lowland tropical rainforest at Los Tuxtlas region. Variation at 11 microsatellite loci was assessed in 28 - 30 reproductive plants per population. In two medium-and two large-size fragments we estimated the density of reproductive plants, and the mating system by analyzing the progeny of different mother plants per population.
   Results. Despite prevailing habitat fragmentation, populations of A. aurantiaca possess high genetic variation (H-e = 0 : 61), weak genetic structure (R-st = 0 : 037), and slight inbreeding in small fragments. Effective population sizes (N-e) were large, but slightly lower in small fragments. Migrants derive mostly from large and medium size fragments. Gene dispersal is highly restricted but long distance gene dispersal events were detected. Aphelandra aurantiaca shows a mixed mating system (t(m) = 0 : 81) and the outcrossing rate have not been affected by habitat fragmentation. A strong pollen pool structure was detected due to few effective pollen donors (N-ep) and low distance pollen movement, pointing that most plants received pollen from close neighbors. Past demographic fluctuations may have affected the present population genetic structure as Bayesian coalescent analysis revealed the signature of past population expansion, possibly during warmer conditions after the last glacial maximum.
   Discussion. Habitat fragmentation has not increased genetic differentiation or reduced genetic diversity of A. aurantiaca despite dozens of generations since the onset of fragmentation in the region of Los Tuxtlas. Instead, past population expansion is compatible with the lack of observed genetic structure. The predicted negative effects of rainforest fragmentation on genetic diversity and population structure of A. aurantiaca seem to have been buffered owing to its large effective populations and long-distance dispersal events. In particular, its mixed-mating system, mostly of outcrossing, suggests high efficiency of pollinators promoting connectivity and reducing inbreeding. However, some results point that the effects of fragmentation are underway, as two small fragments showed higher membership probabilities to their population of origin, suggesting genetic isolation. Our findings underscore the importance of fragment size to maintain genetic connectivity across the landscape.

AB  - Aim To provide distribution information and preliminary conservation assessments for all species of the pineapple family (Bromeliaceae), one of the most diverse and ecologically important plant groups of the American tropics-a global biodiversity hotspot. Furthermore, we aim to analyse patterns of diversity, endemism and the conservation status of the Bromeliaceae on the continental level in the light of their evolutionary history. Location The Americas. Methods We compiled a dataset of occurrence records for 3,272 bromeliad species (93.4% of the family) and modelled their geographic distribution using either climate-based species distribution models, convex hulls or geographic buffers dependent on the number of occurrences available. We then combined this data with information on taxonomy and used the ConR software for a preliminary assessment of the conservation status of all species following Criterion B of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Results Our results stress the Atlantic Forest in eastern Brazil, the Andean slopes, Central America and the Guiana Highlands as centres of bromeliad diversity and endemism. Phylogenetically ancient subfamilies of bromeliads are centred in the Guiana highlands whereas the large radiations of the group spread across different habitats and large geographic area. A total of 81% of the evaluated bromeliad species are Possibly Threatened with extinction. We provide range polygons for 3,272 species, as well as newly georeferenced point localities for 911 species in the novel "bromeliad" r package, together with functions to generate diversity maps for individual taxonomic or functional groups. Main conclusions Diversity centres of the Bromeliaceae agreed with macroecological patterns of other plant and animal groups, but show some particular patterns related to the evolutionary origin of the family, especially ancient dispersal corridors. A staggering 2/3rds of Bromeliaceae species might be threatened with extinction, especially so in tropical rain forests, raising concerns about the conservation of the family and bromeliad-dependent animal species.

AB  - Species distribution models can be affected by overprediction when dispersal movement is not incorporated into the modelling process. We compared the efficiency of seven methods that take into account spatial constraints to reduce overprediction when using four algorithms for species distribution models. By using a virtual ecologist approach, we were able to measure the accuracy of each model in predicting actual species distributions. We built 40 virtual species distributions within the Neotropical realm. Then, we randomly sampled 50 occurrences that were used in seven spatially restricted species distribution models (hereafter called M-SDMs) and a non-spatially restricted ecological niche model (ENM). We used four algorithms; Maximum Entropy, Generalized Linear Models, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. M-SDM methods were divided into a priori methods, in which spatial restrictions were inserted with environmental variables in the modelling process, and a posteriori methods, in which reachable and suitable areas were overlapped. M-SDM efficiency was obtained by calculating the difference in commission and omission errors between M-SDMs and ENMs. We used linear mixed-effects models to test if differences in commission and omission errors varied among the M-SDMs and algorithms. Our results indicate that overall M-SDMs reduce overprediction with no increase in underprediction compared to ENMs with few exceptions, such as a priori methods combined with the Support Vector Machine algorithm. There is a high variation in modelling performance among species, but there were only a few cases in which overprediction or underprediction increased. We only compared methods that do not require species dispersal data, guaranteeing that they can be applied to less-studied species. We advocate that species distribution modellers should not ignore spatial constraints, especially because they can be included in models at low costs but high benefits in terms of overprediction reduction.

AB  - Microreserves may be useful in protecting native arthropod diversity in urbanized landscapes. However, species that do not disperse through the urban matrix may eventually be lost from these fragments. Population extinctions may be precipitated by an increase in genetic differentiation among fragments and loss of genetic diversity within fragments, and these effects should become stronger with time. We analyzed population genetic structure in the dispersal limited Jerusalem cricket Stenopelmatus n. sp. "santa monica" in the Santa Monica Mountains and Simi Hills north of Los Angeles, California (CA), to determine the impacts of fragmentation over the past 70 years. MtDNA divergence was greater among urban fragments than within contiguous habitat and was positively correlated with fragment age. MtDNA genetic diversity within fragments increased with fragment size and decreased with fragment age. Genetic divergence across 38 anonymous nuclear Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) loci was influenced by the presence of major highways and highway age, but there was no effect of additional urban fragmentation. ISSR diversity was not correlated with fragment size or age. Differing results between markers may be due to male-biased dispersal, or different effective population sizes, sorting rates, or mutation rates among sampled genes. Results suggest that genetic connectivity among populations has been disrupted by highways and urban development, prior to declines in local population sizes. We emphasize that genetic connectivity can rapidly erode in fragmented landscapes and that flightless arthropods can serve as sensitive indicators for these effects.

AB  - Conservation of coastal habitats is a global issue, yet biogenic reefs in temperate regions have received very little attention. They have a broad geographic distribution and are a key habitat in marine ecosystems impacted by human activities. In the Mediterranean Sea coralligenous reefs are biodiversity hot spots and are classified as sensitive habitats deserving conservation. Genetic diversity and structure influence demographic, ecological and evolutionary processes in populations and play a crucial role in conservation strategies. Nevertheless, a comprehensive view of population genetic structure of coralligenous species is lacking. Here, we reviewed the literature on the genetic structure of sessile and sedentary invertebrates of the Mediterranean coralligenous reefs. Linear regression models and meta-analytic approaches are used to assess the contributions of genetic markers, phylum, pelagic larval duration (PLD) and geographical distance to the population genetic structure. Our quantitative approach highlight that 1) most species show a significant genetic structure, 2) structuring differs between phyla, and 3) PLD does not appear to be a major driver of the structuring. We discuss the implication of these finding for the management and conservation, suggesting research areas that deserve attention, and providing recommendations for broad assessment and monitoring of genetic diversity in biogenic reefs species.

AB  - Endemic species on islands are considered at risk of extinction for several reasons, including limited dispersal abilities, small population sizes, and low genetic diversity. We used mitochondrial DNA (D-Loop) and 17 microsatellite loci to explore the evolutionary relationship between an endemic anemonefish, Amphiprion mccul-lochi (restricted to isolated locations in subtropical eastern Australia) and its more widespread sister species, A. akindynos. A mitochondrial DNA(mtDNA) phylogram showed reciprocal monophyly was lacking for the two species, with two supported groups, each containing representatives of both species, but no shared haplotypes and up to 12 species, but not location-specific management units(MUs). Population genetic analyses suggested evolutionary connectivity among samples of each species (mtDNA), while ecological connectivity was only evident among populations of the endemic, A. mccullochi. This suggests higher dispersal between endemic anemonefish populations at both evolutionary and ecological timeframes, despite separation by hundreds of kilometers. The complex mtDNA structure results from historical hybridization and introgression in the evolutionary past of these species, validated by msat analyses (NEWHYBRIDS, STRUCTURE, and DAPC). Both species had high genetic diversities (mtDNA h > 0.90, pi = 4.0%; msat genetic diversity, gd > 0.670). While high gd and connectivity reduce extinction risk, identifying and protecting populations implicated in generating reticulate structure among these species should be a conservation priority.

AB  - 1. Habitat fragmentation has been implicated as a primary cause for the ongoing erosion of global biodiversity, yet our understanding of the consequences in lotic systems is limited for many species and regions. Because of harsh environmental conditions that select for high colonisation rates, prairie stream fishes may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of fragmentation. Hence, there is urgent need for broader understanding of fragmentation in prairie streams such that meaningful conservation strategies can be developed. Further, examination at large spatial scales, including multiple impoundments and un-impounded catchments, will help identify the spatial extent of species movement through the landscape. 2. Our study used data from 10 microsatellite loci to describe the genetic structure of creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) populations across four catchments (three impounded and one un-impounded) in the Kansas River basin. We investigated whether genetic diversity was eroded in response to habitat fragmentation imposed by reservoirs and whether intervening lentic habitat increased resistance to dispersal among sites within a catchment. 3. Our analyses revealed that genetic diversity estimates were consistent with large populations regardless of the location of the sampled tributaries, and there was little evidence of recent population reductions. Nevertheless, we found a high degree of spatial genetic structure, suggesting that catchments comprise a set of isolated genetic units and that sample sites within catchments are subdivided into groups largely defined by intervening habitat type. Our data therefore suggest that lentic habitat is a barrier to dispersal among tributaries, thus reducing the opportunity for genetic rescue of populations in tributaries draining into reservoirs. Isolation by a reservoir, however, may not be immediately deleterious if the isolated tributary basin supports a large population.

AB  - Comparing genetic diversity, genetic differentiation, and performance between native and nonnative populations has advanced our knowledge of contemporary evolution and its ecological consequences. However, such between-range comparisons can be complicated by high among-population variation within native and nonnative ranges. For example, native vs. nonnative comparisons between small and non-representative subsets of populations for species with very large distributions have the potential to mislead because they may not sufficiently account for within-range adaptation to climatic conditions, and demographic history that may lead to non-adaptive evolution. We used the cosmopolitan weed Conyza canadensis to study the interplay of adaptive and demographic processes across, to our knowledge, the broadest climatic gradient yet investigated in this context. To examine the distribution of genetic diversity, we genotyped 26 native and 26 nonnative populations at 12 microsatellite loci. Furthermore, we recorded performance traits for 12 native and 13 nonnative populations in the field and in the common garden. To analyze how performance was related to range and/or climate, we fit pedigree mixed-effects models. These models weighed the population random effect for co-ancestry to account for the influence of demographic history on phenotypic among-population differentiation. Genetic diversity was very low, selfing rates were very high, and both were comparable between native and nonnative ranges. Nonnative populations out-performed native populations in the field. However, our most salient result was that both neutral genetic differentiation and common garden performance were far more correlated with the climatic conditions from which populations originated than native vs. nonnative range affiliation. Including co-ancestry of our populations in our models greatly increased explained variance and our ability to detect significant main effects for among-population variation in performance. High propagule pressure and high selfing rates, in concert with the ability to adapt rapidly to climatic gradients, may have facilitated the global success of this weed. Neither native nor nonnative populations were homogeneous groups but responded comparably to similar environments in each range. We suggest that studies of contemporary evolution should consider widely distributed and genotyped populations to disentangle native vs. nonnative range effects from varying adaptive processes within ranges and from potentially confounding effects of demographic history.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a major extinction driver. Despite dramatically increasing fragmentation across the globe, its specific impacts on population connectivity across species with differing life histories remain difficult to characterize, let alone quantify. Here, we investigate patterns of population connectivity in six songbird species from Singapore, a highly fragmented tropical rainforest island. Using massive panels of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms across dozens of samples per species, we examined population genetic diversity, inbreeding, gene flow and connectivity among species along a spectrum of ecological specificities. We found a higher resilience to habitat fragmentation in edge-tolerant and forest-canopy species as compared to forest-dependent understorey insectivores. The latter exhibited levels of genetic diversity up to three times lower in Singapore than in populations from contiguous forest elsewhere. Using dense genomic and geographic sampling, we identified individual barriers such as reservoirs that effectively minimize gene flow in sensitive understorey birds, revealing that terrestrial forest species may exhibit levels of sensitivity to fragmentation far greater than previously expected. This study provides a blueprint for conservation genomics at small scales with a view to identifying preferred locations for habitat corridors, flagging candidate populations for restocking with translocated individuals and improving the design of future reserves.

AB  - Gene flow in animals is limited or facilitated by different features within the landscape matrix they inhabit. The landscape representation in landscape genetics (LG) is traditionally modeled as resistance surfaces (RS), where novel optimization approaches are needed for assigning resistance values that adequately avoid subjectivity. Also, desert ecosystems and mammals are scarcely represented in LG studies. We addressed these issues by evaluating, at a microgeographic scale, the effect of landscape features on functional connectivity of the desert-dwelling Dipodomys merriami. We characterized genetic diversity and structure with microsatellites loci, estimated home ranges and movement of individuals using telemetry-one of the first with rodents, generated a set of individual and composite environmental surfaces based on hypotheses of variables influencing movement, and assessed how these variables relate to individual-based gene flow. Genetic diversity and structure results evidenced a family-induced pattern driven by first-order-related individuals, notably determining landscape genetic inferences. The vegetation cover and soil resistance optimized surface (NDVI) were the best-supported model and a significant predictor of individual genetic distance, followed by humidity and NDVI+humidity. Based on an accurate definition of thematic resolution, we also showed that vegetation is better represented as continuously (vs. categorically) distributed. Hence, with a nonsubjective optimization framework for RS and telemetry, we were able to describe that vegetation cover, soil texture, and climatic variables influence D. merriami's functional connectivity at a microgeographic scale, patterns we could further explain based on the home range, habitat use, and activity observed between sexes. We describe the relationship between environmental features and some aspects of D. merriami's behavior and physiology.

AB  - Introduction The Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF) is undergoing alarming deforestation, land overexploitation, and unregulated occupation. The Coastal Sandy Vegetation of BAF, known as Restinga, is under the most pressure of the BAF ecosystems. Understanding the effects of Restinga deforestation on biodiversity is a conservation priority. Aims/Methods We predicted the effect of landscape modifications on the large-scale spatial distribution of an endangered dung beetle (Dichotomius schiffleri) endemic to the BAF Restinga ecosystem. We tested the hypothesis that almost all the potential distribution area of this species has suffered from landscape modification, and reduced its spatial distribution. We used niche-based modeling approaches to predict the potential species distribution (climate-based models) and the species distribution under the current land-use scenario (landscape-based models). We then combined these models to predict the effects of landscape modification. Results The spatial distribution of D. schiffleri has decreased drastically as a consequence of landscape modification. The decreasing patch size, canopy cover percentage, and functional connectivity, and the increasing edge distance explain the decrease in the potential species distribution as predicted by climate variables. Discussion Suitable sites for this species are isolated in a vast matrix of pasture, tree plantations, and urban areas. D. schiffleri is sensitive to anthropogenic changes such as disturbances of preserved Restinga areas. Therefore, human coastal-plain land uses over the past five centuries pose multiple synergistic threats to the persistence of this species. Implications for insect conservation Our findings suggest an alarming trend toward species extinction in the near future, highlighting the need for specific conservation actions to protect Restinga biodiversity.

AB  - Pine wilt disease (PWD), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, is an extremely threatening invasion forest disease throughout the world, especially in Asia. B. xylophilus is spread in Asia by vector beetles of Monochamus alternatus, which has long no effective control method. Understanding of landscape effects on the dispersal and outbreaks of forest pests is crucial to establishing effective ecological control strategies. Here, we analyzed the samples of M. alternatus collected in a fine-scale in order to estimate the effects of landscape types on the genetic structure and dispersal of M. alternatus. The landscapes included the geographical scales, forest types and land uses. The individuals of M. alternatus were genotyped by using whole-genome resequencing. Population genetic structures were clearly differentiated at the range of 250 kms, suggesting the intermediate scale is an effective barrier against natural dispersal of M. alternatus. We used the least-cost distances, least-cost transect analysis, and distance-based redundancy analysis to estimate the effects of forest types and land uses within the fine scales. The results showed that the gene flow and genetic diversity were positively correlated with host and mixed forests, whereas negatively with non-host forests. Among land-use landscapes, the roads had the positive effect on gene flow and genetic diversity but farmland and urban uses had negative effects. This highlights that humanmediated transport via roads was likely to be the main factor leading to the long-distance invasion of M. alternatus, whereas non-host landscapes could suppress the spread of this species. These findings may be useful to control the PWD dispersed by M. alternatus.

AB  - Amazonian understory antbirds are thought to be relatively sedentary and to have limited dispersal ability; they avoid crossing forest gaps, and even narrow roads through a forest may limit their territories. However, most evidence for sedentariness in antbirds comes from field observations and plot-based recapture of adult individuals, which do not provide evidence for lack of genetic dispersal, as this often occurs through juveniles. In this study, we used microsatellite markers and mitochondrial control-region sequences to investigate contemporary and infer historical patterns of genetic diversity and structure of the Rufous-throated Antbird (Gymnopithys rufigula) within and between two large reserves in central Amazonia. Analyses based on microsatellites suggested two genetically distinct populations and asymmetrical gene flow between them. Within a population, we found a lack of genetic spatial autocorrelation, suggesting that genotypes are randomly distributed and that G.rufigula may disperse longer distances than expected for antbirds. Analyses based on mitochondrial sequences did not recover two clear genetic clusters corresponding to the two reserves and indicated the whole population of the Rufous-throated Antbird in the region has been expanding over the last 50,000 years. Historical migration rates were low and symmetrical between the two reserves, but we found evidence for a recent unilateral increase in gene flow. Recent differentiation between individuals of the two reserves and a unilateral increase in gene flow suggest that recent urban expansion and habitat loss may be driving changes and threatening populations of Rufous-throated Antbird in central Amazonia. As ecological traits and behavioral characteristics affect patterns of gene flow, comparative studies of other species with different behavior and ecological requirements will be necessary to better understand patterns of genetic dispersal and effects of urban expansion on Amazonian understory antbirds.

AB  - The ocelot Leopardus pardalis has become a conservation priority in the US as a result of severe population decline and loss of habitat during the 20th century. Only two small populations remain in this country. Their short-term viability is threatened by the disappearance of dense thornshrub communities, human-caused mortality and demographic stochasticity. The influence these factors have on ocelot persistence must be considered to develop effective conservation initiatives. We therefore examined neutral genetic diversity and connectivity among ocelots in the US and northeastern Mexico using 25 autosomal microsatellites and a 395-bp segment of the mitochondrial control region. Genetic variation was lowest in the population occurring on Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge, Texas (autosomal microsatellite HE=0.399 and mtDNA-haplotype diversity=0) and highest in northeastern Mexico (0.637 and 0.73, respectively), while intermediate on private lands in Willacy County, Texas (0.553 and 0.252, respectively). Significant genetic differentiation between the two Texas populations was observed, despite their close proximity (similar to 30 km). Both populations were also significantly divergent from northeastern Mexico. The absence of any detectable gene flow implies that the human modified landscape of the Lower Rio Grande Valley in southern Texas acts as a strong barrier to ocelot movement, disrupting metapopulation dynamics and contributing to loss of diversity. As a consequence, continued genetic erosion among the Texas populations is expected. The lack of movement through the fragmented landscape also suggests it is unlikely ocelots will recolonize unoccupied habitat patches along the Lower Rio Grande and the delta interior where agriculture and urban land uses predominate. The continued rapid development will exacerbate this problem. These factors threaten the persistence of the Texas populations and limit their recovery. Translocations are necessary to link ocelot populations in the US.

AB  - Reductions in genetic diversity and genetic connectivity have been documented in some predatory bird species in response to anthropogenic habitat fragmentation. The Southern Boobook (Ninox boobook) is the most common and widely-distributed owl in Australia but declines in abundance have been observed across its range. We used polymorphic microsatellite loci to investigate landscape-scale patterns of genetic variation and spatial genetic structure in boobooks from a variety of fragmented landscape types and relatively undisturbed landscape types across Western Australia. The maximum distance between collection locations of genetic samples was 1391 km. Indirect estimates of connectivity inferred from these genetic data were complemented by direct estimates of post-breeding dispersal of juvenile boobooks gathered from banding data resulting from this and other studies across Australia. We found high genetic diversity in microsatellite markers, weak spatial genetic structuring and no evidence of genetic erosion associated with inbreeding in heavily fragmented landscapes. Bayesian modelling, spatial autocorrelation analysis and principal coordinates analysis suggested a single large panmictic population across all areas sampled. Within the heavily fragmented landscape of an extensive urban area, band re-sightings and recoveries substantiate the considerable capacity of juvenile boobooks to disperse across areas far greater than the distance between patches. We hypothesise that the genetic homogeneity observed in this species is a consequence of long-distance dispersal capacity in addition to their ability as habitat and dietary generalists to make use of highly altered habitats.

AB  - Urban fragmentation can reduce gene flow that isolates populations, reduces genetic diversity and increases population differentiation, all of which have negative conservation implications. Alternatively, gene flow may actually be increased among urban areas consistent with an urban facilitation model. In fact, urban adapter pests are able to thrive in the urban environment and may be experiencing human-mediated transport. Here, we used social network theory with a population genetic approach to investigate the impact of urbanization on genetic connectivity in the Western black widow spider, as an urban pest model of human health concern. We collected genomewide single nucleotide polymorphism variation from mitochondrial and nuclear double-digest RAD (ddRAD) sequence data sets from 210 individuals sampled from 11 urban and 10 nonurban locales across its distribution of the Western United States. From urban and nonurban contrasts of population, phylogenetic, and network analyses, urban locales have higher within-population genetic diversity, lower between-population genetic differentiation and higher estimates of genetic connectivity. Social network analyses show that urban locales not only have more connections, but can act as hubs that drive connectivity among nonurban locales, which show signatures of historical isolation. These results are consistent with an urban facilitation model of gene flow and demonstrate the importance of sampling multiple cities and markers to identify the role that urbanization has had on larger spatial scales. As the urban landscape continues to grow, this approach will help determine what factors influence the spread and adaptation of pests, like the venomous black widow spider, in building policies for human and biodiversity health.

AB  - Periodic and spatially synchronous outbreaks of insect pests have dramatic consequences for boreal and sub-boreal forests. Within these multitrophic systems, parasitoids can be stabilizing agents by dispersing toward patches containing higher host density (the so-called birdfeeder effect). However, we know little about the dispersal abilities of parasitoids in continuous forested landscapes, limiting our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of host-parasitoid systems, and constraining our ability to predict forest resilience in the context of global changes. In this study, we investigate the spatial genetic structure and spatial variation in genetic diversity of two important species of spruce budworm larval parasitoids during outbreaks: Apanteles fumiferanae Viereck (Braconidae) and Glypta fumiferanae (Viereck) (Ichneumonidae). Using parasitoids sampled in 2014 from 26 and 29 locations across a study area of 350,000 km(2), we identified 1,012 and 992 neutral SNP loci for A. fumiferanae (N = 279 individuals) and G. fumiferanae (N = 382), respectively. Using DAPC, PCA, AMOVA, and IBD analyses, we found evidence for panmixia and high genetic connectivity for both species, matching the previously described genetic structure of the spruce budworm within the same context, suggesting similar effective dispersal during outbreaks and high parasitoid population densities between outbreaks. We also found a significant negative relationship between genetic diversity and latitude for A. fumiferanae but not for G. fumiferanae, suggesting that northern range limits may vary by species within the spruce budworm parasitoid community. These spatial dynamics should be considered when predicting future insect outbreak severities in boreal landscapes.

AB  - Farmland ponds represent habitats with a high conservation value that make a significant contribution to regional biodiversity. Understanding the influence of plant species composition and environmental variables in driving variations in animal species composition in ponds is an important issue in the fields of ecological research and conservation biology. Using variance partitioning techniques to quantify independent effects, we examined how plant species composition, local-landscape configuration and physicochemical variables interact in influencing aquatic insect and amphibian community composition. The ponds investigated in this study were located in the Site of Community Importance - Special Protected Area (Natura 2000 Network) "Monte Labbro - Alta Valle dell'Albegna" (Tuscany, central Italy). Our results showed that: (i) plant community composition (such as Carex hirta, Glicerya fluitans, Potamogeton natans, Typha latifolia) is a good predictor for amphibian but not for aquatic insect species composition; (ii) aquatic insect species composition was more strongly affected by the landscape context, whereas for amphibians the local characteristics of the ponds were determining; (iii) the physicochemical context is a poor predictor for these animal taxa; (iv) lastly, and notably, the explanatory variables explained a high proportion of the total variation in amphibian and aquatic insect species composition. Our results have important implications with respect to the creation of new ponds, which should preferentially take place close to semi-natural grasslands and other wetlands, in order to maintain greater connectivity, and away from urban areas. Moreover, larger ponds are preferable for the preservation of pond biodiversity. The management and conservation of ponds is necessary to ensure the protection of habitats, the survival of individual species and overall pond biodiversity.

AB  - Recent anthropogenic fragmentation has led to population differentiation threatening viability of many species, including species specialized on mountainous ecosystems. Bombus ephippiatus, a widespread species mostly found in mountains in the Neotropics, seems to use the highlands as island, and deforested lowland areas may represent barriers to their dispersal, leading to isolation and potentially loss of genetic diversity. Yet, lack of knowledge of its population structure does not allow adequate management and conservation. To fill this knowledge gap, we assessed the population structure and inferred dispersion of B. ephippiatus in two mountain-ranges in Guatemala (Volcanic Chain and Sierra de las Minas). This region is characterized by high topographic variation and considerable deforestation strain. We analyzed the effects of elevation and land-use on genetic differentiation of B. ephippiatus populations and inferred its demography in the region. Our results suggest that B. ephippiatus is able to disperse long distances across most landscape types, reflected by its high genetic diversity, high effective population size, considerable gene flow, low population differentiation, as well as the lack of isolation by distance. Hence, B. ephippiatus may be a resilient species for the provision of pollination services. However, we detected a subtle divergence of B. ephippiatus into two clusters, of which Sierra de las Minas has been identified as a regional hotspot of genetic and species endemism. Yet, differentiation is very recent and hence likely caused by lowland deforestation. The combined effects of current forest cover and elevation partially explain the observed subtle patterns of differentiation suggesting that the maintenance of suitable habitat is crucial to ensure population connectivity of this keystone pollinator.

AB  - Population genetic patterns can be affected by a number of factors, including life history characteristics and landscape features. Identifying general patterns of connectivity and key factors affecting these patterns is often central to effective ecological monitoring and management, particularly in areas with increasing urbanization. Examining patterns of connectivity and diversity of widespread and still abundant vertebrates, such as many cricetid rodents, can serve as a general indicator of habitat quality and connectivity. We investigated patterns of genetic diversity, differentiation, and population structure in 2 species of deer mice (Peromyscus californicus and P. fraterculus) occupying patches of native habitat separated by roadways in San Diego County, California. The 2 species are closely related and frequently co-occur at the same site. We collected samples from 5 widely distributed sites throughout the county and analyzed them using 10-12 microsatellites. We found similar levels of genetic diversity in both species, with allelic richness ranging from 4.47 to 8.81 and observed heterozygosity values from 0.60 to 0.79. In general, we found that P. californicus exhibits a pattern of isolation by distance at a finer spatial scale than does P. fraterculus. Populations of both species that were separated by major roads were not strongly genetically differentiated, with one exception: at 1 site, P. fraterculus exhibited signs of minor differentiation across a roadway. However, subsequent landscape modeling at this site was unsuccessful in detecting a correlation between specific landscape features and genetic differentiation. In general, our study shows that small rodent populations may be robust with respect to impacts of recent anthropogenic fragmentation by roadways.

AB  - Predicted increases in the human population, in a context of climatic change and limiting freshwater resources, have raised awareness of the need to preserve aquatic ecosystems, their functions, and the biodiversity they harbor. The ecological reconciliation approach proposes the long-term co-existence of biodiversity preservation and the development of human activities. We investigated the ecological and evolutionary contributions of irrigation and hydroelectric canals in the highly fragmented and regulated Durance River (Rhone basin, Southern France), to the genetic diversity patterns of two interbreeding cyprinid species, the native Parachondrostoma toxostoma, and the introduced Chondrostoma nasus species. We observed a high degree of genetic homogeneity along the length of the river. The maintenance of gene flow despite the presence of dams, and the detection of admixed populations and hybridization events in canals suggest that these canals may act as ecological corridors and hybrid zones with the potential to influence genetic resources for the native and introduced species. These anthropogenic structures vary considerably in terms of their spatial organization, size, and overall management, increasing habitat diversity in the urbanized section of river. Together with the restoration of natural habitats, canals can be considered as important structures for biodiversity dynamic in such urban conditions.

AB  - AimPopulation genomics data were used to determine the genetic diversity, genetic divergence and genetic structure of the mangrove, Rhizophora apiculata, across its distributional range and to re-assess the evolutionary processes that shaped its current distribution.
   LocationThe Indo-Malesian region section of the Indo-West Pacific region.
   MethodsNext-generation sequencing technology was used to sequence 81 nuclear loci from a pooled DNA sample of 31-44 individuals of Rhizophora apiculata from 11 populations. Five nuclear loci from six to eight individuals from 18 populations were sequenced using conventional Sanger sequencing technology to validate the results.
   ResultsGenetic diversity at the population level was low ( and were <1.0x10(-3) in most of the populations), but relatively high at the specieslevel (=2.419x10(-3) and =1.362x10(-3)). The populations of R.apiculata in the Indo-Malesian region were genetically differentiated and grouped into three clusters: east Indian Ocean (EIO), South China Sea (SCS) and Australasia (AUA). Based on the genetic distance matrices, two genetic discontinuities were observed, and they correspond to the Malay Peninsula land barrier and the Wallacea zone. The admixture observed in populations from the Malacca Strait was attributed to asymmetric gene flow through the strait, which was simulated by the isolation-with-migration (IM) model.
   Main conclusionBoth the Sunda shelf barrier and ocean currents in Wallacea contributed to the observed genetic discontinuity, which separated R. apiculata into three clusters (SCS, EIO and AUA). The cycle between extinction and recolonization in the SCS in response to Pleistocene sea level fluctuations reduced the genetic diversity within populations. The repeated opening and closing of the gene flow corridors, such as the Malacca Strait, may have blurred the genetic discontinuities to an extent and introduced an admixture into populations in boundary areas.

AB  - Aquatic species represent a vast diversity of metazoans, provide humans with the most abundant animal protein source, and are of increasing conservation concern, yet landscape genomics is dominated by research in terrestrial systems. We provide researchers with a roadmap to plan aquatic landscape genomics projects by aggregating spatial and software resources and offering recommendations from sampling to data production and analyses, while cautioning against analytical pitfalls. Given the unique properties of water, we discuss the importance of considering freshwater system structure and marine abiotic properties when assessing genetic diversity, population connectivity, and signals of natural selection. When possible, genomic datasets should be parsed into neutral, adaptive, and sex-linked datasets to generate the most accurate inferences of eco-evolutionary processes.

AB  - The combination of habitat loss, climate change, direct persecution, introduced species and other components of the global environmental crisis has resulted in a rapid loss of biodiversity, including species, population and genetic diversity. Birds, which inhabit a wide spectrum of different habitat types, are particularly sensitive to and indicative of environmental changes. The Caucasus endemic bird area, part of which covers northeastern Turkey, is one of the world's key regions harboring a unique bird community threatened with habitat loss. More than 75% of all bird species native to Turkey have been recorded in this region, in particular along the Kars-Igdir migratory corridor, stopover, wintering and breeding sites along the Aras River, whose wetlands harbor at least 264 bird species. In this study, DNA barcoding technique was used for evaluating the genetic diversity of land bird species of Aras River Bird Paradise at the confluence of Aras River and Igdir Plains key biodiversity areas. Seventy three COI sequences from 33 common species and 26 different genera were newly generated and used along with 301 sequences that were retrieved from the Barcoding of Life Database (BOLD). Using the sequences obtained in this study, we made global phylogeographic comparisons to define four categories of species, based on barcoding suitability, intraspecific divergence and taxonomy. Our findings indicate that the landbird community of northeastern Turkey has a genetical signature mostly typical of northern Palearctic bird communities while harboring some unique variations. The study also provides a good example of how DNA barcoding can build upon its primary mission of species identification and use available data to integrate genetic variation investigated at the local scale into a global framework. However, the rich bird community of the Aras River wetlands is highly threatened with the imminent construction of the Tuzluca Dam by the government.

AB  - Freshwater species often show high levels of endemism and risk of extinction owing to their limited dispersal abilities. This is exemplified by the stenotopic freshwater crab, Johora singaporensis which is one of the world's 100 most threatened species, and currently inhabits less than 0.01km(2) of five low order hill streams within the highly urbanized island city-state of Singapore. We compared populations of J. singaporensis with that of the non-threatened, widespread, abundant, and eurytopic freshwater crab, Parathelphusa maculata, and found surprisingly high congruence between their population genomic histories. Based on 2,617 and 2,470 genome-wide SNPs mined via the double-digest restriction-associated DNA sequencing method for similar to 90 individuals of J. singaporensis and P. maculata, respectively, the populations are strongly isolated (F-ST=0.146-0.371), have low genetic diversity for both species (also for COI), and show signatures of recent genetic bottlenecks. The most genetically isolated populations for both species are separated from other populations by one of the oldest roads in Singapore. These results suggest that anthropogenic developments may have impacted stream-dependent species in a uniform manner, regardless of ubiquity, habitat preference, or dispersal modes of the species. While signs of inbreeding were not detected for the critically endangered species, the genetic distinctiveness and low diversity of the populations call for genetic rescue and connecting corridors between the remaining fragments of the natural habitat.

AB  - Urban green space is an important refuge of biodiversity in urban areas. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the relationship between the landscape pattern of green spaces and biodiversity to mitigate the negative effects of urbanization. In this study, we collected insects from 45 green patches in Beijing during July 2012 using suction sampling. The green patches were dominated by managed lawns, mixed with scattered trees and shrubs. We examined the effects of landscape pattern on insect species density using hierarchical partitioning analysis and partial least squares regression. The results of the hierarchical partitioning analysis indicated that five explanatory variables, i.e., patch area (with 19.9% independent effects), connectivity (13.9%), distance to nearest patch (13.8%), diversity for patch types (11.0%), and patch shape (8.3%), significantly contributed to insect species density. With the partial least squares regression model, we found species density was negatively related to patch area, shape, connectivity, diversity for patch types and proportion of impervious surface at the significance level of p < 0.05 and positively related to proportion of vegetated land. Regression tree analysis further showed that the highest species density was found in green patches with an area < 500 m(2). Our results indicated that improvement in habitat quality, such as patch area and connectivity that are typically thought to be important for conservation, did not actually increase species density. However, increasing compactness (low-edge) of patch shape and landscape composition did have the expected effect. Therefore, it is recommended that the composition of the surrounding landscape should be considered simultaneously with planned improvements in local habitat quality.

AB  - Background Connectivity among jaguar (Panthera onca) populations will ensure natural gene flow and the long-term survival of the species throughout its range. Jaguar conservation efforts have focused primarily on connecting suitable habitat in a broad-scale. Accelerated habitat reduction, human-wildlife conflict, limited funding, and the complexity of jaguar behaviour have proven challenging to maintain connectivity between populations effectively. Here, we used non-invasive genetic sampling and individual-based conservation genetic analyses to assess genetic diversity and levels of genetic connectivity between individuals in the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary and the Maya Forest Corridor. We used expert knowledge and scientific literature to develop models of landscape permeability based on circuit theory with fine-scale landscape features as ecosystem types, distance to human settlements and roads to predict the most probable jaguar movement across central Belize. Results We used 12 highly polymorphic microsatellite loci to identify 50 individual jaguars. We detected high levels of genetic diversity across loci (H-E = 0.61, H-O = 0.55, and N-A = 9.33). Using Bayesian clustering and multivariate models to assess gene flow and genetic structure, we identified one single group of jaguars (K = 1). We identified critical areas for jaguar movement that fall outside the boundaries of current protected areas in central Belize. We detected two main areas of high landscape permeability in a stretch of approximately 18 km between Sittee River Forest Reserve and Manatee Forest Reserve that may increase functional connectivity and facilitate jaguar dispersal from and to Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary. Our analysis provides important insights on fine-scale genetic and landscape connectivity of jaguars in central Belize, an area of conservation concern. Conclusions The results of our study demonstrate high levels of relatively recent gene flow for jaguars between two study sites in central Belize. Our landscape analysis detected corridors of expected jaguar movement between the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary and the Maya Forest Corridor. We highlight the importance of maintaining already established corridors and consolidating new areas that further promote jaguar movement across suitable habitat beyond the boundaries of currently protected areas. Continued conservation efforts within identified corridors will further maintain and increase genetic connectivity in central Belize.

AB  - Understanding how habitat fragmentation affects population processes (e.g. dispersal) at different spatial scales is of critical importance to conservation. We assessed the effects of habitat fragmentation on dispersal and regional and fine-scale population structure in a currently widespread and common cooperatively breeding bird species found across south-eastern Australia, the superb fairy-wren Malurus cyaneus. Despite its relative abundance and classification as an urban tolerant species, the superb fairy-wren has declined disproportionately from low tree-cover agricultural landscapes across the Box-Ironbark region of north-central Victoria, Australia. Loss of genetic connectivity and disruption to its complex social system may be associated with the decline of this species from apparently suitable habitat in landscapes with low levels of tree cover. To assess whether reduced structural connectivity has had negative consequences for genetic connectivity in the superb fairy-wren, we used a landscape-scale approach to compare patterns of genetic diversity and gene flow at large (landscape/regional) and fine (site-level) spatial scales. In addition, using genetic distances, for each sex, we tested landscape models of decreased dispersal through treeless areas (isolation-by-resistance) while controlling for the effect of isolation-by-distance. Landscape models indicated that larger-scale gene flow across the Box-Ironbark region was constrained by distance rather than by lack of structural connectivity. Nonetheless, a pattern of isolation-by-resistance for males (the less-dispersive sex) and lower genetic diversity and higher genetic similarity within sites in low-cover fragmented landscapes indicated disruption to fine-scale gene flow mechanisms and/or mating systems. Although loss of structural connectivity did not appear to impede gene flow at larger spatial scales, fragmentation appeared to affect fine-scale population processes (e.g. local gene flow mechanisms and/or mating systems) adversely and may contribute to the decline of superb fairy-wrens in fragmented landscapes in the Box-Ironbark region.

AB  - Introductions of non-native lineages increase opportunities for hybridization. Non-native lineages of the common wall lizard, Podarcis rnuralis, are frequently introduced in cities where they hybridize with native populations. We aimed at unravelling the invasion history and admixture of native and non-native wall lizards in four German cities using citywide, comprehensive sampling. We barcoded and genotyped 826 lizards and tested if gene flow in populations composed of admixed native and introduced lineages is facilitated by similar environmental factors to those in native populations by comparing fine-scale landscape genetic patterns. In cities with non-native lineages, lizards commonly occurred in numerous clusters of hybrid swarms, which showed variable lineage composition, consisting of up to four distinct evolutionary lineages. Hybrid swarms held vast genetic diversity and showed recent admixture with other hybrid swarms. Landscape genetic analyses showed differential effects of cityscape structures across cities, but identified water bodies as strong barriers to gene flow in both native and admixed populations. By contrast, railway tracks facilitated gene flow of admixed populations only. Our study shows that cities represent unique settings for hybridization, caused by multiple introductions of non-native taxa. Cityscape structure and invasion histories of cities will determine future evolutionary pathways at these novel hybrid zones.

AB  - Species distributions and their patterns in geographical space have been studied for several decades and explained by theories such as Janzen's, with respect to the nature of dispersal barriers in the Tropics, and Rapoport's, with respect to range size. However, the roles of specific environmental and geographical factors (e.g. ecological niche breadth, geographical barriers, etc.) in shaping species ranges and distributional patterns remain largely unexplored. The present study analyzed predictions from these two theories via analysis of virtual species with respect to biogeographical patterns: virtual species were created across South America, covering all major environments on the continent, and were used to compare effects of niche breadth, environmental availability, connectivity, seasonality, and the presence of known biogeographical barriers (rivers) in shaping species distributions and biodiversity patterns. Geographical ranges varied from narrow to broad, depending on the location of the seed point when comparing species produced with the same niche breadth. Analysis without consideration of seasonality and barriers produced species with broader distributions in the Tropics and narrower distributions in montane and temperate regions of the continent. When seasonality was included, however, broader ranges were concentrated in temperate regions, thus supporting Janzen's idea. Rapoport's rule of broader geographical ranges at higher latitudes was supported only when seasonality and physical barriers were included but not in species with very narrow or very broad niches, suggesting that this rule results from interactions among niche breadth, dispersal capabilities, and dispersal barriers.

AB  - The spread of invasive plants in urban forests is of great concern to land managers and ecologists. Here, we analyse the distribution pattern and potential occurrence of a problematic invasive plant, Ageratina altissima, on Mt. Umyeon, in the Seoul metropolitan area of South Korea, using multiple species distribution modelling with geographic information system layers and a time series of Landsat 8 satellite imagery data. Also, we identify this species' potential dispersal corridors using a network-based landscape lattice approach. All five species distribution models performed well with a range of test area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.843-0.899 with an average of 0.876. Distance from trails had the greatest effect on its occurrence probability, and generally exerted a negative influence within ca. 20m of trails, indicating that urban forest trails facilitate the spread of invasive plants. Of the remote sensing-based predictors used, 7 August 2016 tasselled cap brightness index was an important variable having a negative effect on the presence of A. altissima. Elevation generally had a positive effect on its presence, although it was less important than tasselled cap brightness index. We explicitly detected the distribution pattern of high invasion risk corridors, mostly located on or around trails, which follow the central ridgeline of the study area. The results and approaches employed here can be useful for understanding, monitoring, and predicting invasive plant distribution and spread for the management of urban natural resources and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Urban green spaces are potentially important to biodiversity conservation because they could provide patches of high quality habitat or connectivity to nearby habitat. Presence-only species distribution models (SDMs) represent a potential tool for assessing the biodiversity value of urban green space; however, there is limited research to validate SDM results with field surveys to see if the predictions accurately represent observed species richness. We generated a range of SDMs using multiple suitability thresholds for 23 species of amphibians that occur in southwest, Ohio, USA. The distributions were overlaid to enumerate species richness. We surveyed 20 sites for amphibian species to evaluate model predictions. Our models over-predicted species richness relative to survey data. For example, we observed a mean pairwise difference of 14 species between models of species richness and observed values. Our results suggest either SDMs built with landscape variables we selected did not represent accurately amphibian richness, or the amphibian surveys did not detect all species present. Analyzing sites that had more than three sampling events suggests the explanation of inadequate sampling effort is only partially correct. Differences such as that between predicted and observed values of species richness is a challenge for land managers and conservation biologists that need a tool for modeling biodiversity. Species distribution models did project relative species richness well in urban and non-urban green space, which suggests this technique offers a spatially explicit way to identify more species rich areas and may help managers and conservation biologists manage systems with greater efficiency.

   Urbanization alters local environmental conditions and the ability of species to disperse between remnant habitat patches within the urban matrix. Nonetheless, despite the ongoing growth of urban areas worldwide, few studies have investigated the relative importance of dispersal and local environmental conditions for influencing species composition within urban and suburban landscapes. Here, we explore this question using spatial patterns of plant species composition.
   LocationTime periodThe Research Triangle area, which includes the cities of Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill and Cary, in central North Carolina, USA.

   Major taxa studiedMethodsVascular plants.
   We sampled riparian forest plant communities along an urban-to-rural gradient and used redundancy analysis to identify predictors of species composition patterns for groups of species categorized by nativity and seed dispersal mode. We first compared the ability of different models of habitat connectivity (least-cost paths that avoided urban land cover versus Euclidean and along-stream distance) to explain spatial patterns of species composition. We then partitioned the variation in species composition explained by habitat connectivity models, local environmental conditions and measures of urbanization in the surrounding landscape.
   ResultsMain conclusionsWe found that several groups of native species were best explained by least-cost path models that avoided urban development, suggesting that urbanization impedes dispersal within this landscape, particularly for short-dispersed species. Environmental variables related to urbanization (e.g., temperature, stream incision) were important predictors of species composition for many species groups, but measures of urbanization in the surrounding landscape were more important for exotic than for native species.
   Our results demonstrate that urbanization influences plant species composition via its effects on both habitat connectivity and environmental conditions. However, the strength of these effects varies somewhat predictably across seed dispersal modes and between native and exotic species. These results highlight the importance of landscape-scale planning for urban conservation.

AB  - We studied population size, genetic diversity and differentiation of common frog (Rana temporaria) populations at urban golf courses and reference natural ponds in the greater Helsinki region, southern Finland. A total of 248 tadpoles from 12 locations (six golf courses, six reference sites) were genotyped with 13 polymorphic microsatellite markers. The most urban populations, situated in northern Helsinki, were the largest breeding sites having > 120 (golf courses) and > 200 (reference sites) spawn clumps at the time of sampling. On average, there was no difference in the number of spawns between the anthropogenic ponds at golf courses and the natural water bodies. Genetic variation within populations was substantial (H (O) = 0.68) while genetic differentiation between populations was low (F (ST) = 0.016; average distance = 17.6 km). The golf course populations did not differ from natural populations in terms of genetic variability or differentiation. Hence, our results suggest that golf courses contribute positively to urban amphibian populations by providing suitable water bodies for reproduction and green corridors for dispersal, thus preventing isolation and loss of genetic variability within populations.

AB  - Delineating population boundaries in anthropogenic landscape is of critical importance for domains of biology that are concerned with the ecology, evolution and conservation of species. This remains particularly difficult for species where there is no obvious demarcation of geographical populations and dispersal patterns are poorly known. This is often the case in amphibian species that reproduce in aquatic habitats but live otherwise in terrestrial habitats. Sampling of such species usually occurs in the aquatic habitat (i.e., breeding sites) but these may represent neither genetically nor demographically distinct populations. Here, we analyzed the genetic structure of a stream-breeding species, the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) along a rural-to-urban land use gradient. We used genetic data and Bayesian clustering approaches, which rely on genetic information without assuming predefined populations, to delineate distinctive genetic units along this gradient, and compare genetic diversity between rural and urban areas. The different analytical approaches used partitioned our dataset in slightly different but highly congruent clusters, that included localities which were up to 19 km apart from each other. Genetic breaks occurred at unexpected places while several landscape features reported to act as barriers on gene flow for amphibians did not lead to genetic breaks. Our results emphasize the difficulty to delineate management units in open systems, especially for long-lived species, for which the timespan between the establishment of a barrier and its translation into clear genetic breaks will take longer than in short-lived species.

AB  - We present results from a study of genetic variation in Utah's cougar population. Estimates were based on data for 50 animals at nine microsatellite loci with five individuals sampled for each of ten management units throughout Utah. Levels of variation were moderate (average genetic diversity across populations was estimated to be 0.4687 for all 50 individuals), and comparable with other large mammals. But this level of variation for the microsatellite loci translated into an inbreeding effective population size of only 571 animals, much lower than the current estimates of census sizes of around 2000-3000. A lack of differentiation among the sampled populations across Utah (average N(e)m = 6.2) indicates that gene flow occurs over a large area. Since cougars are capable of movement beyond the Utah state borders (and certainly across management units), a better understanding of migration rates and patterns of dispersal will be achieved by sampling a much larger geographic region incorporating much of the western USA. Successful management and conservation of this species will then require a far more integrated approach, involving agencies across a number of states, as opposed to current management practices involving individual units within states.

AB  - In recent decades Madagascar has experienced significant habitat loss and modification, with minimal understanding of how human land use practices have impacted the evolution of its flora and fauna. In light of ongoing and intensifying anthropogenic pressures, we seek new insight into mechanisms driving genetic variability on this island, using a Critically Endangered lemur species, the black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata), as a test case. Here, we examine the relative influence of natural and anthropogenic landscape features that we predict will impose barriers to dispersal and promote genetic structuring across the species range. Using circuit theory, we model functional connectivity among 18 sampling localities using population-based genetic distance (FST). We optimized resistance surfaces using genetic algorithms and assessed their performance using maximum-likelihood population-effects mixed models. The best supported resistance model was a composite surface that included two anthropogenic features, habitat cover and distance to villages, suggesting that rapid land cover modification by humans has driven change in the genetic structure of wild lemurs. Primary conservation priority should be placed on mitigating further forest loss and connecting regions identified as having low dispersal potential to prevent further loss of genetic diversity and promote the survival of other moist forest specialists.

AB  - Australian arboreal mammals are experiencing significant population declines, particularly due to land clearing and resulting habitat fragmentation. The squirrel glider, Petaurus norfolcensis, is a threatened species in New South Wales, with a stronghold population in the Lake Macquarie Local Government Area (LGA) where fragmentation due to urbanization is an ongoing problem for the species conservation. Here we report on the use of squirrel glider mitochondrial (385 bp cytochrome b gene, 70 individuals) and nuclear DNA (6,834 SNPs, 87 individuals) markers to assess their population genetic structure and connectivity across 14 locations sampled in the Lake Macquarie LGA. The mitochondrial DNA sequences detected evidence of a historical genetic bottleneck, while the genome-wide SNPs detected significant population structure in the Lake Macquarie squirrel glider populations at scales as fine as one kilometer. There was no evidence of inbreeding within patches, however there were clear effects of habitat fragmentation and biogeographical barriers on gene flow. A least cost path analysis identified thin linear corridors that have high priority for conservation. These areas should be protected to avoid further isolation of squirrel glider populations and the loss of genetic diversity through genetic drift.

AB  - Background: Riparian vegetation is strongly influenced by the surrounding land use. While it is known that urbanization processes can affect plant species composition and the ecological condition of the riparian zone, the specific responses require a fuller understanding.
   Hypothesis: The quality of riparian zones is inversely related to the degree of urbanization of adjacent areas, and that land uses that provide forest cover ensure a less degraded condition and greater diversity of species.
   Study site and year of study: Sabinal River basin, Chiapas, Mexico, 2015.
   Methods: Measures of the Riparian Quality Index (RQI) and plant species composition were compared among three different land use conditions (secondary forest, grasslands and crops, and human settlements).
   Results: Riparian zones adjacent to secondary forest showed higher RQI than those next to grasslands and crops and human settlements. Riparian zones within secondary forest also had a higher woody species richness and better substrate condition, whereas reaches adjacent to human settlements appeared paved and eroded, exhibiting soil compaction. Species richness and diversity were positively correlated to the RQI and were greater in riparian zones adjacent to secondary forest than in those next to human settlements.
   Conclusions: While grazing and cultivation affect the riparian zone, expansion of urban areas has a greater impact by reducing woody species richness and diversity, altering species composition and favoring soil compaction and bank erosion, which results in reduced riparian quality.

AB  - Gene flow in birds can be affected by urbanization depending on natural history traits and adaptability to habitat change. Contrasting results can be expected when comparing species with opposite resilience to urbanization. In this study, we assessed genetic diversity and structure for two bird species, the urban avoider white-eared ground-sparrow, Melozone leucotis, and the urban dweller house wren Troglodytes aedon. We used seven microsatellite loci and sampled five locations with differing levels of urbanization in Costa Rica. We found considerably higher genetic structure in white-eared ground-sparrows than in house wrens. Circuit theory analyses proved a higher isolation from urban resistance for the white-eared ground-sparrow than for house wrens. These results support that urbanization is a significant barrier for gene flow in urban avoiders, in contrast to urban dweller species that showed little to no impact. Differences could be attributed to a higher plasticity in habitat and nesting site preferences in the house wren, and significant dispersal limitation for the white-eared ground-sparrow. These results emphasize the need for conservation strategies towards white-eared ground-sparrows and other urban avoider species whose habitat and connectivity have been reduced by the recent urban expansion.

AB  - The rapid expansion of urban land across the globe presents new and numerous opportunities for invasive species to spread and flourish. Ecologists historically rejected urban ecosystems as important environments for ecology and evolution research but are beginning to recognize the importance of these systems in shaping the biology of invasion. Urbanization can aid the introduction, establishment, and spread of invaders, and these processes have substantial consequences on native species and ecosystems. Therefore, it is valuable to understand how urban areas influence populations at all stages in the invasion process. Population genetic tools are essential to explore the driving forces of invasive species dispersal, connectivity, and adaptation within cities. In this review, we synthesize current research about the influence of urban landscapes on invasion genetics dynamics. We conclude that urban areas are not only points of entry for many invasive species, they also facilitate population establishment, are pools for genetic diversity, and provide corridors for further spread both within and out of cities. We recommend the continued use of genetic studies to inform invasive species management and to understand the underlying ecological and evolutionary processes governing successful invasion.

AB  - One of the key concerns in conservation is to document and predict the effects of habitat loss on species richness. To do this, the species-area relationship (SAR) is frequently used. That relationship assumes random patterns of habitat loss and species distributions. In nature, however, species distribution patterns are usually nonrandom, influenced by biotic and abiotic factors. Likewise, socioeconomic and environmental factors influence habitat loss and are not randomly distributed across landscapes. We used a recently developed SAR model that accounts for nonrandomness to predict rates of bird species loss in fragmented forests of the Panama Canal region, an area that was historically covered in forest but now has 53% forest cover. Predicted species loss was higher than that predicted by the standard SAR. Furthermore, a species loss threshold was evident when remaining forest cover declined by 25%. This level of forest cover corresponds to 40% of the historical forest cover, and our model predicts rapid species loss past that threshold. This study illustrates the importance of considering patterns of species distributions and realistic habitat loss scenarios to develop better estimates of losses in species richness. Forecasts of tropical biodiversity loss generated from simple species-area relationships may underestimate actual losses because nonrandom patterns of species distributions and habitat loss are probably not unique to the Panama Canal region.

   Methods: Coleoptera and Araneae communities were collected in a comparative sampling framework. Seven sky-islands were sampled within two high-elevation habitats separated by altitude. Samples were individually sequenced for a region of the mtDNA COI gene to delimit Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and haplotypes within them. Richness was estimated at the community level, as well as genetic diversity within and among mountains and habitats. The West-East structure was tested with a null model and an analysis of variance with permutations.
   Results: Few OTUs were shared between the Abies forests and alpine grasslands. High beta diversity was found across mountains. Beta diversity between the West and East grouping is higher than expected by chance.
   Main conclusions: Our results indicate that colonization from other mountains followed by allopatric divergence dominates as a source of OTU formation, and that despite some probable connectivity during glacial periods existed, ancient communities and genetic structures persist.

AB  - The impact of global change on biodiversity is commonly assessed in terms of changes in species distributions, community richness and community composition. Whether and how much associations between species are also changing is much less documented. In this study, we quantify changes in large-scale patterns of species associations in bird communities in relation to changes in species composition. We use network approaches to build three community-aggregated indices reflecting complementary aspects of species association networks. We characterise the spatio-temporal dynamics of these indices using a large-scale and high-resolution dataset of bird co-abundances of 109 species monitored for 17 years (2001-2017) from 1969 sites across France. We finally test whether spatial and temporal changes in species association networks are related to species homogenisation estimated as the spatio-temporal dynamics of species turnover (beta-diversity) and community generalism (community generalisation index). The consistency of these relationships is tested across three main habitats, namely woodland, grassland and human settlements. We document a directional change in association-based indices in response to modifications in species turnover and community generalism in space and time. Weaker associations and sparser networks were related to lower spatial species turnover and higher community generalism, suggesting an overlooked aspect of biotic homogenisation affecting species associations and may also have an impact on species interactions. We report that this overall pattern is not constant across habitats, with opposite relationships between biotic homogenisation and change in species association networks in urban versus forest communities suggesting distinct homogenisation processes. Although species associations contain only partial signatures of species interactions, our study highlights that biotic homogenisation translates to finer changes in community structure by affecting the number, strength and type of species associations.

AB  - Populations in fragmented landscapes experience reduced gene flow, lose genetic diversity over time and ultimately face greater extinction risk. Improving connectivity in fragmented landscapes is now a major focus of conservation biology. Designing effective wildlife corridors for this purpose, however, requires an accurate understanding of how landscapes shape gene flow. The preponderance of landscape resistance models generated to date, however, is subjectively parameterized based on expert opinion or proxy measures of gene flow. While the relatively few studies that use genetic data are more rigorous, frameworks they employ frequently yield models only weakly related to the observed patterns of genetic isolation. Here, we describe a new framework that uses expert opinion as a starting point. By systematically varying each model parameter, we sought to either validate the assumptions of expert opinion, or identify a peak of support for a new model more highly related to genetic isolation. This approach also accounts for interactions between variables, allows for nonlinear responses and excludes variables that reduce model performance. We demonstrate its utility on a population of mountain goats inhabiting a fragmented landscape in the Cascade Range, Washington.

AB  - MacArthur and Wilson's Theory of Island Biogeography (TIB) is among the most well-known process-based explanations for the distribution of species richness. It helps understand the species-area relationship, a fundamental pattern in ecology and an essential tool for conservation. The classic TIB does not, however, account for the complex structure of ecological systems. We extend the TIB to take into account trophic interactions and derive a species-specific model for occurrence probability. We find that the properties of the regional food web influence the species-area relationship, and that, in return, immigration and extinction dynamics affect local food web properties. We compare the accuracy of the classic TIB to our trophic TIB to predict community composition of real food webs and find strong support for our trophic extension of the TIB. Our approach provides a parsimonious explanation to species distributions and open new perspectives to integrate the complexity of ecological interactions into simple species distribution models.

AB  - The vegetation of riparian habitats is often distinct from that Of the Surrounding landscape, thus representing unique habitat for a variety of biota. Although highly mobile, birds often exhibit distinct species assemblages associated with habitat. Therefore, degradation or removal of riparian habitat, particularly in arid environments, may threaten bird diversity. Along the Vaal River, South Africa, milling arid agriculture have reduced natural riparian habitat to ca. 9% of its former extent in the Northern Cape Province. We Surveyed bird assemblages within intact riparian, savanna and bush-thickened habitats along the Vaal River to ascertain their importance to bird diversity. Avian abundance arid species richness did not differ between the three habitats. Species composition of riparian bird assemblages was significantly different to that of savanna and bush-thickened habitats, however, which were not significantly different from each other,, and more species were characteristic of riparian habitat (17 species) than bush-thickened (seven species) or savanna (one species) habitats. Of three species reaching the south-western limit of their African distribution, all Occurred in riparian habitat. Thus, despite its fragmented nature, the riparian vegetation on the Vaal Still Supports an important component of avian diversity, and a landscape-level approach is required to manage this relatively rich, arid-land, river.

AB  - Nature forms interdependent networks in a landscape, which is key to the survival of species and the maintenance of genetic diversity. Nature provides crucial socio-economic benefits to people, but they are typically undervalued in political decisions. This has led to the concept of Green Infrastructure (GI), which defines an interlinked network of (semi-)natural areas with high ecological values for wildlife and people, to be conserved and managed in priority to preserve biodiversity and ecosystem services. This relatively new concept has been used in different contexts, but with widely diverging interpretations. There is no apparent consensus in the scientific literature on the methodology to map and implement GI. This paper serves as an informed primer for researchers that are new to GI mapping understand the key principles and terminology for the needs of their own case-study, and as a framework for more advance researchers willing to contribute to the formalization of the concept. Through a literature review of articles on creating GI networks, we summarized and evaluated commonly used methods to identify and map GI. We provided key insights for the assessment of diversity, ecosystem services and landscape connectivity, the three 'pillars' on which GI identification is based according to its definition. Based on this literature review, we propose 5 theoretical levels toward a more complex, reliable and integrative approach to identify GI networks. We then discuss the applications and limits of such method and point out future challenges for GI identification and implementation.

AB  - The interplay between biotic and abiotic environments is increasingly recognized as a major determinant of spatial genetic patterns. Among spatial genetic studies, saxicolous or rock-dwelling species remain underrepresented in spite of their strict dependence on landscape structure. Here we investigated patterns and processes operating at different spatial (fine and regional scales) and time scales (using mitochondrial and microsatellite markers) in the rock hyrax (Procavia capensis (Pallas, 1766)). Our focus was on the western seaboard of South Africa and included two recognized biodiversity hotspots (Cape Floristic Region and Succulent Karoo). At fine spatial scale, significant genetic structure was present between four rocky outcrops in an isolated population, likely driven by the social system of this species. At a broader spatial scale, ecological dependence on rocky habitat and population-level processes, in conjunction with landscape structure, appeared to be the main drivers of genetic diversity and structure. Large areas devoid of suitable rocky habitat (e.g., the Knersvlakte, Sandveld, and Cape Flats, South Africa) represent barriers to gene flow in the species, although genetic clusters closely follow climatic, geological, and phytogeographic regions, possibly indicating ecological specialization or adaptation as contributing factors enforcing isolation. Taken together, our study highlights the need to consider both intrinsic and extrinsic factors when investigating spatial genetic structures within species.

AB  - Complex structural connectivity patterns can influence the distribution of animals in coastal landscapes, particularly those with relatively large home ranges, such as birds. To understand the nuanced nature of coastal forest avifauna, where there may be considerable overlap in assemblages of adjacent forest types, the concerted influence of regional landscape context and vegetative structural connectivity at multiple spatial scales warrants investigation.
   This study determined whether species compositions of coastal forest bird assemblages differ with regional landscape context or with forest type, and if this is influenced by structural connectivity patterns measured at multiple spatial scales.
   Three replicate bird surveys were conducted in four coastal forest types at ten survey locations across two regional landscape contexts in northeast Australia. Structural connectivity patterns of 11 vegetation types were quantified at 3, 6, and 12 km spatial scales surrounding each survey location, and differences in bird species composition were evaluated using multivariate ordination analysis.
   Bird assemblages differed between regional landscape contexts and most coastal forest types, although Melaleuca woodland bird assemblages were similar to those of eucalypt woodlands and rainforests. Structural connectivity was primarily correlated with differences in bird species composition between regional landscape contexts, and correlation depended on vegetation type and spatial scale.
   Spatial scale, landscape context, and structural connectivity have a combined influence on bird species composition. This suggests that effective management of coastal landscapes requires a holistic strategy that considers the size, shape, and configuration of all vegetative components at multiple spatial scales.

AB  - 1. Species distribution models (SDMs) are broadly used in ecological and evolutionary studies. Almost all SDM methods require extensive data preparation in a geographic information system (GIS) prior to model building. Often, this step is cumbersome and, if not properly done, can lead to poorly parameterized models or in some cases, if too difficult, prevents the realization of SDMs. Further, for many studies, the creation of SDMs is not the final result and the post-modelling processing can be equally arduous as other steps.
   2. SDMtoolbox is designed to facilitate many complicated pre- and post-processing steps commonly required for species distribution modelling and other geospatial analyses. SDMtoolbox consists of 59 Python script-based GIS tools developed and compiled into a single interface.
   3. A large set of the tools were created to complement SDMs generated in Maxent or to improve the predictive performance of SDMs created in Maxent. However, SDMtoolbox is not limited to analyses of Maxent models, and many tools are also available for additional analyses or general geospatial processing: for example, assessing landscape connectivity of haplotype networks (using least-cost corridors or least-cost paths); correcting SDM over-prediction; quantifying distributional changes between current and future SDMs; or for calculating several biodiversity metrics, such as corrected weighted endemism.
   4. SDMtoolbox is a free comprehensive python-based toolbox for macroecology, landscape genetic and evolutionary studies to be used in ArcGIS 10.1 (or higher) with the Spatial Analyst extension. The toolkit simplifies many GIS analyses required for species distribution modelling and other analyses, alleviating the need for repetitive and time-consuming climate data pre-processing and post-SDM analyses.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation and habitat loss diminish population connectivity, reducing genetic diversity and increasing extinction risk over time. Improving connectivity is widely recommended to preserve the long-term viability of populations, but this requires accurate knowledge of how landscapes influence connectivity. Detectability of landscape effects on gene flow is highly dependent on landscape context, and drawing conclusions from single landscape studies may lead to ineffective management strategies. We present a novel approach to elucidate regional variation in the relative importance of landscape variable effects on gene flow. We demonstrate this approach by evaluating gene flow between isolated, genetically impoverished mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) populations in Washington and much larger, genetically robust populations in southern British Columbia. We used geneland to identify steep genetic gradients and then employed individual-based landscape genetics in a causal modeling framework to independently evaluate landscape variables that may be generating each of these genetic gradients. Our results support previous findings that freeways, highways, water, agriculture and urban landcover limit gene flow in this species. Additionally, we found that a previously unsupported landscape variable, distance to escape terrain, also limits gene flow in some contexts. By integrating geneland and individual-based methods we effectively identified regional limiting factors that have landscape-level implications for population viability.

AB  - Edges between forest and non-forest habitats often have significant effects on forest microclimate and resource availability, with corresponding effects on species composition and abundance. Exotic species are often increased in abundance near forest edges. This increase in abundance could be either because of the increase in resource availability near edges, or because of increased dispersal into forest edges. We measured species composition and a set of geospatial variables on transects at 66 edges in the North Carolina Piedmont in an attempt to distinguish between these two factors. Mantel tests show that species composition is significantly different in forest edges than in the forest interior, but that this effect only penetrates about 5 m into the forest. Indicator species analysis finds several species that are indicative of edge communities, including trumpet vine (Campsis radicans), two drought-tolerant oak species (Quercus stellata and Q. falcata), a serviceberry (Amelanchier arboreum), and a common exotic species, tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima). Poisson regression techniques showed that in both the seedling and tree strata of the forest, exotic species increased in abundance on flat sites with a high potential seed source. Mapping predicted exotic species abundance onto the landscape. We find that large-scale variation in exotic species abundance is due mostly to variation in potential seed sources, while small-scale variation relates more to edaphic factors. Our results stress that both dispersal and environmental filters are important for determining exotic species abundance, but potentially the filters operate at different spatial scales.

AB  - AimWuling Mountains range from the northeast to southwest in Central China, a region with high habitat complexity and diversity that supports substantial plant species diversity. Connecting the northern subtropics to the mid-subtropics, Wuling Mountains also link the floras of Eastern and South-Western China. Despite a long-standing interest in how important role Wuling Mountains play in species exchange, patterns of plant species diversity in Wuling and their underlying drivers are still not well characterized. Here, the spatial distribution of woody plant species in this region is described and the role the Wuling Mountains play in structuring biodiversity in surrounding areas is explored. LocationWuling Mountains and adjacent regions, China. MethodsDetailed distribution data for woody plant species in China were collected and mapped onto a raster grid of the Wuling Mountains and adjacent regions (a total of 820,000 km(2)) to analyze spatial patterns in species diversity, including alpha-diversity (species richness) and beta-diversity (beta(sor)). Unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages (UPGMA) clustering was used to divide the study region based on species composition. Canonical redundancy analysis was used to illustrate spatial patterns and species-environment relationships. ResultsMountainous areas in the study region have high species richness as compared to other areas. Species exchanges occurred at a greater rate latitudinally vs. longitudinally, especially in Wuling Mountains. This suggests that Wuling Mountains may be an important ecological corridor for woody species, linking Northern and Southern Chinese floras. The study region was divided into six bioregions based on species composition: the Wuling Mountains Region, Nanling-Xuefengshan Mountains Region, Qinling-Dabashan Mountains Region, Sichuan Basin Region, Yangtze Plain Region and Yungui Plateau Region. Main ConclusionsThe Wuling Mountains Region acts as an ecological corridor for woody species, linking Northern and Southern China, and fostering biodiversity exchange and conservation in Central China.

AB  - Information to guide decision making is especially urgent in human dominated landscapes in the tropics, where urban and agricultural frontiers are still expanding in an unplanned manner. Nevertheless, most studies that have investigated the influence of landscape structure on species distribution have not considered the heterogeneity of altered habitats of the matrix, which is usually high in human dominated landscapes. Using the distribution of small mammals in forest remnants and in the four main altered habitats in an Atlantic forest landscape, we investigated 1) how explanatory power of models describing species distribution in forest remnants varies between landscape structure variables that do or do not incorporate matrix quality and 2) the importance of spatial scale for analyzing the influence of landscape structure. We used standardized sampling in remnants and altered habitats to generate two indices of habitat quality, corresponding to the abundance and to the occurrence of small mammals. For each remnant, we calculated habitat quantity and connectivity in different spatial scales, considering or not the quality of surrounding habitats. The incorporation of matrix quality increased model explanatory power across all spatial scales for half the species that occurred in the matrix, but only when taking into account the distance between habitat patches (connectivity). These connectivity models were also less affected by spatial scale than habitat quantity models. The few consistent responses to the variation in spatial scales indicate that despite their small size, small mammals perceive landscape features at large spatial scales. Matrix quality index corresponding to species occurrence presented a better or similar performance compared to that of species abundance. Results indicate the importance of the matrix for the dynamics of fragmented landscapes and suggest that relatively simple indices can improve our understanding of species distribution, and could be applied in modeling, monitoring and managing complex tropical landscapes.

AB  - Currently little is known about intra-African bird migrants. Migratory connectivity between populations may be affected by past climatic fluctuations as well as contemporary threats that affect habitat connectivity resulting in genetic differentiation. Here, integrated molecular and morphological data was used to examine genetic diversity, elucidate patterns of differentiation and assess evolutionary history of the African Pygmy Kingfisher (Ispidina picta). Three subspecies have been described namely: I. p. picta, I. p. ferrugina and I. p. natalensis. Here, molecular analysis was performed for two subspecies; I. p. natalensis (South Africa) and I. p. picta (Uganda, Ghana and Nigeria) using mitochondrial and nuclear genes. Our results provided evidence of two genetic lineages corresponding to subspecies designation: I. p. natalensis, and I. p. picta that diverged 1.74 Mya ago in the Pleistocene. Lack of differentiation was observed within the two subspecies indicating that connectivity between the populations has been maintained. Morphometric variation identified differences between the subspecies and further identified sexual dimorphism within I. p. natalensis. This study provides for the first time a genetic and morphometric appraisal of African Pygmy Kingfishers. We recommend that this or similar approaches be applied to other widespread African bird species that are often overlooked in a global conservation context.

AB  - An important limitation of studies on the ecological value of urban habitats is the question of habitat connectivity. While connectivity allows spread and genetic exchange of species, isolation can lead to the extinction of populations through inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity. However, while practitioners already start improving urban habitat patches by means of restoration, issues of connectivity have not been taken in account although being crucial for a self-sustaining habitat network. In our study, we evaluate the connectivity of public urban grasslands such as lawns, grasslands in residential areas, playgrounds or parks in the city of Munster, Germany. Employing a graph theory approach, which uses a map (graph) of habitat patches to calculate functional connectivity measures using patch area size and patch connectivity, we studied four groups of different plant dispersal distances (2 m, 20 m, 44 m and 100 m). This approach can be recommended for planning issues due to the output of different indicator values and comparably low data demands. Our results show for the first time, that connectivity of urban grasslands is extremely low for species of short-distance dispersal but slightly increases for long-distance dispersal. Except two larger conglomerations of well-connected patches, urban grasslands were found to be mostly sparsely connected. Thus, future research should focus on options to improve connectivity and to prioritize patches for ecological improvement. The graph theory approach turned out to be a useful tool to analyse urban habitat connectivity but also to illustrate results obtained.

AB  - Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) populations in south-east Queensland are in decline. Although various studies have looked at broad-scale tree preference and habitat quality, there has been little attempt to quantify fine-scale activity shifts from one year to the next or examination of activity at the mesoscale. This study quantified koala activity levels in a 909-ha forest patch at Karawatha Forest Park, in south Brisbane. The Spot Assessment Technique was used to quantify activity and tree selection on 33 long-term monitoring plots in 2009 and 2010. In total, 843 trees were searched and koala pellets were found underneath 34 and 47 trees in 2009 and 2010, respectively. A higher proportion of pellets was found underneath Eucalyptus tindaliae and E. fibrosa and there was weak selection for larger trees. A low occurrence of revisits and a minor shift in activity distribution from 2009 to 2010 indicate that the koala population exists at a low density. Rapid declines in koala populations are occurring in primary habitats. Hence, stable low-density koala populations are important for maintaining genetic diversity and connectivity in fragmented urban landscapes.

AB  - Cave bats have an intimate association with their roosts. Size, structural heterogeneity, and microclimatic conditions are traits of caves known to affect the structure of these assemblages. The effects of the natural and anthropogenic landscape factors around caves on the structure of these assemblages are poorly known, especially in areas with large cave clusters. We assessed the effects of cave size and surrounding landscape attributes on the richness and species composition of cave-roosting bats in 13 caves distributed in two landscapes with large cave clusters in Caatinga dry forests, Brazil. In a 1-km buffer around caves, we obtained 13 internal cave and external landscape variables. Candidate univariate models using generalized linear models were constructed and the Akaike information criterion was used for model selection. The cave size model explained richness and variance in the species composition; larger caves tended to have greater richness and assemblage composition varied depending on the cave size, hence affecting the occurrence of certain species, some of conservation concern (Natalus macrourus, Furipterus horrens). The cave connectivity model affected only the richness; caves located in denser cave clusters had higher richness likely attributed to movement of bats among caves by a more diverse array of species. Both environmental and anthropic variables affected species composition, but differently depending of the landscape context of cave location (protected versus nonprotected area). The extent these landscape variables affected the species composition was due to species-specific responses, and observed in the mean colony sizes of the species shared between the cave systems. All the landscape variables that we tested affected the structuring process of cave-roosting bats assemblages, and evidences that variables found in disturbed karstic landscapes also affect the structure of the assemblage (e.g., large colonies of vampire bats). However, the ubiquitous effect of cave size on both richness and species composition reinforces the critical importance of the roost in the life of these flying mammals.

AB  - In many rural landscapes, woodland typically consists of small fragments of different habitat quality and age, embedded in a more or less intensively managed agricultural matrix. Genetic consequences on forest plant populations remain largely unknown. Here we explore whether genetic diversity, spatial genetic structure (SGS) and underlying gene flow are influenced by current and past permeability of the matrix in fragmented landscapes. We compare SGS of the generalist Geum urbanum and the forest specialist Primula elatior across three agricultural landscapes differing by their composition and management intensity. We use non-spatial and spatially informed approaches based upon multilocus genotypes to detect SGS and evaluate the respective importance of historical and contemporary gene flow. Results suggest that a low matrix permeability tends to disrupt gene flow, reducing SGS in populations of the two species. This effect is stronger for the forest specialist than for the generalist, as the former exhibits both low fecundity and dispersal limitation, and requires a higher habitat quality to maintain metapopulations. The current and past permeability of the matrix to gene vectors (seed dispersers and pollinators) explains the apparent unimodal relationship between SGS intensity and genetic connectivity. These results show the susceptibility of forest plant specialists to fragmentation and highlight the need for conserving the most ancient forest fragments and restoring a high functional connectivity among forest patches within agricultural landscapes.

AB  - Aim Projections of biodiversity scenarios often rely solely on climate change to inform species distribution shifts in the future. Land use projections are rarely used due to their unavailability and, when available, are often at coarse spatial and thematic resolutions, making them unsuitable to capture fine scale habitat suitability. This study aims to (a) show how coupled land use change (LUC) models of high thematic resolution (HTR) can be used in species distribution models (SDM), (b) compare the impacts of HTR and low thematic resolution (LTR) explanatory predictors on biodiversity scenarios and (c) assess the impact of species' present area of occupancy on the effect of thematic resolution in SDMs.
   Location Belgium
   Taxon Bumblebees (Bombus)
   Methods We compared species distribution models with 17 land use predictors (HTR) against models with 5 land use predictors (LTR). We modelled the distribution of 17 bumblebee species in Belgium projected until 2035. We examined how model performance, variable importance and projections of distribution change differed depending on the thematic resolution of the land use predictors.
   Results Overall, HTR models performed better than LTR models. LTR models predicted greater extent per species. HTR projected a greater percentage of range gains, and both models projected similar losses of suitable habitat. However, the percentage loss and connectivity of suitable habitats varied differently for HTR and LTR models along a gradient of rare to common species. The HTR models projected greater loss of suitable areas for rare species and less loss for common species compared to LTR models.
   Main conclusions These results illustrate the importance of using ecologically relevant explanatory variables in SDMs, particularly for rare and localized species with specific habitat requirements. The results also indicate the need for large-scale LUC projections to improve future biodiversity scenarios under climate change and to improve the ability of conservationists and policymakers to use SDM projections.

AB  - Especially in urbanized landscapes, habitat fragmentation and increasing numbers of infrastructural features may limit genetic exchange among wildlife populations. Yet, whether this results in genetic differentiation among individuals in different habitat fragments will depend on both the species studied and the composition of the landscape. European pine martens (Martes martes) show clear spatial structure at a Europe-wide scale, but whether gene flow among habitat patches can be maintained at a more local scale in intensively urbanized areas remained unclear. Here, we analysed genotypic data from 270 pine martens sampled from locations scattered across the Netherlands, one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Using Bayesian clustering models we show that most likely maximum two large subpopulations exist in the Netherlands. We observed relatively low levels of genetic differentiation and genetic evidence of regular long-distance dispersal by juveniles that must have crossed one or multiple major highways. Our results suggest that genetic exchange among Dutch pine martens has, until 2010, not been impacted severely by the countries' dense infrastructural network. Furthermore this species seems to have maintained its genetic diversity despite a recent demographic bottleneck. These conclusions support the idea that the effects of habitat fragmentation may strongly differ between (groups of) species, and that prioritization and optimization of management decisions thus requires direct study of the targeted species.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation can change the ecological context of populations, rupturing genetic connectivity among them, changing genetic structure, and increasing the loss of genetic diversity. We analyzed mating system and pollen structure in two population fragments and two continuous forest populations of Dieffenbachia seguine (Araceae), an insect-pollinated understory herb in the tropical rain forest of Los Tuxtlas, Mexico, using nine allozyme loci. Mating system analysis indicated almost complete outcrossing but some inbreeding among the adults. Pollen structure analysis indicated highly restricted pollen flow, both within and among populations. We showed that the effective pollination neighborhood was small in all populations, and slightly (though not significantly) smaller in fragments, partially as a consequence of an increase in density of reproductive individuals in those fragments. Using assignment analysis, we showed that all populations were strongly structured, suggesting that pollen and seed flow across the Los Tuxtlas landscape has been spatially restricted, though sufficient to maintain connectedness. Forest fragmentation at Los Tuxtlas has (so far) had limited impact on pollen dynamics, despite the changing ecological context, with reduced pollinator abundance being partially offset by increased flowering density in fragments. Continued outcrossing and limited pollen immigration, coupled with more extensive seed migration, should maintain genetic connectedness in D. seguine, if fragmentation is not further exacerbated by additional deforestation.

AB  - Fidelity to migratory destinations is an important driver of connectivity in marine and avian species. Here we assess the role of maternally directed learning of migratory habitats, or migratory culture, on the population structure of the endangered Australian and New Zealand southern right whale. Using DNA profiles, comprising mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes (500 bp), microsatellite genotypes (17 loci) and sex from 128 individually-identified whales, we find significant differentiation among winter calving grounds based on both mtDNA haplotype (F-ST = 0.048, Phi(ST) = 0.109, p < 0.01) and microsatellite allele frequencies (F-ST = 0.008, p < 0.01), consistent with long-term fidelity to calving areas. However, most genetic comparisons of calving grounds and migratory corridors were not significant, supporting the idea that whales from different calving grounds mix in migratory corridors. Furthermore, we find a significant relationship between delta C-13 stable isotope profiles of 66 Australian southern right whales, a proxy for feeding ground location, and both mtDNA haplotypes and kinship inferred from microsatellite-based estimators of relatedness. This indicates migratory culture may influence genetic structure on feeding grounds. This fidelity to migratory destinations is likely to influence population recovery, as long-term estimates of historical abundance derived from estimates of genetic diversity indicate the South Pacific calving grounds remain at <10% of prewhaling abundance.

AB  - In peri-urban regions, the establishment of new forest patches can be affected by specific community assembly rules driving species extinction debts and colonization credits. This might result in species surpluses or deficits and shifts in species composition along forest establishment, whose association with human-driven landscape transformation remains largely unknown. We have compared plant assemblages in peri-urban Mediterranean forests of contrasting history (recent vs. preexisting; post- vs. pre-1956) according to species' habitat requirements (forest, scrub-grassland, synanthropic or other) and dispersal mode (vertebrate- vs. non-vertebrate), while considering site and landscape characteristics. Species richness and cover were mostly associated to site characteristics, but also to forest connectivity and history. Connectivity increased total species cover, forest species richness and both richness and cover of vertebrate-dispersed species, while reducing non-forest species richness and synanthropic species cover. Regarding forest history, recent stands showed higher total and non-forest species richness, higher scrub-grassland species cover and lower cover of vertebrate-dispersed species than preexisting forests. Thus, recent stands exhibit a species surplus due to the extinction debt of scrub-grassland species and the transient abundance of synanthropic species, despite the observed colonization credit of vertebrate-dispersed species. These results emphasize the importance of forest connectivity when managing plant species assemblage in peri-urban forest patches but also highlight the need to consider recent history of habitat patches to manage time lags in biodiversity change in human-transformed landscapes.

AB  - Strong relations between population trends and spatial distribution have been suggested at the regional scale: declining species should have more fragmented distributions because decline causes range retractions towards optimal habitats, whereas increasing species should have more aggregated distributions, because colonization processes are constrained by distance. Most analyses of the effects of land use changes on animal populations are diachronic studies of population dynamics or synchronic studies of species habitat selection. Few studies take simultaneously into account temporal changes in habitat distribution and changes in species spatial distribution. We applied the above rationale to the landscape scale and analysed how population declines, increases or stability, as diagnosed in a long term study, correlate with population connectivity or fragmentation at that scale. We used data on changes in faunal distribution and information on temporal changes in the vegetation in a Mediterranean area that had been subjected to land abandonment. We found that species declining at the landscape scale had retracting fragmented distributions and that expanding species had expanding continuous distributions. However, for the latter, we suggest that the factors involved are related to landscape structure and not to dispersal mediated meta-population processes, which are of little relevance at this local scale. We also show that even species that are numerically stable can show fragmentation of their distribution and major spatial distribution shifts in response to land use changes, especially in species that have low occurrence levels or that are associated with transitory habitats such as heterogeneous shrublands (e.g. Sylvia melanocephala). Studying the spatial structure of species distribution patterns at the landscape scale may provide information about population declines and increases both at the regional and the landscape scale and can improve our understanding of short-term risks of local extinction.

AB  - The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is declining in large parts of Europe but populations in some German cities remained so far unaffected by this decline. The question arises of how urbanization affects patterns of population genetic variation and differentiation in German rabbit populations, as urban habitat fragmentation may result in altered meta-population dynamics. To address this question, we used microsatellite markers to genotype rabbit populations occurring along a rural-to-urban gradient in and around the city of Frankfurt, Germany. We found no effect of urbanization on allelic richness. However, the observed heterozygosity was significantly higher in urban than rural populations and also the inbreeding coefficients were lower, most likely reflecting the small population sizes and possibly on-going loss of genetic diversity in structurally impoverished rural areas. Global FST and G(ST)'-values suggest moderate but significant differentiation between populations. Multiple matrix regression with randomization ascribed this differentiation to isolation-by-environment rather than isolation-by-distance. Analyses of migration rates revealed asymmetrical gene flow, which was higher from rural into urban populations than vice versa and may again reflect intensified agricultural land-use practices in rural areas. We discuss that populations inhabiting urban areas will likely play an important role in the future distribution of European rabbits.

AB  - Management of ecosystems often focuses on specific species chosen for their habitat demand, public appeal, or levels of threat. We propose a complementary framework for choosing focal species, the mobile link concept, which allows managers to focus on spatial processes and deal with multi-scale ecological dynamics. Spatial processes are important for three reasons: maintenance, re-organization, and restoration of ecological values. We illustrate the framework with a case study of the Eurasian Jay, a mobile link species of importance for the oak forest regeneration in the Stockholm National Urban Park, Sweden, and its surroundings. The case study concludes with a conceptual model for how the framework can be applied in management. The model is based on a review of published data complemented with a seed predation experiment and mapping of Jay territories to reduce the risk of applying non-urban site-specific information in an urban setting. Our case study shows that the mobile link approach has several advantages: (1) Reducing the vulnerability of ecological functions to disturbances and fluctuations in resources allocated to management, (2) Reducing management costs by maintaining natural processes, and (3) Maintaining gene flow and genetic diversity at a landscape level. We argue that management that includes mobile link organisms is an important step towards the prevention of ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss in increasingly fragmented landscapes. Identifying and managing mobile links is a way to align management with the ecologically relevant scales in any landscape.

AB  - Local native species that decline in response to urbanisation are often classified as 'urban avoiders'. Their decline drives the biotic homogenisation seen in cities but the characterisation of these species as urban avoiders may discourage efforts to conserve them in urban landscapes. We used gradient analysis and species distribution modelling to examine habitat availability and fragmentation along an entire urban-forest gradient for a representative urban avoider - the Eastern Yellow Robin (Eopsaltria australis). Gradient analysis had utility in quantifying threats for this species but species distribution modelling better highlighted conservation opportunities in the landscape. The amount of suitable habitat declined with increasing urbanisation whilst fragmentation increased. Towards the city centre, habitat clustered around major waterways. Riparian networks showed clear potential to facilitate the restoration of connectivity between urban and fringing habitat and we identify 'missing links' in this network - key opportunities for habitat restoration. Riparian vegetation escapes development, is the preferred habitat for many species, including humans, and can serve as the logical architecture on which to focus conservation efforts. Restoring habitat along riparian networks in cities can build comprehensive and fully connected biotic infrastructure that facilitates human-nature connections and conserves local native species diversity.

AB  - Many estuarine shorelines are influenced by urbanization. Extensive shoreline modification in Upper New York Harbor (UNYH) included port development, landfilling marshes, and armoring. Recent sedimentation in constructed shipping terminal embayments, abandonment of shoreline structure maintenance, subsequent recruitment of upland and intertidal vegetation, and restoration projects have naturalized some shorelines in this urban setting. We determined the species composition and relative abundance of fishes and crabs in shallow shoreline habitats in constructed embayments of UNYH with seine sampling to determine the potential for restoring similar isolated shallow water sites as functional habitats. Twenty-seven identified species of fishes and crabs, including seasonally transient and resident marsh species, were represented in samples dominated by Menidia menidia, but marsh resident and coastal ocean species were also periodically abundant. Differences in assemblage structure among the sampled embayments as measured by principal components analysis were weak despite some differences in the slope and colonization of vegetation along shorelines. The mere presence of shallow shorelines was sufficient to recruit numerous species. Assemblage differences relative to a nearby relatively unaltered estuary revealed a lack of southern, warm affiliated species reflecting a natural clinal gradient. Marsh resident species dominated in UNYH, but not as strongly as at the reference estuary. Together with a previously published evaluation of life cycle connectivity for several sentinel species, this study shows that even small, isolated projects seeking to restore shallow shorelines add value to the estuarine landscape and are worth pursuing.

AB  - The Resplendent Quetzal (Pharomachrus mocinno) is a threatened bird species classified into two putative Subspecies (P. m. mocinno and P. m. costaricensis) and distributed in cloud forests of seven countries in Mesoamerica. Because the birds are rare, tissue samples are difficult to obtain, but we analyzed genetic diversity in 25 quetzals from five countries based on 255 bp of domain I of the control region of mitochondrial DNA. Eight haplotypes were detected. Nucleotide diversity for Mexico (P. m. mocinno: 0.0021) and Panama (P. m. costaricensis: 0.0026) were low, and did not differ from the values estimated for other birds species it-respective of whether they were endangered. A haplotype tree rooted with the Pavonine Quetzal (P. pavoninus) recovered two reciprocally monophyletic clades corresponding to each subspecies, so we propose that each subspecies be considered as an evolutionarily significant unit for conservation planning. A minimum spanning network showed the number of genetic differences separating haplotypes within subspecies was small relative to the number of substitutions among them, indicating strong population subdivision (F-ST = 0.37). In spite of the limited sampling we propose that in conservation practice Mexico-Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Panama be considered preliminarily as independent conservation management units since they each have unique haplotypes. Additionally, these countries should construct international agreements to protect the natural vegetation corridors among cloud forests of Mesoamerica and to curtail the illegal trade of quetzals.

AB  - Understanding how populations respond to habitat loss is central to conserving biodiversity. Population genetic approaches enable the identification of the symptoms of population disruption in advance of population collapse. However, the spatio-temporal scales at which population disruption occurs are still too poorly known to effectively conserve biodiversity in the face of human-induced landscape change. We employed microsatellite analysis to examine genetic structure and diversity over small spatial (mostly 1-50 km) and temporal scales (20-50 years) in the squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis), a gliding mammal that is commonly subjected to a loss of habitat connectivity. We identified genetically differentiated local populations over distances as little as 3 km and within 30 years of landscape change. Genetically isolated local populations experienced the loss of genetic diversity, and significantly increased mean relatedness, which suggests increased inbreeding. Where tree cover remained, genetic differentiation was less evident. This pattern was repeated in two landscapes located 750 km apart. These results lend support to other recent studies that suggest the loss of habitat connectivity can produce fine-scale population genetic change in a range of taxa. This gives rise to the prediction that many other vertebrates will experience similar genetic changes. Our results suggest the future collapse of local populations of this gliding mammal is likely unless habitat connectivity is maintained or restored. Landscape management must occur on a fine-scale to avert the erosion of biodiversity.

AB  - Throughout the developing world, urban centres with sprawling slum settlements are rapidly expanding and invading previously forested ecosystems. Slum communities are characterized by untended refuse, open sewers and overgrown vegetation, which promote rodent infestation. Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) are reservoirs for epidemic transmission of many zoonotic pathogens of public health importance. Understanding the population ecology of R.norvegicus is essential to formulate effective rodent control strategies, as this knowledge aids estimation of the temporal stability and spatial connectivity of populations. We screened for genetic variation, characterized the population genetic structure and evaluated the extent and patterns of gene flow in the urban landscape using 17 microsatellite loci in 146 rats from nine sites in the city of Salvador, Brazil. These sites were divided between three neighbourhoods within the city spaced an average of 2.7km apart. Surprisingly, we detected very little relatedness among animals trapped at the same site and found high levels of genetic diversity, as well as structuring across small geographical distances. Most F-ST comparisons among sites were statistically significant, including sites <400m apart. Bayesian analyses grouped the samples in three genetic clusters, each associated with distinct sampling sites from different neighbourhoods or valleys within neighbourhoods. These data indicate the existence of complex genetic structure in R.norvegicus in Salvador, linked to the heterogeneous urban landscape. Future rodent control measures need to take into account the spatial and temporal linkage of rat populations in Salvador, as revealed by genetic data, to develop informed eradication strategies.

AB  - Recent research has focused on the ways urban forest patterns vary in relation to level of urbanization and socioeconomic characteristics, with most studies limited to one urban land use type or multiple non-differentiate land uses. Additionally, the majority of studies examining urban forest patterns focus on canopy cover extent, with less attention given to patterns of species diversity. This study explores how tree species diversity varies across different urban land uses and municipal boundaries to better understand the role of land use types in shaping urban forest patterns. The goal is addressed through an exploration of plot-level tree data in the urban municipalities of Peel Region located in the Greater Toronto Area (Ontario, Canada). Species composition and standard diversity metrics are calculated for eight land use types and four municipalities. Our results show that differences in diversity metrics and species composition are greater between urban land uses than municipalities. Moreover, Peel's urban forest has relatively high alpha diversity but many species are present on only one land use type. The results suggest that different causal processes are associated with each land use type, and that urban forest managers should adopt land use-specific strategies to meet species composition goals within the urban forest.

AB  - Landscape features may restricting dispersal and gene flow, and increase demographic isolation among sub-populations. In addition, landscape features may represent potential dispersal barriers depending on species vagility. To predict the persistence of populations and to formulate adequate conservation measures it is essential to understand the ability of species to transverse landscape barriers. Using population genetic techniques we assessed the importance of physical barriers along the Kinabatangan River for a suite of non-volant small mammals. Cytochrome b sequence variation was examined for each of the 19 species sampled across both riverbanks. Haplotype networks and molecular variance analyses indicated contrasting patterns of genetic isolation between riversides for different taxa. Genetic isolation between riversides ranged from moderate to complete in tree shrews and squirrels, whereas no isolating effect could be detected in murids and gymnures. Although genetic divergence between forest fragments on the same side of the river could only be studied in a subset of six species, the results suggest an additional dispersal barrier for two of these studied species. While barrier effects of a paved road and tributaries could not be verified, large oil palm plantations seem to have disrupted gene flow in these species. Furthermore, the findings suggest higher genetic connectivity on the more continuously forested compared to the more fragmented riverside, and underline the importance of forest corridors as essential conservation measures to maintain genetic diversity in a fragmented landscape such as that along the Kinabatangan River.

AB  - Populations of the western spadefoot (Spea hammondii) in southern California occur in one of the most urbanized and fragmented landscapes on the planet and have lost up to 80% of their native habitat. Orange County is one of the last strongholds for this pond-breeding amphibian in the region, and ongoing restoration efforts targeting S. hammondii have involved habitat protection and the construction of artificial breeding ponds. These efforts have successfully increased breeding activity, but genetic characterization of the populations, including estimates of effective population size and admixture between the gene pools of constructed artificial and natural ponds, has never been undertaken. Using thousands of genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms, we characterized the population structure, genetic diversity, and genetic connectivity of spadefoots in Orange County to guide ongoing and future management efforts. We identified at least 2, and possibly 3 major genetic clusters, with additional substructure within clusters indicating that individual ponds are often genetically distinct. Estimates of landscape resistance suggest that ponds on either side of the Los Angeles Basin were likely interconnected historically, but intense urban development has rendered them essentially isolated, and the resulting risk of interruption to natural metapopulation dynamics appears to be high. Resistance surfaces show that the existing artificial ponds were well-placed and connected to natural populations by low-resistance corridors. Toad samples from all ponds (natural and artificial) returned extremely low estimates of effective population size, possibly due to a bottleneck caused by a recent multi-year drought. Management efforts should focus on maintaining gene flow among natural and artificial ponds by both assisted migration and construction of new ponds to bolster the existing pond network in the region.

AB  - Simple Summary
   We determined the genetic variability, population structure, and influence of genetic factors on two parameters of fitness (body mass and reproductive ability) in roe deer females in the contact zone between the Alps and the Dinaric Mountains by utilizing microsatellite variations in 214 individuals collected throughout Slovenia, Central Europe. Spatial differences in the genetic diversity of the species can be explained by population history, different approaches to population management and/or different connectivity among subpopulations. The population genetic structure confirms the high side fidelity of roe deer, but also shows the existence of admixtures of genes among different areas. We found evidence that genetic factors, including individual heterozygosity, influence body mass, confirming that heterozygosity positively affects fitness in wild populations. However, as the effect of genetic factors is usually masked or overruled by the influence of environmental factors, i.e., availability of resources, data on the joint influence of external and intrinsic factors on fitness and other life-history traits are needed to better predict the population dynamics of targeted species, which would enable sustainable, science-based population management.
   Across its pan-European distribution, the European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) faces a wide diversity of environmental and climatic conditions; therefore, several factors, including intrinsic ones, shape life-history traits and cause significant variability in parameters of fitness. By utilizing microsatellite variations in 214 roe deer females collected throughout Slovenia, Central Europe, we determined the genetic variability and population structure of this species in the contact zone between the Alps and the Dinaric Mountains, i.e., over a wider area where data on the genetic outlook for this-the most common and widespread European wild ungulate-have been completely lacking so far. Throughout the country, we found moderate microsatellite diversity (Ho = 0.57-0.65) in relation to the observed heterozygosity reported for other roe deer populations in Europe. Spatial differences in genetic diversity of the species in Slovenia can be explained by population history linked to varying approaches to population management and/or different connectivity among subpopulations in topographically differentiated habitats. A country-wide pattern of genetic structure is clearly defined by separation of the populations into three groups present in the following regions: (i) Southern sub-Mediterranean and Karst regions, (ii) Central Slovenia, and (iii) the Sub-Pannonian Region in the north-east. This is also confirmed by evidencing a moderate isolation by distance, especially by separating southern samples (coastal Slovenia) from others. Levels of genetic differentiation vary among populations, which can be explained by the effect of natural geographical barriers or the presence of anthropogenic barriers such as urban areas and highways. In the subset of 172 yearling females, we analyzed the influence of genetic advantage (individual heterozygosity) and other genetic data (reflected in the structuring of the population) on body mass and reproductive ability. We found evidence that genetic factors influence the body mass of roe deer yearling females (explaining altogether 18.
   8% of body mass variance), and the level of individual heterozygosity alone also positively affected body mass, which is in accordance with the theory that heterozygosity is commonly positively correlated with fitness in wild populations. However, we did not uncover any effect of heterozygosity on two parameters of reproductive ability (fertility and potential reproductive outcome), indicating that several other factors, especially environmental ones, have a predominant effect on the parameters of fitness in roe deer.

AB  - We monitored the last remaining Asian elephant populations in China over the past decade. Using DNA tools and repeat genotyping, we estimated the population sizes from 654 dung samples collected from various areas. Combined with morphological individual identifications from over 6,300 elephant photographs taken in the wild, we estimated that the total Asian elephant population size in China is between 221 and 245. Population genetic structure and diversity were examined using a 556-bp fragment of mitochondrial DNA, and 24 unique haplotypes were detected from DNA analysis of 178 individuals. A phylogenetic analysis revealed two highly divergent clades of Asian elephants, alpha and beta, present in Chinese populations. Four populations (Mengla, Shangyong, Mengyang, and Pu'Er) carried mtDNA from the a clade, and only one population (Nangunhe) carried mtDNA belonging to the a clade. Moreover, high genetic divergence was observed between the Nangunhe population and the other four populations; however, genetic diversity among the five populations was low, possibly due to limited gene flow because of habitat fragmentation. The expansion of rubber plantations, crop cultivation, and villages along rivers and roads had caused extensive degradation of natural forest in these areas. This had resulted in the loss and fragmentation of elephant habitats and had formed artificial barriers that inhibited elephant migration. Using Geographic Information System, Global Positioning System, and Remote Sensing technology, we found that the area occupied by rubber plantations, tea farms, and urban settlements had dramatically increased over the past 40 years, resulting in the loss and fragmentation of elephant habitats and forming artificial barriers that inhibit elephant migration. The restoration of ecological corridors to facilitate gene exchange among isolated elephant populations and the establishment of cross-boundary protected areas between China and Laos to secure their natural habitats are critical for the survival of Asian elephants in this region.

AB  - Societal constraints often limit full process restoration in large river systems, making local rehabilitation activities valuable for regeneration of riparian vegetation. A target of much mitigation and restoration is the federally threatened Valley elderberry longhorn beetle and its sole host plant, blue elderberry, in upper riparian floodplain environments. However, blue elderberry ecology is not well understood and restoration attempts typically have low success rates. We determined broad-scale habitat characteristics of elderberry in altered systems and examined associated plant species composition in remnant habitat. We quantified vegetation community composition in 139 remnant riparian forest patches along the Sacramento River and elderberry stem diameters along this and four adjacent rivers. The greatest proportion of plots containing elderberry was located on higher and older floodplain surfaces and in riparian woodlands dominated by black walnut. Blue elderberry saplings and shrubs with stems < 5.0 cm in diameter were rare, suggesting a lack of recruitment. A complex suite of vegetation was associated with blue elderberry, including several invasive species which are potentially outcompeting seedlings for light, water, or other resources. Such lack of recruitment places increased importance on horticultural restoration for the survival of an imperiled species. These findings further indicate a need to ascertain whether intervention is necessary to maintain functional and diverse riparian woodlands, and a need to monitor vegetative species composition over time, especially in relation to flow regulation.

AB  - Barriers to animal movement can isolate populations, impacting their genetic diversity, susceptibility to disease, and access to resources. Barriers to movement may be caused by artificial light, which is known to disrupt bird, sea turtle, and bat behavior, but few studies have experimentally investigated the effects of artificial light on movement for a suite of terrestrial vertebrates. Therefore, we studied the effect of ecological light pollution on animal usage of a bridge under-road passage structure. On a weekly basis, sections of the structure were subjected to different light treatments including no light added, followed by a Reference period when lights were off in all the structure sections. Sand track data revealed use by 23 mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians, nine of which had >30 tracks for species-level analysis. Columbia black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) traversed under unlit bridge sections much less when neighboring sections were lit compared to when none were, suggesting avoidance due to any nearby presence of artificial light. Similarly, deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and opossum (Didelphis virginiana) track paths were less frequent in the lit sections than the ambient. Crossing was correlated with temporal or spatial factors but not light for three of the other species. These findings suggest that artificial light may be reducing habitat connectivity for some species though not providing a strong barrier for others. Such information is needed to inform mitigation of habitat fragmentation in the face of expanding urbanization. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - GIS-based siting procedures are progressively used to select protected areas (PAs) on the basis of a variety of attributes clustered in main environmental groups including climate, hydrogeology, vegetation cover and various criteria and sub-criteria showing changes in the landscape. However, the suitability of a selecting procedure may be restrained by the aggregate analyses involving the weight and relative importance of the criteria. Here, we integrate a multi criteria decision analysis methodology with geographic information system for selecting a protected region for the vulnerable Kaiser's mountain newt, Neurergus kaiseri, endemic to southern Iran. The process of decision making for selection a PA for N. kaiseri structured in a two-stage. Mask maps are prepared using nine exclusionary criteria including stream density, high ridge density, areas with unsuitable terrestrial vegetation cover, unacceptable land use, harsh climate, inappropriate distance to cities and industries, main roads, railroad, and dam reservoirs. These exclusionary criteria provided an overlay map representing areas grossly suitable for allocating PAs. The initial site screening followed by a multi criteria decision analysis based on ten non-exclusionary criteria including conservation integrity, number of newt localities, MaxEnt suitability score, distance to nearest neighbor habitat, genetic diversity, spring density, distance to protected area, extent of selected patch areas, villages density and distance to main roads. Giving weight and rate to the non-exclusionary criteria all nominated PAs received a numerical evaluation. (c) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Urbanization can result in the fragmentation of once contiguous natural landscapes into a patchy habitat interspersed within a growing urban matrix. Animals living in fragmented landscapes often have reduced movement among habitat patches because of avoidance of intervening human development, which potentially leads to both reduced gene flow and pathogen transmission between patches. Mammalian carnivores with large home ranges, such as bobcats (Lynx rufus), may be particularly sensitive to habitat fragmentation. We performed genetic analyses on bobcats and their directly transmitted viral pathogen, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), to investigate the effects of urbanization on bobcat movement. We predicted that urban development, including major freeways, would limit bobcat movement and result in genetically structured host and pathogen populations. We analysed molecular markers from 106 bobcats and 19 FIV isolates from seropositive animals in urban southern California. Our findings indicate that reduced gene flow between two primary habitat patches has resulted in genetically distinct bobcat subpopulations separated by urban development including a major highway. However, the distribution of genetic diversity among FIV isolates determined through phylogenetic analyses indicates that pathogen genotypes are less spatially structuredexhibiting a more even distribution between habitat fragments. We conclude that the types of movement and contact sufficient for disease transmission occur with enough frequency to preclude structuring among the viral population, but that the bobcat population is structured owing to low levels of effective bobcat migration resulting in gene flow. We illustrate the utility in using multiple molecular markers that differentially detect movement and gene flow between subpopulations when assessing connectivity.

AB  - Understanding how habitat structure and resource availability affect local species distributions is a key goal of community ecology. Where habitats occur as a mosaic, variation in connectivity among patches influences both local species richness and composition, and connectivity is a key conservation concern in fragmented landscapes. Similarly, availability of limiting resources frequently determines species coexistence or exclusion. For primarily cursorial arthropods like ants, gaps between neighboring trees are a significant barrier to movement through the forest canopy. Competition for limited resources such as nest sites also promotes antagonistic interactions. Lianas (woody vines) connect normally isolated neighboring tree crowns and often have hollow stems inhabited by ants. We used two large-scale liana-removal experiments to determine how connectivity and nest site availability provided by lianas affect arboreal ant species richness, species composition, and beta-diversity in a lowland tropical forest in Panama. Removing lianas from a tree crown reduced ant species richness up to 35%, and disproportionately affected species that require large foraging areas. Adding artificial connectivity to trees mitigated the effects of liana removal. Ant colonization of artificial nests was higher (73% occupied) in trees without lianas vs. trees with lianas (28% occupied). However, artificial nests typically were colonized by existing polydomous, resident ant species. As a result, nest addition did not affect ant community structure. Collectively, these results indicate that lianas are important to the maintenance of arboreal ant diversity specifically by providing connectivity among neighboring tree crowns. Anticipated increases in liana abundance in this forest could increase the local (tree-level) species richness of arboreal ants, with a compositional bias toward elevating the density of broad-ranging specialist predators.

AB  - Premise Conversion of primary forests to pastures is a major cause of habitat fragmentation in the tropics. Fragmentation is expected to impede gene flow for many plant species that are restricted to remaining forest fragments. Epiphytes may be especially vulnerable to this effect of forest fragmentation because they depend on host trees. However, trees that remain in pastures may enhance connectivity across the landscape for epiphyte species that can thrive on such trees. To investigate this possibility, we studied the genetic structures of two such species on isolated pasture trees and surrounding forest, in relation to their local abundances in different habitat types and aspects of their reproductive biology including pollen and seed dispersal agents, and looked for evidence of increased or diminished gene flow. Methods We used microsatellite markers to assess geographic patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation in two epiphytic bromeliads, Catopsis nitida and Werauhia tonduziana, in the Monteverde region of Costa Rica. Results About 85% of the F-ST value for Catopsis nitida was found among pastures within regions, while for Weruahia tonduziana, about 80% of the F-ST value was contributed by differences between regions, indicating much more gene flow within regions, relative to C. nitida. Conclusions Although there was substantial genetic differentiation among epiphyte populations, those on isolated pasture trees were not substantially less diverse than those in adjacent forests, suggesting that pasture trees may serve as "stepping stones" that help these species maintain their genetic connectedness and diversity at larger geographic scales.

AB  - We evaluated the Aoristic condition of freshwater palustrine wetlands dominated by wet meadow, emergent marsh, aquatic vegetation, or open water within the rapidly urbanizing area of Portland, Oregon, USA by (1) characterizing plant species richness (presence/absence) and composition of naturally occurring wetlands (NOWs) and mitigation wetlands (MWs) and (2) identifying relationships between floristic characteristics and variables describing land-use, site conditions, and mitigation activities. Data were collected on 45 NOWs and 51 MWs. Overall species richness was high (365 plant taxa), but more than 50% of the species present on both NOWs and MWs were introduced. Only 14 species occurred on more than half the sites, and nine of them were invasive introduced species. The mean number of native species per site did not differ between land-use categories (ANOVA, F = 0.62 at 3 and 88 df, p = 0.6031); however, wetlands surrounded by agricultural and commercial/industrial/transportation corridor uses had more introduced species per site than wetlands surrounded by undeveloped land (Fishers Protected LSD at 88 df, p less than or equal to 0.05). Although overlapping in floristic composition, NOWs and MWs had significantly different (MRPP, p < 0.0001) species assemblages that were identified using TWINSPAN. MRPP analyses for all sites showed that watershed, land-use, HGM class, percent cover of water, and MW age were significantly related to the floristic composition of the study wetlands. Canonical correspondence analyses further revealed that the primary gradient for species distribution in NOWs was related to moisture; the secondary gradient was related to land-use. The primary gradient also described a strong relationship between percent cover of water and HGM class. For MWs, the primary gradient was related to watershed location and surrounding landuse; the secondary gradient was related to percent cover of water and MW age. Most MWs (44 out or 51 sites) were depressions in various settings, so while HGM class separates NOWs from MWs, it does little to distinguish MW assemblages. Our results show that wetlands in the urbanizing study area are floristically degraded. Further, current wetland management practices are replacing natural marsh and wet meadow systems with ponds, resulting in changes in the composition of plant species assemblages.

AB  - Species distributions are a function of an individual's ability to disperse to and colonize habitat patches. These processes depend upon landscape configuration and composition.
   Using Blanchard's cricket frogs (Acris blanchardi), we assessed which land cover types were predictive of (1) presence at three spatial scales (pond-shed, 500 and 2500 m) and (2) genetic structure. We predicted that forested, urban, and road land covers would negatively affect cricket frogs. We also predicted that agricultural, field, and aquatic land covers would positively affect cricket frogs.
   We surveyed for cricket frogs at 28 sites in southwestern Ohio, USA to determine presence across different habitats and analyze genetic structure among populations. For our first objective, we examined if land use (crop, field, forest, and urban habitat) and landscape features (ponds, streams, and roads) explained presence; for our second objective, we assessed whether these land cover types explained genetic distance between populations.
   Land cover did not have a strong influence on cricket frog presence. However, multiple competing models suggested effects of roads, streams, and land use. We found genetic structuring: populations were grouped into five major clusters and nine finer-scale clusters. Highways were predictive of increased genetic distance.
   By combining a focal-patch study with landscape genetics, our study suggests that major roads and waterways are key features affecting species distributions in agricultural landscapes. We demonstrate that cricket frogs may respond to landscape features at larger spatial scales, and that presence and movement may be affected by different environmental factors.

AB  - Landscape heterogeneity can shape genetic structure and functional connectivity of populations. When this heterogeneity imposes variable costs of moving across the landscape, populations can be structured according to a pattern of "isolation by resistance" (IBR). At the same time, divergent local environmental filters can limit gene flow, creating an alternative pattern of "isolation by environment" (IBE). Here, we evaluate IBR and IBE in the insect-pollinated, biennial plant Sabatia angularis (L.) Pursh (Gentianaceae) across serpentine grasslands in the fragmented landscape of SE Pennsylvania, USA using similar to 4500 neutral SNP loci. Specifically, we test the extent to which radical alteration of the landscape matrix by humans has fundamentally altered the cost of movement, imprinting a pattern of IBR dictated by land use type and intensity, and the potential for IBE in relation to a gradient of heavy metal concentrations found in serpentine soil. We reveal a strong signal of IBR and a weak signal of IBE across sites, indicating the greater importance of the landscape matrix in shaping genetic structure of S. angularis populations in the study region. Based on Circuitscape and least cost path approaches, we find that both low- and high-intensity urbanization resist gene flow by orders of magnitude greater than "natural" habitats, although resistance to low-intensity urbanization weakens at larger spatial scales. While cropland presents a substantially lower barrier than urban development, cumulative human land use surrounding populations predicts within-population genetic diversity and inbreeding in S. angularis. Our results emphasize the role of forest buffers and corridors in facilitating gene flow between serpentine grassland patches and averting local extinction of plant populations.

AB  - Connectivity of populations influences the degree to which species maintain genetic diversity and persist despite local extinctions. Natural landscape features are known to influence connectivity, but global anthropogenic landscape change underscores the importance of quantifying how human-modified landscapes disrupt connectivity of natural populations. Grasslands of western North America have experienced extensive habitat alteration, fragmenting populations of species such as black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). Population sizes and the geographic range of prairie dogs have been declining for over a century due to habitat loss, disease, and eradication efforts. In many places, prairie dogs have persisted in the face of emerging urban landscapes that carve habitat into smaller and smaller fragments separated by uninhabitable areas. In extreme cases, prairie dog colonies are completely bounded by urbanization. Connectivity is particularly important for prairie dogs because colonies suffer high probabilities of extirpation by plague, and dispersal permits recolonization. Here we explore connectivity of prairie dog populations using analyses of 11 microsatellite loci for 9 prairie dog colonies spanning the fragmented landscape of Boulder County, Colorado. Isolation-by-resistance modeling suggests that wetlands and high intensity urbanization limit movement of prairie dogs. However, prairie dogs appear to move moderately well through low intensity development (including roads) and freely through cropland and grassland. Additionally, there is a marked decline in gene flow between colonies with increasing geographic distance, indicating isolation by distance even in an altered landscape. Our results suggest that prairie dog colonies retain some connectivity despite fragmentation by urbanization and agricultural development.

AB  - The Cape Floristic Region (CFR) is well-known for its floral diversity, yet also contains a rich herpetofauna with >180 species, 28% of which are endemic. Recent studies conducted on CFR lizards indicated that phylogeographic patterns show some congruency, and that the western CFR shows higher overall diversity in the form of population and/or clade turnover. Here, we combine mitochondrial sequence data from two published (Bradypodion spp. and Agama atra) and one new dataset (Pedioplanis burchelli) to investigate whether geographic patterns of genetic diversity could be influenced by predicted climatic changes. We utilised Bayesian methodology and spatial genetic landscapes to establish broad-scale patterns and show that the western CFR is a contact zone for several clades in all three taxa, supporting the hypothesis of phylogeographic congruence. Current levels of gene flow are virtually zero between the western and eastern CFR. In the east, gene flow between populations is negligible at present but was probably stronger in the past given the present lack of strong genetic structure. Bioclimatic modelling predicted that climatically suitable areas within the CFR will decline for Bradypodion spp. and P. burchelli, with areas high in clade turnover loosing more climatically suitable areas than areas with low clade turnover. The models also predict that loss of climatic suitability may result in highly fragmented and patchy distributions, resulting in a greater loss of connectivity. In contrast, A. atra does not show significant climatic suitability losses overall, although it may experience localised losses (and gains). This species is not predicted to loose suitability in areas of high clade turnover. Thus, the incorporation of genetic data into climatic models has extended our knowledge on the vulnerability of these species given the predicted threat of landscape change. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - It is hypothesized that plant diversity in field margins can be influenced by field margin structure and management, factors related to adjacent land use and factors related to landscape structure. To test this hypothesis, the plant species composition of field margins in three hedgerow network landscapes differing in grain size, hedgerow connectivity and land use patterns were compared. Variation partitioning by partial canonical correspondence analysis was used to assess the relative weight of local and landscape factors in total variation explained. Results showed that the three sets of local factors and the landscape factor were all significant. We conclude that the plant species composition of field margins is determined by landscape scale variation in environment attributes, and discuss implications for conservation.

AB  - Animal species living in small populations with small ranges may be particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation. We investigated genetic population structure of the camas pocket gopher (Thomomys bul-bivorus), a species endemic to the Willamette Valley, Oregon, an area strongly affected by human development. Pocket gophers collected across much of the range of the species were analyzed for genetic structure, diversity, and influences of landscape on gene flow using microsatellite markers identified in closely related gopher species. We used k-means clustering to group individuals into genetically similar clusters based on their locations along principal component axes, and we evaluated the strength of evidence for this clustering using discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC). We used mixed-effects modeling to evaluate the influence of rivers and hills (represented by slopes) as explana-tory variables for pairwise individual genetic distances along principal component axes. Results supported a clinal, isola-tion-by-distance or isolation-by-resistance model, with greater genetic diversity near the central portion of the range. A model with both rivers and slopes was best supported, compared to either variable alone or a simple distance model. The Willamette River, which divides the range of the camas pocket gopher, appeared to have some restrictive effect on gene flow but was not a complete barrier. In population-level analyses, we observed strong genetic differentiation as well as persistent Wahlund effects, suggesting that complex genetic structure exists within a population connected across gradients of distance, rivers, and hills. The camas pocket gopher has persisted despite persecution as an agricul-tural pest and intensive habitat fragmentation due to agriculture, but the future may hold new conservation challenges as human population and urban development increase in the limited range of this endemic Oregon species.

AB  - Aim Urbanization as a major global trend profoundly changes biodiversity patterns, and homogenization of urban biota due to expanding exotic species and declining native species is of increasing concern. Previous studies on this topic have mostly taken place at large scales that include high habitat heterogeneity. Here, we aimed at disentangling the effects of urbanization and plant invasion on species composition through the analysis of similarity patterns of urban plant assemblages at the community scale where species interact. Location Berlin, Germany. Methods We analysed how different levels of urbanization, specific components of the urban matrix and the dominance of a native (Betula pendula) versus an exotic tree species (Robinia pseudoacacia) affect alpha and beta diversity of urban woodland understorey vegetation in sixty-eight 100-m2 plots. Results Exotic dominance reduced alpha diversity, but not beta diversity of the total species pool. Comparing beta diversity among different species groups revealed significant but divergent effects of exotic dominance, habitat connectivity and levels of urbanization in native and non-native species assemblages. In particular, urbanity proved to homogenize the native species pool, whereas the beta diversity of the non-native species pool showed a more pronounced response to exotic dominance. Main conclusions Our data provide evidence that both the urban context and the dominance of exotic species can modify homogenization processes at the community level. These novel insights into the mechanisms of biotic homogenization of urban floras may contribute to mitigating the effects of urbanization on biodiversity.

AB  - White pine blister rust is caused by the fungal pathogen Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fisch (Basidiomycota, Pucciniales). This invasive alien pathogen was introduced into North America at the beginning of the 20th century on pine seedlings imported from Europe and has caused serious economic and ecological impacts. In this study, we applied a population and landscape genetics approach to understand the patterns of introduction and colonization as well as population structure and migration of C. ribicola. We characterized 1,292 samples of C. ribicola from 66 geographic locations in North America using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and evaluated the effect of landscape features, host distribution, and colonization history on the structure of these pathogen populations. We identified eastern and western genetic populations in North America that are strongly differentiated. Genetic diversity is two to five times higher in eastern populations than in western ones, which can be explained by the repeated accidental introductions of the pathogen into northeastern North America compared with a single documented introduction into western North America. These distinct genetic populations are maintained by a barrier to gene flow that corresponds to a region where host connectivity is interrupted. Furthermore, additional cryptic spatial differentiation was identified in western populations. This differentiation corresponds to landscape features, such as mountain ranges, and also to host connectivity. We also detected genetic differentiation between the pathogen populations in natural stands and plantations, an indication that anthropogenic movement of this pathogen still takes place. These results highlight the importance of monitoring this invasive alien tree pathogen to prevent admixture of eastern and western populations where different pathogen races occur.

AB  - Bees are the primary pollinators of flowering plants in almost all ecosystems. Worldwide declines in bee populations have raised awareness about the importance of their ecological role in maintaining ecosystem functioning. The naturally strong philopatric behavior that some bee species show can be detrimental to population viability through increased probability of inbreeding. Furthermore, bee populations found in human-altered landscapes, such as urban areas, can experience lower levels of gene flow and effective population sizes, increasing potential for inbreeding depression in wild bee populations. In this study, we investigated the fine-scale population structure of the solitary bee Colletes inaequalis in an urbanized landscape. First, we developed a predictive spatial model to detect suitable nesting habitat for this ground nesting bee and to inform our field search for nests. We genotyped 18 microsatellites in 548 female individuals collected from nest aggregations throughout the study area. Genetic relatedness estimates revealed that genetic similarity among individuals was slightly greater within nest aggregations than among randomly chosen individuals. However, genetic structure among nest aggregations was low (Nei's G(ST) = 0.011). Reconstruction of parental genotypes revealed greater genetic relatedness among females than among males within nest aggregations, suggesting male-mediated dispersal as a potentially important mechanism of population connectivity and inbreeding avoidance. Size of nesting patch was positively correlated with effective population size, but not with other estimators of genetic diversity. We detected a positive trend between geographic distance and genetic differentiation between nest aggregations. Our landscape genetic models suggest that increased urbanization is likely associated with higher levels of inbreeding. Overall, these findings emphasize the importance of density and distribution of suitable nesting patches for enhancing bee population abundance and connectivity in human dominated habitats and highlights the critical contribution of landscape genetic studies for enhanced conservation and management of native pollinators.

AB  - Karst rocky desertification (KRD) is one of the biggest challenges in the karst ecological restoration of Southwest China, and a thorough understanding of the plant community characteristics in various karren habitats provides a basis for mitigating KRD and restoring the degraded ecosystem. To improve our knowledge of the detailed characteristics and impact mechanisms of karren habitats on the species distribution and species diversity patterns of woody and herbaceous plants to benefit sustainable management and planting design for revegetation establishment in the karst region, a field investigation was carried out in the natural restoration vegetation of Shilin Geopark. The results indicated that karren habitats apparently determine the species diversity and composition. At the arbor layer, the habitat with the highest alpha diversity was solution corridor (SC), and at the shrub layer, grikes (GR) were the karren habitats with the most diverse communities. At the herb layer, solution rock debris (SRD) showed the highest richness of herbaceous species. The karren habitat features and topographic factors significantly influence plant alpha diversity and distribution. Soil area (SA) and canopy density (CD) were the dominant factors influencing plant diversity at the arbor, shrub and herb layers, soil thickness (ST) was significantly effective at the arbor and herb layers. Karren habitat height (KHH), litter thickness (LT), and slope gradient (SG) were significantly influential at the herb layer. The impacts of the karren habitat width (KHW), slope aspect (SAS), and SG on woody species distribution were significant. Knowledge obtained from this study will be helpful guidance for future sustainable restored vegetation design and management with high biodiversity and regional characteristics in the karst area of Southwest China and other fragile karst ecosystems in the world.

AB  - By increasing landscape patchiness and habitat loss, urbanization threatens biodiversity. Its adverse effects may be mitigated by urban parks, in which conditions that promote structural and functional biodiversity contribute to preserve ecosystem processes. Therefore, deep knowledge of urban park biodiversity and of patterns driving species assemblages is required, especially for soil communities which are understudied. This study, conducted in public parks in Montpellier (Southern France), is the first one examining the impact of landscape patterns on Collembola communities. Moreover, soil abiotic properties were analyzed to examine how local factors drive species assemblages in different landscape types. The results of the study highlighted that Collembola community structure is affected by landscape patterns. Specifically, Collembola communities with species-abundance structures typical of late successional stages were found within woody landscapes, whereas those with early successional stage structures were observed in wide turf patches surrounded by other vegetation covers. When turf patches become small and isolated, homogenization was observed in Collembola community composition. From the perspective of urban park planning, managers should consider limiting landscape fragmentation (i.e. interspersion and configuration of impervious surfaces) and preserving landscape diversity (especially through woody vegetation patches). These may promote the development of diverse and structured Collembola communities, indicators of the overall soil quality.

   The occurrence and abundance of plant species were recorded in 2003 along transects in 66 settlements in a region north of Frankfurt/Main (Germany). The transect routes had been established in an earlier study in 1974-81. We used ordinations to analyse species composition, fitting 10 independent variables to explain the main gradient in species composition. Additionally, socio-economic styles (derived from interviews of 1359 households) were fitted, to analyse the influence of these on plant communities. Finally, we analysed species richness by calculating independent contributions of the variables using hierarchical partitioning.
   Many species of neophytes have expanded their range since the 1974-81 survey, but this was not associated with a general decline of archaeophytes and natives. The main variation of species composition was along a rural to urban gradient, associated with site conditions and with socio-economic factors that vary from settlements dominated by households rooted in the local community to settlements characterized by a mobile new middle class. For neophytes, variables describing the connection to Frankfurt (distance or connectivity) were most important in predicting species richness. For archaeophytes, the data showed a positive relationship between species richness and increasing herbicide application.
   These results suggest that the occurrence of neophytes within settlements along the urban-rural gradient is triggered by dispersal, related to human mobility patterns. In contrast, the occurrence of archaeophytes in settlements is determined by disturbance-related factors that predominantly depend on traditional gardening practices and weed control practices associated with farming.

AB  - The aim of the study was (1) to describe the biodiversity of the sphingid assemblage in a Cerrado area in the Triangulo Mineiro region, south-east of Brazil; (2) to evaluate the seasonal variations in species composition; (3) to compare the faunistic relationships between the Cerrado biome and adjacent ecosystems; and (4) to analyse the biogeographical pattern of species distribution in the Neotropical region in a historical context.
   Panga Ecological Station (PES), 30 km south of the city of Uberlandia, and other areas of the Triangulo Mineiro region, Minas Gerais state, south-eastern Brazil.
   Moth richness and abundance were monitored monthly at the PES from August 2003 to July 2004, with additional collections at this locality in 2001/2002, 2005 and 2006. Complementary moth richness and abundance data were also collected in other areas of the Triangulo Mineiro region. All collections were made using light traps, and the hawkmoths were mounted and identified. Cluster analysis, rarefaction curves and estimators of total species richness were used to compare the Cerrado hawkmoth assemblage with assemblages derived from other surveys in the Neotropics.
   In total, 61 hawkmoth species were recorded for the study region and their occurrence was markedly seasonal. The hawkmoth assemblage in the study area presented the closest similarity with rain forest areas and with a tropical dry forest area in Central America. The area shared species with both rain forest and seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) ecosystems, including supposedly endemic species previously recorded only in the latter areas. Rarefaction curves and estimators of the total number of species showed species richness to be comparable with other highly diverse forest areas in the Neotropics, such as the Brazilian Amazon and Costa Rica.
   This short-term study is the first systematic survey of hawkmoths in the Cerrado. It has recorded around 22% of the South American fauna and highlighted the high species richness of the region, which compares favourably with that in other rain forest ecosystems. The survey indicates high regional diversity, and has shown that the Cerrado harbours a hawkmoth fauna comprising both rain forest elements, probably distributed along humid gallery forest corridors, and SDTF elements, supporting the idea of a historical Pleistocene arc connecting the Caatinga domain and other seasonal dry forest areas across the Cerrado region.

AB  - Predicting species distribution is of fundamental importance for ecology and conservation. However, distribution models are usually established for only one region and it is unknown whether they can be transferred to other geographical regions. We studied the distribution of six amphibian species in five regions to address the question of whether the effect of landscape variables varied among regions. We analysed the effect of 10 variables extracted in six concentric buffers (from 100 m to 3 km) describing landscape composition around breeding ponds at different spatial scales. We used data on the occurrence of amphibian species in a total of 655 breeding ponds. We accounted for proximity to neighbouring populations by including a connectivity index to our models. We used logistic regression and information-theoretic model selection to evaluate candidate models for each species.
   Switzerland.
   The explained deviance of each species' best models varied between 5% and 32%. Models that included interactions between a region and a landscape variable were always included in the most parsimonious models. For all species, models including region-by-landscape interactions had similar support (Akaike weights) as models that did not include interaction terms. The spatial scale at which landscape variables affected species distribution varied from 100 m to 1000 m, which was in agreement with several recent studies suggesting that land use far away from the ponds can affect pond occupancy.
   Different species are affected by different landscape variables at different spatial scales and these effects may vary geographically, resulting in a generally low transferability of distribution models across regions. We also found that connectivity seems generally more important than landscape variables. This suggests that metapopulation processes may play a more important role in species distribution than habitat characteristics.

AB  - As the rate of urbanization continues to increase globally, a growing body of research is emerging that investigates how urbanization shapes the movement-and consequent gene flow-of species in cities. Of particular interest are native species that persist in cities, either as small relict populations or as larger populations of synanthropic species that thrive alongside humans in new urban environments. In this study, we used genomic sequence data (SNPs) and spatially explicit individual-based analyses to directly compare the genetic structure and patterns of gene flow in two small mammals with different dispersal abilities that occupy the same urbanized landscape to evaluate how mobility impacts genetic connectivity. We collected 215 white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and 380 big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) across an urban-to-rural gradient within the Providence, Rhode Island (U.S.A.) metropolitan area (population =1,600,000 people). We found that mice and bats exhibit clear differences in their spatial genetic structure that are consistent with their dispersal abilities, with urbanization having a stronger effect on Peromyscus mice. There were sharp breaks in the genetic structure of mice within the Providence urban core, as well as reduced rates of migration and an increase in inbreeding with more urbanization. In contrast, bats showed very weak genetic structuring across the entire study area, suggesting a near-panmictic gene pool likely due to the ability to disperse by flight. Genetic diversity remained stable for both species across the study region. Mice also exhibited a stronger reduction in gene flow between island and mainland populations than bats. This study represents one of the first to directly compare multiple species within the same urban-to-rural landscape gradient, an important gap to fill for urban ecology and evolution. Moreover, here we document the impacts of dispersal capacity on connectivity for native species that have persisted as the urban landscape matrix expands.

AB  - Early and late successional stages of forest edge development were studied across long, complex environmental gradients in order to disentangle and assess the woody species composition and functional traits' relations to abiotic and biotic environmental characteristics at site and landscape scale. Data were sampled from 78 randomly stratified locations along a 610-km railway corridor between the cities of Stockholm and Malmo, Sweden, and subsequently analysed in multiple steps of unconstrained, constrained and partial constrained ordination and variation partitioning. Different analytical methods were applied at each step and only the environmental characteristics that repeatedly showed significant impacts on woody species composition were selected for analysis of average weighted community traits to provide verification and a more detailed understanding. Following this approach, 10 environmental characteristics were identified as decisive for the woody species composition of the forest edges. The variation partitioning revealed a marked shift in the relative explanatory power of the environmental variables in relation to the succession of the forest edges. In the early successional stage, the abiotic variables related to site productivity (as reflected by field layer type and soil moisture) and climate (humidity and altitude) dominate, while in the late successional stages of forest edges more complex patterns evolved due to hierarchical and dynamic filter effects, where biotic variables reflecting structural aspects at site (forest edge profile, canopy stratification and canopy cover) and landscape (forest continuity and the shape and contrast of edges in the surrounding landscape) level were equally important as the abiotic variables. We concluded that management efforts in early succession stages of forest edges should depart from basic abiotic gradients of site fertility and moisture; and that it is crucial to incorporate vegetation structure variables at site and landscape level into long-term management planning.

AB  - In coastal southern California, natural riparian corridors occur in a landscape mosaic comprised of human land uses (mainly urban and suburban development) interspersed among undeveloped areas, primarily native shrublands. We asked, does the composition of the landscape surrounding a riparian survey point influence plant species distribution, community composition, or habitat structure? We expected, for example, that invasive non-native species might be more abundant as the amount of surrounding urbanization increased. We surveyed 137 points in riparian vegetation in Orange County, California, along an urbanization gradient. Using logistic regression we analyzed 79 individual plant species' distributions, finding 20 negatively associated and 12 positively associated with the amount of development within a 1-km radius around the survey points, even after accounting for the effects of elevation. However, after summarizing plant community composition with Detrended Correspondence Analysis we observed that, overall, community composition was not statistically correlated with the amount of development surrounding a survey point once the association between development and elevation was taken into account. Non-native species were not particularly associated with increasing development, but instead were distributed throughout vegetation and urbanization gradients. However, the extent of the tree and herb layers (structural attributes) was associated with development, with the tree layer increasing and the herb layer decreasing as urbanization increased. Thus, although the degree of surrounding urbanization appears to influence the distribution of a number of individual plant species, overall composition of the community in our study system seemed relatively unaffected. Instead, we suggest that community composition reflected larger-scale environmental conditions, such as stream order and other variables associated with elevation, and/or regional-scale disturbances, such as historic grazing or enhanced atmospheric deposition of nitrogen.

AB  - The Neotropics harbor between 30-50% of the world's herpetofauna. However, little is known about the ecology and natural history of many species, making conservation strategies difficult to plan. After reviewing published papers on world herpetofauna conservation, it was shown that conservation biology has a low impact factor in scientific journals in comparison with other related disciplines such as evolutionary biology and ecology. Moreover, herpetology has one of the lowest impact factors within the biological sciences journals. The number of publications on amphibian and reptile conservation has increased in recent years; however, only 31% of the papers on herpetofaunal conservation have been published in high impact journals. There are many challenges to overcome in the conservation of the Neotropical herpetofauna. Uniform and stable taxonomic nomenclature is critical to avoid overestimation of species richness and diversity for conservation assessments, and in the context of legal proceedings. Herpetofaunal research needs to be conducted within the appropriate socio-political and economic framework, in order to effectively implement conservation area networks. It is important to reevaluate the role of protected area systems in ensuring the persistence of communities and populations, and to identify strategies and future conservation priorities, based on climate-change scenarios. Population and community studies at different spatial and temporal scales are necessary to understand herpetofauna responses to anthropogenic disturbances, habitat loss and fragmentation, edge and matrix effects, and their synergy with micro-climatic gradients, emergent diseases and shifting patterns of genetic diversity. One of the biggest challenges for herpetofaunal conservation science in the neotropics is to control habitat loss and increase landscape connectivity along altitudinal gradients, while at the same time control species invasion that alter native species' interactions and spread emergent diseases (e.g. Chytridiomycosis) facilitated by climate change.

AB  - The biogeographical relationships between far-separated populations, in particular, those in the mainland and islands, remain unclear for widespread species in eastern Asia where the current distribution of plants was greatly influenced by the Quaternary climate. Deciduous Oriental oak (Quercus variabilis) is one of the most widely distributed species in eastern Asia. In this study, leaf material of 528 Q. variabilis trees from 50 populations across the whole distribution (Mainland China, Korea Peninsular as well as Japan, Zhoushan and Taiwan Islands) was collected, and three cpDNA intergenic spacer fragments were sequenced using universal primers. A total of 26 haplotypes were detected, and it showed a weak phylogeographical structure in eastern Asia populations at species level, however, in the central-eastern region of Mainland China, the populations had more haplotypes than those in other regions, with a significant phylogeographical structure (N-ST = 0.751 > G(ST) = 0.690, P < 0.05). Q. variabilis displayed high interpopulation and low intrapopulation genetic diversity across the distribution range. Both unimodal mismatch distribution and significant negative Fu's F-S indicated a demographic expansion of Q. variabilis populations in East Asia. A fossil calibrated phylogenetic tree showed a rapid speciation during Pleistocene, with a population augment occurred in Middle Pleistocene. Both diversity patterns and ecological niche modelling indicated there could be multiple glacial refugia and possible bottleneck or founder effects occurred in the southern Japan. We dated major spatial expansion of Q. variabilis population in eastern Asia to the last glacial cycle(s), a period with sea-level fluctuations and land bridges in East China Sea as possible dispersal corridors. This study showed that geographical heterogeneity combined with climate and sea-level changes have shaped the genetic structure of this wide-ranging tree species in East Asia.

AB  - Aims Riparian corridors play vital roles in the maintenance of biodiversity. Nonetheless, plant species diversity and vegetation coverage in riparian corridors are seriously threatened by increasing pressure owing to livestock consumption and anthropogenic disturbance; even the stability of river courses has been threatened. The establishment of enclosures is a widely used strategy to restore degraded grassland ecosystems, but its impact on degraded herbaceous riparian vegetation and soil properties remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether species composition, richness, diversity, and soil properties can be recovered by the enclosure.
   Methods Twenty long-term monitoring sample plots were set in the Liaohe main stream river, Liaohe main stream river was enclosed for grazing and farmland exclusion in 2012. The height, coverage and individual numbers of plant were recorded for species richness and diversity evaluation from 2012 to 2017; soil nutrients were measured for comparative analysis in 2012 and 2017. We examined the effects of the establishment of enclosures on plant species diversity and soil properties from 2012 to 2017 in the riparian corridors of the Liaohe River system in China.
   Important Findings Plant species richness and diversity significantly increased from 2012 to 2017. The dominance of Asteraceae plants increased, while the abundance of Gramineae plants decreased over time. The difference in abundance increased each year since enclosure was implemented in 2012. The concentrations of phosphorus and potassium in the soil significantly decreased as a result of the combined effects of vegetation restoration and prohibition of farming practices following the establishment of enclosures. There was also a lag time related to the response of soil organic matter to the establishment of enclosures. In conclusion, our study provides new evidence regarding the response of species diversity, species composition and soil properties following riparian vegetation restoration efforts through enclosure development.

AB  - Aim A long history of isolation coupled with complex landscapes makes Madagascar ideal for exploring the historical factors that have shaped patterns of population diversity and endemism. Many species-level studies have suggested Late Quaternary climate change may have influenced population dynamics in the tropics, but unique biomes and individual species properties may have driven idiosyncratic responses to these shifts. Here, we use community-scale population genetic data to investigate the impact of Quaternary climate cycles on shared demographic response and investigate the contributions of both biotic and abiotic factors which shape these demographic trajectories. Location Madagascar. Taxon Reptiles and Amphibians. Methods Using community-scale population genetic data, we implement a hierarchical approximate Bayesian computation approach to evaluate the degree of synchronous population expansion during glacial cycles across herpetofaunal assemblages both within and across discrete biomes and taxonomic groups. We use Bayesian model averaging to identify intrinsic and extrinsic conditions predictive of individualistic demographic change. Results We find that demographic responses are not uniform across groups, with more than 50% of all populations showing signal of recent expansion. Our explanatory models indicate species occupying narrow elevational ranges had a higher probability of expansion, while amphibian assemblages showed higher genetic diversity and greater departures from population neutrality. Expansion events were largely asynchronous, with coexpansion found in less than half of all populations. Exceptionally, 69%-74% of all humid-restricted populations coexpanded during the start of the Last Glacial Period at around 100 kya, supporting the hypothesis of a more extensive humid forest cover for Madagascar during this time. Main conclusions We show that differences in life history and regional biogeography have contributed to patterns of richness and endemism found across Madagascar, and historical connectivity across humid forests has been an important factor in shaping present-day diversity and endemism on Madagascar, particularly for amphibians.

AB  - Context Structural and functional connectivity, as subconcepts of landscape connectivity, are key factors in biodiversity conservation and management. Previous studies have focused on the consequences of connectivity for populations of terrestrial organisms, which may not be appropriate for aquatic organisms. Objectives As landscape connectivity critically affects the potential value of ponds for biodiversity, here we used diving beetles (Dytiscidae), an indicator taxon of wetland biodiversity, to investigate how structural connectivity affects functional connectivity to aquatic invertebrates in an urban landscape. Methods We assessed pairwise similarities of dytiscid community, i.e. the variation of species composition between clustered and isolated ponds in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland. We investigated how dytiscid community similarity is affected by Euclidean distances between ponds, as an indicator of structural connectivity. Results We found that clustered ponds shared more species than isolated ponds. Dytiscid species community similarity responded negatively to increasing Euclidean distance between ponds. Effectively dispersing species were widely distributed across the landscape, while poor dispersers were scarcely distributed in the same landscape. Conclusions Structural connectivity determines which species are able to disperse successfully, with poor dispersers restricted to well-connected ponds. The different responses of effective dispersers and poor dispersers to the same structural connectivity indicate that functional connectivity determines species composition. We recommend providing well-connected aquatic habitats in urban landscapes and the implementation of measures to reduce isolation of wetland assemblages. Even clustered ponds need dispersal from other habitats to ensure their contribution to urban biodiversity.

AB  - Areas within the rainforests of south-west Tasmania, home to Aboriginal tribes for more than 36,000 years, were dramatically changed in the late 1800s with the arrival of European prospectors. Subsequent large-scale mining and smelting operations resulted in acid rain, local deforestation and extensive soil erosion. Much of the area is now bare rock. The aims of this study were to examine the terrestrial and lacustrine responses to industrial acidification and deforestation as revealed by a sediment core from 'Owen Tarn', a small cirque lake down-wind of the mining town of Queenstown, and adjacent to a World Heritage Area. Terrestrial responses were investigated using pollen analysis to document both the state of the rainforest before and after the arrival of the Europeans. Limnological responses were documented by examining changes in diatom communities in the core. Results show both the terrestrial vegetation and the aquatic microscopic vegetation have been considerably modified by mining activities in the last 100 years. Pollen analysis provides a chronology of industrial deforestation and diatom analysis shows changes in species composition and a decline in species richness. Indirect ordination (PCA) of sediment diatom assemblages in the core with autecological data from 76 Tasmanian highland lakes (TASDIAT) reveals that diatom assemblages in the bottom parts of the core are analogous to those of Tasmanian oligotrophic 'corridor lakes' while recent species assemblages are similar to those of acidic Tasmanian 'western lakes'. Although a number of 'cosmopolitan' species indicative of lake acidification in the northern hemisphere are present in Owen Tarn, acidification has resulted in a different species response. In the most recent sediments the assemblage is dominated by Eunotia species in which valve deformation is manifest. These are a possible response to chemical stress. Lower abundances of deformed diatoms occur in the surface sediments and there is an increase in pollen from herbaceous taxa which reflects the revegetation of the catchment. Both responses are consistent first signs of recovery of the lake and revegetation of the catchment following the cessation of smelting activities in 1969. The most recent diatom assemblages in Owen Tarn (top 1.5 cm) resemble those of L. Spicer and L. Dora in the nearby Tyndall range. It cannot be excluded that these, and other lakes in the World Heritage Area, may have experienced some degree of ecological change as a result of long-range pollution from historic smelting activities.

AB  - The federally-threatened Preble's meadow jumping mouse (Zapus hudsonius preblei) occurs in riparian zones located along the foothills and plains in the Front Range of Colorado and Wyoming. Anthropogenic and natural disturbances have extensively modified Front Range riparian ecosystems affecting the location, quality, and connectivity ofZ. h. prebleipopulations and habitat. Previous studies suggest that specific microhabitat conditions influenceZ. h. prebleioccurrence but no landscape-scale assessments have been conducted. To support conservation and management, we assessedZ. h. prebleihabitat in Boulder County, Colorado by mapping riparian land cover composition, creating species distribution models (SDM), and evaluating connectivity between suitable habitat and knownZ. h. prebleipopulations. The SDM identified 5381 ha of suitableZ. h. prebleihabitat, compared with 252 ha of knownZ. h. prebleioccupied habitat. We found limited connections betweenZ. h. prebleipopulations in different watersheds, as urban development and large expanses of agricultural land disrupt connectivity. Our modeling approach yielded outcomes that are broadly relevant to understanding the distribution and management of geographically restricted species impacted by habitat loss and has provided insight intoZ. h. prebleihabitat and connectivity that cannot be gathered from field work alone.

AB  - Riparian habitats are important sites for avian conservation in western North America. These sites are also places of increasing human exploitation due to water availability and vegetation composition. Degradation and habitat patchiness of these systems may cause declines in avian species that are obligate breeders or use these habitats as corridors during migration. Our objective was to examine species composition and diversity of birds inhabiting a patchy Mesquite landscape in central Mexico. The study was conducted in the Salado River watershed in the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Biosphere Reserve. We conducted bird censuses using circular plot surveys in four zones of similar size differing mainly in proximity to town. We compared bird presence and density with plant coverage and density measured at the same points. We recorded 80 bird species, 53.6% of which were winter migrants. The four zones studied were not statistically different in bird species composition but differed in bird densities. Points counted inside the zones differed in bird densities and were positively correlated with plant density. The study site can be considered important for bird conservation due to its bird species richness, migratory species found exclusively in riparian habitat, and the presence of resident endemic species that breed in the area. Vegetation clearance that involves partial reduction of plants can represent a threat to bird conservation in the area. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The movement of wildlife can be constrained by river development projects owing to the presence of artificial structures. This study analyzes the spatial riparian crossing patterns of two mammal species, the leopard cat (Felis bengalensis euptilura) and water deer (Hydropotes inermis). We examine their ability to traverse from habitat on one side of the river to the other, through riparian vegetation, embankments, and the river,. We used 34 months of monitoring on 104 stream segments with varying levels of human modification on the Seom river, South Korea, to analyze their riparian crossing preferences across the river between suitable habitats on either side of the steam. Environmental variables were used for two scales of analysis: a watershed scale and a stream segment scale that examined both riparian habitat suitability and riparian crossings. At the watershed scale, habitat suitability was determined using species distribution modeling. The resulting maps were inputted with other predictor variables to logistic regression models to predict areas of high probability for the species' occurences. For the river segment analyses, we determined species' presences and potential crossings from snow tracking, heat sensor cameras, and scat. We compared the predicted crossing locations from the watershed scale model to observed crossings. The watershed models indicate that leopard cats prefer upland forest, while water deer prefer the forest edge and riparian corridor. For both target species, the best riparian habitats were characterized by the presence of vegetation cover on the embankment and by at least one side of an embankment being adjacent to farmland or forest cover. The two species showed different riparian crossing preferences. Water deer crossed through large culverts or under bridges, whereas leopard cats utilized drainage pipes and smaller culvert boxes. Stream reaches located close to a river tributary had the highest connectivity values, and areas modeled as good habitats were linked near riparian and watershed areas with high density for both species as well as culvert boxes with a high openness ratio. Artifacts such as steep banks, concrete embankments, and adjacent roads were found to degrade the riparian connectivity of wildlife. These outcomes can be used to identify suitable riparian wildlife habitats of mammals, to evaluate lateral connectivity of riparian corridors for mammals, and to develop criteria for river conservation and restoration in urbanizing areas and developing countries.

AB  - Roadsides are preferential migration corridors for invasive plant species and can act as starting points for plant invasions into adjacent habitats. Rapid spread and interrupted distribution patterns of introduced plant species indicate long-distance dispersal along roads. The extent to which this process is due to species' migration along linear habitats or alternatively, to seed transport by vehicles has not yet been tested systematically. We tested this by sampling seeds inside long motorway tunnels to exclude nontraffic dispersal. Vehicles transported large amounts of seeds. The annual seed rain caused by vehicles on the roadsides of five different tunnel lanes within three tunnels along a single urban motorway in Berlin, Germany, ranged from 635 to 1579 seeas/m(2)/year Seeds of non-native species accounted for 50.0% of the 204 species and 54.4% of the total 11,818 seeds trapped inside the tunnels. Among the samples were 39 (19.1%) highly invasive species that exhibit detrimental effects on native biodiversity in some parts of the world. By comparing the flora in the tunnel with that adjacent to the tunnel entrances we confirmed long-distance dispersal events (>250 m) for 32.3% of the sampled species. Seed sources in a radius of 100 m around the entrances of the tunnels had no significant effect on species richness and species composition of seed samples from inside the tunnels, indicating a strong effect of long-distance dispersal by vehicles. Consistently, the species composition of the tunnel seeds was more similar to the regional roadside flora of Berlin than to the local flora around the tunnel entrances. Long-distance dispersal occurred significantly more frequently in seeds of non-native (mean share 38.5%) than native species (mean share 4.1%). Our results showed that long-distance dispersal by vehicles was a routine rather than an occasional mechanism. Dispersal of plants by vehicles will thus accelerate plant invasions and induce rapid changes in biodiversity patterns.

AB  - Regularly managed electric power line corridors may provide habitats for both early-successional grassland plant species and disturbance-dependent alien plant species. These habitats are especially important in urban areas, where they can help conserve native grassland species and communities in urban greenspace. However, they can also provide further footholds for potentially invasive alien species that already characterize urban areas. In order to implement power line corridors into urban conservation, it is important to understand which environmental conditions in the corridors favor grassland species and which alien species. Likewise it is important to know whether similar environmental factors in the corridors control the species composition of the two groups. We conducted a vegetation study in a 43 kilometer long urban power line corridor network in south-western Finland, and used generalized linear models and distance-based redundancy analysis to determine which environmental factors best predict the occurrence and composition of grassland and alien plant species in the corridors. The results imply that old corridors on dry soils and steep slopes characterized by a history as open areas and pastures are especially suitable for grassland species. Corridors suitable for alien species, in turn, are characterized by productive soils and abundant light and are surrounded by a dense urban fabric. Factors controlling species composition in the two groups are somewhat correlated, with the most important factors including light abundance, soil moisture, soil calcium concentration and soil productivity. The results have implications for grassland conservation and invasive alien species control in urban areas.

AB  - The Australian mesic biome spans c. 33 degrees of latitude along Australia's east coast and ranges and is dissected by historical and contemporary biogeographical barriers. To investigate the impact of these barriers on evolutionary diversification and to predict the impact of future climate change on the distribution of species and genetic diversity within this biome, we inferred phylogenetic relationships within the Dendrobium speciosum complex (Orchidaceae) across its distribution and undertook environmental niche modelling (ENM) under past, contemporary and projected future climates.
   Neighbor Joining tree inference, NeighborNet and STRUCTURE analyses of Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) profiles for D. speciosum sampled from across its distribution showed that the complex consists of two highly supported main groups that are geographically separated by the St. Lawrence gap, an area of dry sclerophyll forest and woodland. The presence of several highly admixed individuals identified by the STRUCTURE analysis provided evidence of genetic exchange between the two groups across this gap. Whereas previous treatments have recognised between one to eleven species, the molecular results support the taxonomic treatment of the complex as a single species with two subspecies.
   The ENM analysis supported the hypothesis that lineage divergence within the complex was driven by past climatic changes. The St. Lawrence gap represented a stronger biogeographic barrier for the D. speciosum complex during the cool and dry glacial climatic conditions of the Pleistocene than under today's interglacial conditions. Shallow genetic divergence was found within the two lineages, which mainly corresponded to three other biogeographic barriers: the Black Mountain Corridor, Glass House Mountains and the Hunter Valley. Our ENM analyses provide further support for the hypothesis that biogeographic barriers along Australia's east coast were somewhat permeable to genetic exchange due to past episodic range expansions and contractions caused by climatic change resulting in recurrent contact between previously isolated populations. An overall southward shift in the distribution of the complex under future climate scenarios was predicted, with the strongest effects on the northern lineage. This study contributes to our understanding of the factors shaping biodiversity patterns in Australia's mesic biome.

AB  - Fragmentation is a critical issue for tree populations because the creation of small patches can reduce local population size and increase isolation, both of which can promote inbreeding and its negative consequences, as well as loss of genetic diversity. To test the hypothesis that patch size and isolation influence mating patterns or seed production in forest trees, we utilize the spatial array of trees of an urban population of Chinese Pine (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr.) planted in patches around Beijing. Our design includes 28 urban patches, with patch size ranging from 1 to 2000 adult trees and isolation (edge distance index) ranging from 37.5 m to 245.8 m. We examined the average number of seeds per cone and percentage of viable seed per cone for each patch as measures of seed production. By utilizing seven paternally inherited chloroplast microsatellite loci, we estimated the mating pattern parameters for each patch, including the level of selling, the amount of immigrant pollen and the effective number of pollen sources (N-ep). Using a general linear model selection procedure based on AIC value, we found patch size was the best predictor of the selling and immigration rate; smaller patches had a higher selfing and immigration rate. Small patches with one adult had relatively high Nep which indicates connectivity among urban patches. However, due to the reduced amount of immigrant pollen and limited diversity of local pollen, intermediate sized patches (with 5-10 adults) had the lowest N-ep among the study patches. For patches with more than 10 adults, Nep was increased with patch size. The percentage of viable seeds per cone significantly decreased with patch size, indicating a possible negative consequence of inbreeding. The effect of patch size on mating patterns and seed production suggests that the patches of trees experience less connectivity than trees within continuous forest. These findings indicate that forest management practices should emphasize the maintenance of an optimal patch size because, despite the fact that tree species show the potential for long distance pollen movement, the number of local trees strongly influences the mating patterns.

AB  - In order to assess macrophyte organisation processes and patterns, with particular reference to corridor effects and connectivity, macrophyte distributions and floristic assemblages were studied within a whole brook system divided into 208 consectutive 50-m-long units in summer.  The results were compared with four 5-m-long plots of the downstream part of the brook, and with 196 stations located on the river basin.
   Four main types of longitudinal distribution were emphasised:  macrophytes could be upstream-specific or - tolerant, downstream-specific, -tolerant or mainly downstream, ubiquitous or confined to one tributary.  The ecological tendencies of some macrophytes were pointed out from ecological profiles.  Vegetational groups were determined by correspondence analysis:  sunny upstream areas were dominated by heliophilous vascular spring hydrophytes while shaded upstream areas were characterised by aquatic bryophytes; in the larger downstream brooks, three layers were observed:  helophytes, vascular rheophytes and aquatic bryophytes.
   The comparison with the two other levels showed how mapping was useful to emphasise species distribution.  A possible misinterpretation of macrophyte ecology was pointed out when studing ecological profiles in a particular brook versus a stratified sampling on the river basin.  The intermediate position of the brook in regard to the general typology of the river watercourse, and also its particularities due to general eutrophication of main course were shown.  Then the relationships between the species distribution and the levels of organisation or human management were discussed and placed within the topics of fluvial corridor functioning, connectedness and connectivity.  The use of other concepts such as ecotones, river continuum concept or functional sectors in hydrosystems was then attempted to understand some distribution and organisation features, and to forecast further research.

AB  - This research aimed to disentangle the role of the connectivity gradient as a dispersal and environmental filter. This was done by comparing community composition and plant strategies (i.e. competition, stress-tolerance and ruderal) in the soil seedbank (SSB) to that in the standing vegetation (SV). The study took place in a disconnecting side channel of the Loire River (France). SV was recorded in-situ and SSB was analyzed using the seedling emergence method. Seedbank density was 512.80 (SD = 329.43) seeds per m(2), species richness was similar in SSB and SV (42 and 43, respectively), and overall Sorensen similarity between both compartments was 0.45. Species composition in the soil seed bank differed between banks and thalweg while in SV it differed moreover along the side channel. With regard to Grime's C-S-R strategies, ruderal strategy dominated in the SSB, while environmental filters favored stress-tolerators in the SV. Usual indicators in seedbank studies (species richness, density and similarity) were inefficient to describe processes. Results moreover highlighted the prevalence of lotic over lentic conditions in structuring seedbanks and standing vegetation.

AB  - The conversion of natural lands in urban areas is exponentially increasing worldwide, causing a major decline in biodiversity. Environmental alterations caused by urbanization, such as land conversion and isolation of natural patches, favour tolerant and generalist species, causing both species loss and replacement. In addition, selective pressure is exerted on particular functionaltraits, driving a functional homogenization or turnover of biotic communities. We sampled ground arthropods within the municipality of Turin (NW-Italy), wherein an isolated and a connected control subplot were repeatedly sampled at 15 stations distributed along a gradient of increasing urbanization. Such a nested sampling design allowed us to investigate the taxonomic and the functional responses of carabids and spiders to both the urbanization level and patch isolation. First, we highlighted the dominant role played by species homogenization (nestedness) in explaining both taxonomic and functional variation in both groups of arthropods. Secondly, we showed that urbanization causes simultaneously functional homogenization and replacement in both carabid and spider assemblages, whereas patch isolation influences carabid species composition and homogenizes and shifts spider taxonomic and functional composition. Lastly, by relating community-weighted means of body length, dispersal capacity and trophic strategy to the urbanization and isolation gradients, we demonstrated that urbanization alters the trophic structure of both taxonomic groups and increases the average dispersal capacity of spiders. On the other hand, patch isolation affected the functional composition of spiders only, reducing the body size and increasing dispersal capacity and the proportion of web-builder species. Our results demonstrate that both urbanization and patch isolation alter species composition by causing functional and taxonomic homogenization. In addition, they exert a strong filtering effect on community functional traits, increasing the proportion of phytophagous species in carabids, and increasing dispersal capacity and web-builders occurrence in spiders, while reducing spider body size.

AB  - Urban green spaces (UGSs) are important elements of urban landscapes. Woody vegetation is a key component of UGSs, providing many socio-ecological benefits such as habitat provision and human well-being. Knowing plant diversity and vegetation configuration that underpin urban ecosystem processes and functions is critical to maximize nature contributions to city dwellers. Here, we present a well-replicated multi-city study showing a detailed description of taxonomic and structural diversity of woody vegetation in 225 UGSs distributed across seven European cities along a NE-SW gradient. Our aim was to understand how UGSs attributes, including size and fragmentation, influence woody vegetation features. A total of 418 woody species belonging to 76 families were identified. UGS size displayed weak positive correlations with woody species richness, but a strong negative correlation with woody species density. Alien woody species were abundant in all cities (from 40% of all species recorded in Antwerp to 64% in Lisbon and Zurich). Among the native tree species we found a predominance of Pinus spp. in southern cities and Acer spp. in cooler climates. On average, tree canopies extent was 56% of UGSs. This paper provides insights on the plant diversity and woody vegetation composition in UGSs of different size, climate and urban planning history. Our results encourage and contribute to future urban ecology studies involving different taxa and ecosystem services as well as support effective urban planning and management practices.

AB  - Urban sprawl has increased in Western Europe principally due to conversion of farmland areas, which has constrained remaining farmland to more intensive use. Urban densification aims to counteract urban sprawl; however, it threatens urban green spaces that act as sustainable alternative habitats for wildlife. In this study, we used the Common Redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus) as a model species to develop sustainable planning recommendations for urban green spaces. Using species distribution models (SDMs) in combinations with high-resolution predicting variables (2 x 2 m grid cell), we defined the suitable habitat of a Common Redstart territory in a moderately urbanized environment. We then predicted how the distribution would be affected under realistic scenarios of land-use modification (termed conservation scenario and threat scenario) in an effort to provide recommendations for urban green space planning. Tree canopy cover was the principal land-cover type in the SDMs that explained the current species distribution followed by impervious surface and short-cut lawn. In the conservation scenario where tree canopy coverage was increased we predicted an increase in optimum habitat for the Common Redstart from 7% to 27% of the study area. In contrast, under a threat scenario based on urban densification, we predicted a decrease in the optimum habitat to only 4% of the study area. The SDMs results were used to highlight the importance of the suitable areas that have a predicted potential to conserve and promote an interconnected urban green space networks to maintain urban biodiversity.

AB  - With the increase in urban development, forest fragments are becoming more prevalent. In urban areas, there is a tendency to hide power-lines within or on the edges of these fragmented forests; however, it is unknown how the maintenance of vegetation under and along power-lines impacts the forest composition and structure of an adjacent fragmented, urban forest. An urban, fragmented maple-oak-hickory forest is located on the Meredith College campus, Raleigh, NC. A 1-ha plot with a hundred 10- x 10-m subplots was established in 2007 to initiate a long-term project supporting undergraduate research. An adjacent meadow is cut and maintained regularly up to the forest and plot edge for power-line clearance and access. We identified, tagged, and measured all of the trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 5 cm in this permanent plot, and compared the tree species richness (S), Shannon-Weiner diversity index (H), Sorenson's similarity index (Ss), DBH, stem density, and basal area along the 100-m gradient from the forest edge. We also used a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) analysis to describe how species composition changed along the gradient. Our findings showed that S, H, and Ss did not change along the 100-m gradient. The NMS confirmed that species composition was not different in the edge subplots (0-10 m from edge) compared to all other subplots and therefore was not impacted by continual, local disturbance along forest edges. However, we found that forest structure changed along the gradient with the exception of mean DBH; stem density and total basal area varied along the 100-m gradient. There was greater stem density along the edge of the forest (0-5 m and 10-20 m from edge) compared to the other interior subplots. Some of the interior subplots (10-20 m and 60-70 m from the edge) had a higher total basal area than the remaining plots. As expected, we also found that there was a negative linear relationship between DBH and stem density for all subplots. Our results confirm trends found in previous studies that community structure parameters (stand density and basal area) differ between forest edges and their respective forest interiors, but did not agree with previous research, which found species composition to be affected by edges. We believe the regular pruning of the forest edge adjacent to the power-lines explains our observed differences in forest structure, but tree species richness, diversity, similarity, and composition may be determined by the disturbance of larger-scale ecological processes. Our results show how power-line placement within a fragmented urban forest can affect the structure of the adjacent forest, and we recommend that the ecological effects of power-line corridors should be further investigated and incorporated into the larger body of literature on forest fragmentation.

AB  - Seoul's Cheonggye Stream Reconstruction Project removed the concrete road surface that had covered the stream basin for decades to allow sunlight to the stream, reconstructed the stream's channel, restored the surface flow of water by pumping water from the river's downstream to its upstream area, and reintroduced riparian vegetation. Although the project did not fulfill the conditions of ecological restoration, there were a few ecological effects that this project brought. The reconstructed Cheonggye stream has enhanced species diversity and decreased the percentage of exotic species compared to an unrestored urban stream. Also, the species composition of the reintroduced riparian vegetation of the Cheonggye stream has since grown to more closely resemble the natural reference streams, whereas dissimilar to the degraded urban reference site. The re-established vegetation has attracted numerous animal species, and thereby increasing the size and diversity of the biota from 17 species before reconstruction to approximately 400 species. Consequently, the naturalness of the reconstructed Cheonggye stream, as indicated by morphological and ecological characteristics, has improved markedly. In addition, the reconstruction project also improved the water quality, as reflected by the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). But the restoration of the Cheonggye stream is still underway and several requirements still need to be met to fully actualize true restoration. First, the river zone should be extended and linked to the surrounding terrestrial ecosystems to create an ecological network based on ecological information from the reference area. Second, more diverse microhabitats should be created within the waterway to support greater biodiversity. Flooding during the rainy season produces various microhabitats and human assistance can aid this natural occurrence. Finally, species composition and its spatial arrangement were focused on landscaping during the reconstruction; this approach should be changed to reflect the principles of ecological restoration.

AB  - We examined the biodiversity of urban habitats in Birmingham (England) using a combination of field surveys of plants and carabid beetles, genetic studies of four species of butterflies, modelling the anthropochorous nature of the floral communities and spatially explicit modelling of selected mammal species. The aim of the project was to: (i) understand the ecological characteristics of the biota of cities model, (ii) examine the effects of habitat fragment size and connectivity upon the ecological diversity and individual species distributions, (iii) predict biodiversity in cities, and (iv) analyse the extent to which the flora and fauna utilise the,urban greenways' both as wildlife corridors and as habitats in their own right. The results suggest that cities provide habitats for rich and diverse range of plants and animals, which occur sometimes in unlikely recombinant communities. The studies on carabids and butterflies illustrated the relative importance of habitat quality on individual sites as opposed to site location within the conurbation. This suggests that dispersal for most of our urban species is not a limiting factor in population persistence, although elements of the woodland carabid fauna did appear to have some geographical structuring. Theoretical models suggested that dormice and water voles may depend on linear habitats for dispersal. The models also indicated that other groups, such as small and medium sized mammals, may use corridors, although field-based research did not provide any evidence to suggest that plants or invertebrates use urban greenways for dispersal. This finding indicates the importance of identifying a target species or group of species for urban greenways intended as dispersal routeways rather than as habitat in their own right. Their importance for most groups is rather that greenways provide a chain of different habitats permeating the urban environment. We suggest that planners can have a positive impact on urban biodiversity by slowing the pace of redevelopment and by not hurrying to tidy up and redevelop brownfield sites. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Large-scale distribution models are effective predictors of habitat suitability and connectivity across broad landscapes and are useful management tools, though few large-scale species distribution models exist for medium-sized predators in urban landscapes. We modeled the potential distribution of 4 medium-sized predators in a 17,361-km(2) portion of the Chicago Metropolitan Area. We applied a maximum entropy algorithm model (MaxEnt) using presence-only data collected via remote cameras from 54 Lake County, Illinois, forest preserves during August-October 2008-2012. Environmental data layers used to model distributions were distances to forest, grassland, barren land, crops, wetlands, developed open space, developed low intensity, developed high intensity, water, primary roads, secondary roads, and tertiary roads. Coyotes (Canis latrans) had the greatest area of potential distribution followed by opossums (Didelphis virginiana), striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), and raccoons (Procyon lotor). Models for all species had high AUC values (0.90-0.94) indicating strong predictive performance. More than 50% of the study area was predicted to be within the distributional limit for each focal species. Distance to forest was the most important contributory predictor for all species modeled (82% - 96%) and higher probability of presence for all 4 species was indicated closer to forest and further from tertiary roads. However, coyotes and raccoons were predicted to prefer habitat closer to highly-developed areas. Our research indicates medium-sized predators are highly synanthropic and able to persist within the Chicago Metropolitan Area given adequate availability of non-urban land cover, particularly forest, and ample green space linking forest patches within highly-developed areas.

AB  - The world is becoming increasingly urban. Tools to support urban planning and management are necessary to reconcile needs to develop buildings, to ensure a high quality of life and to protect urban biodiversity. In this paper, we present a tool based on algorithms of Hellwig's method that can be used in decision-making processes concerning biodiversity management of urban green areas, e.g., identification of ecologically primary areas that should be protected from development, quantitative comparisons of various arrangements of urban green areas and identification of sites that can be built-up with the least loss of urban biodiversity. The tool has been tested with empirical data on species composition and abundance of small mammals in the city of Lublin, Poland (central Europe). We used small mammals as a bioindicators of the ecological significance of green areas. Our scenarios show that this method works well for untransformed species composition and species abundance data. Issues of the universality of the method, its ease of use and low cost, the possibility of use in decision-making process that includes public participation and the credibility of the data and are discussed.

AB  - Extensive landscape modification by humans has led to the fragmentation of riparian forests across North America. We compared the vegetation of extant riparian forest along an urban-rural disturbance gradient. In 1999, twenty-five sites along Assiniboine River in Manitoba, Canada were categorized according to land use: urban, suburban, high intensity rural, low intensity rural, and relatively high quality reference forest. Differences in herbaceous, shrub, and tree species composition and diversity were related to the proportion of surrounding land use, forest patch size, connectivity, and area:perimeter ratio. Urban riparian forests were more disturbed and isolated. They were smaller and characterized by drier, more alkaline soils. Moreover, they had significantly lower native and overall understorey species diversity, and had a higher proportion of exotics including Solanum dulcamara and Hesperis matronalis. Suburban forests were less disturbed, faced greater development pressure, and had sandier soils. Although suburban understorey diversity was similar to that of rural forests, suburban sites had a higher proportion of exotic species, especially escaped horticultural and invasive species including Caragana arborescens and Rhamnus cathartica. Reference sites were relatively large and exhibited greater connectivity, but there was little difference in species composition and diversity among high intensity rural, low intensity rural, and reference sites. These site types were less disturbed than either urban or suburban forests, and reference sites were characterized by hydrophilic species including Scirpus fluviatilis and Carex aquatilis. Our results suggest that landscape measures of disturbance, and related changes in environment, may be confidently used to assess impacts of land use on vegetation along urban-rural gradients.

   Objectives Characterize three key stages of invasion from the landscape scale distribution patterns for an invasive insect-Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri), and investigate the potential spatial variability in establishment and impact risk.
   Methods The study focuses on the recent invasion of D. citri in Southern California's urban landscape. We used a combination of spatiotemporal pattern analyses and species distribution models (SDMs) to characterize the introduction, establishment and impact of D. citri invasion.
   Results Diaphorina citri detections in relation to major roadways revealed that initial detections are significantly closer to major roads than later detections, suggesting that transportation corridors serve as introduction pathways. SDMs of D. citri establishment and impact potential using presence-(pseudo)absence and abundance revealed percent impervious surface as the best landscape predictor. Inclusion of prior D. citri detections as a lagged spatiotemporal effect improved both model fit and performance suggesting that small-scale dispersal events do matter. Interestingly, interpolated risk maps based on the predicted occurrence and abundance highlighted substantial spatial variability in D. citri establishment and impact risk.
   Conclusions Our study demonstrates how examining spatiotemporal patterns of an invasive species is useful in inferring key stages of the invasion, and how occurrence and abundance information can be leveraged to quantify variability in establishment and impact risk. The study thus provides a useful baseline in formulating effective landscape-level management actions.

AB  - The Mahogany Glider (Petaurus gracilis) is one of the most endangered marsupials in Australia. Its known distribution is an approximately 120 km strip of fragmented coastal woodland in north-east Queensland, from north of Townsville to the Tully area. Records are clustered in a number of well-surveyed areas, with significant areas of lowland habitat unsurveyed. Around 30% of historic records fall in areas that were subsequently cleared for farmland, and ongoing clearing and fragmentation of lowland sclerophyll forest continues within the potential distribution. Resolving the distribution is an urgent requirement to guide conservation but Mahogany Gliders are difficult to detect in the field. Species distribution modelling offers a technique for estimating the fine-scale distribution and for targeting further field survey and conservation efforts. We used known occurrence records (N = 481) to predict the distribution of Mahogany Gliders across the Wet Tropics bioregion. We used climatic, topographic and other environmental predictors to generate distribution models using Maxent and Random Forest algorithms, each with two bias correction methods. The predictions revealed that many unknown populations may exist within the currently defined distribution and in important areas beyond this (e.g. Hinchinbrook Island). There was reasonable congruence between models, and we include syntheses of the models to present the most likely current distribution. The most important predictor variables across the models were precipitation seasonality (high seasonality), elevation (generally <100 m), soil type (hydrosols) and vegetation type (including Eucalyptus and Melaleuca woodlands). Our results identify core habitat and reveal key areas that require targeted field surveys. Importantly, the predicted suitable habitat is highly fragmented and ongoing conservation efforts need to improve habitat connectivity and limit further fragmentation.

AB  - The impact of long-term high grazing pressure on geomorphological features, plant community composition and cover and soil characteristics of an ephemeral river system in Namaqualand, South Africa, was compared to that of lighter grazing pressure across fencelines which crossed the river system. Under heavy grazing the river system was less braided and a higher proportion of the river width was unvegetated runoff channels. The river system was generally dominated by very sandy soil. However, more silt and organic matter, and less sand were found in soil under plants growing in the river bed. Since vegetation cover was much higher under light grazing, river soil was more fertile when grazing was light. A plant species compositional shift when grazing pressure was high resulted in riparian vegetation which more closely resembled the surrounding rangelands. Graminoid growth forms were encountered more frequently in the lightly grazed river. A rest from grazing of 33 months resulted in increased plant cover in another section of the river system. Heavy grazing alters the physical and soil features of this river system by reducing plant cover. Riparian vegetation, by slowing flow rates and catching light soil particles increases landscape heterogeneity and creates productive sites in the landscape. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Throughout the Miocene, the African landscape underwent broad climatic shifts that profoundly influenced the distribution of fauna and flora. Since the late Miocene, these shifts have created a landscape in southern Africa that is strongly characterised by savanna and arid environments. Forests persist in small fragments, primarily in mountainous or heterogeneous landscapes. Arthroleptis wahlbergii is a small frog endemic to eastern South Africa that has presumed low dispersal ability. Because of its preference for forests, the dynamics of forests since the late Miocene in this region might have promoted diversification within A. wahlbergii. To investigate whether habitat fragmentation might have driven divergences among populations, we carried out species distribution modelling and population level and phylogenetic analyses using two genetic loci (16S, mitochondrial; RAG-1, nuclear) sequenced for 48 individuals from 14 forests across the c. 500 km range of this species. There is substantial population-level structuring within A. wahlbergii, however the structure does not relate to forest types or catchments. We instead propose that the structure is a result of dynamic and idiosyncratic changes in forest connectivity over the Pleistocene. We identified two geographically circumscribed clades, the northern of which corresponds to true A. wahlbergii. The southern clade corresponds to populations from which Arthroleptis wageri FitzSimons, 1930 was described. This has long been considered a synonym of A. wahlbergii, but our molecular phylogenetic and distribution modelling supports recognising A. wageri as a distinct species.

AB  - Increasing development of urban environments creates high pressure on green spaces with potential negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. There is growing evidence that green roofs - rooftops covered with vegetation - can contribute mitigate the loss of urban green spaces by providing new habitats for numerous arthropod species. Whether green roofs can contribute to enhance taxonomic and functional diversity and increase connectivity across urbanized areas remains, however, largely unknown. Furthermore, only limited information is available on how environmental conditions shape green roof arthropod communities. We investigated the community composition of arthropods (Apidae, Curculionidae, Araneae and Carabidae) on 40 green roofs and 40 green sites at ground level in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. We assessed how the site's environmental variables (such as area, height, vegetation, substrate and connectivity among sites) affect species richness and functional diversity using generalized linear models. We used an extension of co-inertia analysis (RLQ) and fourth-corner analysis to highlight the mechanism underlying community assemblages across taxonomic groups on green roof and ground communities. Species richness was higher at ground-level sites, while no difference in functional diversity was found between green roofs and ground sites. Green roof arthropod diversity increased with higher connectivity and plant species richness, irrespective of substrate depth, height and area of green roofs. The species trait analysis reviewed the mechanisms related to the environmental predictors that shape the species assemblages of the different taxa at ground and roof sites. Our study shows the important contribution of green roofs in maintaining high functional diversity of arthropod communities across different taxonomic groups, despite their lower species richness compared with ground sites. Species communities on green roofs revealed to be characterized by specific trait assemblages. The study also provides details on the environmental conditions that influence arthropod diversity and gives new perspectives on how the design of green roofs can be improved to increase their ecological value. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of integrating green roofs in planning policies which aim to enhance urban habitat connectivity.

AB  - Forest network development in urban areas faces the challenge from forest fragmentation, human-induced disturbances, and scarce land resources. Here, we proposed a geotechnology-based modeling to optimize conservation of forest network by a case study of Wuhan, China. The potential forest network and their priorities were assessed using an improved least-cost path model and potential utilization efficiency estimation. The modeling process consists of four steps: (i) developing species assemblages, (ii) identifying core forest patches, (iii) identifying potential linkages among core forest patches, and (iv) demarcating forest networks. As a result, three species assemblages, including mammals, pheasants, and other birds, were identified as the conservation targets of urban forest network (UFN) in Wuhan, China. Based on the geotechnology-based model, a forest network proposal was proposed to fulfill the connectivity requirements of selected species assemblages. The proposal consists of seven forest networks at three levels of connectivity, named ideal networks, backbone networks, and comprehensive network. The action priorities of UFN plans were suggested to optimize forest network in the study area. Additionally, a total of 45 forest patches with important conservation significance were identified as prioritized stepping-stone patches in the forest network development. Urban forest conserve was also suggested for preserving woodlands with priority conservation significance. The presented geotechnology-based modeling is fit for planning and optimizing UFNs, because of the inclusion of the stepping-stone effects, human-induced pressures, and priorities. The framework can also be applied to other areas after a sensitivity test of the model and the modification of the parameters to fit the local environment.

AB  - Species distribution data provide critical baseline information for conservation planning and decision making. However, in many of the Earth's most biodiverse regions, such data are lacking for many species. Here, we used ecological niche modeling and connectivity analyses to model distributions of endangered species and protected area connectivity across the Upper Guinea Forest (UGF) Global Conservation Hotspot of West Africa. We estimated the current distributions of African forest elephant Loxodonta cyclotis (Vulnerable), western chimpanzee Pan troglodytes verus (Critically Endangered), and pygmy hippopotamus Choeropsis liberiensis (Endangered) across the region and optimized connectivity in two main forest complexes in the region. We used occurrence data for the period 2010-2016 for the three species from two well-sampled national parks in Liberia (Sapo National Park and Gola National Park), and remotely sensed MODIS enhanced vegetation index data for the period 2010-2015. Our models predicted a total of 75,157km(2) of suitable habitat for chimpanzees in the region, 79,400km(2) for elephants, and 290,696km(2) for hippos. Of these areas, for chimpanzees, 30% of the area predicted falls within the boundaries of proposed or designated protected areas, and likewise 30% for elephants, and 19% for hippos. Liberia had the largest blocks of contiguous forest suitable for these species compared to other countries in the region but this forest was largely unprotected. This study identifies priority areas for biodiversity conservation and forest connectivity in the region, and reemphasizes the practicality of these tools to optimize conservation planning and implementation.

AB  - Environmental policies and the objective of no net loss highlight the importance of preserving ecological networks to limit the fragmentation of natural habitats and biodiversity loss, especially due to urbanization. In the environmental impact assessment context, habitat connectivity and the spatio-temporal dynamics of biodiversity are crucial to obtaining reliable predictions that can support decision-making. We propose a methodological framework 1) to quantify the overall impact of a development project on the functioning of an ecological network, and 2) to select the best locations for implanting new habitat patches intended to enhance landscape connectivity. The amount of reachable habitat concept was applied to three representative terrestrial mammal species: the red squirrel, the Eurasian badger and the European hedgehog. All three species are recognized as vulnerable to human pressures and potentially affected by the construction of a new stadium in our study site, Lyon (Southern France). The method combines the species distribution model Maxent with the landscape functional connectivity model Graphab. The results showed that using any one of the avoidance and reduction measures on its own was unsuccessful in achieving the objective of no net loss when habitat connectivity is considered. However, the combination of new habitat patches and corridors offered a higher gain than distinct measures. This is especially important in the short term, when new hedgerow plantations have not yet developed enough to be used by the target species. Our findings indicate, first, the need to take the temporal scale into account in environmental impact assessment. We also show that applying the optimal scenario, constructed using a cumulative patch addition followed by a similar process testing a set of potential land-use changes, maximizes habitat connectivity. Our methodology provides a useful tool to increase target species' habitat connectivity within the mitigation hierarchy and to enhance development project design for increased environmental efficiency.

AB  - Investigations on the ichthyofauna in the Vit River basin were carried out in 2007 and 2008 at 15 sampling points covering the Vit River itself and 5 tributaries in its upper stretch. Fish were sampled applying electricity according to the Standard EN14011. The results obtained were analyzed together with the data of earlier studies. Totally, 45 fish species were recorded in the basin of the Vit River until now. Twenty five of them are considered of conservation significance according to the referred national and international sources. Some of species are enlisted in several sources. Thus, 13 species are enlisted in the Bulgarian Biodiversity Act (Annexes 2 and 4), 14 are in the Bulgarian Red Data Book, 19 are in Bern Convention (Annex 3), 10 are in the IUCN Red List, and 14 are in the Habitat Directive (92/43/EEC). The most part of the Vit River basin is covered by 4 proposed protected areas of the NATURA'2000 National Network after the Directive 92/43/EEC.
   The species composition of the ichthyofauna remained almost unchanged during the last 35 years. The occurrence of fish species along the river conformed to the hydro-morphological continuum depending on the habitat distribution. Significant changes were found in the recent spatial distribution of fishes in comparison with those recorded in 1970s and 1980s as a result mainly of human activities. As a whole, qualitative and quantitative impoverishment of the ichthyofauna in the upper stretch occurred due to the increasing direct and indirect human pressure. At the same time, a recovery of the fish community downstream the city of Pleven was recorded after the municipal sewage treatment plant had been put in operation.

AB  - As the world becomes more and more urbanized, it is increasingly important to understand the impacts of urban landscapes on biodiversity. Urbanization can change local habitat factors and decrease connectivity among local habitats, with major impacts on the structure of natural food webs. However, most studies have focused on single species, or compared rural to urban habitats, which do not inform us on how to design and manage cities to optimize biodiversity. To understand the local and spatial drivers of ecological communities within urban landscapes, we assessed the relative impact of local habitat factors (sunlight exposure and leaf litter) and spatial connectivity on an oak-associated herbivore community within an urban landscape. From the local habitat factors, leaf litter but not sunlight exposure was related to herbivore species richness, with leaf litter contributing to the maintenance of high species richness on isolated trees. Guilds and species differed strongly in their response to local habitat factors and connectivity, resulting in predictable variation in insect community composition among urban oaks. Taken together, our study shows an interactive effect of local and spatial factors on species richness and species composition within an urban context, with guild- and species-specific life histories determining the response of insects to urban landscapes. To maintain biodiversity in the urban landscape, preserving a dense network of local habitats is essential. Moreover, allowing leaf litter to accumulate can be a simple, cost-effective conservation management practice.

AB  - We compared the avifauna recorded in a recent survey in an urban park (Parque Municipal Henrique Luis Roessler, Parcao) and surroundings, Novo Hamburgo, RS, with past data, to evaluate the possible alterations in species composition over time. Of the 265 species compiled as original elements of that region, 114 were found at Parcao. Among forest species, 37% were considered locally extinct. The most affected guild was the large frugivores, with nine extinct species and one survivor (Trogon surrucura). Birds highly sensitive to disturbance as well as endemic species were the most extinguished. The possible causes for this loss are fragmentation, hunting and environmental changes. The diversity today is threatened, thus conservation measures are necessary in that region. The most important actions are: maintenance of ecological corridors, protection of natural remnant areas and the establishment of protected areas.

AB  - Understanding the dynamics of biodiversity in changing agricultural landscapes is a goal for nature conservation and agricultural policies. Agriculture operates at several spatio-temporal levels from field to landscape, and induces differential response of communities according to their ecological traits. Reactions of several taxa to landscape and agricultural changes was conducted along landscape gradients in northern Brittany (France) gathering 14 sites. Landscapes ranged from fine grained areas, with a large proportion of permanent grasslands, wood and hedgerows, to coarse grained ones dominated by crops. Response of communities were either loss of species along the gradient (as for Diptera Chironomidae and Empididae), replacement (Coleoptera Carabidae) and no change in species composition (small mammals). In this paper, we present why these taxa react in such different ways according to their life history traits, their mobility patterns and to which parameters of landscape structure or agriculture intensification they are sensitive. Density of hedgerow networks, and permeability of individual hedgerows determine the spatial distribution of adults Diptera according to their flying ability. Mean body size of carabid beetles significantly decreases along the gradient of agricultural intensification, small species adapted to disturbance replacing large ones that are characteristic of stable habitats. The same small mammal species are found all along the two gradients, but their relative abundance is linked to the importance of crops versus more stable habitats in the landscape.
   We concluded that species survival in those fine grained agricultural landscapes depends on processes operating at the site scale and defining habitat quality, and processes operating at the landscape and/or metapopulation scale such as landscape modifications in connectivity and habitat availability.

AB  - In agricultural landscapes, patches of natural or semi-natural habitat are crucial for the survival of plant and animal populations, which in turn are essential to maintain ecosystem functioning. Species composition and diversity of trees and birds among woody habitat islands were compared in a Colombian rangeland to assess how habitat characteristics influence bird community composition, bird species traits and their potential ecosystem services. Bird and tree diversity was higher in gallery forest fragments compared to hedgerows and isolated tree islands within rangelands. Forest fragments shared over 50% of their bird and tree species with tree islands and hedgerows, yet communities differed markedly. Tree islands and hedgerows had relatively more endozoochorous and small-seeded tree species and hosted birds of forest, savanna and shrubland, while forest fragments had more synzoochorous and large-seeded tree species and primarily hosted forest birds. Hedges and tree islands contribute to the conservation of forest bird and tree biodiversity in rangeland, but gallery forests are essential for the conservation of less tolerant forest species. The savanna rangeland acts as an ecological filter between the gallery forests and the hedges and tree islands, which in turn facilitate the spillover of tolerant forest birds and their ecological functions, including tree seed dispersal, into the rangeland, and thus support regional forest conservation and restoration.

AB  - Questions
   (1) How do seres differ with respect to vegetation changes? (2) What are the directions of succession? (3) How do species numbers change? (4) How do target species, i.e. those typical of natural and semi-natural vegetation, participate in succession? (5) Are spontaneously developed successional stages acceptable from the point of view of ecosystem restoration?
   Location
   Extracted peatlands, bulldozed sites in forests destroyed by air pollution, an emerged bottom of a water reservoir, corridors of former Iron Curtain, artificial fishpond islands and barriers, sedimentary basins, spoil heaps from mining, stone quarries, forest clearings, road verges, sand and gravel-sand pits, ruderal urban sites, river gravel bars and abandoned arable fields, located in various parts of the Czech Republic in Central Europe.
   Methods
   Phytosociological releves were recorded in 10-25m(2) plots located in the centre of representative successional stages defined by their age, ranging from 1 to 100yrs. In total, we obtained 2392 vegetation samples containing 951 species. We performed DCA ordination to compare 19 seres. Desirable target species were considered as those representing (semi)-natural vegetation and all Red List species.
   Results
   The seres studied are more similar in their species composition in the initial and early stages, in which synathropic species prevail, than in the later stages when the vegetation differentiates. This divergence is driven mainly by local moisture conditions. In most cases, succession led to woodland, which usually established after ca. 20yrs. In very dry or wet places (with limited presence of woody species) open vegetation developed, often highly valuable from the restoration and conservation point of view. The total number of species and the number of target species increased in the majority of seres with successional age.
   Conclusions
   The vegetation in the sites studied formed a continuum along a moisture gradient and by successional age. The individual seres largely overlapped in their species composition; the sere identity was not significant. Spontaneous succession usually proceeded towards woodland, except at very dry or wet sites, and generally appeared to be an ecologically suitable way of ecosystem restoration of disturbed sites because target species became dominant over time.

AB  - Fragmentation and land use cover change are key factors for global biodiversity loss. In this work, we analyzed the processes of fragmentation in land use cover in the region of the Sierra Madre Oriental in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, to assess the impact on the distribution of birds and important areas for conservation. Fieldwork was conducted and distribution records of birds were collected, from which species distribution models with MaxEnt were developed. This information was compared with fragmentation data obtained from landscape metrics. The results indicate that natural land cover is prone to fragmentation, while land use (i.e. agriculture) tends to connect and increase in area. Both, Central and Southwestern regions have the greatest tendency to land cover fragmentation, leading to a high heterogeneity in the landscape. This affects the distribution areas of 34% of modeled species due to loss of connectivity between habitats and rising edges. These results confirm the importance of the region as a center of high bird diversity and highlights the need for short-term conservation actions to maintain the distribution areas of importance for birds.

AB  - Butterflies (Lepidoptera) have attracted more attention as bin-indicators of terrestrial ecosystems than other terrestrial arthropods. This study determined butterfly species turnover at a priori selected habitat patches inside Nduli Nature Reserve and its surrounding landscape, and their response to measured environmental variables. Using the line transect method, 516 butterfly individuals belonging to 22 species were sampled from all 16 sampling units (Sus), of which 13 species occurred in two or more Sus across the study site. Habitat patches outside the reserve were higher in butterfly species richness and abundance than inside the reserve. Papilio demodocus Esper, Borbo gemella Mabille, Precis octavia (Cramer) and Hypolimnas missipus (Linnaeus) were each restricted to one sampling unit. Hierarchical clustering using Bray-Curtis similarity matrices and correspondence analyses grouped sampling units according to butterfly species sampled. Canonical correspondence analysis results indicated that certain site (environmental) variables, e.g. percentage herb cover, grazing intensity, distance to the city centre and average flower density accounted for species distribution patterns across Sus. The implications of the study suggest that habitat patch level management for conservation action should aim at preserving sufficient herb cover and nectaring plants, especially during the summer season to cater for all developmental stages of butterfly species in the study area. Furthermore, species richness within the reserve can be encouraged by using vegetation linkages and corridors between the reserve and its surrounding landscape. Butterflies identified during the study can serve as indicator species for assessing the conservation value of habitat patches in the study area and for increasing public awareness of the need to conserve butterflies and the invertebrate fauna of the King Sabata Dalindyebo Municipality between the months of November and April.

AB  - The urban river corridor is an important ecological space that is known for its landscapes and ecological continuity. Compared with the natural river, the urban river is seriously affected by human activities, which are constructed with the hope of recreating a similar natural environment and are uniquely designed so that ecological specialists, landscape experts and scientists could study both the surrounding environment's ecological effects and the continuity degree of the river corridor area. A system, including 10 indices urban river corridor, is established. This assessment method adapts the Analytic Hierarchy Process, GIS data analysis and GIS space technology, and is combined with these methods based on quantitative and qualitative analyses. Using the results obtained by studying the Suzhou River Corridor and the assessment of ecological continuity is completed and the spatial distribution characteristics are approved, thus it allows future development throughout the corridor. Eventually, a development policy is proposed. Firstly, a method to improve the landscape connectivity among the river's greenways is needed. Secondly, a high value area with ecological continuity related to the river greenway is planned along the river greenway. Thirdly, a sufficient natural area is needed to give the area a river corridor influence, maintain the river's ecological continuity, and keep this natural area undisturbed by zoning. Lastly, the plant species distribution need to link ecological traits and landscape matrix. The study of this assessment method provides a rational development path and decision-making basis for the construction of healthy and sustainable urban river corridors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Landscape genetics is now ten years old. It has stimulated research into the effect of landscapes on evolutionary processes. This review describes the main topics that have contributed most significantly to the progress of landscape genetics, such as conceptual and methodological developments in spatial and temporal patterns of gene flow, seascape genetics, and landscape genomics. We then suggest perspectives for the future, investigating what the field will contribute to the assessment of global change and conservation in general and to the management of tropical and urban areas in particular. To address these urgent topics, future work in landscape genetics should focus on a better integration of neutral and adaptive genetic variation and their interplay with species distribution and the environment.

AB  - Understanding the factors related to invasive exotic species distributions at broad spatial scales has important theoretical and management implications, because biological invasions are detrimental to many ecosystem functions and processes. Housing development facilitates invasions by disturbing land cover, introducing nonnative landscaping plants, and facilitating dispersal of propagules along roads. To evaluate relationships between housing and the distribution of invasive exotic plants, we asked (1) how strongly is housing associated with the spatial distribution of invasive exotic plants compared to other anthropogenic and environmental factors; (2) what type of housing pattern is related to the richness of invasive exotic plants; and (3) do invasive plants represent ecological traits associated with specific housing patterns? Using two types of regression analysis (best subset analysis and hierarchical partitioning analysis), we found that invasive exotic plant richness was equally or more strongly related to housing variables than to other human (e. g., mean income and roads) and environmental (e. g., topography and forest cover) variables at the county level across New England. Richness of invasive exotic plants was positively related to area of wildland-urban interface (WUI), low-density residential areas, change in number of housing units between 1940 and 2000, mean income, plant productivity (NDVI), and altitudinal range and rainfall; it was negatively related to forest area and connectivity. Plant life history traits were not strongly related to housing patterns. We expect the number of invasive exotic plants to increase as a result of future housing growth and suggest that housing development be considered a primary factor in plans to manage and monitor invasive exotic plant species.

AB  - Understanding the drivers of exotic plant invasions along waterways is crucial for helping environmental managers devise effective control strategies. We combined a field survey, molecular data and a logistic regression model to further our understanding of the spatial distribution of Japanese (Fallopia japonica) and Bohemian (Fallopiaxbohemica) knotweeds along the entire course (185km) of a river located in Quebec (Canada). Both knotweeds were abundant along the river, but each had a distinct spatial distribution pattern. Only one genotype for each knotweed species or hybrid was found, suggesting that the individuals established along the Chaudiere River resulted from the propagation of rhizome or stem fragments. The distance from the nearest town or village was the only explanatory variable significantly correlated to the spatial distribution of knotweeds. However, spatial autoregressive coefficients were significant, indicating that knotweeds were more likely to occur close to other knotweeds. In summary, the invasion was probably initiated by the introduction, in riverside towns and villages, of a few individuals of the same genotype. The clones then spread vegetatively, probably during spring floods. The rhizome and stem fragments spread over short distances, dispersing downstream from urban centres. The introduction of just two knotweed genotypes along the Chaudiere River was sufficient to initiate a massive riverside colonization, as few riparian vegetation types were apparently able to resist knotweed invasion.

AB  - Objective To analyse whether the geographical ranges of Dendroctonus species are (1) associated with factors such as host species or elevation, and (2) in agreement with Halffter's Nearctic distribution pattern. (3) To identify and discuss the factors that are likely to act as barriers to the genus' geographical distribution. (4) To explore whether there is an association between the size of the geographical ranges of Dendroctonus species and the number of Pinus host species used by each of them, and (5) to assess if these host species are most common at the elevations preferred by the individual Dendroctonus species.
   Site Mexico.
   Methods Records of 12 species of Dendroctonus were gathered from entomological collections in Mexico. Distribution ranges were defined by using the propinquity method (Rapoport, 1975a). Analysed parameters were: (1) geographical distribution of single species, (2) overlapping of species ranges, (3) disjunction patterns and barriers by means of isoprobabilistic lines, based on the morphotectonic subdivision of Mexico (Ferrusquia-Villafranca, 1998), (4) spatial variation in species richness with respect to latitude and altitude, (5) size of geographical ranges, and (6) host species for each Dendroctonus species. A correlation was determined between area size and number of pine host species.
   Results The species ranges varied in shape and size. Geographical ranges tend to be discontinuous in shape. Composite patterns showed that disjunctions among ranges do not closely follow Mexico's morphotectonic subdivision. There are repeated discontinuities among individual distributions, which define five areas: (1) Baja California Peninsula, (2) Sierra Madre Occidental (SMOC), (3) northern Sierra Madre Oriental (SMOR), (4) Sierra Madre de Chiapas, and (5) SMOR + Faja Volcanica Transmexicana (FVT) + Sierra Madre del Sur. The isoprobabilistic lines confirm that the inner part of SMOC provides an optimal environment for the genus, and the FVT province constitutes the broader corridor for it in the country. Richness does not directly decrease or increase with latitude. Richness behaviour of the insect is not associated with that of its host. Elevation distributions showed that most Dendroctonus species move within broad margins of tolerance and species richness is concentrated in the montane interval. Dendroctonus attack 24 of the 47 Pinus species distributed in Mexico. Preferred pine species belong predominantly to Leiophyllae, Ponderosae and Oocarpae subsections. The Spearman rank correlation between area size and number of pine host species was not significant. Dendroctonus clearly belongs to a Nearctic distribution pattern (sensu Halffter, 1987).
   Dendroctonus is present in all montane systems of Mexico and its species coexist within a high geographical sympatry. Overlapping of species distribution appears to be the result of two elements - generalized polyphagy inside Pinus and a wide elevation tolerance within mountainous environments. This behaviour, linked to a high vagility, has allowed the genus Dendroctonus to expand its distribution across Mexico and to employ mountainous systems as corridors separated by barriers that exert a low selective filter effect.

AB  - Urbanization is changing Earth's ecosystems by altering the interactions and feedbacks between the fundamental ecological and evolutionary processes that maintain life. Humans in cities alter the eco-evolutionary play by simultaneously changing both the actors and the stage on which the eco-evolutionary play takes place. Urbanization modifies land surfaces, microclimates, habitat connectivity, ecological networks, food webs, species diversity, and species composition. These environmental changes can lead to changes in phenotypic, genetic, and cultural makeup of wild populations that have important consequences for ecosystem function and the essential services that nature provides to human society, such as nutrient cycling, pollination, seed dispersal, food production, and water and air purification. Understanding and monitoring urbanization-induced evolutionary changes is important to inform strategies to achieve sustainability. In the present article, we propose that understanding these dynamics requires rigorous characterization of urbanizing regions as rapidly evolving, tightly coupled human-natural systems. We explore how the emergent properties of urbanization affect eco-evolutionary dynamics across space and time. We identify five key urban drivers of change-habitat modification, connectivity, heterogeneity, novel disturbances, and biotic interactions-and highlight the direct consequences of urbanization-driven eco-evolutionary change for nature's contributions to people. Then, we explore five emerging complexities-landscape complexity, urban discontinuities, socio-ecological heterogeneity, cross-scale interactions, legacies and time lags-that need to be tackled in future research. We propose that the evolving metacommunity concept provides a powerful framework to study urban eco-evolutionary dynamics.

AB  - For many avian species, spatial migration patterns remain largely undescribed, especially across hemispheric extents. Recent advancements in tracking technologies and high-resolution species distribution models (i.e., eBird Status and Trends products) provide new insights into migratory bird movements and offer a promising opportunity for integrating independent data sources to describe avian migration. Here, we present a three-stage modeling framework for estimating spatial patterns of avian migration. First, we integrate tracking and band re-encounter data to quantify migratory connectivity, defined as the relative proportions of individuals migrating between breeding and nonbreeding regions. Next, we use estimated connectivity proportions along with eBird occurrence probabilities to produce probabilistic least-cost path (LCP) indices. In a final step, we use generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) both to evaluate the ability of LCP indices to accurately predict (i.e., as a covariate) observed locations derived from tracking and band re-encounter data sets versus pseudo-absence locations during migratory periods and to create a fully integrated (i.e., eBird occurrence, LCP, and tracking/band re-encounter data) spatial prediction index for mapping species-specific seasonal migrations. To illustrate this approach, we apply this framework to describe seasonal migrations of 12 bird species across the Western Hemisphere during pre- and postbreeding migratory periods (i.e., spring and fall, respectively). We found that including LCP indices with eBird occurrence in GAMMs generally improved the ability to accurately predict observed migratory locations compared to models with eBird occurrence alone. Using three performance metrics, the eBird + LCP model demonstrated equivalent or superior fit relative to the eBird-only model for 22 of 24 species-season GAMMs. In particular, the integrated index filled in spatial gaps for species with over-water movements and those that migrated over land where there were few eBird sightings and, thus, low predictive ability of eBird occurrence probabilities (e.g., Amazonian rainforest in South America). This methodology of combining individual-based seasonal movement data with temporally dynamic species distribution models provides a comprehensive approach to integrating multiple data types to describe broad-scale spatial patterns of animal movement. Further development and customization of this approach will continue to advance knowledge about the full annual cycle and conservation of migratory birds.

AB  - Land use change can result in complex environments of varying habitat quality and permeability that directly and indirectly influence the effectiveness of natural areas for wildlife conservation. To assess how isolation and degradation of protected natural areas may affect long-term conservation efforts across the range of a sensitive subspecies, we used multiscale occupancy analysis, species distribution modeling, and circuit theory to identify hotspot areas of occurrence and potential landscape connectivity among areas of high quality habitat within and between protected natural areas. Big Cypress fox squirrels (Sciurus niger avicennia: BCFS) are state-threatened subspecies of fox squirrel endemic to forested wetlands in southwest Florida, which have been highly altered by human activities. Probability of occupancy of BCFS among conservation areas varied widely due to differences in environmental features (Hedge's g = 1.4705, 95% CI: 1.074-1.763). Fine-scale features indicative of habitat degradation, such as increasing midstory vegetation cover and decreasing bromeliad cover, negatively influenced BCFS occurrence. Home-range-level tree canopy cover differentially affected probability of occupancy dependent on proximity to urban areas. Additionally, home-range-level high summer temperature differentially affected probability of occupancy dependent on proximity to cypress domes. Habitat was distributed patchily both within and among conservation areas, separated by large areas of unsuitable vegetation communities and urbanized features that were barriers to movement. Considering the threat of increasing isolation of conservation areas due to continued development as well as current and impending degradation caused by land use and climate change within conservation area boundaries, we suggest a strong need for interagency coordination to improve, maintain, and acquire rights for protection of additional remaining habitat.

AB  - The following study presents an updated diagnosis of the existing birdwatching resources as a touristic activity in the National Route 40 corridor, along the section between the Rio Turbio Coal Basin and Gobernador Gregores city (Santa Cruz) and its area of influence, with the aim of laying the foundations for the planning and development of the activity in its various kinds, based on the suitability and capabilities of the area. Two types of observers were identified; recreationists and specialists. For the latter, 17 species, which are the most sought by observers who visit Santa Cruz, stand out because of their limited distribution, endemism and singularity. Some of these species' distribution is very limited, which results in a comparative advantage respect to other places that offer the same product. Various zones identified to develop this activity are presented and classified according to their potential.

AB  - Recent growth of investments in wind energy and power industries has increased concerns about the associated adverse impacts on wildlife. In particular, flying vertebrates are especially at risk, both directly, through an extra mortality rate due to collision with turbines and electrocution, and indirectly through habitat loss or fragmentation. In this study, we propose a modelling approach that combines species distribution models and data managed in geographic information systems to predict and quantify the effects of wind turbines and power lines on the breeding habitat of a soaring migratory bird, the black stork Ciconia nigra, in Italy. The species is recolonizing the country, where it had been driven to extinction in the Middle Age by human persecution. Today, infrastructures such as those considered in our study might in fact hamper this recolonization. Our results show a high probability of presence of the species in several areas in Italy. The most important variables in influencing habitat suitability for C. nigra are the mean temperature of May followed by the distance from urban areas, inland wetlands and hydrographic network. Exposure to wind turbine collision and electrocution resulted to be potentially high. In particular, in Northern Italy the main potential risk of mortality for C. nigra is posed by power lines, whereas in southern regions the species might be mostly threatened by wind turbines. Our approach makes it possible to detect suitable areas that, although not yet colonized by the species, would imply a high mortality risk should the species colonize them in the future. The tool we provide may therefore prove useful to conservationists and landscape planners in order to mitigate the impact of human infrastructures on this species and encourage a more sustainable planning.

AB  - Background: Land-use change has led to a dramatic decrease in total forest cover, contributing to biodiversity loss and changes of ecosystems' functions. Insect communities of medical importance can be favored by anthropogenic alterations, increasing the risk of novel zoonotic diseases. The response of mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) abundance and richness to five land-use types (shade coffee plantation, cattle field, urban forest, peri-urban forest, well-preserved montane cloud forest) and three seasons ("dry", "rainy" and "cold") embedded in a neotropical montane cloud forest landscape was evaluated.
   Methods: Standardized collections were performed using 8 CDC miniature black-light traps, baited with CO2 throughout the year. Generalized additive mixed models were used to describe the seasonal and spatial trends of both species richness and abundance. Rank abundance curves and ANCOVAs were used to detect changes in the spatial and temporal structure of the mosquito assemblage. Two cluster analyses were conducted, using 1-beta sim and the Morisita-Horn index to evaluate species composition shifts based on incidences and abundances.
   Results: A total of 2536 adult mosquitoes were collected, belonging to 9 genera and 10 species; the dominant species in the study were: Aedes quadrivittatus, Wyeomyia adelpha, Wy. arthrostigma, and Culex restuans. Highest richness was recorded in the dry season, whereas higher abundance was detected during the rainy season. The urban forest had the highest species richness (n = 7) when compared to all other sites. Species composition cluster analyses show that there is a high degree of similarity in species numbers across sites and seasons throughout the year. However, when considering the abundance of such species, the well-preserved montane cloud forest showed significantly higher abundance. Moreover, the urban forest is only 30 % similar to other sites in terms of species abundances, indicating a possible isolating role of the urban environment.
   Conclusion: Mosquito assemblage was differentially influenced by land-use change and seasonality, but at the same time the assemblage is rather homogeneous across the studied landscape, suggesting a high degree of spatial connectivity. Information generated in this study is potentially useful in the development of urban planning and surveillance programs focused mainly on mosquito species of medical and veterinary importance.

AB  - Forest fragments are characteristic features of many megacities that have survived the urbanisation process and are often represented by unique assemblages of flora and fauna. Such woodlands are representations of nature in the city-often dominated by non-native and invasive species that coexist with resilient native congeners and purposefully introduced flora. These forest fragments also provide significant ecosystem services to urban society and therefore, understanding their compositional patterns is of considerable importance for conservation and management. In this work, we use a complex network approach to investigate species assemblages across six distinct urban forest fragments in the South Delhi Ridge area of the National Capital Territory, India. We generate bipartite ecological networks using conventional vegetation sampling datasets, followed by network partitioning to identify multiple cliques across the six forest fragments. Our results show that urban woodlands primarily form invasive-native associations, and that major invasive species, such as Prosopis juliflora and Lantana camara exclude each other while forming cliques. Our findings have implications for the conservation of these urban forests and highlight the importance of using network approaches in vegetation analysis.

AB  - This paper explores the role of landscape planning as a tool for rural fire prevention. It presents a methodology for a fire resilient and sustainable landscape model (FIRELAN) that articulates the ecological and cultural components in a suitable and multifunction land-use plan. FIRELAN is a conceptual and ecologically based model that recognizes river basin' land morphology, microclimate and species combustibility as the fundamental factors that determine fire behavior and landscape resilience, along with the ecological network (EN) for achieving ecological sustainability of the landscape. The model is constituted by the FIRELAN Network and the Complementary Areas. This network ensures the effectiveness of discontinuities in the landscape with less combustible land-uses. It also functions as a fire-retardant technique and protection of wildland-urban interface (WUI). This model is applied to municipalities from Portugal's center region, a simplified landscape severely damaged by recurrent rural fires. The results show that land-use and tree species composition should change drastically, whereas about 72% of the case study needs transformation actions. This requires a significant increase of native or archaeophytes species, agricultural areas, landscape discontinuities and the restoration of biodiversity in Natura 2000 areas. The EN components are 79% of the FIRELAN N area, whose implementation ensures soil and water conservation, biodiversity and habitats. This paper contributes to the discussion of the Portuguese rural fires planning framework.

AB  - The establishment of a sustainable vegetation layer on shotcrete walls subjected to road environment represents enormous challenges. High inclination of almost 90 degrees, the exposed position of the walls near streets as well as lack of soil and water supply pose major limiting conditions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of an innovative greening technology for vertical structures in terms of vegetation development on varying plant substrates and geotextiles. The field experiment included testing three plant substrates on basis of nearby rocky excavation material ('Innsbrucker Quarzphyllit', 'Bundnerschiefer' and 'Zentralgneis') combined with compost. Additionally, five geotextiles (geogrid (3x4 mm), geogrid (9x10 mm), coir net, coir mat, geo mat) were applied for assessment. All test combinations were evaluated regarding vegetation cover, species composition, and biomass production from 2015 to 2016. Analyses of chemical properties were conducted for all plant substrates. Results showed highest vegetation cover ratio on 'Bundnerschiefer' and 'Innsbrucker Quarzphyllit', which can be explained by the favorable mineral composition (nutrient storage capacity) and chemical properties of compost (lower values of electrical conductivity and C/N ratio). In conclusion, the use of ` Green Walls' filled with 'Bundnerschiefer' or 'Innsbrucker Quarzphyllit' plant substrate in combination with netlike geotextiles like geogrid or coir net proved best. They are promising in terms of establishing an optimal vegetation cover on vertical structures and are well suited for integrating shotcrete walls into the landscape. The use of local excavation material for greening purposes thus can be confirmed. Though, the use of high-quality compost is crucial.

AB  - The process of urbanization and urban land use conversion inevitably disturbs the structure and function of ecosystems and their capacity to provide ecosystem services. Integrating ecosystem services into effective policies and planning at the regional scale to achieve sustainable urban development is still a challenge. The goal of this research is to optimize spatial patterns of urban development by assessing and comparing multiple trade-off scenarios between ecological processes and urban expansion, incorporating planning and design into spatially explicit methods, and integrating ecosystem services into decision-making procedures. We develop a conceptual framework for regional urban-ecological sustainability with six steps: pattern recognition, landscape process, problem diagnosis, integrated ecological network, urbanization simulation, and decision-support. We apply this framework to a case in which planning and design have followed the rational-comprehensive approach. Results demonstrate that landscape multi-functionality and regional ecological networks are significantly improved using our integrated approach to planning and design, because it provides vital information for regional planning to cope with the urgent need for ecological protection and urban development. By comparing urban growth under three scenarios, we found that the trade-off scenario based on ecological conservation and restoration (medium security level) resolved conflict more effectively, which restricted urban expansion on land of high ecological importance by constructing regional ecological networks. In addition, using field survey and species distribution model approaches, we design plant community types with complementary tree, shrub, and herb species as part of the decision-making procedure, which can restore zonal vegetation and the hydrological cycle in rugged mountain regions. The research concludes that regional urban-ecological sustainability based on scientific assessment, planning, and design provides a rational basis for sustainable urban development and landscape management.

AB  - Migratory birds rely on a habitat network along their migration routes by temporarily occupying stopover sites between breeding and non-breeding grounds. Removal or degradation of stopover sites in a network might impede movement and thereby reduce migration success and survival. The extent to which the breakdown of migration networks, due to changes in land use, impacts the population sizes of migratory birds is poorly understood. We measured the functional connectivity of migration networks of waterfowl species that migrate over the East Asian-Australasian Flyway from 1992 to 2015. We analysed the relationship between changes in non-breeding population sizes and changes in functional connectivity, while taking into account other commonly considered species traits, using a phylogenetic linear mixed model. We found that population sizes significantly declined with a reduction in the functional connectivity of migration networks; no other variables were important. We conclude that the current decrease in functional connectivity, due to habitat loss and degradation in migration networks, can negatively and crucially impact population sizes of migratory birds. Our findings provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms that affect population trends of migratory birds under environmental changes. Establishment of international agreements leading to the creation of systematic conservation networks associated with migratory species' distributions and stopover sites may safeguard migratory bird populations.

AB  - Insect diversity levels and change in remnant urban habitats have been poorly examined in Neotropical regions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diversity and composition of foliage/shrub dwelling beetles (Insecta: Coleoptera) regarding the influence of patch attributes (i.e., patch size, connectivity, and surrounding matrix) and within-patch habitat complexity, in an urban landscape at Chetumal, Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. Despite the potential species-specific responses to urban landscape pattern, our study reveals that there are effects of patch spatial features and habitat complexity on overall beetle diversity.These effects are as follows: 1) relatively larger urban patches contained higher overall beetle richness, 2) beetle species composition varied significantly regarding understory vegetation structure and tree richness, and 3) patches of intermediate vegetation age had highest beetle richness.This research provides a case study of patch and habitat features related to Neotropical insect assemblages in urban settlements, underlying the importance of using ecological information to offer management recommendations in ever-expanding urban tropical settlements.

AB  - Shenzhen, a new city existed for less than three decades, experienced dramatic biological invasions of alien plants resulting from the construction of urban green spaces. In an investigation of plant species from 390 plots in 186 sites across five main types of green space (public parks, forests, vegetation corridors, residential and industrial area), a total of 474 plant species, including 221 alien species (46.6%), were recorded. Our study witnessed the spread and establishment of alien species across all urban green spaces and revealed significantly greater proportions of alien species in artificial green spaces than in natural ones. Furthermore, we found the positive relationship between native and alien species richness existed across all the green spaces and was particularly prevalent in the artificial ones. Additionally, successful establishment of alien species instigated by anthropogenic disturbances and most frequent species assemblages caused biotic homogenization in the artificial habitats. In contrast, biotic differentiation in the near-natural habitats was still preserved due to a greater level of protection for native species, which showed some resistance against the establishment of alien species. Therefore, urbanization was proven distinct effects on the flora of artificial and near-natural habitats, coexisting in the new city. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

CP  - International Symposium on Wetlands - Environmental Gradients, Boundaries, and Buffers
AB  - A general definition of riparian zones as three-dimensional zones of direct interaction between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems provides a starting point for consideration of the ecological structure and function of riparian forests needed for informed management. Some fundamental ecological issues include: (1) the scale of inquiry (landscape, site), (2) structure and function of the terrestrial system (corridors for plant and animal habitat and dispersal, biodiversity conservation, succession, and species composition), and (3) ecological functions for aquatic ecosystems. Rather than presenting criteria for delineating the boundaries of riparian forests, a case is presented for the importance of management goals in determining functional boundaries of riparian forested wetlands. When considering such forested wetlands with an ecosystem approach, there can not be one single boundary defined for riparian areas that is independent of human goals and independent of scale considerations.

AB  - Natural disturbances and human development can cause habitat fragmentation. Plant and animal populations can become isolated, but wildlife corridors can potentially alleviate the problem by providing linkages between isolated patches of natural areas. These connecting corridors need to be designed to create habitat appropriate for target species.
   This study developed a framework for design of wildlife corridors which considered both critical corridor attributes and target species. it provided a methodology for use in designing corridors to ensure appropriate species composition. Objectives included identifying and analyzing attributes which constitute a corridor. An 'ecosystem approach' for selecting guilds of target species was used. The framework was applied to a fragmented landscape case study in southwestern Ontario, Canada.
   Results indicated that, by applying this framework to a fragmented landscape, ecologically appropriate corridors could be designed when corridor attributes and target species were carefully analyzed. In addition, it was shown that optimal corridor designs could be altered to fit a landscape's opportunities and constraints. (C) Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - In urban landscapes, gardens provide refuges for bee diversity, but conservation potential may depend on local and landscape features. Foraging and population persistence of bee species, as well as overall pollinator community structure, may be supported by the abundance, richness, and spatial distribution of floral resources. Floral resources strongly differ in urban gardens. Using hand netting and pan traps to survey bees, we examined whether abundance, richness, and spatial distribution of floral resources, as well as ground cover and garden landscape surroundings influence bee abundance, species richness, and diversity on the central coast of California. Differences in floral abundance and spatial distribution, as well as urban cover in the landscape, predicted different bee community variables. Abundance of all bees and of honeybees (Apis mellifera) was lower in sites with more urban land cover surrounding the gardens. Honeybee abundance was higher in sites with patchy floral resources, whereas bee species richness and bee diversity was higher in sites with more clustered floral resources. Surprisingly, bee species richness and bee diversity was lower in sites with very high floral abundance, possibly due to interactions with honeybees. Other studies have documented the importance of floral abundance and landscape surroundings for bees in urban gardens, but this study is the first to document that the spatial arrangement of flowers strongly predicts bee abundance and richness. Based on these findings, it is likely that garden managers may promote bee conservation by managing for floral connectivity and abundance within these ubiquitous urban habitats.

AB  - Bird communities on the 20 fragmented woodlots in a suburban area were surveyed in the Tokorozawa City, Central Japan, to analyze the factors that influenced the distribution of birds. Our results showed that woodlot area is an important predictor of the number of individuals and the species richness of birds in each woodlot. Based on the species composition of birds in wintering season, the fragmented woodlots were classified into four types by TWINSPAN: those are core woodlots, woodlots surrounding core ones, isolated and small woodlots, and isolated and middle-sized woodlots. By canonical discriminant analysis, it was indicated that the connectivity between woodlots and the vegetation structure are also important factors influencing bird communities. The necessity of controlling these factors for avian conservation was pointed out.

AB  - Global climate change may enable invasive plant species (IPS) to invade protected areas (PAs), but plant invasion on a global scale has not yet been explicitly addressed. Here, we mapped the potential invasion pathways for IPS in PAs across the globe and explored potential factors determining the pathways of plant invasion under climate change. We used species distribution modelling to estimate the suitable habitats of 386 IPS and applied a corridor analysis to compute the potential pathways of IPS in PAs under climate change. Subsequently, we analysed the potential factors affecting the pathways in PAs. According to our results, the main potential pathways of IPS in PAs are in Europe, eastern Australia, New Zealand, southern Africa, and eastern regions of South America and are strongly influenced by changes in temperature and precipitation. Protected areas can play an important role in preventing and controlling the spread of IPS under climate change. This is due to the fact that measures are taken to monitor climate change in detail, to provide effective management near or inside PAs, and to control the introduction of IPS with a high capacity for natural dispersal. A review of conservation policies in PAs is urgently needed.

AB  - Coevolution can impose density-dependent selection through reciprocal biotic interactions on the fitness of involved species, driving directional and disruptive trait evolution and rich evolutionary possibilities. Coevolution has since Darwin been considered a potential path leading to adaptive diversification that could explain the emergence of ecological networks of biotic interactions that harbour multiple interacting species (eg, pollination networks and food webs). Here, we present adaptive dynamics, a powerful tool of evolutionary invasion analysis that explores how quantitative traits undergo incremental evolution, to exploring the emergence of multi-species networks through coevolution. Specifically, we exemplify the feasibility of using adaptive dynamics to investigate trait evolution in 4 ecological networks, driven, respectively, by resource competition, trophic interactions, as well as bipartite mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. We use a set of ordinary differential equations to describe, at different paces, the population dynamics and trait dynamics of involved species assemblages. Through computing ecological equilibrium, invasion fitness, selection gradient and evolutionary singularity, and testing for evolutionary stability and the coexistence criterion of mutual invasibility, we illustrate the typical evolutionary dynamics and the criteria of evolutionary stability and branching in these ecological networks. Results highlight the importance of the form of trait-mediated interaction kernel (ie, interaction strength as a function of trait difference) to adaptive diversification in these coevolutionary systems. We conclude by advocating that biotic interactions between two species can indeed lead to diffuse and even escape-and-radiate coevolution, making the emerged ecological networks an ideal model for studying complex adaptive systems.

AB  - Residential communities are the primary living spaces for people in China. Their associated greenspaces are important elements of the urban ecosystem, providing neighborhood ecosystem services and hosting bird populations of differing community structures compared with other urban green areas. This study analyzes avian community characteristics within residential communities and their differences compared with urban parks in Beijing. Furthermore, we assess the key environmental factors determining species composition and population sizes and the spatial scales at which these factors are most significant. We randomly selected 27 residential communities to assess the habitat structure and landscape characteristics that underpin residential avian assemblages across multiple spatial scales. Independent sample t-test and model selection methods based on AICc were used for data analysis. Eurasian Tree Sparrow (Passer montanus) (hereafter ETS) alone accounted for 91.0% of total individuals. Compared with urban parks, more migrants and omnivores were found in residential communities. Within-site forest patch connectivity simultaneously decided resident species diversity and individual abundance, with the exception of ETS. Tree species richness and coverage are key predictors for resident species richness and ETS numbers, respectively. Even in the most urbanized species, ETS retained ecological attributes found in "wilder" settings. Residential communities skewed toward avian communities with dominant numbers of ETS. In these low-quality habitats, our results suggest that landscape configuration is more important than local habitat structure. Within-site habitat connectivity and the number of surrounding forest patches with shorter between-patch distances deserve more attention in future landscape design for residential communities.

AB  - Functional connectivity is essential for the long-term persistence of populations. However, many studies assess connectivity with a focus on structural connectivity only. Cityscapes, namely urban landscapes, are particularly dynamic and include numerous potential anthropogenic barriers to animal movements, such as roads, traffic or buildings. To assess and compare structural connectivity of habitats and functional connectivity of gene flow of an urban lizard, we here combined species distribution models (SDMs) with an individual-based landscape genetic optimization procedure. The most important environmental factors of the SDMs are structural diversity and substrate type, with high and medium levels of structural diversity as well as open and rocky/gravel substrates contributing most to structural connectivity. By contrast, water cover was the best model of all environmental factors following landscape genetic optimization. The river is thus a major barrier to gene flow, while of the typical anthropogenic factors only buildings showed an effect. Nonetheless, using SDMs as a basis for landscape genetic optimization provided the highest ranked model for functional connectivity. Optimizing SDMs in this way can provide a sound basis for models of gene flow of the cityscape, and elsewhere, while presence-only and presence-absence modelling approaches showed differences in performance. Additionally, interpretation of results based on SDM factor importance can be misleading, dictating more thorough analyses following optimization of SDMs. Such approaches can be adopted for management strategies, for example aiming to connect native common wall lizard populations or disconnect them from non-native introduced populations, which are currently spreading in many cities in Central Europe.

AB  - The prevailing trend of increasing urbanization and habitat fragmentation makes knowledge of species' habitat requirements and distribution a crucial factor in conservation and urban planning. Species distribution models (SDMs) offer powerful toolboxes for discriminating the underlying environmental factors driving habitat suitability. Nevertheless, challenges in SDMs emerge if multiple data sets - often sampled with different intention and therefore sampling scheme - can complement each other and increase predictive accuracy. Here, we investigate the potential of using recent data integration techniques to model potential habitat and movement corridors for Eurasian red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris), in an urban area. We constructed hierarchical models integrating data sets of different quality stemming from unstructured on one side and semi-structured wildlife observation campaigns on the other side in a combined likelihood approach and compared the results to modeling techniques based on only one data source - wherein all models were fit with the same selection of environmental variables. Our study highlights the increasing importance of considering multiple data sets for SDMs to enhance their predictive performance. We finally used Circuitscape (version 4.0.5) on the most robust SDM to delineate suitable movement corridors for red squirrels as a basis for planning road mortality mitigation measures. Our results indicate that even though red squirrels are common, urban habitats are rather small and partially lack connectivity along natural connectivity corridors in Berlin. Thus, additional fragmentation could bring the species closer to its limit to persist in urban environments, where our results can act as a template for conservation and management implications.

AB  - The San Bernardino kangaroo rat (Dipodomys merriami parvus) is a federally listed endangered species endemic to Southern California and limited to three remaining populations. Its native habitat of alluvial fan sage scrub faces many anthropogenic threats, including urban and agricultural development, and the resulting flood control and fire suppression. With the loss of natural processes such as scouring or burning from floods and fires, the mosaic of seral stages across the landscape has shifted to dense vegetation, and active restoration may be necessary to provide suitable habitat for the San Bernardino kangaroo rat. Species distribution modeling using the partitioned Mahalanobis distance method on all occurrence points collected in the past 16 years revealed that alluvial scrub cover and fluvent soils were most strongly associated with San Bernardino kangaroo rat occupancy. Through surveys at 14 locations across the species' range, we identified non-native grass cover, shrub cover, bare ground and sandy soils as microhabitat features related to San Bernardino kangaroo rat abundance. We also calculated the optimal range of cover for each habitat type that was correlated with higher kangaroo rat abundance. The results of this multiple-model approach can be used by the agencies to assess the value of conserved habitat, set targets for microhabitat enhancement to facilitate population growth and expansion, or identify receiver sites should translocation be required for recovery. This work lays the foundation for more coordinated and strategic restoration efforts, given the compressed and rigid timelines of development projects that continue to impact remaining San Bernardino kangaroo rat populations.

AB  - Wetlands are among the most vulnerable ecosystems, stressed by habitat loss and degradation from expanding and intensifying agricultural and urban areas. Climate change will exacerbate the impacts of habitat loss by altering temperature and rainfall patterns. Wetlands within Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR) catchment are not different, stressed by extensive cropping, urban expansion, and alteration for grazing. Understanding how stressors affect wildlife is essential for the effective management of biodiversity values and minimizing unintended consequences when trading off the multiple values wetlands support. Impact assessment is difficult, often relying on an aggregation of ad hoc observations that are spatially biased toward easily accessible areas, rather than systematic and randomized surveys. Using a large aggregate database of ad hoc observations, this study aimed to examine the influence of urban proximity on machine-learning models predicting taxonomic richness and assemblage turnover, relative to other habitat, landscape, and climate variables, for vertebrates dwelling in the wetlands of the GBR catchment. The distance from the nearest city was, by substantial margins, the most influential factor in predicting the richness and assemblage turnover of all vertebrate groups, except fish. Richness and assemblage turnover was predicted to be greatest nearest the main urban centers. The extent of various wetland habitats was highly influential in predicting the richness of all groups, while climate (predominately the rainfall in the wettest quarter) was highly influential in predicting assemblage turnover for all groups. Bias of survey records toward urban centers strongly influenced our ability to model wetland-affiliated vertebrates and may obscure our understanding of how vertebrates respond to habitat loss and climate change. This reinforces the need for randomized and systematic surveys to supplement existing ad hoc surveys. We urge modelers in other jurisdictions to better portray the potential influence of survey biases when modeling species distributions.

AB  - Despite its importance as a component of urban green spaces, as far as we are aware no study has focused on plant diversity in urban green corridors (GCs). Therefore, this study aimed at: (i) characterizing tree and shrub communities in Lisbon's GCs and (ii) assessing whether GCs' users value trees and shrubs. We counted Lisbon's GCs users in the same places where we assessed the tree and shrub community. Along the nine GCs, we observed trees and shrubs belonging to 70 species, distributed across 35 families with most (>= 50%) species and plants being trees, exotic, pollinated by insects, with fruit dispersion by animals, evergreen leaves, and producing dry fruits. Most GCs had a similar number of users (20-30 users h(-1) survey(-1)) except for those of Central and Ribeirinho, which were more frequented (60 and 100 users h(-1) survey(-1), respectively). Most users (>= 50%) were adults, walking accompanied, and performing leisure activities. Finally, the number of users was shown to be influenced by: (i) tree and shrub relative abundance, confirming that users preferred greener corridors; and (ii) function(s), showing that users preferred the most multifunctional GCs (i.e., GCs fulfilling ecological, cultural, and recreational functions). Our data suggest that Lisbon's GCs favor more the inclusion of citizens than ecological functionality and resilience.

AB  - Anthropogenic changes, such as land use and climate change, are the greatest threats to biodiversity, especially for amphibians, which are the most endangered vertebrate class worldwide. Species distribution modelling was applied to assess how expected future climate and land cover change scenarios might influence the geographic distribution and habitat connectivity of four salamanders endemic to Mexico: Aquiloeurycea cephalica (Cope, 1865), Isthmura bellii (Gray, 1850), Pseudoeurycea robertsi (Taylor, 1939), and Pseudoeurycea leprosa (Cope, 1869). For this, the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) with two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 45 and RCP 85) and two modelling methods (Maxent in ENMeval and an ensemble model in biomod2) were used. The most important environmental variables explaining the distribution of the target species, as well as the environmental niche overlap between them, were also determined. Abies forest cover was one of the most important variables explaining the current distribution of P. robertsi (contribution of 39%), P. leprosa (contribution of 18%), and A. cephalica (contribution of 22%) with a positive effect. The distribution of these three species was also limited by maximum temperatures, whereas the I. bellii distribution was more limited by minimum temperatures. The environmental niches of P. leprosa and A. cephalica were significantly similar (D = 0.637, I = 0.801, p-value = 0.02), as well as the environmental niches of P. robertsi and P. leprosa (D = 0.640, I = 0.797, p-value = 0.01). As expected, all salamander species were predicted to face a reduction in their potential distribution (reductions between 2.64 and 32.16%) and landscape connectivity (reductions between 4.93 and 73.92%) under future scenarios of climate and land cover change. Different models and scenarios were inconsistent in determining which species' distribution would suffer the biggest reduction in the future. However, P. robertsi suffered the largest reduction in connectivity under both scenarios of climate change. Similarly, our results suggest that Sierra de las Cruces and Corredor Biol acute accent ogico Chichinautzin are very important areas in terms of connectivity. Unfortunately, great losses of Abies and Pinus forests were also predicted to occur in these areas between 2011 and 2014. According to these findings, the preservation of Abies forests of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt is essential to preserve P. robertsi, P. leprosa, and A. cephalica salamanders, whereas the preservation of Corredor Biol acute accent ogico Chichinautzin and Sierra de las Cruces is essential to maintain landscape connectivity for P. leprosa, A. cephalica, and I. bellii. Thus, these areas should be prioritized in conservation programs.

AB  - Invasions of exotic forest insects and pathogens can devastate evolutionarily naive habitats and could cause irreversible changes to urban and natural ecosystems. Given the ever-increasing volume of trade in wood and plant stock worldwide, establishment of non-native pests under climate change is one of the most important forest health concerns currently. The European spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus, is a damaging, phloem-feeding insect of Norway spruce, Picea abies, in Eurasia. Endoconidiophora polonica is the most virulent ophiostomatoid fungal associate of I. typographus. Spruce species native to North America are susceptible to this insect-pathogen complex. We studied the suitability of 'current' (1970-2000) and future climates (2021-2100) in Canada and the United States for these two species via ensemble species distribution models. We also determined overlapping regions favorable to both I. typographus and E. polonica. Our results indicate that, currently, climate is particularly suitable for I. typographus and E. polonica in western Canada and throughout the United States. Northward shifts in climatic suitability are projected to occur in Canada for both species under climate change. By the end of the 21st century, a coast-to-coast corridor of climatic suitability for I. typographus and E. polonica will occur in Canada under high-temperature regimes.

AB  - The concept of green infrastructure (GI) seeks to identify and prioritize areas of high ecological value for wildlife and people, to improve the integration of natural values in landscape planning decisions. In 2018, the canton of Geneva, Switzerland, established a roadmap for biodiversity conservation, which includes the operationalization of GI covering 30% of the territory by 2030. In this paper, we demonstrate a GI mapping framework in the canton of Geneva. Our approach is based on the combined assessment of three 'pillars', namely species' distribution, landscape structure and connectivity, and ecosystem services, to optimize the allocation of conservation actions using the spatial prioritization software, Zonation. The identified priority conservation areas closely overlap existing natural reserves. Including the three pillars in the landscape prioritization should also improve adhesion to the GI idea, without undermining the protection of threatened species. With regards to land use planning, public and private land parcels with high values for GI may require specific incentives to maintain their desirable characteristics, as they are more likely to be degraded than areas with more building restrictions. Visualizing priority conservation areas in a spatially explicit manner will support decision-makers in Geneva to optimally allocate limited resources for ecosystem preservation.

AB  - Many species are threatened by global climate change, but plants are particularly vulnerable because, as sessile organisms, they are unable to move to areas with more suitable conditions as the climate changes. Instead they must rely on their seeds dispersing far and often to keep pace with a changing climate. This problem is exacerbated by the fragmentation of natural landscapes by clearing for agricultural or urban development, or similarly by a species requirement for particular soil types or topography.
   Models can help predict how different species will be affected by climate change. Most previous modelling work on predicting the persistence of plant and other species under climate change has been static, regression style modelling, known as climate envelope modelling. This has focussed on predicting where suitable environments for a species will likely occur under possible future climatic conditions, based on the species' distribution under current conditions. While the existence of suitable environments in a new climate is a necessary condition for a species' persistence, for sessile organisms such as plants, the ability of a species to move and colonise these suitable environments is also likely to be a major limitation. There is therefore a need for models that account for the dynamic processes involved in plant species' migration and colonisation in changing climates.
   This paper presents such a dynamic model, called PPunCC (Plant Persistence under Climate Change). We describe how the PPunCC model represents the important factors and processes likely to affect a plant species' capacity to migrate across a landscape fast enough to keep pace with a changing climate, such as the rate of climate change, the degree of landscape fragmentation, and the plant species' life history, seed production, dispersal, and establishment. We also discuss how the model could be used to inform management decisions regarding adaptation options such as assisted migration or the creation of large-scale corridors that increase the connectivity of fragmented landscapes in order to help species migrate naturally and find suitable environments in new climates.

AB  - Simple Summary Urban landscapes, though a primary contributor to habitat fragmentation, have the potential to facilitate habitat connectivity for native pollinator species, especially with strategic green space planning. Citizen science data have been proven to be useful to address conservation issues in urban areas, especially where knowledge is lacking about species richness and habitat preferences. In this study, we used data collected by a citizen science program between 2016 and 2018 to determine which families of pollinators were the most frequently observed in Seoul, with which habitats pollinators had the highest affinities, and what parts of the city facilitated habitat connectivity. We found that the most suitable habitats for multiple families were located in public parks, university campuses, and Cultural Heritage sites. These results are directly applicable in order to better understand urban planning stakes for pollinators and wildlife in general and provide avenues for improvement to recreate functional greenways in a dense city like Seoul. The preservation and restoration of habitats and ecological connectivity inside cities is crucial to ensure wildlife can find suitable areas to forage, rest and reproduce, as well as to disperse, thereby allowing metapopulation functioning. In this study, we used data collected by a citizen science program between 2016 and 2018 to determine which families of pollinators were the most frequently observed in Seoul and with which habitats pollinators had the highest affinities. Using species distribution modeling and landscape graph approaches, we located the main habitats and corridors to reinforce connectivity for six pollinator families. Finally, we identified habitats and corridors where conservation actions should be prioritized. In total, 178 species belonging to 128 genera and 60 families were observed. Hymenopterans were the most recorded, followed by dipterans and lepidopterans. The most suitable habitats for pollinators were constituted of public parks, university campuses, and Cultural Heritage sites. In a dense city like Seoul, most of the conservation corridors are located in built-up areas. Innovative urban planning and architecture are therefore required as well as the setting-up of ecological management practices to lead to a more sustainable urbanism for pollinators and wildlife in general.

AB  - Protected areas are becoming increasingly isolated. River corridors represent crucial links to the surrounding landscape but are also major conduits for invasion of alien species. We developed a framework to assess the risk that alien plants in watersheds adjacent to a protected area will invade the protected area along rivers. The framework combines species- and landscape-level approaches and has five key components: (l) definition of the geographical area of interest, (2) delineation of the domain into ecologically meaningful zones, (3) identification of the appropriate landscape units, (4) categorization of alien species and mapping of their distribution and abundance, and (5) definition of management options. The framework guides the determination of species distribution and abundance through successive, easily followed steps, providing the means for the assessment of areas of concern. We applied the framework to Kruger National Park (KAP) in South Africa. We recorded 231 invasive alien plant species (of which 79 were major invaders) in the domain. The KNP is facing increasing pressure from alien species in the upper regions of the drainage areas of neighboring watersheds. On the basis of the climatic modeling, we showed that most major riparian invaders have the ability to spread across the KNP should they be transported down the rivers, With this information, KNP managers can identify areas for proactive intervention, monitoring, and resource allocation. Even for a very large protected area such as the KNP, sustainable management of biodiversity will depend heavily on the response of land managers upstream managing alien plants. We suggest that this framework is applicable to plants and other passively dispersed species that invade protected areas situated at the end of a drainage basin.

AB  - The population of the mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella) in Israel has been on the increase since 1960, as a result of strict enforcement of the Wildlife Protection Law.  In several regions, this led to a high density of gazelle (up to 35 km-2) and to management of the population by controlled hunting.  A grazing intensity of 70 gazelle days ha-1 year-1 affects species composition and increases species diversity.  In order to conserve the full potential of species diversity, encouraging spatial variability in grazing intensities in the different landscape units is recommended.  However, even with low grazing density food crops are very attractive mainly in the dry Mediterranean summer, therefore only good fencing is successful in protecting farms from grazing damage.  Farm protection will leave a continuous habitat for gazelle, that in addition to its importance for the long-term health of the population will conserve the semi-natural landscape with multiple use for nature conservation, livestock ranching and outdoor recreation.  Such management could be implemented by controlled hunting and protection, and successful cooperation with farmers.

AB  - From November 2001 to January 2002, wintering birds were censused in 30 urban woodlands in Chiba City, near Tokyo, Japan, to determine the factors other than habitat area, influencing avian species composition and diversity in urban woodlands. A group of species such as Sturnus cineraceus and Columba livia were more frequently observed in sparser woodlands. These species are not typically categorized as woodland species, and they preferred mixed habitat of tree-covered vegetation and open areas. The birds of another group, including Streptopelia orientalis and Lanius bucephalus, which tend to use tree crowns as foraging habitat were more frequently observed in the woodlands surrounded by agricultural areas rather than in those surrounded by urbanized areas. This could be because those species can move across agricultural areas, but not urban areas, so that the effect of woodland isolation is not very remarkable for them when agricultural areas surrounded woodlands. On the other hand, some species preferred open area to vegetated area. A mixture of open space and woodlands would result in woodlands of reduced value for these woodland birds. Site planning that reduces the degree of interspersion should be adopted, if woodland habitat is to be conserved or restored. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim As accurate and up-to-date distribution data for plant species are rarely available, cumulative records over long periods of time are frequently used for mapping distributions, without taking into account that species do not persist in their historical localities forever. However, persistence is highly relevant in changing modern landscapes, especially for invasive species that dynamically spread in unstable human-made habitats. We studied how an invasive species, Heracleum mantegazzianum, persists at sites once colonized and how its ability to persist affects its distribution. Location The Czech Republic. Methods We visited 521 localities of H. mantegazzianum occurrence reported in the literature and herbaria to determine whether the species still occurs at these sites. By using G-tests and classification trees, we explored the roles of various factors affecting its persistence at a site. Results Of the total number of 521 historical sites at which the species has occurred since the end of the 19th century, it persists at only 124 (23.8%). The persistence rate differs with respect to habitat type and is highest in meadows and forest margins. Analysis using classification trees indicated that the factors that best explain persistence are: type of habitat (with meadow and forest margins over-represented); urbanity (with a higher persistence outside urban areas); proximity to the place of the species introduction into the country; metapopulation connectivity; and distance to the nearest neighbouring population. Main conclusions The use of cumulative historical records as a measure of species distribution, which is common in invasion literature, can seriously overestimate the actual distribution of alien plant species with low persistence. In the case of alien species such as H. mantegazzanium, which is non-clonal and reproduces only by seed, estimates of distribution and spread based on historical data are informative about potentially suitable habitat but may be unreliable as indicators of current occurrence and invasion dynamics.

AB  - Progress is required in response to how cities can support greater biodiversity. This calls for more research on how landscape designers can actively shape urban ecologies to deliver context-specific empirical bases for green space intervention decisions. Design experiments offer opportunities for implemented projects within real-world settings to serve as learning sites. This paper explores preliminary ecological outcomes from a multidisciplinary team on whether purposefully engineered native grassland gardens provide more habitat functions for insects than mainstream gardens in the City of Tshwane, South Africa. Six different sites were sampled: two recently installed native grassland garden interventions (young native), two contemporary non-native control gardens (young non-native) on the same premises and of the same ages as the interventions, one remnant of a more pristine native grassland reference area (old native), and one long-established, non-native reference garden (old non-native). Plant and insect diversity were sampled over one year. The short-term findings suggest that higher plant beta diversity (species turnover indicating heterogeneity in a site) supports greater insect richness and evenness in richness. Garden size, age, and connectivity were not clear factors mediating urban habitat enhancement. Based on the preliminary results, the researchers recommend high native grassland species composition and diversity, avoiding individual species dominance, but increasing beta diversity and functional types when selecting garden plants for urban insect biodiversity conservation in grassland biomes.

AB  - Aim: Habitat fragmentation and alien species are among the leading causes of biodiversity loss. In an attempt to reduce the impact of forestry on natural systems, networks of natural corridors and patches of natural habitat are often maintained within the afforested matrix, yet these can be subject to degradation by invasion of non-native species. Both habitat fragmentation and alien invasive species disrupt the complex interaction networks typical of native communities. This study examines whether an invasive plant and/or the fragmented nature of the forestry landscape influences natural flower visitation networks (FVNs), flower-visitor abundance and richness or flower/visitor species composition.
   Location: The species rich and diverse grasslands in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, South Africa is under threat from transformation, particularly by commercial forestry plantations, restricting much of the remaining untransformed grasslands into remnant grassland patches (RGPs). Remaining patches are under additional threat from the invasive Rubus cuneifolius Pursh (bramble). Sites were established in RGPs and in a nearby protected area (PA), with and without brambles present for both areas.
   Results: Flower abundance and flower area of native plant species were greater within RGP than in PA, but only in the absence of R. cuneifolius. Flower-visitor assemblages differed between invaded and uninvaded sites and also differed between PA and RGP sites. Both areas lost specialist flower-visitor species in the presence of brambles. Network modularity was greatly reduced by the presence of bramble, indicating a reduction in complexity and organization. The structure of FVNs was otherwise unaffected by presence of bramble or being located in RGPs or the PA.
   Main conclusions: The RPGs contribute to regional biodiversity conservation through additional compositional diversity and intact FVNs. Rubus cuneifolius reduces ecological complexity of both RGPs and PAs, however, and its removal must be prioritized to conserve FVNs.

AB  - Severe losses in biodiversity hotspots reduce global insect diversity. Renosterveld is a critically endangered and biologically diverse ecosystem occurring only in the fynbos biome of the Cape Floristic Region (CFR), a recognized global biodiversity hotspot. Following agricultural intensification, less than 5% natural renosterveld vegetation remains in the Swartland of South Africa's Western Cape. Remaining renosterveld is highly fragmented and confined to land less suited to agriculture, including steep slopes and rocky outcrops. These fragments vary in their environmental conditions at the local (e.g. microhabitat, floral diversity and density) and the landscape (e.g. patch size, habitat connectivity and surrounding crop cover) level. The influence of these environmental variables on butterfly diversity at a landscape scale in the CFR is not fully understood. We selected 32 sites across the Swartland and surveyed for butterflies to determine the effect of environmental variables on butterfly diversity, specifically butterfly species richness, abundance and composition. Overall, we found 2861 individuals of 27 species. Our findings suggest that crop cover in the surrounding landscape affects butterfly diversity at a small landscape scale (<500m radius) in the CFR. Flower species richness and microhabitat type impact species richness and abundance. Patch size is a key predictor of species diversity particularly for endemics and site quality may influence species composition. All renosterveld patches regardless of size and site quality can be considered valuable for butterflies in this highly fragmented landscape.

AB  - Agroforestry systems maintain intermediate levels of biodiversity between natural forests and purely agricultural land-uses and may therefore increase connectivity or sustain biodiversity in fragmented forest landscapes. This hypothesis is tested by comparing the species richness and similarity in species composition between forest fragments and agroforestry systems in two landscapes in Guatemala. Connectivity indices were calculated based on the similarity of biodiversity held between forest and agroforestry. Tree and ant species richness was significantly higher for forest than agroforestry land-uses. Conversely, species richness of leaf hoppers (Cicadellidae) was lower in forests compared to agroforests. Chao-Sorensen estimates indicated a high proportion of ant species were shared (0.78-0.99) between different agroforestry land-uses and forest fragments, but lower proportions of tree (0.39-0.55) and leaf hopper species (0.42-0.65). Including the contribution of agroforestry systems in estimates of forest connectivity, based on their biodiversity relative to forest, substantially increased the land area rated with high connectivity (by 100-300%) and forest edge connectivity (by 70-170%), but had negligible impact on land area rated as dense forest. The major forest fragments in the two landscapes were linked by land rated as medium connectivity for forest biodiversity. Thus, agroforestry contributes to the capacity of the landscape to support biodiversity, but only partially increases connectivity between forest fragments in the two landscapes studied. If these benefits are to be sustained, consideration needs to be given to the incentives for land-owners to maintain agroforestry systems.

AB  - Uncontrolled urban development is threatening the survival of many terrestrial species worldwide, especially those with limited dispersal capabilities. Soil invertebrates account for a high proportion of the global biodiversity but there are few studies on how soil biodiversity varies with different parameters of landscape structure, especially in fragmented tropical habitats. Millipedes are among the most abundant detritivore invertebrates in the soil-litter macrofauna. We examined the relationships between soil millipede diversity and landscape structure in 12 forest patches of approximately 30 years of age, in northeastern Puerto Rico. Spatial characteristics of the landscape were determined from aerial color photographs and were digitized into a GIS package for analysis. Millipede species diversity and composition in these forest patches showed correlations with their surroundings (e.g. amount of forest in the matrix) and with the presence of vegetation corridors that connected to other forest patches, rather than forest patch attributes such as patch area and shape. Millipede species richness correlated negatively with the degree of isolation of forest patch (within 600 m radius), while species evenness correlated positively to the amount of forest within a 50 m buffer. Millipede species composition was related with the presence of vegetation corridors and the distance to the Luquillo Experimental Forest reserve. These findings show that a low degree of patch isolation, forested buffers, and presence of vegetation corridors need to be considered for the conservation and management of forest patches surrounded by urban developments, especially to protect terrestrial invertebrate species that require forested habitats for their dispersal.

AB  - Temporary aquatic environments are widespread in the world, and although there are considerable regional differences in their type and method of formation they have many physical, chemical and biological properties in common. With the aim to increase knowledge of urban temporary pool fauna, the objectives of this work were to assess the seasonal patterns of species composition, richness, and diversity of the aquatic insect community inhabiting rain pools in urban temperate Argentina, and to identify the environmental variables associated to these patterns. Four temporary pools of an urban green space in Buenos Aires City were studied throughout a 1-year period. Eleven flood cycles with very varied hydroperiods and dry periods, mainly associated with rainfall, were identified. Insect species richness in these temporary urban pools, 86 taxa were documented, was found to be within the range reported for wild temporary water bodies of other regions of the world. The present results provide evidence for the existence of a clear link between habitat and community variability. Hydroperiod and seasonality were the main environmental factors involved in structuring the insect communities of the studied water bodies. Urban pools in green spaces have the potential to act to its dwellers like corridors through the urban matrix. Taking into account these characteristics and their accessibility, urban temporary pools can be considered as promising habitats for the study of ecological processes involving the insect community.

AB  - Many organisms persist in fragmented habitat where movement between patches is essential for long-term demographic and genetic stability. In the absence of direct observation of movement, connectivity or isolation metrics are useful to characterize potential patch-level connectivity. However, multiple metrics exist at varying levels of complexity, and empirical data on species distribution are rarely used to compare performance of metrics. We compared 12 connectivity metrics of varying degrees of complexity to determine which metric best predicts the distribution of prairie dog colonies along an urban gradient of 385 isolated habitat patches in Denver, Colorado, USA. We found that a modified version of the incidence function model including area-weighting of patches and a cost-weighted distance surface best predicted occupancy, where we assumed roads were fairly impermeable to movement, and low-lying drainages provided dispersal corridors. We also found this result to be robust to a range of cost weight parameters. Our results suggest that metrics should incorporate both patch area and the composition of the surrounding matrix. These results provide guidance for improved landscape habitat modeling in fragmented landscapes and can help identify target habitat for conservation and management of prairie dogs in urban systems.

AB  - This paper demonstrates the importance of the remaining urban forests, and the related policy and management issues, by reviewing the current situation in Sydney, Australia. Transport corridor vegetation surveys are used to show challenges and implications for the future.
   The process of medium to long-term policy formulation, with initial management strategy development at the local level, is outlined. This study also addresses the increasing need for integration with other urban issues, including the existing general urban forest strategies. The benefits of using active remote sensing technologies are illustrated by using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to generate a high resolution, 3-dimensional surface model.
   Among the major transport corridors in the Sydney metropolitan area, segments of two long-established main roads were selected for detailed studies of the roadside forest resource. Data analysis indicated that roadside trees are very diverse and distributed in a patchy way. Some areas are treeless and some have dense stands. The results also showed high variability in species composition between local areas, with canopy cover and shading varying widely. We identify a number of issues and lessons from conservation, pollution and socio-economic perspectives, which have broader applications, and relate these findings back to policies and planning.

AB  - Differences in alpha and beta bat diversity among montane rainforest and five shaded coffee plantations under different management regimes, as well as some environmental factors and vegetation parameters influencing bat richness, were evaluated for the first time in southeastern Chiapas, Mexico. In each site, bats were captured every 2 months from March 2004 to July 2005, with six mist-nets, during two nights, using the capture-recapture method. We captured 2970 individuals of 43 bat species. Montane rainforest had the greatest alpha diversity (H' = 2.681; n = 37), whereas alpha diversity was similar among coffee plantations (H' = 2.229-2.364; n = 23-26). The number of frugivorous and nectarivorous species was similar among the sites; the greatest exchange in species composition (beta diversity) occurred for insectivorous bats, which reduce their number in coffee plantations as pesticides are incorporated. Bat richness species was significantly related to the number of vegetation strata, height, and cover of trees. We suggest that coffee plantations could act as corridors, facilitating connection among different elements of the landscape in the Sierra Madre de Chiapas for some frugivorous and nectarivorous bats.

AB  - The general lack of trees in the Great Plains has limited colonization by eastern woodland mammals in the past, but recent expansion of forests in corridors along prairie waterways and in towns has enabled an assortment of woodland species to expand distributional ranges westward. The evening bat (Nycticeius humeralis) historically occurred in woodlands throughout the eastern United States. Following our capture of the first evening bat in New Mexico, we updated the distributional range for this species by amassing recent records from published literature and museum voucher records west of its historic range published in 1981, the last time the species distribution was updated throughout its range. We document that evening bats, including some reproductively active populations, now occur across much of the central and southern Great Plains, including southwestern Nebraska, western Kansas, and western Texas. Such records should encourage researchers to factor in the possible occurrence of this species beyond published historic western limits for mist-netting and acoustic surveys. While it remains unclear if the single capture in southwestern New Mexico represented a wandering individual, these compiled records suggest that established populations might occur west of our updated distribution for the species.

AB  - Climate and land-cover changes are major threats to biodiversity, and their impacts are expected to intensify in the future. Protected areas (PAs) are crucial for biodiversity conservation. However, their effectiveness under future climate and land-cover changes remains to be evaluated. Moreover, the impacts of climate and land-cover changes on multi-dimensions of biodiversity are rarely considered when expanding PAs. Using distributions of 8,732 woody species in China and species distribution models, we identified species that will be threatened by future climate and land-cover changes (i.e. species with significant projected loss of suitable habitats by the 2070s) under different dispersal scenarios. We then estimated the geographical patterns in species richness (SR) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) of threatened species, evaluated the effectiveness (i.e. the changes in SR and PD) of Chinese PAs and identified conservation priorities for future PA expansion. Approximately 12%-38% of woody species will be threatened under different scenarios. These species tend to be clustered in the tree of life, and their SR and PD show consistent spatial patterns, being highest at low latitudes. PAs currently protect 90% of threatened species. However, their SR and PD of threatened species within PAs will decrease by 30%-40% by the 2070s, which reduces the PA effectiveness, especially for PAs at low elevations and those with low topographic heterogeneity and high natural vegetation loss. The conservation priorities identified from the SR and PD of the threatened species are mainly in mountains in southern China, the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and Taiwan Island. PA expansion and ecological corridors in these regions are needed to conserve threatened species. Synthesis and applications. We present a systematic study of the impacts of future climate and land-cover changes on the conservation status of woody species and PA effectiveness in China. Our results suggest that future climate and land-cover changes will reduce PA effectiveness, and the spatial prioritization of biodiversity conservation should consider the influences of future global changes on biodiversity. These results shed new light on the conservation priorities for the post-2020 expansion of PAs in China.

AB  - The biodiversity crisis and ecosystem degradation caused by habitat destruction and human activities can be reduced by organizing protected areas. However, many protected areas currently take the form of green islands, which has led to serious habitat isolation in many places. We thus introduce herein a landscape-scale adjoining conservation (LAC) approach for the protection and restoration of ecosystems across the boundaries between protected areas and surrounding non-protected areas. The strategy of the LAC approach is to effectively expand conservation areas by connecting isolated areas of important ecosystems or habitats outside of protected areas. The methodology of the LAC approach involves integrated analyses that consider both habitat quality and landscape patterns. Forest-habitat quality is characterized by species composition and stand structure, and habitat connectivity is quantified by the max patch area of habitat and total habitat area. The focal statistic is useful for examining habitat clumps that result from landscape fragmentation. As a case study, we apply the LAC approach to adjoining restoration of broadleaf Korean pine mixed forest on the Changbai Mountain in northeastern China. We developed a metric called the Restoration Efficiency of Landscape Expansion (RELE) to evaluate the LAC approach. The results indicate that a minimal restoration effort can produce significant effects in terms of the expansion of contiguous habitat, as quantified by RELE.

AB  - A fundamental tenet of modern ecology and conservation science is the fact that species occurrence in habitat patches can be determined by patch area and isolation. But such island biogeographic models often poorly predict actual species occurrences in structurally complex landscapes that typify most ecosystems. Recent advances in circuit theory have enhanced estimates of species dispersal and can provide powerful ways to predict landscape-scale distribution of species assemblages through integration with island biogeography. Applying such an integrative analytical framework to 43 bird species in Tanzania improved model fit by an average of 2.2-fold over models where patch isolation was estimated without accounting for landscape matrix heterogeneity. This approach also allowed us to assess species-specific dispersal rates and quantify differences among land cover types in their permeability to animal movement. These results reaffirm the utility of foundational island biogeographic principles, yet with an important caveat. Two-thirds of the variance in species occurrence in habitat fragments can be explained simply by patch area and isolation, conditional on isolation explicitly accounting for the spatial configuration of different land cover types in the landscape matrix.

AB  - Urban trails and greenspaces have become ubiquitous features in cities, in part due to their ability to provide ecological benefits to the built-up environment. A major factor in their popularity is their potential to enhance habitat connectivity by bridging the gaps between remnant patches across urbanized areas, however, information on the structure and function of greenways themselves is limited. In this study we examined how greenways serve as distinct habitats in their own right by characterizing the vegetative structure of the Capital Area Greenway (CAG) in Raleigh, NC. We conducted a systematic vegetation survey of woody vegetation along 39 km of trails (354 random plots) in 2016 and identified environmental variables related to site conditions (percent canopy cover, stream proximity, flood zones), management efforts (designated conservation areas), and local anthropogenic activities (percent impervious surface, street proximity). We preformed three types of multivariate analyses (non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS), multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP), and indicator species analysis (ISA)) to distinguish potential influences on species distribution and community structure. We observed highly diverse riparian, upland mesic, and xeric forest communities within the CAG. Results from NMS and MRPP suggested that vegetation patterns can be differentiated based on local environmental variables. Sites located in conservation areas and floodplains, for instance, were typically found at further distances from streets and were characterized by greater basal area, canopy cover, and higher non-native species richness. Individual study sites were highly diverse and varied even within similar local environments. Our findings indicate that the CAG serves as established natural habitat for native vegetation, supporting the idea that greenways can be used to enhance environmental quality in cities as ecological corridors.

AB  - Climate shifts during the Quaternary Period have driven changes in regional range dynamics for many species, influencing population structure of species and in some cases promoting speciation. Within southern Africa, the psammophine snakes Psammophis trinasalis and P. namibensis were historically considered subspecies of P. leightoni but were elevated to species rank based on ecological differences. Preliminary phylogenetic analyses suggested intraspecific, not interspecific genetic variation between these taxa, but this finding was based on very limited data and could not be confirmed. To assess the level of genetic differentiation within the P. leightoni species complex, we explored the evolutionary history of these snakes by combining phylogenetic analyses, species distribution modelling and an examination of morphology. We generated a comprehensive, multi-gene phylogeny for Psammophis that included wider geographic sampling of the three species in the complex. Using this phylogeny, Bayesian and distance-based species delimitation analyses showed intraspecific, not interspecific divergences between taxa in the complex, suggesting that they collectively represent a single taxon. Furthermore, non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis of scalation characters showed no differences between the species. Moreover, palaeo-modelling at three time periods since the last interglacial period suggest that there have been varying levels of connectivity between these taxa, which has likely facilitated gene flow between them. Given the evidence, we propose that the P. leightoni complex represents a single species and therefore formally synonymise the three species.

AB  - We evaluated how the taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversities of butterflies and their community-weighted traits are affected by urbanization in the southeastern Brazilian Atlantic Forest. For this purpose, a dataset of Nymphalidae species distributed across 15 urban, semiurban, and rural fragments was analyzed. Urbanization was defined by a set of environmental variables. Furthermore, the total area of each fragment was also considered in the analyses but did not influence the results, in which disturbance level and patch connectivity drove the environmental variation across the urban matrix. Species diversity increased towards the more connected fragments, while phylogenetic and functional diversity did not vary in relation to urbanization. A high forewing:hindwing ratio and the frequency of tiger-like wings were positively related to the urban fragments, while a low forewing:hindwing ratio and iridescent wings were related to the semiurban and rural fragments. The suitability of highly interconnected rural habitats for the maintenance of butterfly diversity was corroborated as expected. Nonetheless, our results also showed that semiurban fragments preserved the ecologically relevant traits of butterflies related to forested habitats, expressed in butterfly groups possibly linked with dispersal capability to avoid predation. Careful management of semiurban fragments and urban landscaping, including highly structured and native vegetation outside urban parks, may increase the functional and taxonomic diversities or at least maintain the current levels of functionality in the urban matrix. Thus, it is possible to preserve the biological diversity of native fauna and flora and recover relevant ecosystem services, ensuring the conservation of Neotropical urban centers.

AB  - Urban forests adjacent to interstate corridors are understudied ecosystems across cities. Despite their small area, these forests may be strategically located to provide large ecosystem services due to their ability to act as a barrier against air pollutants and noise as well as to provide flood control. The woody vegetation composition and structure of forests adjacent to urban interstates is an important determinant of their ability to provide these services. However, these forest communities may be particularly susceptible to the introduction of exotic invasive species via the interstate and the surrounding city that can potentially alter current and future forest composition. The purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of native and exotic woody vegetation and tree regeneration in forests along three interstate corridors in Louisville, KY, and to determine potential factors (e.g., traffic density) that are correlated with patterns in the woody vegetation community. We found the most important determinants of vegetation composition along these interstate corridors were the distance from the city center and the presence of an exotic invasive shrub, Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii). Compared with forested plots within 10 km of the city center, plots further from the city center had 81% lower stem density of Amur honeysuckle, 96% higher tree seedling regeneration, and 51% greater woody plant species richness. The primarily native species composition of adult trees in forests alongside urban interstates in Louisville and the regeneration of native tree species provide optimism that these forests can maintain native species while experiencing multiple impacts from the interstate as well as from the surrounding city, emphasizing their important potential for maintaining natural forest functions across the urban landscape.

AB  - Estimating species density and abundance is challenging but important for establishing conservation and management strategies. Significant progress has been made toward estimating Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) abundance in the conterminous United States of America (USA) but much less is known about eagle abundance in Alaska. Here, we paired migration count and GPS-tracking data collected near Gunsight Mountain, Alaska, in a Bayesian framework to estimate the number of Golden Eagles in southcentral Alaska. We estimated 1204 (95% credible interval: 866, 1526) potentially breeding (similar to 4 yr old) Golden Eagles annually moved through the Gunsight Mountain migration corridor and summered over an area of 150,325 km(2) in south-central Alaska, equating to a density of 0.80 potentially breeding eagles/100 km(2). By extrapolating across the species' nesting range in Alaska (1,180,489 km(2)) and incorporating published productivity and age-specific survival rates for eagles <4 yr old into our hierarchical model, we estimated 12,717 (95% credible interval: 9043, 16,349) Golden Eagles of all ages occur in Alaska, annually. We propose this as a conservative statewide population estimate because we used methods that likely underestimated population size. Even so, our estimate is three to five times larger than previous estimates and likely represents about one quarter of the USA's population.

AB  - Although freshwater ecosystems contain high biodiversity and provide valuable ecosystem services, they are severely threatened worldwide. Many broad-scale approaches to conserve freshwater environments have been proposed, but as headwaters tend to host higher levels of biodiversity, identifying priority areas for conservation at a local scale is essential. An integrative three-step framework is proposed to recognize such areas, using anomuran crabs of the family Aeglidae as biodiversity indicator taxa, within four freshwater ecoregions in South America. First, the knowledge on the distribution of species occurring within the study area was updated and the species conservation status assessed. Second, species distribution modelling was used to identify areas of high richness and endemism. Third, these areas were compared with the existing protected area network, in addition to land-use and urban information, to indicate priority areas for conservation within four freshwater ecoregions (Laguna dos Patos, Upper Uruguay, Lower Uruguay, Tramandai and Mampituba) studied at a local scale. Analysis of the distribution of species of the genus Aegla showed that the present protected area network poorly covers freshwater habitats within the study region. Three priority areas for conservation were identified, with high levels of endemism and richness of aeglid species. These areas are mainly located close to current protected areas, and we suggest, therefore, that the enlargement of some protected areas, through the establishment of corridors, would better protect several species with distributions restricted to headwaters, such as macroinvertebrates and fishes, some of which are threatened with extinction.

AB  - In face of a dramatic decline of wild bee species in many rural landscapes, potential conservation functions of urban areas gain importance. Yet effects of urbanization on pollinators, and in particular on wild bees remain ambiguous and not comprehensively understood. This is especially true for amenity grassland and extensively managed wastelands within large-scale residential housing areas. Using Berlin as a study region we aimed to investigate (a) if these greenspaces are accepted by wild bee assemblages as foraging habitats; (b) how assemblage structure of bees and individual bee species are affected by different habitat (e.g., management, flower density) and urban matrix variables (e.g., isolation, urbanization); and (c) to what extent grassland restoration can promote bees in urban environments. In summer 2012, we collected 62 bee species belonging to more than 20% of the taxa known for Berlin. Urbanization significantly affected species composition of bees; 18 species were affiliated to different levels of urbanization. Most bee species were not affected by any of the environmental variables tested, and urbanization had a negative effect only for one bee species. Further, we determined that restoration of diverse grasslands positively affected bee species richnesss in urban environments. We conclude that differently structured and managed greenspaces in large-scale housing areas can provide additional foraging habitats and refuges for pollinators. This supports approaches towards a biodiversity friendly management within urban regions and may be of particular importance given that anthropogenic pressure is increasing in many rural landscapes.

AB  - Mexico's Pleistocene terrestrial mammal record includes 13 orders, 44 families, 147 genera and 280 species, thus is comparable to the Recent one, but shows greater ordinal and family diversity. Post-Pleistocene extinction chiefly involved meso- and megabaric species. The mammal, palynologic and paleosol records are strongly time and space biased in favor of Late Rancholabrean data from a few morphotectonic provinces; hence, only broad climatic trends could be delineated, which approximately coincide with those known for the Wisconsinan; they disclose by 25-12 ka, greater moisture and cooler temperature conditions than at present, coinciding too with a larger mammalian diversity and local faunas disharmony. Climate fluctuations impacted the fauna, causing species distribution changes and extinctions. The Recent fauna's complex biogeographic pattern reflects this; it includes tropical and temperate species associations outside their respective latitudes. Combining geologic and Recent mammal distribution data with the Pleistocene record, possible dispersal routes were detected: high and low land, southward corridors for temperate species, and low land, northward ones for tropical species. Finally, the existence of a single Mexican Rancholabrean Faunal Province is incompatible with mammal record's makeup and distribution, which calls for a multiprovince scheme to better understand Mexico's Pleistocene mammal biogeography and faunistics.

AB  - Background: Mexico is one of the world's centers of species diversity (richness) for Opuntia cacti. Yet, in spite of their economic and ecological importance, Opuntia species remain poorly studied and protected in Mexico. Many of the species are sparsely but widely distributed across the landscape and are subject to a variety of human uses, so devising implementable conservation plans for them presents formidable difficulties. Multi-criteria analysis can be used to design a spatially coherent conservation area network while permitting sustainable human usage.
   Methods and Findings: Species distribution models were created for 60 Opuntia species using MaxEnt. Targets of representation within conservation area networks were assigned at 100% for the geographically rarest species and 10% for the most common ones. Three different conservation plans were developed to represent the species within these networks using total area, shape, and connectivity as relevant criteria. Multi-criteria analysis and a metaheuristic adaptive tabu search algorithm were used to search for optimal solutions. The plans were built on the existing protected areas of Mexico and prioritized additional areas for management for the persistence of Opuntia species. All plans required around one-third of Mexico's total area to be prioritized for attention for Opuntia conservation, underscoring the implausibility of Opuntia conservation through traditional land reservation. Tabu search turned out to be both computationally tractable and easily implementable for search problems of this kind.
   Conclusions: Opuntia conservation in Mexico require the management of large areas of land for multiple uses. The multi-criteria analyses identified priority areas and organized them in large contiguous blocks that can be effectively managed. A high level of connectivity was established among the prioritized areas resulting in the enhancement of possible modes of plant dispersal as well as only a small number of blocks that would be recommended for conservation management.

AB  - Agriculture and urban development have destroyed 95% of native brushland habitat in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of south Texas. Therefore, habitat restoration is an important issue in the LRGV. Since 1982, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been replanting areas in the LRGV to native brushland species to establish a wildlife corridor along the lower reach of the Rio Grande. Vegetation composition of a mature brushland, a replanted habitat and an unaided secondary succession site (fallow field) were examined at one locale in the LRGV in 1999. The mature brushland edge plot had the highest species richness (43) followed by the replanted edge plot (37), mature brushland interior (35), replanted interior plot (33) and fallow field interior (12) and edge (11) plots. Edge and interior plots in the same habitat were similar in species composition (mature brushland, 74%; replanted, 63%; fallow field, 70%). Community similarity was greater for mature brushland and replanted habitats (47%) than the mature brushland and fallow field (32%), or the replanted and fallow field habitats (28%)'. These data suggest that current replanting techniques used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the LRGV achieve a more diverse plant community in a shorter length of time than unaided secondary succession of fallow fields.

AB  - Road and railway networks are pervasive elements of all environments, which have expanded intensively over the last century in all European countries. These transportation infrastructures have major impacts on the surrounding landscape, representing a threat to biodiversity. Roadsides and railways may function as corridors for dispersal of alien species in fragmented landscapes. However, only few studies have explored the spread of invasive species in relationship to transport network at large spatial scales. We performed a spatial mismatch analysis, based on a spatially explicit correlation test, to investigate whether alien plant species hotspots in Germany and Austria correspond to areas of high density of roads and railways. We tested this independently of the effects of dominant environments in each spatial unit, in order to focus just on the correlation between occurrence of alien species and density of linear transportation infrastructures. We found a significant spatial association between alien plant species hotspots distribution and roads and railways density in both countries. As expected, anthropogenic landscapes, such as urban areas, harbored more alien plant species, followed by water bodies. However, our findings suggested that the distribution of neobiota is strongest correlated to road/railways density than to land use composition. This study provides new evidence, from a transnational scale, that alien plants can use roadsides and rail networks as colonization corridors. Furthermore, our approach contributes to the understanding on alien plant species distribution at large spatial scale by the combination with spatial modeling procedures.

AB  - The present study analyzed the drosophilid assemblages in different levels of urbanization in the city of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Collections were carried out in 2008 in three different environments: a highly urbanized area-"Jardim BotA cent nico," a forested area with intermediary urbanization-"Parque Gabriel Knijnik," and in a relatively well-preserved forested area, although threatened by the urban growth-"Morro Santana." In Jardim BotA cent nico, 36 species belonging to four genera were found, with high abundance of exotic species as Drosophila simulans Sturtevant and Zaprionus indianus (Gupta). In Parque Gabriel Knijnik, 33 species that belonged to four genera were found, with higher abundances of native species belonging to the Drosophila tripunctata species group and Drosophila willistoni species subgroup, and lower abundance of exotic species. As for Morro Santana, 32 species and three genera were found, with higher abundances of native groups, low representativeness of exotic species, and absence of Zaprionus indianus. The analysis of the Jaccard index showed higher similarity in the species composition between samples collected in summer and autumn, and between samples collected in winter and spring. On the other hand, the Morisita index differentiated Jardim BotA cent nico from the other two studied sites. Our results show that Morro Santana is an important area of native biodiversity, reinforcing, therefore, the inclusion of this area in the project for the creation of an ecological corridor as proposed by the Ministry of the Environment of Brazil.

AB  - Biological communities in Mexico experienced profound changes in species composition and structure as a consequence of the environmental fluctuations during the Pleistocene. Based on the recent and fossil Mexican mammal checklists, we determine the distribution, composition, diversity, and community structure of late Pleistocene mammalian faunas, and analyze extinction patterns and response of individual species to environmental changes. We conclude that (1) differential extinctions occurred at family, genus, and species level, with a major impact on species heavier than 100 kg, including the extinction all proboscideans and several ruminants; (2) Pleistocene mammal communities in Mexico were more diverse than recent ones: and (3) the current assemblages of species are relatively young. Furthermore, Pleistocene relicts support the presence of biogeographic corridors; important refugia existed as well as centers of speciation in isolated regions. We identified seven corridors: eastern USA-Sierra Madre Oriental corridor, Rocky Mountains-Sierra Madre Occidental corridor, Central United States-Northern Mexico corridor, Transvolcanic Belt-Sierra Madre del Sur corridor, western USA-Baja California corridor, Tamaulipas-Central America gulf lowlands corridor, and Sonora-Central America Pacific lowlands corridor. Our study suggests that present mammalian assemblages are very different than the ones in the late Pleistocene. (C) 2010 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The expansion of urban environments is a major cause of species decline. Regulatory protection of rare species leads however to major conflicts between urban development and species protection. Here, we develop an interdisciplinary study to address three main issues concerning a legally protected endemic reed, Arundo donaciformis (Poaceae), threatened by urban development of the town of Frejus (Mediterranean France). First, we found an absence of genetic variation across the whole range of the species and that this species has a generalist ecological niche in ruderal habitats. These findings should facilitate its practical conservation. Second, a diachronic study revealed a decline of 50% of species distribution in the last twenty years. However, this species plays a dominant structural role in the urban network of green ways and on the banks of watercourses. It thus provides ecological services associated with riverbank stabilization and natural corridors between peripheral natural areas and urban green spaces. Third, sociological interviews revealed two contrasting perceptions of the species among local actors who view the plant either as a rare endemic species in regression or as a highly resistant, even invasive, weed of urban wastelands. Moreover, this protected species is quasi-absent from urban planning documents and locallactors show little comprehension of the need for conservation management, illustrative of another case of the "knowing-doing" gap.

AB  - The concept of nestedness represents a null model that measures the order in presence-absence matrices of species in different assemblages (Patterson & Atmar 1986, 2000). Based on the assumptions of the model, consequences of fragmentation and the vulnerability of species to habitat change can be quantified. Different species assemblages are considered to be nested perfectly, if subsets of one or more species are lost at a time as communities decline in species number and none of the species lost from the richer communities reappears in one of the species poor communities once it was lost. Nestedness is most prevalent in habitat fragments (islands) derived from a once continuous system with a common species pool that became isolated. The presence-absence matrix of species at given sites can be ordered in a way to maximize regularity. Then, the order of sites and species reflects habitat suitability of the sites and the vulnerability of a given species to fragmentation. This concept of nestedness is illustrated and used
   1. to derive estimates of minimum viable populations of lemurs in forest fragments of Madagascar;
   2. to learn, at which size a forest fagment is perceived as "forest" by Malagasy reptiles;
   3. to test whether the system of protected areas within the city of Hamburg represents a network for the local avifauna with species exchange or whether the single protected areas represent islands in the urban matrix;
   4. to link life history traits to the vulnerability of species to the urban environment and to develop hypotheses on the causes underlying the evolution of nested patterns. The analysis of the urban system revealed that the Protected areas within the city limits of Hamburg are perceived by birds as islands in an urban matrix. "Green" links between the areas do not act as corridors that allow free movement of all species. The vulnerability of any given bird species to fragmentation of woodland habitat within the city depends on its ability to use the urban matrix between the protected areas and seems to be related to the investments in egg-shell material. Species with high requirements for egg-shells disappear earlier from the community. Analyses of nested patterns can provide insights in biodiversity processes and valuable recommendations for decision making where longterm data are not available. The main values of the analyses of nested patterns, however, is to develop hypotheses that can then be tested with more detailed studies.

AB  - Riparian forests are essential for stream ecological processes in arid and semiarid regions, however, they are often highly altered by the rapid expansion of urban areas. To maintain riparian ecosystems services, it is important to better understand the effects of urbanization on riparian forests. We quantified the three-dimensional (3D) structure and woody species composition of a riparian corridor in Utah, USA, to evaluate patterns of vegetation along stream reaches that flow through distinct hydrologic domains (with gaining and losing reaches) and through a rapid rural-to-urban gradient. By using LiDAR imaging and field observations, we explore the extent to which the riparian vegetation structure follows patterns of topography linked to energy and water subsidies and patterns of human influence along the stream. Whereas natural reaches of Red Butte Creek were characterized by native vegetation and typical riparian species (e.g., Betula occidentalis), urbanized reaches had higher numbers of introduced plants (e.g., Acer platanoides) and more upland species (e.g., Quercus gambelii). Urban reaches were also characterized by exceptionally high trees (>18 m) in older residential neighbourhoods. In the natural area, canopy height was negatively correlated with height above the river (HAR). Additionally, we found higher cover and taller canopies on north-facing aspects. These results show that LiDAR data, in combination with ground observations, can reveal strong influences of hydrology as well as land use in different canopy layers of riparian forests. We suggest that the decision making of individual landowners shapes vegetation beyond natural hydrological patterns, with implications for riparian forest management and restoration.

AB  - Human activities associated with urbanization have negatively affected the biodiversity of native plant communities globally. Establishing native species assemblages on green roofs may help conserve native plant diversity in urban areas, but these assemblages are susceptible to colonization by species from the surrounding landscape. In natural communities, colonization from the regional species pool reflects the filtering effects of both abiotic and biotic factors, but the relative effects of these factors on green roof colonization are not well-understood. To address this knowledge gap, we studied colonization dynamics of 10 green roofs in New York City (NY, United States), each established at the same time with the same source materials. On each roof, 12 plots were established, with one-half of each plot planted with an erect C-4 graminoid dominant (Hempstead Plains: HP) and the other half with a tuft C-3 graminoid and forb dominant (Rocky Summit: RS) species assemblage derived from native communities. Six of the 12 split-plots contained shallow growing medium, while the other six contained deeper growing medium. Resident plants were planted in October 2010. Fifty-eight non-resident plant species colonized plots between August 2011 and August 2012, with two native and 10 non-native species accounting for 90% of total colonist dry mass. Colonist dry mass and richness decreased with increasing resident plant cover, but the effects of growing medium depth on colonist dry mass and richness differed between assemblages. Forbs accounted for 81% of the colonist dry mass from the HP assemblage, but just 31% in the RS assemblage. Further, forbs accounted for over 95% of colonist dry mass in June and July, while graminoids accounted for over 95% of colonist dry mass in August. These results indicate colonization of planted green roofs may be strongly affected by the composition of established plant assemblages and that these effects may vary temporally with colonist management regime, even within a single growing season. Further, the inconsistent effects of growing medium depth suggest that niche overlap and complementarity in rhizosphere dynamics may influence colonization more in some systems compared with others. Additional research is required to describe the effects of colonist management strategies, as well as the roles of priority effects, niche complementarity and community assembly, on long-term dynamics of colonization on green roofs planted with native plants.

AB  - Coastal habitats are very fragile and specialized environments susceptible to human activities and therefore vegetation ecology studies are needed to predict responses to landscape monitoring. There is little information about plant species invading human-made habitats, and no study has been carried out in Turkey on plant species distributed on coastal revetments. Therefore, the present study aimed to present the findings of a survey of plant species in relation to habitat factors to coastal revetments in the city of Trabzon (northeastern Turkey) and to identify and suggest species for future landscaping and environmental remediation works. The fieldwork was undertaken within the boundaries of Trabzon province. Data were collected along three habitat types regarding coastal revetments obtaining a total of 1,277 taxa collected from 46 different revetment areas including 150 sample plots. So, 169 plant species were identified, three of which were the most frequent with high presence of Conyza canadensis L. (44.67 %), Clematis vitalba L. (24.67 %) and Daucus carota (22.67 %). Using descriptive statistics of different diversity indices for plant species present in the three revetment types, significant variations were found in Shannon's diversity index (H'), species richness index (R') and Pielou's evenness index (J'). The results of the regression analysis of relationships between habitat factors and diversity of species indicated that distance from the road and distance from the sea totally affected the diversity and distribution of the species on coastal revetments. Consequently, the ecological roles of the species on coastal revetments are discussed in the conservation and management context. Therefore, when selecting plants to be used in the landscaping of coastal areas and deciding where they should be planted, habitat factors should be considered to have a significant effect on the alpha diversity of plants that can be suggested.

AB  - Urbanization particularly promotes habitat fragmentation, which in turn strongly affects biodiversity patterns. A major driver of species loss in isolated habitat patches is dispersal limitation. The relative importance of dispersal ability of species, spatial habitat configuration and local environmental conditions for predicting species composition is still unclear though. Addressing urban abandoned railway areas as study areas, we analyzed the relative importance of environmental versus landscape predictors (e.g. proportions of sealed, built-up and ruderal areas) using variation partitioning methods. To add the perspective of individual species dispersal ability, we characterized the effect of species traits on explained variation in species occurrence with a regression tree. The difference in explained variation in the occurrence of individual species (Delta Cfit) between a CCA with environmental predictors and environmental and landscape predictors together was analyzed.
   The results revealed that environmental predictors explained a slightly larger amount of variation than landscape predictors. Adding landscape predictors to the analysis with environmental predictors resulted in a sizeable increase in explained variation. The most important predictors in the CCA were photosynthetically active radiation, C/N-ratio in the soil and the proportion of ruderal habitats in the surroundings of the plots. The regression tree model showed higher Delta Cfit values for species with a long-term persistent soil seed bank. The lowest Delta Cfit values were found for species with a transient seed bank and long seeds.
   Linking dispersal-related traits to the predictability of species occurrence is a promising approach to reveal the interdependencies between environmental conditions, landscape configuration and species-specific dispersal abilities. Our results suggest that in fragmented urban habitats, a persistent seed bank is advantageous because it allows for stable populations once habitat patches have been colonized.

AB  - Civilization built around rivers directly affects riparian corridor structure and ecology. Degradation, pollution, and deterioration along riparian corridors in urban landscapes change species composition and biodiversity. Birds are one of the most vulnerable taxa to ecological changes. The main objective of our study was to spatially compare bird species richness, abundance, and community structure along the Asar River, an urban riparian corridor in Duzce, Turkey. We identified 63 bird species, comprising 6722 individuals, and classified them into one of three groups: generalist species (11 species), woodland species (40 species), and waterbird species (12 species). Bird species richness was positively related to vegetative cover and negatively to urbanization. Richness was low in the winter and was higher during spring and summer. Riparian Quality Index (RQI) scores (mean = 54.8 +/- 33.7; max. = 97 and min. = 5) were relatively low for all sampling plots and was reduced by human activities (e.g., roads, farmland, settlement). The number of woodland bird species changed positively (r = 0.71) with RQI. The generalist bird species, adapted to urbanization, were more common around settlements and open areas. Human population and settlement around Asar River increased one-third and farmland and natural habitat decreased onefifth during the last decade. The area has high potential for growth and increased urbanization, thus increasing the pressure on the natural areas. Activities that diminish the amount of tree cover in the riparian corridor should be avoided. Habitat restoration and rehabilitation will increase RQI values, which can be used as indicators for bird richness in urban landscapes and benefit avian diversity along the riparian corridor. The existing riparian corridor and any enhancements to the corridor will help conserve Duzce's biodiversity in the future.

AB  - The Accra Plain of Ghana is experiencing rapid urbanization, but there is scant information on its impact on local biodiversity. We assessed the changes in land use/land cover of the Accra Plain since 1991 and evaluated how the observed changes have influenced local small mammals in forest fragments. We applied supervised classification and intensity analysis time-series Landsat imagery data to assess land use/land cover changes between 1991 and 2017. Small mammals were surveyed in two forest fragments, the Pinkwae and Adumanya forests from June 2019 to January 2020, using capture-mark-recapture technique. We compared our data with baseline data gathered in 1991-1992, when large areas of the city remained mostly undeveloped. Our data revealed that the urban area has increased by 832%, while the forest area declined by 85% between 1991 and 2017. The Pinkwae and Adumanya forests, which covered 120 and 1.5 ha, respectively, in 1991 have each been reduced to < 1 ha. We found changes in the small mammal species composition in the forest fragments, but not species richness due to species turnover. Grammomys poensis and Dephomys defua are first records for the Accra Plain. Our data suggested that small forest fragments within the urbanizing landscape are important for maintaining the local small mammal species. For the conservation of local small mammals in urbanizing landscapes, it is important to maintain the greatest possible number of small forest fragments and establish policies that prevent forest remnants from being further depleted.

AB  - Questions The ecological condition of riparian habitats has been negatively altered by human activities and land-use changes. The aims of this study were to evaluate: (a) how adjacent land use affects the ecological condition of riparian habitats; and (b) whether the ecological condition relates to riparian vegetation properties (i.e., structure, diversity, and species composition). Location Watershed of the Duero River, in the state of Michoacan, Mexico. Methods Sampling sites were established along the Duero River riverbank by considering three different land uses (i.e., native forest, agriculture, and urban). At each site, we assessed the ecological condition of riparian habitats with a riparian condition index (RCI) composed of six subindices, with 17 indicators. Using a survey of woody plants (DBH >= 2.5 cm) in 12 different 0.1-ha sites, we assessed vegetation properties. Results According to the RCI, 76% of the studied riparian habitats had a very poor ecological condition, and only one site scored an excellent condition. The values of all subindices as well as the RCI were significantly greater in the forest than in the agricultural or urban land uses. The significant relationships between the RCI and its components (subindices) with vegetation properties were all positive and explained between 22% and 73% of the variation in structural and diversity attributes, and between 48% and 66% in floristic composition. Conclusions This study shows how human land-use activities affect the ecological condition of riparian habitats and hence riparian forests. Overall, the RCI had a high predictive power for the vegetation properties of riparian forests. This information is critical for programs involved in the management, conservation, and ecological restoration of riparian habitats. Low-cost and time-efficient indices, such as the RCI, facilitate ecological condition assessments of riparian habitats not only by scientists but also by previously trained land managers and the general public.

AB  - Tropical agriculture is a major driver of biodiversity loss, yet it can provide conservation opportunities, especially where protected areas are inadequate. To investigate the long-term biodiversity capacity of agricultural countryside, we quantified bird population trends in Costa Rica by mist netting 57,255 birds of 265 species between 1999 and 2010 in sun coffee plantations, riparian corridors, secondary forests, forest fragments, and primary forest reserves. More bird populations (69) were declining than were stable (39) or increasing (4). Declines were common in resident, insectivorous, and more specialized species. There was no relationship between the species richness of a habitat and its conservation value. High-value forest bird communities were characterized by their distinct species composition and habitat and dietary functional signatures. While 49% of bird species preferred forest to coffee, 39% preferred coffee to forest and 12% used both habitats, indicating that coffee plantations have some conservation value. Coffee plantations, although lacking most of the forest specialists, hosted 185 bird species, had the highest capture rates, and supported increasing numbers of some forest species. Coffee plantations with higher tree cover (7% vs. 13%) had more species with increasing capture rates, twice as many forest specialists, and half as many nonforest species. Costa Rican countryside habitats, especially those with greater tree cover, host many bird species and are critical for connecting bird populations in forest remnants. Diversified agricultural landscapes can enhance the biodiversity capacity of tropical countryside, but, for the long-term persistence of all forest bird species, large (> 1,000 ha) protected areas are essential.

AB  - Urban areas are primary causes of species' range fragmentation and reduction. However, relatively few studies have attempted to describe the habitat variables influencing the diversity and conservation of amphibians and reptiles, particularly in Mediterranean Europe and in large metropolitan areas. We explored this broad conservation ecology problem by studying the richness and diversity patterns in relation to a suite of six independent habitat variables in Rome, one of the most ancient cities of the world. We considered all the green remnant areas (n=62) of Rome, ranging 1 to > 1000 ha in size, which are interspersed within a sea of urbanized matrix. A total of 10 amphibian and 15 reptile species were studied. Their presence/absence patterns were assessed and the effects of the various habitat variables on each species were predicted by a logistic regression model. A total of 1261 presence records (404 amphibians and 857 reptiles) were analysed. Fragment size and wood size within each fragment did correlate significantly with the species richness of both amphibians and reptiles, and there was a clear threshold effect after 50 ha of wooded surface. The presence of water bodies positively affected the species distribution. One amphibian and three reptiles inhabited exclusively fragments > 50 ha. The distance from the centre did not affect fragment species richness. The presence of most species of both amphibians and reptiles was positively influenced by the irregular versus circular shape of the wooded area. The legal protection of a given area did not influence the observed patterns but the total number of sheltered species. Overall, our study suggests that, in order to maintain the current diversity and population viability, it is necessary, in addition to water bodies' maintenance, to (1) preserve the wooded landscapes over 50 ha; (2) promote irregularly shaped increases in the wood surface; (3) maintain ecotonal boundaries.

AB  - Understanding the factors contributing to maintaining biodiversity is crucial to mitigate the impact of anthropogenic disturbances. Representing large proportions of green area in highly modified landscapes, residential gardens are often seen as local habitats that can contribute to larger networks of suitable environments at the landscape scale.
   We investigated the impact of the landscape context on butterfly communities observed in residential gardens, taking into account garden characteristics, land-use types and presence of linear features in the surrounding landscape. We examined how species traits affected butterflies' response to landscape context and habitat quality.
   We performed a cross-scale study, based on citizen science data documenting butterfly species composition and abundance in 920 gardens across France. We examined the effect of garden quality, the area of different land-use types and the length of linear elements measured at three scales within the surrounding landscape. Species were grouped according to their habitat preference and mobility.
   Urbanization negatively affected total species richness and the abundance of butterfly in each group. This was related to declining habitat quality and reduced area of suitable habitat in the surrounding landscape. The magnitude of this effect, however, was negatively correlated with mobility, a trait related to habitat preference. The spatial scale at which landscape context best explained variation in butterfly abundance changed with species' habitat preference.
   This study highlights the importance of preserving high quality habitats in altered landscapes and considering species' mobility and habitat preference when assessing the impact of landscapes on butterfly communities.

AB  - Aim Coastal plants are terrestrial organisms for which ocean surface currents often act as long-distance dispersal vectors (thalassochorous species) favouring broad distributions and connecting distant populations. However, few studies have statistically assessed the role of currents in modulating gene flow and species distributions of terrestrial organisms. Here we evaluate the hypothesis that some thalassochorous plants exhibit population connectivity, presumably due to effective seed dispersal driven by sea currents. Location Galapagos Islands (Ecuador). Taxon Salt bush (Cryptocarpus pyriformisKunth), a Galapagos native and locally widespread coastal angiosperm. Methods Using 1806 SNPs obtained by ddRADseq, we evaluated the genetic structure and differentiation of the Galapagos salt bush. To assess the role of sea currents in modulating inter-population gene flow, four explicit hypotheses were tested using reciprocal causal modelling and spatial eigenvector analysis: (a) isolation by sea resistance, considering that only sea dispersal is possible; (b) isolation by sea and inland resistance, considering that inland dispersal is also possible; (c) isolation by barrier, considering the sea as an obstacle to seed dispersal; and (d) isolation by geographical distance. Results Low differentiation and little genetic structure were detected among populations ofC. pyriformis. Pairwise genetic distances between populations from different islands were significantly correlated with cost distances calculated from sea-current direction and speed. Nonetheless, inland dispersal also accounted for some gene flow within each island. Main conclusion Extensive and frequent seed dispersal by sea has apparently favoured strong inter-island genetic connectivity within Galapagos. A combination of methods developed for terrestrial and marine domains (landscape and seascape genetics) aids in understanding how landscape features modulate gene flow of coastal plant species, as these terrestrial organisms are highly dependent on the sea for seed dispersal.

AB  - (1) The presence and absence of 22 plant species of various growth forms and habitat associations were analysed in 423 habitat fragments totalling 10.4 km(2) in a 268 km(2) urban and suburban region, in Birmingham, UK. (2) Multivariate logistic regressions were used to assess the effects of patch geometry and quality on the species distributions. Measures of geometry were area, shape (S-factor), distance from open countryside and various measures of isolation from other patches. Potential habitat for each species was determined quantitatively, and the distribution of each species was considered within a subset of patches containing potentially suitable habitat types. There was found to be a significant positive correlation between the density of patches available to a species and the proportion of these patches which were occupied. (3) Logistic analyses and incidence functions revealed that, for many of the species, occupancy increased with site age, area, habitat number and similarity of adjacent habitats, while increasing distance to the nearest recorded population of the same species decreased the likelihood that a species would be found in a patch. (4) Patterns of occupancy are consistent with increased extinction from small sites, and colonisation of nearby habitats, coupled with an important role for site history. We conclude that spatial dynamics at the scale of the landscape are of importance to the long-term persistence of many plant species in fragmented landscapes, and must be seriously considered in conservation planning and management. These results have direct implications for the siting and connectivity of urban habitat reserves.

AB  - After two major storms, the Swedish Transport Administration was granted permission in 2008 to expand the railroad corridor from 10 to 20 m from the rail banks, and to clear the forest edges in the expanded area. In order to evaluate the possibilities for managers to promote and control the species composition of the woody regrowth so that a forest edge with a graded profile develops over time, this study mapped the woody regrowth and environmental variables at 78 random sites along the 610-km railroad between Stockholm and Malm four growing seasons after the clearing was implemented. Through different clustering approaches, dominant tree species to be controlled and future building block species for management were identified. Using multivariate regression trees, the most decisive environmental variables were identified and used to develop a regrowth typology and to calculate species indicator values. Five regrowth types and ten indicator species were identified along the environmental gradients of soil moisture, soil fertility, and altitude. Six tree species dominated the regrowth across the regrowth types, but clustering showed that if these were controlled by selective thinning, lower tree and shrub species were generally present so they could form the "building blocks" for development of a graded edge. We concluded that selective thinning targeted at controlling a few dominant tree species, here named Functional Species Control, is a simple and easily implemented management concept to promote a wide range of suitable species, because it does not require field staff with specialist taxonomic knowledge.

AB  - Anthropogenic landscape modification which leads to the displacement of species, is arguably one of the most profound impacts on animal movement globally. In urban landscapes, animal movement is generally impacted by varying levels of increased urbanization. However, this is species dependent and is mostly guided by the surrounding habitat. Fragmentation and habitat patch isolation must be considered at scales appropriate to the study species. Using telemetry, we test these assumptions investigating movement patterns of flocks of Forest Red-tailed Black Cockatoos (Calyptorhynchus banksii naso; RTBC) between three regions: urban, peri-urban, and forest using GPS and satellite PTT. This species occurs at varying levels of urbanization, however, how this might affect its movements is largely unknown. We did not find evidence that RTBC movement was impaired in the urban region compared with peri-urban or forest regions. It found, however, a significant within-region variation in movement extent among flocks and across regions depending on foraging resource availability and location. Differences in daily movement distance (Av. 4.96 - 16.41 km) and home range size (6.02 - 52.57 km(2)) between urban flocks appeared to be associated with the proximity of green spaces as roosts and foraging sites, with roadside vegetation providing important foraging resources and movement corridors. Key urban habitats were predominantly located in public nature reserves and private properties, with roadside vegetation connecting these sites for RTBC. The findings of this study highlight that conservation management for this and many other threatened species should regard the urban landscape as a critical habitat for urban adapted species. This would include management of its green spaces with connectivity and offsets from roads in mind. Furthermore, future research should focus on identifying additional key habitat sites (resource selection) and species distribution modeling, which will facilitate an active and adaptive approach towards this species' conservation management.

AB  - Species are expected to shift their distributions in response to global environmental changes and additional protected areas are needed to encompass the corresponding changes in the distributions of their habitats. Conservation policies are likely to become obsolete unless they integrate the potential impacts of climate and land-use change on biodiversity.
   We identify conservation priority areas for current and future projected distributions of Iberian bird species. We then investigate the extent to which global change informed priority areas are: (i) covered by existing protected area networks (national protected areas and Natura 2000); (ii) threatened by agricultural or urban land-use changes.
   We use outputs of species distributions models fitted with climatic data as inputs in spatial prioritization tools to identify conservation priority areas for 168 bird species. We use projections of land-use change to then discriminate between threatened and non-threatened priority areas.
   19% of the priority areas for birds are covered by national protected areas and 23% are covered by Natura 2000 sites. The spatial mismatch between protected area networks and priority areas for birds is projected to increase with climate change. But there are opportunities to improve the protection of birds under climate change, as half of the priority areas are currently neither protected nor in conflict with urban or agricultural land-uses.
   We identify critical areas for bird conservation both under current and climate change conditions, and propose that they could guide the establishment of new conservation areas across the Iberian Peninsula complementing existing protected areas.

AB  - Urbanization has been a global phenomenon producing great environmental and ecological challenges including species composition shifts in urban areas. To evaluate the interaction networks of the inhabitant metacommunities in urban parks, we applied the nestedness analysis using ecological survey data of birds, reptiles, frogs, and butterflies among 16 parks in Taipei City of Taiwan and identified critical environmental factors for biodiversity conservation. Results found significant nestedness of the metacommunities among these parks, which indicated strong interaction networks and the importance of urban parks for sustaining these metacommunities. In addition, various types of land use had different effects on the species incidence of birds, reptiles, frogs, and butterflies. It demonstrates that landscape design should consider the taxonomic differences in the development of conservation guidelines. Results also showed that the area of parks and the area of woodlot in the park were critical elements for the nested structure. Nonetheless, abundant bird generalists were found to be highly related to the area of buildings within parks, distance to forests, rivers, and the neighbouring parks. Moreover, the exotic species were found to affect the interaction networks of native species. However, based on the current information, we cannot confirm the actual effects of the exotic species on the native biotasassemblages. Reptiles and frogs appeared to be more easily threatened by land development and habitat fragmentation due to their lower vagility. In this regard, we suggest that conservation action should focus on preserving green space with large areas and constructing green corridors, creating crucial elements, and increasing the vertical complexity in the parks for species with various vagilities. We believe these strategies can help reduce the impact of urbanization to retain healthy interactions and connections of metacommunities among habitats for effective biodiversity conservation in urban areas.

AB  - Frequent drying of ponded water, and support of unique, highly specialized assemblages of often rare species, characterize temporary wetlands, such as vernal pools, gilgais, and prairie potholes. As small aquatic features embedded in a terrestrial landscape, temporary wetlands enhance biodiversity and provide aesthetic, biogeochemical, and hydrologic functions. Challenges to conserving temporary wetlands include the need to: (1) integrate freshwater and terrestrial biodiversity priorities; (2) conserve entire 'pondscapes' defined by connections to other aquatic and terrestrial systems; (3) maintain natural heterogeneity in environmental gradients across and within wetlands, especially gradients in hydroperiod; (4) address economic impact on landowners and developers; (5) act without complete inventories of these wetlands; and (6) work within limited or non-existent regulatory protections. Because temporary wetlands function as integral landscape components, not singly as isolated entities, their cumulative loss is ecologically detrimental yet not currently part of the conservation calculus. We highlight approaches that use strategies for conserving temporary wetlands in increasingly human-dominated landscapes that integrate top-down management and bottom-up collaborative approaches. Diverse conservation activities (including education, inventory, protection, sustainable management, and restoration) that reduce landowner and manager costs while achieving desired ecological objectives will have the greatest probability of success in meeting conservation goals.

AB  - Propagule pressure and habitat characteristics are important factors used to predict the distribution of invasive alien species. For species exhibiting strong propagule pressure because of human-mediated introduction of species, indicators of introduction potential must represent the behavioral characteristics of humans. This study examined 64 agricultural ponds to assess the visibility of ponds from surrounding roads and its value as a surrogate of propagule pressure to explain the presence and absence of two invasive fish species. A three-dimensional viewshed analysis using a geographic information system quantified the visual exposure of respective ponds to humans. Binary classification trees were developed as a function of their visibility from roads, as well as five environmental factors: river density, connectivity with upstream dam reservoirs, pond area, chlorophyll a concentration, and pond drainage. Traditional indicators of human-mediated introduction (road density and proportion of urban land-use area) were alternatively included for comparison instead of visual exposure. The presence of Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) was predicted by the ponds' higher visibility from roads and pond connection with upstream dam reservoirs. Results suggest that fish stocking into ponds and their dispersal from upstream sources facilitated species establishment. Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) distribution was constrained by chlorophyll a concentration, suggesting their lower adaptability to various environments than that of Bluegill. Based on misclassifications from classification trees for Bluegill, pond visual exposure to roads showed greater predictive capability than traditional indicators of human-mediated introduction. Pond visibility is an effective predictor of invasive species distribution. Its wider use might improve management and mitigate further invasion. The visual exposure of recipient ecosystems to humans is important for many invasive species that spread with frequent instances of human-mediated introduction.

AB  - Urban landscapes are characterized by an urban matrix often unfavorable for biodiversity, interspersed with remnant corridors such as riparian areas. Those are increasingly threatened by urban expansion and land use change worldwide. We investigated the effect of the two components, matrix versus corridor, by comparing the riparian plant diversity and the community-level ecological traits along an urbanization gradient. Species distribution was surveyed at a local-scale along an urban riparian corridor in Strasbourg, eastern France. Ninety plots were sampled along an urbanization gradient. Several plant metrics were measured using both plant richness (R) and mean ecological trait values of species weighted by their abundance (CWM). The surroundings of each plot were first described by selecting representative variables of matrix and corridor. Secondly, the distribution of plant species according to a given i ecological trait was analyzed in relation with different levels of urbanization. Using mixed effects models, we verified whether matrix or corridor variables best explain the distribution of traits. Three levels of urbanization were detected, termed urban, suburban and pen-urban, based on landscape composition. Neither the pen-urban nor the suburban level affected plant metrics. At the urban level, and whatever indicator value was considered, the CWMi metrics clearly decreased, whereas species richness Ri increased. The upstream distance to the nearest natural area and tree cover were the most influential variables on CWMi metrics, whereas Ri metrics were mainly driven by built component and landscape heterogeneity. Matrix variables were more important in explaining Ri metrics while corridor features affected CWMi metrics. These results highlight the preponderance of the corridor effect on plant ecological types and the importance of the matrix on the selection and/or the implantation of novel species. Thus, the urbanization gradient may operate simultaneously on the abundance of local species and impose the recruitment of new co-existing species. This study suggests that ecological type responds to the urbanization gradient and may be an alternative tool to understand plant distribution rather than plant diversity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The wild boar is the target species selected for developing a GIS model of potential habitat for big game species, mainly using many GIS layers and kilometric abundance indices (KAI). We identify and weight environmental factors that determine the suitability for wild boar populations in a Mediterranean region, highly influenced by urban and agro-forestry activities. Marina Baja region (Spain) is selected to make a regional analysis. In the GIS modelling process, a suitability value is assigned to each pixel, which represents the habitat preference of the species. In the potential habitat model some variables were considered, the most important being land use. Voronoi polygons are generated by calculating the centroid of census transects located with GPS. These polygons are combined with the 'suitability' layer to obtain potentiality values, involving the displacement of the wild boar impedances within each Voronoi polygon. Finally, it performs the cartographic generalization process to obtain the resulting potential areas. We have obtained six potential areas that represent 39% of the region and they are best for the species. Natural vegetation is the most important landcover type in these areas. The cost-distance model is an efficient tool that gives good results in line with existing knowledge of species distribution. The model is constructed in order to explain, understand and predict the relations of analysed species using a determinate number of environmental variables. Thus, the use of GIS has allowed the information coming from different sources to be integrated in a simple way, allowing wild boar observations (KAI) to be combined with the cost-distance analysis result.

AB  - Powerline clearings are common in urban and semi-urban landscapes worldwide. The clearings could potentially promote flowering species associated with open-canopy habitats, and provide alternative habitat for species dependent on semi-natural grasslands, but the empirical evidence for this hypothesis is weak. We carried out a large-scale field study of understorey plant communities at 51 sites in powerline clearings and adjacent boreal forest. At each site, we placed four 4 m x 5 m plots with five 1-m(2) subplots in the clearing centre and a parallel set of plots 100 m into the adjacent forest. Habitat characteristics were sampled at plot and site level and from digital maps. The clearings had a higher richness of species associated with semi-natural grasslands, and a higher richness of shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant forb species. Total plant richness and diversity were higher in the clearings than in the forests. The magnitude of difference in species composition between clearings and forest, and plant community properties in the clearings, depended on the environmental context (age of the clearing, productivity, shading by tree regrowth, landscape fragmentation, climate). Our results indicate that over time, powerline clearings develop into novel habitats. Low-productive sites were dominated by Ericaceaous dwarfs shrubs. Richness of forbs and semi-natural grassland species in the clearings increased with productivity. Richness of shade-intolerant forbs and semi-natural grassland species increased with fragmentation of the surrounding landscape. We conclude that frequent clearing of productive sites can enhance plant biodiversity including richness of insect-pollinated species and mitigate the loss of species associated with semi-natural grasslands.

AB  - Few studies have evaluated seed predation in fragmented landscapes, in which lower species diversity is expected to modifying ecological interactions. The rates of seed removal by mammals were investigated in a continuous forest and two fragmented patches of Premontane Tropical Moist Forest, in Monteverde, Costa Rica. The composition of mammalian seed-predators in each site was recorded during 16 months. The removal of four native tree species of experimental seeds: Ocotea valeriana and Ocotea whitei (Lauraceae), Panopsis costaricensis (Proteaceae) and Billia colombiana (Hippocastanaceae) in forest understories was followed during two annual fruiting seasons for each species. Results indicated similar species composition of seed-predators between continuous forest, the largest fragment (350 ha). However the smaller fragment (20 ha), had fewer seed predators. In this fragment, the specialized seed predator Heteromys desmarestianus (Rodentia) was more abundant. Unexpectedly, seed-predation in the two forest fragments and the continuous forest did not differ statistically for any of the seed species. Apparently, the higher abundance of small seed-predators in the fragments was compensated by the absence of medium and large seed-predators, like Agouti paca, Dasyprocta punctata (both Rodentia) and Pecari tajacu (Artiodactyla) recorded in continuous forest. Removal of experimentally-placed seeds was higher when the number of naturally occurring seeds in the sites was lower. This result could best be attributed to differential satiation of seed predators rather than differences in richness or abundance of seed predators. Rev. Biol. Trop. 57 (3): 865-877.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms underlying species assembly is a central focus of plant ecology and is crucial to revealing how plant communities are structured. However, the temporal limitations of most terrestrial plant communities preclude collection of species assembly data in a tractable time-frame. The aim of this study is to investigate the importance of dispersal potential, as estimated by interspecific variation in sexual and asexual expression, as a predictor of patch chronosequence assembly for epiphyllous (leaf-inhabiting) bryophytes. Secondarily, we investigate whether spatiotemporal patterns in patch turnover and compositional variation infer evidence of local (within-patch) population processes. The frequency and distribution of 55 epiphyllous bryophytes across five leaf age classes were studied on an understorey shrub Piper grande (Piperaceae) in premontane Panamanian tropical forest. Logistical models were used to test whether interspecific variation in dispersal-related life-history traits predicts assembly order. Beta diversity and ordination analyses were employed to examine nestedness vs. turnover, and probe for repeatable patterns in patch chronosequence assembly, respectively. Our results emphasize the importance of dispersal potential on species assembly patterns as earlier arrivals exhibit greater probabilities of sexual and specialized asexual expression. High turnover coupled with temporal convergence in species composition also points to evidence of within-patch biotic filtering. Synthesis. Epiphylls are locally diverse in humid tropical forests worldwide; however, the mechanisms which maintain their high local diversity are unknown. This study suggests that interspecific variation in dispersal capacity in combination with diffuse indirect effects is the principal contributor to the high alpha-diversity of these ephemeral metacommunities.

AB  - Aim The global sprawl of marine hard infrastructure (e.g. breakwaters, sea walls and jetties) can extensively modify coastal seascapes, but the knowledge of such impacts remains limited to local scales. We examined the regional-scale effects of marine artificial habitats on the distribution and abundance of assemblages of ascidians, a key group of ecosystem engineer species in benthic fouling systems.
   Location Five hundred kilometers of coastline in the North Adriatic Sea.
   Methods We sampled a variety of natural reefs, marine infrastructures and marinas, and tested hypotheses about the role of habitat type and location in influencing the relative distribution and abundance of both native and non-indigenous species.
   Results Assemblages differed significantly between natural and artificial habitats and among different types of artificial habitats. Non-indigenous species were 2-3 times more abundant on infrastructures built along sedimentary coastlines than on natural rocky reefs or infrastructures built close to rocky coastlines. Conversely, native species were twice as abundant on natural reefs than on nearby infrastructures and were scarce to virtually absent on infrastructures built along sedimentary coasts. The species composition of assemblages in artificial habitats was more similar to that of marinas than of natural reefs, independently of their location.
   Main conclusions Our results show that marine infrastructures along sandy shores disproportionally favour non-indigenous over native hard bottom species, affecting their spread at regional scales. This is particularly concerning for coastal areas that have low natural densities of rocky reef habitats. We discuss design and management options to improve the quality as habitat of marine infrastructures and to favour their preferential use by native species over non-indigenous ones.

AB  - Context Romania is currently one of the best-connected landscapes, with high-quality habitats and a high density of brown bears. However, regional development measures are needed for the nation's economic growth, and without responsible government actions, these measures pose a threat to brown bear connectivity, a vital pillar of the entire Carpathian region. Despite having important implications for the species conservation, bears sex-specific behaviour has been overlooked in connectivity assessments. Objectives The study's main goals were to (i) develop sex-specific distribution and connectivity models, (ii) assess the movement patterns differences between females and males, and (iii) identify high-quality areas to be secured for species connectivity conservation. Methods We designed a methodological framework based on interdisciplinary approaches and modelling tools for landscape connectivity combined with novel spatial analysis. Telemetry data of sixteen bears (females and males) were utilized to predict habitat selection (MaxEnt), and circuit-theoretic approaches (Circuitscape) were applied to identify the potential movement corridors of both sexes and high-priority areas. Results The obtained results provided new evidence on the uneven movement patterns and pathways used by males and females in the study region. Males' movement preferences were related to river shores and dense forest coverage areas, avoiding urban areas, while females were predicted to move across forested and open areas and were more tolerant to human-modified areas. Three high-quality areas were delineated for both sexes, and connectivity conservation efforts are needed due to the vicinity of anthropic pressures. Conclusions This study depicts the usefulness of combining interdisciplinary approaches and provides planners, managers, and decision-makers with practical solutions to address sustainable design and management within the intervened landscapes. Using separate female and male spatial models for leading management and conservation measures, setting connectivity targets within environmental and impact assessments while adopting conservation easements could secure a safety network for biodiversity conservation in the Carpathians.

AB  - Ecological corridors and urban parks are created to connect habitats that become isolated due to urban devel-opment and integrate ecological, social, and cultural functions. Establishing and implementing the ecological function of urban green structures and conservation plans for urban terrestrial species requires prioritizing developing an understanding of the community structure of urban terrestrial species. However, understanding the appearance and distribution of terrestrial species in urban ecosystems is often neglected or lacking; furthermore, the inaccurate detection of species distribution can create biased estimates of species occupancy. Recently, an applied research method for detecting terrestrial species such as mammals and birds has been proposed based on molecular biology such as environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding. We installed artificial water tanks (mesocosm) in urban green spaces (Urban forests; UFs, Urban ecological corridors; UECs, Urban parks; UPs), applying eDNA metabarcoding as a tool to detect wild terrestrial species, and camera traps (CTs) and field surveys were performed in parallel to verify the results. We detected 22 urban terrestrial species only by eDNA metabarcoding and identified 43 species in total by performing eDNA metabarcoding, CTs, and field surveys in parallel. In addition, we identified 31 species of UFs, 13 species of UECs, and 28 species of UPs of urban terrestrial species using the three species survey methods in parallel. We confirmed that eDNA meta-barcoding is very useful for detecting small species that are difficult to detect with the naked eye and internal species vulnerable to disturbance. However, since some species were only detected by CTs or field surveys due to DNA false-negative errors or the species' life-history characteristics, it was judged that the species inventory can be effectively collected using several monitoring techniques.

AB  - Aims Grassland plant species diversity is affected by local, temporal and landscape environmental factors, but what is the relative importance of those factors? Understanding this is crucial for the effective conservation of grassland vegetation. We analyzed the factors affecting species richness to contribute to native species conservation and alien species management in grassland vegetation. Location Semi-natural grasslands in Shiroi City, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. Methods The species composition in 36 grasslands was surveyed in 2014. Plants were classified as native grassland specialist, other native or alien species. Generalized Linear Models (GLM) were developed, with the number of species in each plant type as the response variable and local (habitat area, use of mowing management), landscape (adjacent land use, connectivity to other grassland habitats) and temporal (period for which the grassland has been preserved from development, i.e., temporal continuity) factors as explanatory variables. Other GLM were developed with the presence/absence of each species as a response variable and three factors as explanatory variables. Results Habitat area, use of mowing management and temporal continuity were most important in explaining the number of grassland specialist species and had significant positive effects on their richness. Species-based analysis identified a significant positive effect of temporal continuity on grassland specialist species. By contrast, habitat area and adjacent land use were most related to alien species richness. The number of alien species was high in grasslands adjacent to farmlands or roads. Conclusions The relative importance of temporal and spatial factors differs between native grassland specialists and alien species. Mowing is effective for the conservation of grassland specialists' species diversity, particularly in historically old grasslands. However, it is necessary to pay attention to the invasion of alien species from adjacent residential or agricultural areas.

AB  - Paddy fields are essential habitats for frogs. We evaluated the impacts of both farmland consolidation including agricultural road improvement and farmland abandonment on the two Rana species using a model incorporating spatial autocorrelation. A sampling unit consists of several paddy fields that share a ditch and are isolated from other blocks by roads or other land covers. We surveyed 619 blocks in an area of about 1000 km(2) from the plain to the mountains of Toyota City in central Japan. Among them, 124 blocks included at least a flooded paddy field where frogs could lay eggs. R. ornativentris and R. japonica bred in 50 and 25 blocks, respectively. We constructed models to explain the presence/absence of two species by GLM (non-spatial model) and hierarchical Bayesian model with INLA (spatial model) that includes spatial autocorrelation as a random effect. Explanatory variables of the local scale were the altitude, location of the paddy field (yatsuda (valley bottom paddy fields) or non-yatsuda), farmland consolidated or not consolidated, and under cultivation or abandoned. Those of the landscape scale were areas of forest and paddy fields, and road density in 14 circles with different radius from 50 to 2000 m. Both species' distribution had significant spatial autocorrelation. The spatial model had a higher discriminative ability than the non-spatial model. Farmland consolidation and the forest area in the 400 m radius had a positive effect on R. ornativentris. Altitude and road density in the 50 m radius had negative effects, cultivation had a positive effect, and farmland consolidation and yatsuda had no or negative effects on R. japonica. R. ornativentris was threatened by farmland abandonment, but the urbanization and/or farmland consolidation threatened R. japonica.

AB  - Understanding the causes of spread of overabundant species plays a key role in deciphering their invasion mechanisms, while providing managers with targeted management actions to control their spread. The objective of this research was to quantify the spread of Hooded Crow (Corvus cornix) in Israel and to elucidate the causes of its spread. Long-term occurrence data of Hooded Crow sightings were used to analyze the species range expansion rate. This dataset was analyzed with a range of climatic, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and land-use variables. Analysis of opportunistic presence-only data, corrected for possible sampling biases, illustrated traveling waves of eastward expansion, from the Mediterranean coast into Israel's central mountain range, and a star-like pattern of spread southward into the northwestern Negev desert. A diffusion equation model revealed an expansion rate of 1.60 km year(-1). Land-use analysis revealed an affinity of sighted individuals toward urban and low vegetation land types. Hooded Crow sightings were positively correlated with annual precipitation, with the remaining variation being negatively correlated with precipitation during the wettest quarter. Species distribution modeling suggested that the species has established new populations and is currently expanding its range. The slow rate of dispersal is consistent with a neighborhood diffusion pattern, corresponding to the species life-history traits. Human-managed environments, including low-cover agricultural fields, provide constant available food and nesting trees, allowing the Hooded Crow to thrive all year-round. Precipitation may aid in enhancing Hooded Crow tolerance toward other unfavorable physical conditions. In light of these new findings, management plans ought to recognize centers of Hooded Crow activity as indicators of highly disturbed native wildlife communities. Also, our findings emphasize the need to establish agri-environmental schemes (AES) in such areas, which would raise community resistance to overabundant species. As AES are currently not in place on a national scale, and since their creation has the power to improve landscape connectivity of native species, this last component is especially necessary.

AB  - Cucurbita pepo L. (Cucurbitaceae) was an integral component of the diet of Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures and is an important cash crop with high cultural value in contemporaneous indigenous populations of Guatemala. Despite the increasing attention to native bees as pollinators of cucurbit crops, little is known about the diversity of bees that visit or pollinate these crops in many regions. Based on collections from 11 observational plots of C. pepo established in five localities and maintained by the local community across the Cloud Forest Corridor in Guatemala, we documented 27 bee species belonging to 14 genera in Apidae and Halictidae as floral visitors. Species composition was significantly different among plots and among localities; however, honey bees (Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758) (Apidae: Apini) and the stingless bee Partamona bilineata (Say, 1837) (Apidae: Meliponini) were the most abundant flower visitors in all plots and localities, accounting up to 80% of the total number of visits. Two species of squash bees were recorded, Peponapis apiculata (Cresson, 1878) and P. limitaris (Cockerel], 1906) (Apidae: Eucerini), but they were rare (3.4% of total number of specimens) across all plots and localities. Based on pollinator exclusion experiments as well as comparisons of fruit weight and seed number and weight, we confirmed the dependence of this crop on insect pollination and the role of honey bees and P. bilineata as main pollinators in the observational plots. Surveys of bees in the surrounding vegetation of the plots indicated a higher diversity (36 species of 28 genera) than in the plots; about 40% of these species are also common visitors of flowers of C. pepo.

AB  - Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and four-channel red, green, blue, and near-infrared (RGBI) remote sensed imageries allow an accurate quantification and contiguous measurement of vegetation characteristics and forest structures. This information facilitates the generation of habitat structure variables for forest species distribution modelling. However, applications of remote sensing data, especially the combination of structural and spectral information, to support evidence-based decisions in forest managements and conservation practices at local scale are not widely adopted. In this study, we examined the habitat requirements of pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) (PW) in Hamilton County, Ohio, using ecologically relevant forest structural and vegetation charac-teristics derived from LiDAR and RGBI data. We hypothesized that the habitat of PW is shaped by vegetation characteristics that are directly associated with the availability of food, hiding and nesting resources, the spatial arrangement of habitat patches within home range, as well as proximity to water sources. We used 186 PW presence or absence locations to model their presence and absence in generalized additive model (GAM) at two scales, representing foraging and home range size, respectively. The results confirm PW's preference for tall and large mature stands with structural complexity, typical of late-successional or old-growth forests. Besides, the crown size of dead trees shows a positive relationship with PW occurrence, therefore indicating the importance of declining living trees or early-stage dead trees within PW home range. These locations are preferred by PW for nest cavity excavation as it attempts to balance the ease of excavation and tree security. In addition, we found that PW can adjust its travel distance to the nearest water resource, suggesting that habitat fragmentation can have certain impacts on PW. Based on our findings, we recommend that forest managers should use different priorities to manage nesting, roosting, and feeding habitats. Particularly, when devising forest management and hazard tree removal plans, one needs to consider retaining enough cavity trees within high-quality PW habitat. By mapping PW habitat suitability for the study area, we highlight the importance of riparian corridor in facilitating PW to adjust to the fragmented urban landscape. Indeed, habitat improvement for PW in the study area could be achieved by conserving riparian corridors and promoting riparian forest succession along major rivers in Hamilton County.

AB  - The Tawawa Woods Natural Landmark, Wilberforce, Xenia Township, Greene County, OH (39degrees 43' N, 83degrees 52' W), and the associated riparian forest corridor along Massies Creek has nurtured at least five human cultures over the past three millennia: Native Americans (Adena ca. 1000 BC, Hopewell ca. 100 BC, and Shawnee in the 17(th) to early 19(th) centuries), European Americans, and African Americans. The purpose of this study was to document the land use patterns of these cultures and their influences on the hydrological and botanical characteristics of Tawawa Woods as a basis for understanding the current dynamics of the woods. Archival accounts from photographs, correspondence, departmental board minutes, surveys, maps, and existing physical structures were used to reconstruct prior land use patterns. Historic tree species diversity was estimated using land surveys from 1799-1856. Current tree species composition of Tawawa Woods was estimated using a combination of plot and point-centered quarter sampling methods. Tree and herbaceous species outside plot sample areas were identified by walk-through surveys and documented with photographs. Historic accounts suggest that the number of springs and flow rates had significantly decreased by the beginning of the 20(th) century. Release of pollutants into Massies Creek, deposits of refuse into the woods, and continued demand for lumber during the late 19(th) and early 20(th) centuries may have altered both water tables and biodiversity. Witness tree data identify 15 different tree species, while current surveys recognize 31 tree species and at least, 79 herbaceous and vine/shrub species.

AB  - Skippers are a species rich and widespread group of butterflies with evolutionary patterns and processes largely unstudied despite some recent efforts. Among Hesperiidae, the subfamily Heteropterinae is a moderately diverse clade comprising ca. 200 species distributed from North to South America and from Africa to the Palearctic region. While some regions are species rich, others are far less diverse. Using anchored phylogenomics, we infer a robust timetree and estimate ancestral ranges to understand the biogeographic history of these skippers. Inferences based on up to 383 exons recover a robust backbone for the subfamily along with the monophyly of all genera. Bayesian divergence time estimates suggest an origin of Heteropterinae in the late Eocene, ca. 40 million years ago. Maximum likelihood ancestral range estimates indicate an origin of the group in the New World. The eastern Palearctic was likely colonized via a Beringian route and a reverse colonization event resulted in two independent and extant American clades. We estimate a vicariant event between Central and South America that significantly predates estimates of the proto-Caribbean seaway closure, indicating active overwater dispersal in the Oligocene. The colonization of Africa from the east Palearctic is synchronous with the closure of the Tethys Ocean, while the colonization of Madagascar appears to be comparatively recent. Our results shed light on the systematics and biogeography of Heteropterinae skippers and unveil the evolutionary history of a new leaf in the skipper tree-of-life.

AB  - About 190,000 ha of higher-elevation marl prairies flank either side of Shark River Slough in the southern Everglades. Water levels typically drop below the ground surface each year in this landscape. Consequently, peat soil accretion is inhibited, and substrates consist either of calcitic marl produced by algal periphyton mats or exposed limestone bedrock. The southern marl prairies support complex mosaics of wet prairie, sawgrass sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense), tree islands, and tropical hammock communities and a high diversity of plant species. However, relatively short hydroperiods and annual dry downs provide stressful conditions for aquatic fauna, affecting survival in the dry season when surface water is absent. Here, we present a conceptual ecological model developed for this landscape through scientific concensus, use of empirical data, and modeling. The two major societal drivers affecting the southern marl prairies are water management practices and agricultural and urban development. These drivers lead to five groups of ecosystem stressors: loss of spatial extent and connectivity, shortened hydroperiod and increased drought severity, extended hydroperiod and drying pattern reversals, introduction and spread of non-native trees, and introduction and spread of non-native fishes. Major ecological attributes include periphyton mats, plant species diversity and community mosaic, Cape Sable seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis), marsh fishes and associated aquatic fauna prey base, American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), and wading bird early dry season foraging. Water management and development are hypothesized to have a negative effect on the ecological attributes of the southern marl prairies in the following ways. Periphyton mats have decreased in cover in areas where hydroperiod has been significantly reduced and changed in community composition due to inverse responses to increased nutrient availability. Plant species diversity and community mosaics have changed due to shifting gradients to more terrestrial or more aquatic communities, displacement of native communities by non-natives, expansion of woody plants, high-intensity dry season fires, tree-island burnout, and reduced microtopography resulting from alligator population decline. Cape Sable seaside sparrow populations are threatened by nest destruction resulting from extended hydroperiods, drying pattern reversals, and high intensity dry season fires, as well as by the expansion of woody plants into graminoid wetland habitats. Populations of marsh fishes and associated aquatic fauna that constitute the aquatic prey base for higher vertebrates have decreased in density and changed in species composition and size structure due to loss of wetland spatial extent, shortened hydroperiod, increased drought severity, loss of aquatic drought refugia in solution holes and alligator holes, and spread of exotic fishes. American alligator populations have declined in the Rocky Glades, and alligator holes have filled with sediment, as a result of shortened hydroperiod and increased drought severity. Habitat options for wading birds to forage during the early dry season and during unusually wet years have been reduced due to loss of spatial extent and shortened hydroperiod.

AB  - In the context of urbanization, due to lack of the unified planning of land use for representative ecological indicators, the sustainable wildlife existence in urban ecosystems is emerging as a burning issue. A new descriptive method is proposed to establish the sustainable conservation strategy of protected wildlife in the current urbanization scenario. We use the Habitat Quality module in the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs model (InVEST-HQ), straightforward construction package of complex ecological niche Ecological Niche Modeling at The MetaLand EcologyLab (ENMTML) and ecological corridors construction model Species Distribution Model toolbox (SDMtoolbox) to distinguish the priority protected areas (PAs) and construct the ecological corridors of Gallinula chloropus (G. chloropus) in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, China in 2018. The results show that the PAs are fragmented and only occupy 0.05% of total area in BTH region, which indicate an urgent conservation issue in highly urbanization area. For the sustainable conservation strategy of protected G. chloropus, 25 ecological corridors comprised 2790.8 km are required to construct, mainly distributed in Beijing and Tianjin city. Ecological corridors are also distributed close to the border of southeast, southwest and eastern coastal areas of the BTH region. In order to optimize the ecological corridors, 9 important ecological corridors comprised 813.4 km are suggested to build firstly, which are mainly distributed in the central and eastern coastal areas of the BTH region. Our combined modeling (ENMTML-InVEST-HQ) indicate that based on actual species occurrence data and land uses, it can successfully generate the PAs which should be paid more attention. Furthermore, concrete measures to build ecological corridors which connect PAs in BTH region are proposed. In order to well-targeted organized planning in highly urbanized areas, measures to protect key habitats of wildlife need to be defined and this research provides a reference for sustainable protection and management of wildlife.

AB  - Central European floodplain meadows are characterised by flooding mainly in winter/spring and dry conditions over the summer. They harbour many rare and endangered plant species. We studied the vegetation of floodplain meadows along the regional climatic gradient of the Middle Elbe River. This gradient exhibits rather continental conditions in the south-east and oceanic conditions in the northwest. We aimed at detecting the influence of climate on the vegetation of floodplain meadows along this gradient.
   Along the Middle Elbe River (Germany), we recorded the vegetation of wet and mesic meadows in 2010. The results revealed differences in species composition especially in wet meadows: vegetation plots of wet meadows clustered in the DCA ordination according to their geographic location from west to east. Sample scores of DCA-axes of both meadow types correlated with the long-term means of climatic factors such as precipitation or temperature. While species numbers did not differ between study sites, evenness of mesic meadows was higher in the western part of the gradient.
   Indicative species of the sites were mainly common meadow species. Species typical for floodplain meadows were relatively evenly distributed along the gradient. Therefore, we confirm that the distribution of typical floodplain species is largely determined by hydrologic and land use conditions rather than by climatic factors. Therefore, we assume that typical floodplain meadow species at the Elbe River are relatively robust against direct climatic changes, as long as these changes do not exceed the range of the climatic gradient today. Concerning the total assemblages of floodplain meadows, those of wet meadows might be more vulnerable to climate change than those of mesic meadows. However, indirectly occurring changes caused by climate change, i.e. water-level changes due to an altered discharge regime of the Elbe River caused by altered precipitation patterns in the catchment, will affect all floodplain species.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are recognized as the flagship tool to offset biodiversity loss on Earth. Spatial conservation planning seeks optimal designs of PAs that meet multiple targets such as biodiversity representation and population persistence. Since connectivity between PAs is a fundamental requirement for population persistence, several methods have been developed to include connectivity into PA design algorithms. Among these, the eigenvalue decomposition of the connectivity matrix allows for identifying clusters of strongly connected sites and selecting the sites contributing the most to population persistence. So far, this method was only suited to optimize an entire network of PAs without considering existing PAs in the new design. However, a more cost-effective and realistic approach is to optimize the design of an extended network to improve its connectivity and thus population persistence. Here, we develop a flexible algorithm based on eigenvalue decomposition of connectivity matrices to extend existing networks of PAs while optimizing connectivity and population growth rate. We also include a splitting algorithm to improve cluster identification. The new algorithm accounts for the change in connectivity due to the increased biological productivity often observed in existing PAs. We illustrate the potential of our algorithm by proposing an extension of the network of approximate to 100 Mediterranean marine PAs to reach the targeted 10% surface area protection from the current 1.8%. We identify differences between the clean slate scenario, where all sites are available for protection, irrespective of their current protection status, and the scenario where existing PAs are forced to be included into the optimized solution. By integrating this algorithm to existing multi-objective and multi-specific algorithms of PA selection, the demographic effects of connectivity can be explicitly included into conservation planning.

AB  - Landscape heterogeneity is regarded as a key factor for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem function in production landscapes. We investigated whether grassland sites at close vicinity to forested areas are more frequently used by bats. Considering that bats are important consumers of herbivorous insects, including agricultural pest, this is important for sustainable land management. Bat activity and species richness were assessed using repeated monitoring from May to September in 2010 with acoustic monitoring surveys on 50 grassland sites in the Biosphere Reserve Schorfheide-Chorin (North-East Germany). Using spatial analysis (GIS), we measured the closest distance of each grassland site to potentially connecting landscape elements (e.g., trees, linear vegetation, groves, running and standing water). In addition, we assessed the distance to and the percent land cover of forest remnants and urban areas in a 200 m buffer around the recording sites to address differences in the local landscape setting. Species richness and bat activity increased significantly with higher forest land cover in the 200 m buffer and at smaller distance to forested areas. Moreover, species richness increased in proximity to tree groves. Larger amount of forest land cover and smaller distance to forest also resulted in a higher activity of bats on grassland sites in the beginning of the year during May, June and July. Landscape elements near grassland sites also influenced species composition of bats and species richness of functional groups (open, edge and narrow space foragers). Our results highlight the importance of forested areas, and suggest that agricultural grasslands that are closer to forest remnants might be better buffered against outbreaks of agricultural pest insects due to higher species richness and higher bat activity. Furthermore, our data reveals that even for highly mobile species such as bats, a very dense network of connecting elements within the landscape is beneficial to promote activity in open areas and thus assure vital ecosystem function in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - In this study we evaluated whether pteridophytes are reliable indicators of urban forest integrity. We inventoried the total pteridophyte diversity in 82 forest patches of the Hochelaga Archipelago (Montreal area, Quebec, Canada), and evaluated their level of integrity using landscape metrics (e.g., area, connectivity, matrix composition) calculated from satellite imagery and land use maps. To obtain information at microhabitat scale, we sampled pteridophyte diversity, as well as biotic and abiotic data, in 225 sample plots within these 82 patches. Relationships of pteridophyte richness to landscape metrics and to microhabitat variables were analyzed with parsimonious regression models. Variation partitioning was used to isolate the effects of each group of variables (forest area, land use, biotic/abiotic and edge effect). To enhance the interpretation of models involving richness, distance-based redundancy analyses of species composition data were performed. Indicator species of low and high levels of urban influence were then identified using the IndVal method. Results showed a strong species-area relationship that was influenced by surrounding land use. Pteridophyte richness decreased with increasing proportions of residential areas, urban heat islands (UHI) and water bodies in a 500 m-buffer zone around patches. Greater richness at the microhabitat scale was associated to greater distance from internal and external edges. Out of 38 species, 19 were significant indicators of low levels of urban influence. We conclude that pteridophytes are positive indicator of forest integrity, since they demonstrate typical plant responses to adverse urban-generated ecological conditions. Green-spored species are of particular interest, since their presence indicates low levels of UHIs. Impact of global climate changes on biodiversity can be predicted by studying UHls, and we suggest using pteridophytes in this broader context. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cities are human dominated ecosystems providing novel conditions for organisms. Research on urban biodiversity is rapidly increasing, yet it is still hampered by the partial spatial coverage of cities and because of existing taxonomic biases. Predictive models have proved to be a key tool to solve this shortfall. However, predictive models have rarely been used in urban ecosystems due to either the lack of sufficient species records or high-quality predictors (e.g. meaningful ecological maps). Here, we assemble a large cross-taxa inventory of 1446 species from 12 taxonomic groups, including several understudied invertebrate groups, sampled in 251 sites in Zurich, Switzerland. We investigate the species diversity distributions and the structure of species assemblages along artificial urban ecological gradients by applying predictive models. We find that the general species diversity distribution law, where assemblages are dominated by a few very abundant and frequent species, applied consistently across all taxonomic groups (3% of the species accounting for approximately 50% of abundance). Furthermore, only species of intermediate abundance and frequency are spatially structured along urban intensity gradients, with rare species numbers keeping constant even in the most urbanised parts of the city. In addition, we show that green areas with low mowing regimes are associated with higher species diversity in the majority of taxonomic groups. Hence, this suggests management relaxation as a low-cost solution to promote species richness. Our study demonstrates the potential of predictive modelling for addressing ecological questions in urban environments and to inform management and planning.

AB  - Offshore platforms, subsea pipelines, wells and related fixed structures supporting the oil and gas (O&G) industry are prevalent in oceans across the globe, with many approaching the end of their operational life and requiring decommissioning. Although structures can possess high ecological diversity and productivity, information on how they interact with broader ecological processes remains unclear. Here, we review the current state of knowledge on the role of O&G infrastructure in maintaining, altering or enhancing ecological connectivity with natural marine habitats. There is a paucity of studies on the subject with only 33 papers specifically targeting connectivity and O&G structures, although other studies provide important related information. Evidence for O&G structures facilitating vertical and horizontal seascape connectivity exists for larvae and mobile adult invertebrates, fish and megafauna; including threatened and commercially important species. The degree to which these structures represent a beneficial or detrimental net impact remains unclear, is complex and ultimately needs more research to determine the extent to which natural connectivity networks are conserved, enhanced or disrupted. We discuss the potential impacts of different decommissioning approaches on seascape connectivity and identify, through expert elicitation, critical knowledge gaps that, if addressed, may further inform decision making for the life cycle of O&G infrastructure, with relevance for other industries (e.g. renewables). The most highly ranked critical knowledge gap was a need to understand how O&G structures modify and influence the movement patterns of mobile species and dispersal stages of sessile marine species. Understanding how different decommissioning options affect species survival and movement was also highly ranked, as was understanding the extent to which O&G structures contribute to extending species distributions by providing rest stops, foraging habitat, and stepping stones. These questions could be addressed with further dedicated studies of animal movement in relation to structures using telemetry, molecular techniques and movement models. Our review and these priority questions provide a roadmap for advancing research needed to support evidence-based decision making for decommissioning O&G infrastructure.

AB  - Worldwide, lotic ecosystems are heavily impacted by anthropogenic disturbance, leading to a significant decline in freshwater biodiversity. In recent years, increasing efforts have been directed towards the restoration and revitalization of disturbed streams and rivers to reverse this trend. Although it is widely acknowledged that species dispersal is the key to the recolonization of restored streams and rivers and ultimately to their ecological recovery, dispersal often remains unaddressed in restoration ecology. In this study, we present an approach to predict larval (aquatic) and adult (terrestrial) dispersal ranges of three lotic insect species (Hydropsyche dinarica [Trichoptera], Calopteryx virgo [Odonata] and Dinocras cephalotes [Plecoptera]) within one life cycle. The actual species' distributions (presence / absence) were obtained from a total of 1,198 sites evenly distributed within the Ruhr catchment, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The predictions for aquatic and terrestrial dispersal were made for two scenarios: with and without dispersal barriers included in the predictive modelling. In-stream dispersal barriers included weirs, dams, culverts and impounded water bodies, whereas terrestrial barriers were related to the stream corridor (degraded riparian vegetation) and different forms of land use (urban land use, coniferous and deciduous or mixed forest, open land, road infrastructure). We applied a least-cost modelling approach and combined each species' life-cycle-specific dispersal capabilities and the corresponding dispersal barrier's "friction" costs in a gridbased GIS model. Among the three model species, H. dinarica was the best disperser and was predicted to be able to reach between 81 % (without barriers) and 67 % (with barriers) of all river sections in the model catchment within one life cycle. Aerial (terrestrial) dispersal was by far the most important dispersal mechanism. For validation purposes, we conducted a logistic regression analysis to identify sample sites with environmentally suitable habitats. Within these sites that are not considered constrained by habitat limitations, the comparison of actual and predicted absences revealed a better match, if barriers were included in the dispersal models. At the same time the mismatch of actual absences and predicted presences decreased. Our results suggest that dispersal models can contribute to a better assessment of the potential recolonization of rivers. Yet, the dispersal of lotic insects may be considerably overestimated if dispersal barriers remain unaddressed.

AB  - The expansion of roads, and the subsequent changes to the surrounding landscape not only lead to landscape fragmentation but also have been shown to be a key driver of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. Local declines of species abundance as well as changes in animal behaviour have drawn attention to wider ecosystem effects including altered species composition and a degradation of ecosystem functioning. However, methods for measuring and quantifying the distribution and environmental impacts of roads are not yet fully developed. We present a new technique for assessing the potential impacts of roads on biodiversity using a spatial road disturbance index (SPROADI). The index is calculated from three sub-indices: traffic intensity as a measure of traffic volume per time and space; vicinity impact, which is the assessment of edge effect of roads on adjacent habitats (the road-effect zone); and fragmentation grade, which provides an indication of the degree to which the landscape is intersected by roads. SPROADI was then tested using data from the Federal State of Brandenburg in north-eastern Germany. A sensitivity analysis was carried out on the results to assess the robustness of the index. The findings revealed expected patterns of high road disturbance in urban and peri-urban landscapes surrounding Berlin. Less obvious were the high levels of road density and impacts in forest plantations across the southern region of Brandenburg, and low levels of road disturbance in agricultural crop lands of the north-western region. Results were variable for areas under some form of protection. The only national park displayed substantially lower SPROADI values in contrast to the surrounding non-protected areas whilst other protected area categories, which were landscape conservation areas and nature parks, revealed SPROADI values that were equally high as those for non-protected areas. The results of this study demonstrate the strengths and potential applications of SPROADI as a quantitative means for identifying low-traffic areas in the context of conservation and sustainable transport planning.

AB  - Anthropogenic disturbances can have negative effects on species assemblages. This study was established to form baseline data on the environmental structure and reptile assemblages within a planned energy corridor in Pinal County, Arizona, prior to construction. We emphasized evaluating the differences in reptile assemblages in two subdivisions of the Sonoran Desertscrub, the Lower Colorado River Valley (LCV) and Arizona Uplands (AZU). Surveys were conducted on 50 sites (LCV = 15; AZU = 35) along the proposed 67.1-km long energy corridor through environmental surveys and 50 drift-fence trapping arrays with 400 box funnel traps. Vegetation height, number of burrows, and percent rock, ground cover, and coarse woody debris were significantly higher in the AZU than in LCV. Eighteen reptile species (n = 995 captures) were detected on the energy corridor including 8 lizard species (n = 952 captures) and 10 snake species (n = 43 captures). Species richness, evenness, and capture rates were not significantly different between the LCV and AZU; however, species diversity was significantly higher in the LCV. Reptile abundance (LCV = 281; AZU = 714) differed in the two subdivisions, yet rank-abundance curves revealed no difference in dominance of species. Post hoc examination revealed that the geographic separation of sites within the LCV and the location of the study area (along the ecotone) may have contributed to our results. We conclude that both subdivisions are equally important to the maintenance of local biotic diversity and recommend that any future land set-asides consider both subdivisions.

AB  - To meet a growing demand for accurate high-fidelity vegetation cover mapping in urban areas toward biodiversity conservation and assessing the impact of climate change, this paper proposes a complete approach to species and vitality classification at single tree level by synergistic use of multimodality 3D remote sensing data. So far, airborne laser scanning system (ALS or airborne LiDAR) has shown promising results in tree cover mapping for urban areas. This paper analyzes the potential of mobile laser scanning system/mobile mapping system (MLS/MMS)-based methods for recognition of urban plant species and characterization of growth conditions using ultra-dense LiDAR point clouds and provides an objective comparison with the ALS-based methods. Firstly, to solve the extremely intensive computational burden caused by the classification of ultra-dense MLS data, a new method for the semantic labeling of LiDAR data in the urban road environment is developed based on combining a conditional random field (CRF) for the context-based classification of 3D point clouds with shape priors. These priors encode geometric primitives found in the scene through sample consensus segmentation. Then, single trees are segmented from the labelled tree points using the 3D graph cuts algorithm. Multinomial logistic regression classifiers are used to determine the fine deciduous urban tree species of conversation concern and their growth vitality. Finally, the weight-of-evidence (WofE) based decision fusion method is applied to combine the probability outputs of classification results from the MLS and ALS data. The experiment results obtained in city road corridors demonstrated that point cloud data acquired from the airborne platform achieved even slightly better results in terms of tree detection rate, tree species and vitality classification accuracy, although the tree vitality distribution in the test site is less balanced compared to the species distribution. When combined with MLS data, overall accuracies of 78% and 74% for tree species and vitality classification can be achieved, which has improved by 5.7% and 4.64% respectively compared to the usage of airborne data only.

AB  - Climatic fluctuations and aridification have combined with the environmental heterogeneity between north and south Xinjiang to shape the spatial genetic structure and demographic history of desert species in Xinjiang, China. Lycium ruthenicum offers a unique opportunity for surveying the spatial genetic structure, evolutionary history, and effect of environmental heterogeneity on local adaption and population divergence. Three cpDNA loci (psbA-trnH, psbK-psbI, and trnV) were sequenced for 238 individuals from 21 populations across the species range in Xinjiang. Median-joining networks, principal coordinate analyses (PCoA), BEAST analysis, species distribution models (SDMs), and least-cost path (LCP) analysis were integrated to investigate the spatial genetic patterns and demographic history of the species. The 21 haplotypes identified formed two clusters, corresponding to northern and southern populations according to the PCoA and median-joining network. BEAST analysis indicated the genetic divergence between the northern and southern populations began in the middle to late Pleistocene. Increased aridity may have triggered population differentiation and fragmentation; the expansions of the Gurbantunggut and Taklamakan Deserts and uplift of the Tianshan Mountains likely further isolated northern from southern populations. High levels of diversity and unique haplotypes were identified in the populations from the north slope of the Tianshan Mountains and the northwestern and southwestern Tarim Basin, which likely served as glacial refugia for the northern and southern groups, respectively. The distribution of genetic variation, SDMs, and LCP analysis indicate L. ruthenicum expanded from refugia along the edge of the Gurbantunggut and Taklamakan Deserts at the end of the last glacial maximum.

AB  - Freshwater communities and especially pond-breeding amphibians are extremely vulnerable to land-use change, alien species introductions and the use of pesticides or other toxic chemicals, as reflected in their worldwide decline. Effective conservation and management of ponds requires a better understanding of the biotic and abiotic factors that shape diversity patterns and species distribution, especially in cases of habitat loss
   The present study aimed to reveal and classify which pond and landscape characteristics are the most important determinants for the occurrence patterns of amphibian species as well as for the overall amphibian species richness in an urban pond network. To achieve this aim, 17 biotic and abiotic variables were measured for 61 ponds and the dataset was analysed by means of a machine-learning approach, suitability indices and co-occurrence modelling
   The highest probability of Triturus macedonicus occurrence was found at fishless artificial and semi-natural ponds. The persistence of Lissotriton graecus in ponds was predicted by high pond connectivity and the absence of fish reflecting the species dispersive potential. Pelophylax kurtmuelleri showed a higher probability of occurrence with increased pond connectivity and macrophyte cover.
   Amphibian species richness was higher in fishless ponds with well-oxygenated waters located in sites with a low to intermediate road density network. Ponds categorized as 'average' in terms of newt suitability were more frequently inhabited by fish than Triturus macedonicus. Alien fish species showed negative associations with both newt species, while both newt species showed a positive association between them.
   The results support the view that conserving a greater number of water bodies with increased landscape connectivity and without any fish presence could provide amphibian species with alternative habitat choices, especially in sites with human pressure where pond stability is at stake owing to continuous landscape changes.

AB  - 1. Landscape genetic approaches were used to assess functional connectivity of populations of the endangered damselfly Coenagrion mercuriale in a fragmented agricultural landscape in Switzerland. Spatial genetic clustering methods combined with interpolation by kriging and landscape genetic corridor analysis were applied to identify landscape elements that enhance or hinder dispersal and gene flow. 2. Spatial genetic clustering analysis divided the sampled populations into a northern and a southern genetic group. The boundary between the two groups coincided with a hill ridge intersecting the study area. Landscape corridor analysis identified five landscape elements that significantly affected gene flow. Elevation change, Euclidian distance, patches of forest and flowing waterbodies acted as barriers, whereas open agricultural land enhanced gene flow between populations of C center dot mercuriale. 3. This study showed that movement of C center dot mercuriale was not restricted to its preferred habitat (i.e. streams). Populations linked via continuous open agricultural land were functionally well connected if they were not more than about 1.52 km apart. In contrast, substantial elevation change and larger forest patches separated populations. These findings may serve as a basis to define conservation units and should be considered when planning connectivity measures, such as determining the locations of stepping stones, or the restoration of streams.

AB  - A recent plan to extend a highway in south-west Western Australia has been abandoned, but not before a 10-200 m wide strip of vegetation along the alignment had been cleared. Attempts are now being made to rehabilitate the cleared area. The aim of this paper is 2-fold. First, it documents the changes in invertebrate abundance, richness and evenness in this abandoned landmark development. Second, it explores the changes in invertebrate species composition, concentrating on ants, in terms of known trends in biodiversity, with particular emphasis on biotic homogenisation. We report on the immediate changes in invertebrate assemblages from a spatial continuum of sites passing through six discrete woodland communities. A total of 69 species of ants were sampled by pitfall traps from the sites, with 50 being sampled in the 7 reference sites and 46 in the 13 cleared sites. As far as most of these simple indices are concerned, the previously cleared areas generally exhibited values that are not appreciably different from those of the reference sites, except that species richness was marginally higher in the reference sites and ant abundance was higher in the cleared area sites. There was considerable variation in numbers of ant species within Ant Niche Template categories in both the reference and cleared area sites. However, numbers of nest specialists and trophic specialists were significantly lower in cleared area sites; opportunistic species and one generalist were more abundant in cleared areas. The two-dimensional solution of the multi-dimensional scaling ordination grouped all cleared sites close together, with the reference sites and modified native vegetation site being widely scattered across the graph. The tight bunching of the cleared sites suggests that clearing for the proposed highway has resulted in homogenising the ant fauna, creating a characteristic assemblage that differed from all of the original reference sites. When considered at the ordinal level, significantly less Clitellata (worms), Malacostraca (slaters), Araneae (spiders), Blattodea (cockroaches), Dermaptera (earwigs) and Coleoptera (beetles) were sampled from the cleared sites, but significantly more Collembola (springtails), Homoptera and Heteroptera (both types of sucking bugs) were sampled in these sites. Collembola may be responding to the abundance of exotic grasses whereas the sucking bugs may have benefitted from the lush herb and shrub layer associated with the regrowth and rehabilitation efforts.

AB  - The ring-necked parakeet Psittacula krameri (Aves: Psittaciformes) is a widely distributed species of Asian and African origin, which occurs with over 40 alien populations in the rest of the world. Most established populations of this species are showing a clear trend of territorial expansion and numerical growth. Recent reviews highlighted that one of the main impacts by alien ring-necked parakeets is the competition with threatened bat species using trunk cavities as roosts. In Italy, the only known reproductive population of Nyctalus bats (Mammalia: Chiroptera) occurs in an urban area in the central part of the country, surrounded by increasing and expanding populations of ring-necked parakeets. In this work, we updated the population status of both ring-necked and Alexandrine parakeets and breeding noctule bats in the region. Then, we ran a species distribution model using Maxent software to analyze the environmental suitability of the region for the ring-necked parakeet and a connectivity model using Circuitscape software to predict the possibility of its expansion in the area occupied by breeding noctule bats. We recorded a high number of individual parakeets and breeding colonies, together with a remarkable noctule population decline, from about 400 to about 120 individuals, in the last 20 years, possibly due to urban green management practices. Although some ring-necked parakeets have already been observed in the study area, there is no evidence of reproduction in the surroundings of the noctule colony. However, our model showed a high environmental suitability for the ring-necked parakeet in the area occupied by breeding noctules. As well, the connectivity model showed the potential for a direct flow of individuals from the main urban centers to the area used by noctule bats. The arrival of alien parakeets to the area occupied by the bat breeding colony should be tightly monitored by surveying the suitable areas for this bird, as well as the identified ecological corridors. Early detection of new invasions, together with a sustainable urban green management practice, may prevent the extinction of the southernmost breeding colony of the common noctule.

AB  - Riparian vegetation performs important ecosystem functions, since it maintains regional biodiversity and provides a range of environmental services. However, anthropogenic activity, land use type, and edge effects are factors that modify the riparian species assemblage and properties. The present study analyzes the influence of adjacent land use on the structure and diversity of riparian vegetation in four hydrographic regions that form the watershed of the river Duero, in the state of Michoacan, Mexico. Using a survey of woody plants of dbh a parts per thousand yen 2.5 cm in ten different 0.1 ha sites, we found that the average number of stems and individuals was lower under agricultural (AGR) and urban (URB) land use, compared to forested areas (FOR). The proportion of multistemmed plants differs among land uses: this value was greater in AGR than in the FOR and URB categories. This proportion also differed among the four hydrographic regions. The land use type FOR presented the highest alpha and beta diversity, with a high number of native species occurring only in areas defined by this land use. The results indicate that the category FOR plays an important role in the conservation of regional flora and is a possible source of germplasm for restoration programs in sites degraded by human disturbance. This study shows how anthropogenic activities affect riparian vegetation and highlights the importance of further study of this ecosystem to apply sustainable management strategies that are compatible with its conservation.

AB  - We examined tick communities on wild felid hosts in three ecoregions of Mexico. We collected 186 ticks of 7 species from 10 pumas (Puma concolor) and 9 jaguars (Panthera onca). Tick community composition varied across the ecoregions, and across host species within each region. Overall, Ixodes affinis, Amblyomma ovale, and Amblyomma tenellum were the most abundant species; however, only the latter two ticks were distributed across all three ecoregions, while I. affinis, along with Ixodes spinipalpis, Amblyomma inornatum, and Amblyomma parvum were restricted to more limited geographical regions. Ixodes affinis occurred strictly in southern tropical rainforest ecoregions and was significantly more abundant in Selva Lacandona compared with the Yucatan Peninsula. Amblyomma ovale was significantly more common in the tropical dry forest in the Pacific coastal ecoregion. Amblyomma tenellum abundance tended to be higher on jaguars, while I. affinis abundance was higher on pumas. Regional distribution patterns of some tick species (e.g., I. affinis and I. spinipalpis) may be determined by off-host environmental conditions rather than host factors. In contrast, at the local scale, occurrence and abundance of some tick species (e.g., A. tenellum, A. ovale and Rhipicephalus microplus) might be driven by ecological-host factors, such as habitat use or predator-prey relationships.

AB  - Patterns in plant-soil biota interactions could be influenced by the spatial distribution of species due to soil conditions or by the functional traits of species. Gypsum environments usually constitute a mosaic of heterogeneous soils where gypsum and non-gypsum soils are imbricated at a local scale. A case study of the interactions of plants with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in gypsum environments can be illustrative of patterns in biotic interactions. We hypothesized that (i) soil characteristics might affect the AMF community and (ii) there are differences between the AMF communities (modules) associated with plants exclusive to gypsum soils (gypsophytes) and those associated with plants that show facultative behavior on gypsum and/or marly-limestone soils (gypsovags). We used indicator species and network analyses to test for differences between the AMF communities harbored in gypsophyte and gypsovag plants. We recorded 46 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to nine genera of Glomeromycota. The indicator species analysis showed two OTUs preferentially associating with gypsum soils and three OTUs preferentially associating with marly-limestone soils. Modularity analysis revealed that soil type can be a major factor shaping AMF communities, and some AMF groups showed a tendency to interact differently with plants that had distinct ecological strategies (gypsophytes and gypsovags). Characterization of ecological networks can be a valuable tool for ascertaining the potential influence of above- and below-ground biotic interactions (plant-AMF) on plant community composition.

AB  - The disruption of hydrological connectivity by human activities such as flood regulation or land-use changes strongly impacts riparian plant communities. However, landscape-scale processes have generally been neglected in riparian restoration projects as opposed to local conditions, even though such processes might largely influence community recovery. We surveyed plant composition of field edges and riverbanks in 51 riparian zones restored by tree planting (565 1-m(2) plots) within two agricultural watersheds in southeastern Quebec, Canada. Once the effects of environmental variables (hydrology, soil, agriculture, landscape, restoration) were partialled out, three models of spatial autocorrelation based on Moran's eigenvector maps and asymmetric eigenvector maps were compared to quantify the pathways and direction of the spatial processes structuring riparian communities. The ecological mechanisms underlying predominant spatial processes were then assessed by regression trees linking species response to spatial gradients to seed and morphological traits. The structure of riparian communities was predominantly related to unidirectional spatial gradients from upstream to downstream along watercourses, which contributed more to species composition than bidirectional gradients along watercourses or overland. Plant traits selected by regression trees explained 22% of species response to unidirectional upstream-downstream gradients in field edges and 24% in riverbanks, and predominantly corresponded to seed traits rather than morphological traits of the adult plants. Our study showed that even in agriculturally open landscapes, water flow remains a major force structuring spatially riparian plant communities by filtering species according to their seed traits, thereby suggesting long-distance dispersal as a predominant process. Preserving hydrological connectivity at the watershed-scale and restoring riparian plant communities from upstream to downstream should be encouraged to improve the ecological integrity of rivers running through agricultural landscapes.

AB  - Aim The composition of communities is known to be influenced by biogeographical history, but also by local environmental conditions. Yet few studies have evaluated the relative importance of the direct and indirect effects of multiple factors on species diversity in rich Neotropical forests. Our study aims to assess drivers of change in local bird species richness in lowland tropical rain forests.
   Location Thirty-two physiographic subregions along the corridor of the Panama Canal, Panama.
   Methods We mapped the distributions of all forest-dwelling bird species and quantified the environmental characteristics of all subregions, including mean annual rainfall, topographic complexity, elevational variability, forest age and forest area. Plant species richness, believed to be correlated with structural complexity, was estimated by interpolation through kriging for subregions where data were unavailable.
   Results The study region has a strong rainfall gradient across a short distance (65 km), which is also accompanied by steep gradients in plant and bird species diversity. Path analysis showed that precipitation strongly affected plant species diversity, which in turn affected avian diversity. Forest age and topography affected bird diversity independently of plant diversity. Forest area and its proportion occurring in the largest two fragments of each subregion (habitat configuration) were also positive correlates of bird species richness.
   Main conclusions Our results suggest that plant species richness, known to be influenced in part by biogeographical history and geology, also affects bird species assemblages locally. We provide support for the hypothesis that bird species richness increases with structural complexity of the habitat. Our analysis of the distributions of the region's most disturbance-sensitive bird species showed that subregions with more rainfall, more complex topography and older forests harboured not only richer communities but also more sensitive species; while subregions with the opposite characteristics usually lacked large fractions of the regional forest bird community and hosted only common, widely distributed species. Results also emphasize the importance of preserving forest diversity from habitat loss and fragmentation, and confirm that larger, continuous forest tracts are necessary to maintain the rich avian diversity in the region.

AB  - More than 1180 non-native species, mostly of Palaearctic origin, have been recorded from the boreal zone of Canada, with the highest diversity on the island of Newfoundland and in the southern boreal zone of Ontario and Quebec. The non-native biota of the boreal zone (and of Canada in general) is poorly known in terms of species composition and distribution. A large proportion of species are associated with disturbed anthropogenic habitats such as urban areas, agricultural landscapes, transportation and communication corridors, and industrial developments. Natural habitats in the boreal zone have a high degree of resistance to invasion compared with those of other Canadian zones, likely owing to harsh climates, low light levels, poor soil nutrient availability, low soil pH, low productivity, and dense covering of the ground by plants, especially bryophytes. Of the relatively few non-native species that have successfully colonized the boreal zone, many decline greatly in abundance after a few years, suggesting biotic resilience. To date the boreal zone has shown the least resistance and resilience to large vertebrates (moose and white-tailed deer) translocated to islands, diseases of vertebrates, and earthworms. In general, the ecological impacts of non-native species on the boreal zone have been poorly studied, and there are few examples where such impacts are evident. Likewise, there has been little attempt to quantify the economic impacts of non-native species in either the boreal zone or in Canada as a whole. In the few cases where management measures have been implemented for highly destructive non-native species, results have been somewhat successful, especially where classical biological control measures have been implemented against insects on trees. Chemical and mechanical management measures have had only limited success in localized situations. Management resources are most effectively applied to reducing the risk of introduction. The risk to the boreal zone posed by future new non-native species is increasing with the warming climate and the fast and direct transport of goods into the boreal zone from points of origin. Five recommendations are provided to address recognized gaps concerning non-native species.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Urban green areas are essential for many animals inhabiting cities, including bats. They provide food and shelter, and also facilitate migration. Our aim was to identify bat species inhabiting Planty Park in Cracow and determine how their activity differed depending on the weather and season. We recorded bats' calls on ultrasonic detectors in 2016 and 2017. In total, 2 of 10 observed species were new for this part of Poland: the Kuhl's pipistrelle (Pipistrellus kuhlii) and the Savi's pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii). We divided all species into groups of similar ecology for further analyses. Myotis bats were the least active group. Bats of genera Nyctalus, Eptesicus and Vespertilio were the most active in late summer, similarly to Pipistrellus and Hypsugo, although statistics did not back the outcome for the latter two genera. In spring and early summer, Nyctalus, Eptesicus and Vespertilio bats were more active during warmer nights, while in autumn, they preferred cloudless nights. Interestingly, Pipistrellus and Hypsugo bats decreased their activity at higher temperatures during summer. Our study will lead to a better understanding of bat ecology in urban areas and will contribute to setting urban landscape planning recommendations.
   Municipal greenery can mitigate the negative impact of urbanization on biodiversity, including bats, by providing a migration corridor, food base and roosts. Our study aimed to evaluate the species composition and diversity, test the differences in activity between seasons, and identify the atmospheric conditions influencing the bats' activity in the Planty Park (Cracow). Fieldworks were conducted in 2016 and 2017. We recorded 10 species, two new for this part of Poland: the Kuhl's pipistrelle (Pipistrellus kuhlii) and the Savi's pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii). Taxa were divided into three ecological guilds. Myotis group's activity was insufficient to perform statistical analyses. The activity of Nyctalus, Eptesicus and Vespertilio group peaked in late summer. A similar insignificant trend was observed for Pipistrellus and Hypsugo. Temperature enhanced the activity of Nyctalus, Eptesicus and Vespertilio group in spring and early summer, while cloud cover suppressed their activity in autumn. Temperature also enhanced Pipistrellus and Hypsugo group activity in spring and autumn, but it suppressed their summer activity. Our study is one of the first to investigate temperate urban bats' phenology and may serve as a preface for further research to introduce detailed urban landscape planning recommendations.

AB  - Cities are socioecological systems that filter and select species, therefore establishing unique species assemblages and biotic interactions. Urban ecosystems can host richer wild bee communities than highly intensified agricultural areas, specifically in resource-rich urban green spaces such as allotments and family gardens. At the same time, urban beekeeping has boomed in many European cities, raising concerns that the fast addition of a large number of managed bees could deplete the existing floral resources, triggering competition between wild bees and honeybees. Here, we studied the interplay between resource availability and the number of honeybees at local and landscape scales and how this relationship influences wild bee diversity. We collected wild bees and honeybees in a pollination experiment using four standardized plant species with distinct floral morphologies. We performed the experiment in 23 urban gardens in the city of Zurich (Switzerland), distributed along gradients of urban and local management intensity, and measured functional traits related to resource use. At each site, we quantified the feeding niche partitioning (calculated as the average distance in the multidimensional trait space) between the wild bee community and the honeybee population. Using multilevel structural equation models (SEM), we tested direct and indirect effects of resource availability, urban beekeeping, and wild bees on the community feeding niche partitioning. We found an increase in feeding niche partitioning with increasing wild bee species richness. Moreover, feeding niche partitioning tended to increase in experimental sites with lower resource availability at the landscape scale, which had lower abundances of honeybees. However, beekeeping intensity at the local and landscape scales did not directly influence community feeding niche partitioning or wild bee species richness. In addition, wild bee species richness was positively influenced by local resource availability, whereas local honeybee abundance was positively affected by landscape resource availability. Overall, these results suggest that direct competition for resources was not a main driver of the wild bee community. Due to the key role of resource availability in maintaining a diverse bee community, our study encourages cities to monitor floral resources to better manage urban beekeeping and help support urban pollinators.

AB  - The treeline is a sensitive region of the terrestrial ecosystem responding to climate change. However, studies on the composition and formation mechanisms of soil fungal communities across the treeline are still lacking. In this study, we investigated the patterns of soil fungal community composition and interactions among functional guilds above and below the treeline using Illumina high-throughput sequencing and ecological network analysis. The results showed that there were significant differences in the soil environment and soil fungal community composition between the two ecosystems above and below the treeline. At the local scale of this study, geographic distance and environmental factors affected the composition of the soil fungal community. Soil temperature was an important environmental predictor of soil fungal community composition. Species in soil fungal communities in the subalpine meadow were more closely related to each other compared to those in the montane forest. Furthermore, the soil fungal community in montane forest was more stable. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of how mountain ecological functions respond to global climate change.

AB  - Aim Climate-modelling exercises have demonstrated that the Cape Floristic Region is highly sensitive to climate change and will apparently lose much of its northern limits over the next few decades. Because there is little monitoring of diversity in this area, ant assemblage structure was investigated within the main vegetation types in the Greater Cederberg Biodiversity Corridor. In particular, we sought to determine how ant assemblage structure differs between the main vegetation types, how restricted ants - and in particular the major myrmecochores - are to the major vegetation types, and which environmental variables might underlie differences in the ant assemblages and in the specificity of species to particular areas.
   Location Northern Cape Floristic Region, Western Cape, South Africa.
   Methods Sampling was undertaken during October 2002 and March 2003 across an altitudinal gradient ranging from sea level (Lambert's Bay) to c. 2000 m a.s.l. (Sneeukop, Cederberg) and down again to 500 m a.s.l. (Wupperthal) in the Western Cape, South Africa. Pitfall traps were used to sample ants at 17 altitudinal bands, stretching over three vegetation types (Strandveld, Mountain Fynbos and Succulent Karoo). Biotic and abiotic environmental variables were collected at each sampling site. Generalized linear models were used to determine the relationships between species richness, density, abundance and the abundance of the major myrmecochores, and the environmental variables. Redundancy analysis was used to determine the relationship between ant assemblage structure and the environmental variables. The Indicator Value Method was used to identify characteristic ant species for each vegetation type and altitudinal site.
   Results Temperature explained significant proportions of the variation in species density and abundance, and, together with area and several vegetation variables, contributed significantly to the separation of the assemblages in the major vegetation types and biomes. Four major myrmecochores were identified [Anoplolepis sp. (cf. custodiens), Anoplolepis sp. (cf. steinergroeveri), Camponotus niveosetosus, Tetramorium quadrispinosum]. The abundances of the two Anoplolepis species were related to vegetation variables, while the abundance of the other two species showed opposite relationships with temperature variables. Fourteen ant species were characteristic of certain vegetation types and altitudes. Several of these species contributed to the differences between the assemblages.
   Main conclusions There are likely to be substantial and complex changes to ant assemblages as climates change in the northern Cape Floristic Region. Moreover, the importance of ants for ecosystem functioning suggests that these responses are not only likely to be a response solely to vegetation changes, but might also precipitate vegetation changes. The changes that are predicted to take place in the next 50 years in the Cape Floristic Region could be substantially exacerbated by such synergistic effects, which have major implications for long-term conservation plans. Ongoing monitoring of this transect will reveal the nature and pace of the change as it unfolds.

AB  - While deforestation and fragmentation can cause massive species loss in forest ecosystems, forest regeneration can also drive successional changes in species composition. Although studies have sometimes documented the effects of these compositional changes on interspecific interactions, few studies have investigated changes in the structure of plant-animal networks. We investigated how interaction networks of assemblages of rodents and tree seeds changed with forest fragmentation and succession in a subtropical region. We compared seed-rodent interactions between 14 secondary forest patches that ranged in area from 2 to 58 ha, and from 10 to at least 100 years old, representing a successional gradient. We expected that deforestation and fragmentation would reduce seed production and diversify rodent communities, resulting in higher interaction strengths and connectivity, but weak nestedness (i.e., specialists interact with subsets of the species interaction of generalists). We measured the frequency of rodents eating and removing seeds (interaction strength) in each patch during 3 successive years, using seed tagging and infrared camera trapping, and calculated the properties of the seed-rodent networks. We found that the relative abundances of seeds and rodents changed with stand age not patch size, as did seed-rodent interactions: older patches produced more seeds, contained fewer individuals and species of rodents, and had seed-rodent networks with lower connectance and interaction strength, but higher nestedness. Connectance and interaction strength decreased with metabolic per capita seed availability (as measured by seed energy value); nestedness increased with seed richness, but decreased with rodent abundance. At species level, we found stand age and patch size showed significant effects on seed or rodent abundance of a few species. We also found seed coat thickness and starch contents had significant effects on network metrics. Our results suggest that during succession after deforestation, seed-rodent interactions in these sub-tropical forests change from a state dominated by high seed removal and highly connected seed-rodent networks to a state with more seeds and highly nested networks. From a management perspective of our study region, succession age, not fragment size, and network structure should be paid more attention so as to facilitate the restoration processes of degraded forests. Rodent management should be applied to protect native forest species and exclude incursive ones from farmlands and human residences at early succession stage.

AB  - 1. Natural and anthropogenic disturbances are influential factors in river ecosystems. Lowland rivers that cross urbanised areas experience direct disturbance due to urbanisation, affecting suitability for many vertebrate and invertebrate species and with important implications for ecosystem functioning and stability. In addition, lowland rivers are potentially subjected to major flood events, whose effects may be exacerbated by urbanisation in the river basin. A greater understanding of the combined effects of flood disturbance and urbanisation is needed if we are to preserve riverine ecosystems and improve management strategies. 2. We characterised macroinvertebrate, detritus-based food webs upstream and downstream of Rome (Italy) before a period of exceptional flooding and at intervals until 71 days following the final flood event. We studied community and food-web characteristics, combining carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis with macroinvertebrate population census data. 3. The flood altered the species assemblage at both upstream and downstream locations. The food webs shifted towards a more complex configuration, with increased trophic generalism, linkage density and mean chain length. However, the food web at the upstream location gradually recovered its pre-flood configuration, whereas at the downstream location, where flood effects were stronger, the food web showed little capacity for recovery within the time span of the study. The contrasting food-web responses can be explained with reference to differences in resource availability for detritivores and predators and in water turbidity, which in turn reflect an interaction between flood disturbance and river basin urbanisation. 4. The description of short-term variations in food-web properties may help to improve ecosystem monitoring and the management of freshwater bodies and can be used to assess short-term and long-term effects of disturbance. A better understanding of the negative effects of urban pressure on macroinvertebrate community stability should help to define appropriate measures for the conservation and restoration of urbanised river areas, especially given that extreme flood events are expected to increase due to climatic change.

AB  - Urban development can have multiple effects on mammalian carnivore communities. We conducted a meta-analysis of 7,929 photographs from 217 localities in 11 camera-trap studies across coastal southern California to describe habitat use and determine the effects of urban proximity (distance to urban edge) and intensity (percentage of area urbanized) on carnivore occurrence and species richness in natural habitats close to the urban boundary. Coyotes (Canis latrans) and bobcats (Lynx rufus) were distributed widely across the region. Domestic dogs (Canis lupus fatniliaris), striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), raccoons (Procyon lotor), gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), mountain lions (Puma concolor), and Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana) were detected less frequently, and long-tailed weasels (Mustela.frenata), American badgers (Taxidea taxi's), western spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis), and domestic cats (Felis catus) were detected rarely. Habitat use generally reflected availability for most species. Coyote and raccoon occurrence increased with both proximity to and intensity of urbanization, whereas bobcat, gray fox, and mountain lion occurrence decreased with urban proximity and intensity. Domestic dogs and Virginia opossums exhibited positive and weak negative relationships, respectively, with urban intensity but were unaffected by urban proximity. Striped skunk occurrence increased with urban proximity but decreased with urban intensity. Native species richness was negatively associated with urban intensity but not urban proximity, probably because of the stronger negative response of individual species to urban intensity.

AB  - Urban landscapes are rapid changing ecosystems with diverse urban forms that impede the movement of organisms. Therefore, designing and modelling ecological networks to identify biodiversity reservoirs and their corridors are crucial aspects of land management in terms of population persistence and survival. However, the land cover/use maps used for landscape connectivity modelling can lack information in such a highly complex environment. In this context, remote sensing approaches are gaining interest for the development of accurate land cover/use maps. We tested the efficiency of an object-based classification using open-source projects and free images to identify vegetation strata at a very fine scale and evaluated its contribution to landscape connectivity modelling. We compared different spatial and thematic resolutions from existing databases and object based image analyses in three French cities. Our results suggested that this remote sensing approach produced reliable land cover maps to differentiate artificial areas, tree vegetation and herbaceous vegetation. Land cover maps enhanced with the remote sensing products substantially changed the structural connectivity indices, showing an improvement up to four times the proportion of herbaceous and tree vegetation. In addition, functional connectivity indices evaluated for several forest species were mainly impacted for medium dispersers in quantitative (metrics) and qualitative (corridors) estimations. Thus, the combination of this reproductible remote sensing approach and landscape connectivity modelling at a very fine scale provides new insights into the characterisation of ecological networks for conservation planning.

AB  - Riparian plant communities fulfil many functions, including the provision of corridors linking protected areas and other zones of high conservation value. These habitats across much of South Africa's Cape Floristic Region, especially in the lowlands, have been heavily impacted and degraded by human activities. There is increasing interest in the restoration of degraded riparian zones and the ecosystem services they provide to enhance the conservation value of landscapes. Previous studies of riparian vegetation in the Cape Floristic Region focused on pristine headwater systems, and little is known about human-impacted communities that make up most of the riparian vegetation in downstream areas. More information is needed on the composition of these plant communities to establish a baseline for management intervention. The riparian zone of the Eerste River in South Africa's Western Cape province provides a good opportunity to study the features of riparian vegetation along the entire gradient, from pristine vegetation in a protected area through different levels of human-mediated degradation. Riparian vegetation was surveyed in 150 plots along the entire length of the Eerste River (ca. 40 km). Data were analysed using the vegetation classification and analysis software package JUICE. Final groupings were plotted onto a two-dimensional detrended correspondence analysis plane to check the position of the communities in the reduced multidimensional space. Ten distinct plant communities were identified, including several novel communities dominated by alien plant species. Descriptions of each plant community are presented. Diagnostic, constant and dominant species are listed and the major structural and ecological characteristics of each community are described.
   Conservation implications: Major changes to hydrological and soil properties, nutrient dynamics and disturbance regimes and plant species composition along sections of the riparian zone mean that restoration of many of these habitats to their historic condition is not feasible. However, several native plant species that provide key ecosystem services persist in and adjacent to transformed communities, offering substantial opportunities for restoration to achieve certain goals.

AB  - This research takes Wuhan as a case study with a focus on forest ecological network analysis based on an integrated approach. This approach applies the improved least-cost path model and scenario analysis to identify and compare networks with the cost surface setting, including ecological service value and biodiversity index. We proposed cost-based 5 index and patch connection index (PCI) to evaluate the whole network structure and ecological source connection, as these two indexes comprehensively consider spatial structure and species migration cost. This study proves that the improved line kernel density method based on species migration cost is an effective tool to identify conservation priority areas and break points. Based on the proposed method, we identify and evaluate four types of urban forest ecological networks from different cost setting. The forest ecological network is uneven in spatial distribution. Overall ecological network structure has poor connection. We illustrate conservation priority areas and divide these priority areas into three categories of ecological security.

AB  - The expanding human interference with stream corridors creates many undesirable impacts on the riverine ecosystem at different scales. Population growth and demand on land due to suitability of location for economic activities are pushing factors for encroachment in stream corridors. This issue is critical in the context of all headwater stream corridors in Sri Lanka. The objective of this study is to identify and highlight the nature and intensity of the encroachment and its consequences. Within the context of this concern, the Pinga Oya catchment located within the upper Mahaweli stream corridor, was selected as the study site. Relevant literature sources, legal documents, image classifications, chain survey, stream cross-sectional survey, field observation, questionnaire survey and stakeholder interviews were used to conduct the study. Encroachment in the stream corridor resulted in changing natural functions of the stream corridor ecosystem in many ways. Given that, artificial constructions conceal 100% area within 40 m distance from the stream's left bank and 90% area within 40 m distance from the stream's right bank within the stream's highly populated reach. The average populated reach within the area of 40 m distance from the stream's left and right banks is covered with 80% of artificial constructions. The less populated reach within the area of 40 m distance from the stream's left bank is covered 45% by roads and 55% with natural area s. The right bank is totally natural, with 95% of vegetation and 5% of rock and no artificial constructions. There is less species density and diversity in the highly populated segment of the Pinga Oya stream corridor. The trend has begun since the 1980s after the transformation of Akurana as a trade centre. Stream water quality in terms of turbidity, biological oxygen demand (BOD) and nitrate concentrations has exceed the tolerance limits. The recorded nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) is 18.5 in highly populated reaches and 12.4 NTU in less populated reaches during the rainy season. BOD levels are 14, 10.3 and 9.2 mg L(-1)respectively, showing decreasing pattern from highly populated to less populated reaches. In the less populated reach both seasons represent high (Nitrate) N levels, with 27.5 mg L(-1)in the rainy season. This is particularly due to agriculture-related waste leachate containing nitrate. To overcome the major problems, the government should give more power to relevant authorities to take legal actions to demarcate the stream corridors, at least streams in urban premises. Awareness programmes for stream dwellers to maintain the stream corridors and strict rules and regulations are essential for restoration of the Pinga Oya stream corridor to make it sustainable.

AB  - Context Although many studies have considered urban structure when investigating urban ecological networks, few have considered the three-dimensional (3D) structure of buildings as well as urban green spaces. Airborne LiDAR datasets provide an opportunity to quantify 3D structure and evaluate 3D metrics in connectivity mapping. Objectives We examined an urban ecological network using the 3D structure of both green spaces and buildings. Methods Using breeding-season bird species observations and airborne LiDAR data collected, we assessed the influence of 3D structural variables on species diversity. We used correlation analyses to determine if vertical distribution, volume, area, and height of both buildings and vegetation were related to bird species diversity. Then we conducted circuit theory-based current flow betweenness centrality (CFBC) analysis using the LiDAR-derived structural variables. Results We found that the volumes of buildings and 8-10 m vegetation heights were both highly correlated with species richness per unit area. There were significant differences between 2D and 3D connectivity analysis using LiDAR-derived variables among urban forest patches, boulevards, and apartment complexes. Within urban forest patches and parks, 3D CFBC represented canopy structural characteristics well, by showing high variance in spatial distributions. Conclusions The 3D CFBC results indicated that adjacent high-rise buildings, dense apartment complexes, and densely urbanized areas were isolated, as characterized by low centrality values, but that vegetation planted in open spaces between buildings could improve connectivity by linking isolated areas to core areas. Our research highlights the importance of considering 3D structure in planning and managing urban ecological connectivity.

AB  - In 1996, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and the Republic of Panama's Environmental Authority, with support from the United States Agency for International Development, undertook a comprehensive program to monitor the ecosystem of the Panama Canal watershed. The goals were to establish baseline indicators for the integrity of forest communities and rivers. Based on satellite image classification and ground surveys, the 2790 km(2) watershed had 1570 km(2) of forest in 1997, 1080 km(2) of which was in national parks and nature monuments. Most of the 490 km(2) of forest not currently in protected areas lies along the west bank of the Canal, and its management status after the year 2000 turnover of the Canal from the U.S. to Panama remains uncertain. In forest plots designed to monitor forest diversity and change, a total of 963 woody plant species were identified and mapped. We estimate there are a total of 850-1000 woody species in forests of the Canal corridor. Forests of the wetter upper reaches of the watershed are distinct in species composition from the Canal corridor, and have considerably higher diversity and many unknown species. These remote areas are extensively forested, poorly explored, and harbor an estimated 1400-2200 woody species. Vertebrate monitoring programs were also initiated, focusing on species threatened by hunting and forest fragmentation. Large mammals are heavily hunted in most forests of Canal corridor, and there was clear evidence that mammal density is greatly reduced in hunted areas and that this affects seed predation and dispersal. The human population of the watershed was 113 000 in 1990, and grew by nearly 4% per year from 1980 to 1990. Much of this growth was in a small region of the watershed on the outskirts of Panama City, but even rural areas, including villages near and within national parks, grew by 2% per year. There is no sewage treatment in the watershed, and many towns have no trash collection, thus streams near large towns are heavily polluted. Analyses of sediment loads in rivers throughout the watershed did not indicate that erosion has been increasing as a result of deforestation, rather, erosion seems to be driven largely by total rainfall and heavy rainfall events that cause landslides. Still, models suggest that large-scale deforestation would increase landslide frequency, and failure to detect increases in erosion could be due to the gradual deforestation rate and the short time period over which data are available. A study of runoff showed deforestation increased the amount of water from rainfall that passed directly into streams. As a result, dry season flow was reduced in a deforested catchment relative to a forested one. Currently, the Panama Canal watershed has extensive forest areas and streams relatively unaffected by humans. But impacts of hunting and pollution near towns are clear, and the burgeoning population will exacerbate these impacts in the next few decades. Changes in policies regarding forest protection and pollution control are necessary.

AB  - Competitive interactions between species are fundamental to understanding species assemblages, community dynamics, and ecological processes. Anthropogenic landscape change, particularly resulting from urbanization, can alter interspecific interactions; however, different forms of urbanization are predicted to have contrasting effects on competitive interactions. We developed contact networks between bobcats and pumas to evaluate (1) the potential for interspecific interactions between wild felids and (2) how space-use metrics might change along the urban gradient, including low-density exurban development, wild-land-urban interface, and wildland habitat, at both the population and individual level. We used an extensive telemetry data set for bobcats and pumas across multiple study areas to evaluate four space-use metrics: space-use overlap (used to define potential interactions among animals) and three additional contact network metrics, including degree (the number of potentially interacting animals), in-strength (sum of space-use overlap for animals), and equivalent social connectivity (ESC; considering both space-use extent and the amount of space-use overlap). Space-use extent was an important predictor of potential social interactions as measured by space-use metrics. Bobcats appeared to have a greater opportunity to interact with female pumas based on space-use overlap, degree, and in-strength, which demonstrates that relative scale of space-use extent among animals could be important for understanding interactions; ESC, however, was greater between bobcats and male pumas, likely due to the larger space-use extent by male compared to female pumas and the positive relationship between space-use extent and ESC. In addition, pumas and male bobcats exhibited a greater opportunity to interact, based on space-use overlap, degree, and in-strength, and demonstrated higher ESC compared to female bobcats. Counter to our predictions, felids associated with urbanized grids or with greater amounts of urbanization in their extent of space use did not appear to exhibit greater values of space-use metrics compared to animals with less exposure to urbanization; these results appear consistent with previous research evaluating population characteristics of felids across broad scales in our study areas. Greater ESC for male pumas and male bobcats suggests that males could be particularly important for facilitating connectivity of some ecological processes, such as the transmission of disease, through interspecific contact networks.

AB  - Tropical landscape connectivity and matrix quality near large stands of primary forest are important factors that dictate biodiversity trends in communities. Suitable matrix management surrounding primary forest may help conserve biodiversity, but areas with poor matrix management need attention to determine their long-term viability to support native levels of biodiversity. We examined variations in species and functional diversity and community composition using point-count surveys placed in preserved (PRES), transition (TRA), and disturbed (DIS) areas according to percent land cover of forest and cattle pasture along a human disturbance gradient in the northern Neotropics during an 8 month period from 2019-2020. We expected the gradient of human disturbance to drive species diversity loss of forest specialists from PRES to DIS, resulting in changes to functional diversity and community composition. We detected 228 species overall, with 163 in PRES (40 unique species), 159 in TRA (9 unique species), and 152 in DIS (20 unique species). TRA supported an avian community with shared aspects of PRES and DIS, leading to the highest functional, Shannon (85.8 estimated species), and Simpson (57.9 estimated species) diversity. Higher diversity of open-area specialists in TRA and DIS has led to shifts in functional traits and different species and functional community compositions relative to PRES. Land management in Neotropical human-modified landscapes must focus on increasing habitat quality in remnant forest fragments in the vicinity of large stands of primary forest to prevent species and ecosystem service loss from preserved areas and the distancing of local community compositions.

AB  - Grasslands in South Africa have been extensively transformed and fragmented, but are poorly protected. Commercial afforestation poses a particular threat to grassland biodiversity because areas suitable for forestry coincide with those supporting the greatest richness of endemic and threatened biota. To comply with international forestry standards, commercial timber growers leave "ecological networks" of interconnected open corridors within plantations: however, the value of these networks for conservation is unclear. This study investigated how bird community composition, richness and density were influenced by habitat extent, connectivity and quality in a grassland ecological network in a forestry plantation in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We surveyed birds and measured local vegetation characteristics throughout the network. There were at least five open habitat types within the network and bird communities responded clearly to differences between these habitats: all network communities showed a distinct shift away from those typical of control grasslands. There were three distinct groups of species in the network: (1) grassland specialists, (2) habitat generalists and (3) non-grassland species. Grassland specialists were restricted to areas that are burned regularly and to large, contiguous open areas or wide grassland corridors. We found no evidence for the importance of physical connectivity among open habitats for birds in the study area. Instead, it appears that the establishment of so-called ecological networks at this scale has created much unsuitable habitat for grassland specialist species. We suggest consolidation of open areas and a rotational, biennial burning regime as a more appropriate management strategy for commercial plantations in these Critically Endangered montane grasslands.

AB  - The development of a Pan-European Ecological Network is now widely recognised as an important policy initiative in support of protected Natura 2000 sites. The site selection is based on habitats as defined in the Annex I of the Habitats Directive. Whilst there is information about the presence of these habitats in Natura 2000 sites, there is no detail of their distribution elsewhere in Europe. The present paper describes a methodology that identifies the spatial distribution of habitats across Europe so that their actual extent can be determined. Five methodological steps are involved starting with selection of appropriate spatial data sets, defining knowledge rules from the descriptions of Annex I habitats, continuing with additional ecological expert knowledge when needed, implementation of the models, and finally the validation. Spatial distribution models were derived for 27 habitats representing the most significant ecosystems. This spatial modelling approach is illustrated with one detailed example. Validation showed that mapping accuracy depends on the habitat description available but also upon its spatial character. Thus widespread habitats such as forests were accurately assessed whereas dispersed classes such as freshwater systems were more difficult to assess. Possible methodological improvements are suggested, such as inclusion of vegetation releves to improve the knowledge rules. Extension of the methodology to other habitats would require a moderate effort since data collection and processing has now been completed and it is this which is the most time consuming part of the process. We conclude that our method maps widespread European habitats with unprecedented accuracy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Habitat loss and isolation associated with land conversion for human activities constitute the most serious threat to the Earth's biological diversity. The study of habitat fragmentation provides an important link between the concepts and principles of landscape ecology and the practice of landscape architecture and planning. Here I review ecological literature to examine current understanding of the ecological consequences of habitat fragmentation, and briefly suggest ways in which the results of these studies may guide decision-making by landscape architects and planners. Two theoretical developments in ecology have informed studies of habitat fragmentation and have provided testable hypotheses for empirical studies: island biogeography theory and metapopulation dynamics. Ecologists have examined the influences of habitat fragment size, shape, degree of isolation, context, and habitat quality or heterogeneity on plant and animal population persistence, community composition, and ecosystem processes.
   Disruption of continuous habitat usually results in an increase in the length of the boundary between fragments and their surrounding habitats. Newly created edges experience shifts in microclimatic characteristics, which may significantly alter the native plant and animal communities present. The size of a habitat fragment markedly influences the ecological processes occurring therein, largely due to the changes induced by these habitat edges. In general, species richness declines as fragment area decreases. Vegetated corridors may facilitate the movement of plants and animals among habitat fragments, however, more information is needed regarding the efficacy of corridors in reducing species loss from fragmented habitats. Fragments with highly irregular, convoluted boundaries will likely have greater exchange of nutrients, materials, and organisms with adjacent habitats than will those with less convoluted boundaries. Adjacent habitat types, land management regimes, and intensity of human activities influence boundary permeability and thus flow among habitat fragments. Large fragments are likely to be more heterogeneous than small fragments; they contain a greater variety of soil types, greater topographic variation, and a greater number of habitat types. An integrated view of the spatial characteristics of habitat fragments and their ecological consequences improves our ability to predict the outcomes of, and to design, particular patterns of land conversion.

AB  - Urbanization often negatively impacts biological diversity. Some organisms, however, have traits that are preadapted to urban environments and thus may thrive. Reticulitermes flavipes is one such organism. Indigenous to the Eastern US, it has been introduced into multiple countries. In France, R. flavipes causes major damage to buildings. Although Paris is one of the country's most infested cities, the factors determining R. flavipes' distribution and propagation are poorly understood. Using data on termite occurrence, termite genetics, and environmental variables, our study aims to identify factors that explain the distribution and spread of R. flavipes within Paris. First, we explored the association between several environmental variables and the termite's distribution pattern in Paris; since 2000, a total of 2106 infestations have been recorded. Second, we inferred termite population and colony genetic structure at 66 sample locations using 9 microsatellite loci. Third, we used least-cost models and partial Mantel tests to study the effects of environmental variables on the termite's population genetic structure. Our analyses revealed that building-related variables were significantly associated with termite infestations and could thus help explain the termite's spatial distribution pattern. Furthermore, railway networks also explain termite propagation and genetic patterns. Additionally, we found that the termite's spread is likely driven by budding dispersal, which may be constrained by buildings and roads. Even if budding dispersal could facilitate R. flavipes' spread in urban areas, it cannot explain the termite's distribution in Paris all on its own. Indeed, termite propagation seems to be significantly driven by anthropogenic activities.

AB  - Natural habitats in urban areas provide benefits for both humans and biodiversity. However, to achieve biodiversity gains, we require new techniques to determine habitat suitability and ecological connectivity that will inform urban planning and development. Using an example of an urban population of water voles Arvicola amphibius, we developed a habitat suitability model and a resistance-surface-based model of landscape connectivity to identify potential connectivity between areas of suitable habitat. We then updated the environmental variables according to new urban development plans and used our models to generate spatially explicit predictions of both habitat suitability and connectivity. To make models accessible to urban and conservation planners, we developed an interactive mapping tool that provided users with a graphical user interface (GUI) to inform conservation planning for this species. The model found that habitat suitability for water voles was related to the proportion and distance from key environmental variables, such as built-up areas and urban green spaces, while the connectivity model identified important corridors connecting areas of potential distribution for this species. Future development plans altered the potential spatial distribution of the water vole population, reducing the extent of suitable habitat in some core areas. The interactive mapping tool made available suitable habitat and connectivity maps for conservation managers to assess new planning applications and for the development of a conservation action plan for water voles. Synthesis and applications. We believe this approach provides a framework for future development of nature conservation tools that can be used by planners to inform ecological decision-making, increase biodiversity and reduce human-wildlife conflict in urban environments.

AB  - As systems of marine protected areas (MPAs) expand globally, there is a risk that new MPAs will be biased toward places that are remote or unpromising for extractive activities, and hence follow the trend of terrestrial protected areas in being residual' to commercial uses. Such locations typically provide little protection to the species and ecosystems that are most exposed to threatening processes. There are strong political motivations to establish residual reserves that minimize costs and conflicts with users of natural resources. These motivations will likely remain in place as long as success continues to be measured in terms of area (km(2)) protected. The global pattern of MPAs was reviewed and appears to be residual, supported by a rapid growth of large, remote MPAs. The extent to which MPAs in Australia are residual nationally and also regionally within the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) Marine Park was also examined. Nationally, the recently announced Australian Commonwealth marine reserves were found to be strongly residual, making almost no difference to business as usual' for most ocean uses. Underlying this result was the imperative to minimize costs, but without the spatial constraints of explicit quantitative objectives for representing bioregions or the range of ecological features in highly protected zones. In contrast, the 2004 rezoning of the GBR was exemplary, and the potential for residual protection was limited by applying a systematic set of planning principles, such as representing a minimum percentage of finely subdivided bioregions. Nonetheless, even at this scale, protection was uneven between bioregions. Within-bioregion heterogeneity might have led to no-take zones being established in areas unsuitable for trawling with a risk that species assemblages differ between areas protected and areas left available for trawling. A simple four-step framework of questions for planners and policy makers is proposed to help reverse the emerging residual tendency of MPAs and maximize their effectiveness for conservation. This involves checks on the least-cost approach to establishing MPAs in order to avoid perverse outcomes. (c) 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has led to deteriorated wetland water quality, reduced biodiversity, and fragmented wetland landscapes, which seriously threaten the sustainable development of regional ecology. Based on land use data of Dongying City, Shandong Province, in 2020, this study selected the landscape disturbance degree and landscape fragility index to construct a landscape ecological risk evaluation model and to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of landscape ecological risk in Dongying City in 2020. The MSPA-Conefor-MCR model was used to extract the ecological network of wetlands in Dongying City, and the topological structure indices were quantitatively analyzed. Combined with the actual situation within the study area, the source sites to be optimized were identified by risk zoning and source importance; the ecological resistance surface was modified using landscape ecological risk, and the ecological network was optimized by simulating edge increase in order to evaluate the robustness of the ecological network before and after optimization and to verify the edge increase effect. The results show that the ecological risk in Dongying is high, mainly distributed in the central region and extending to the northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest. A total of 131 ecological source sites (6 core and 125 resting-stone source sites) and 180 ecological corridors were extracted, and the whole ecological network was found to be less stable and to have stronger network heterogeneity using a topological analysis. By simulating 11 additional edges, the robustness of the optimized ecological network was significantly improved. Optimizing the simulated-edge increase can enhance the smoothness of ecological energy flow, which can provide a scientific basis for the construction of the ecological security pattern of wetlands in Dongying City.

AB  - Recent concern over increasing loss of biodiversity has prompted considerable interest in the role of urban green spaces as reservoirs of local biodiversity. This study assessed the diversity of three indicator taxa - plants, ants and birds - on golf courses spanning a wide range of environmental variation in terms of climate, elevation, course age, size and connectivity to native woodland. Species richness and community composition was further compared between contrasting on-course habitat types that reflect different management intensities. We identified a set of taxon-specific environmental correlates indicating an intricate interplay of landscape- and local-scale variables that affect local species diversity. Our results show that floristic diversity is positively associated with the amount of rainfall, whereas ant and bird diversity are related to local-scale factors, particularly the number of trees and the size of water features on a site. The amount of on-course native habitat was a strong predictor of plant and ant diversity and was also associated with the number of unique species at the site level; this reinforces the value of remnant habitat patches as local biodiversity reservoirs that represent mini hot-spots in an otherwise species-poor urban landscape. Community composition for all three taxa differed markedly between non-playing and playing areas, with boundary and remnant habitats generally having more diverse, species-rich communities. Our results suggest that local floral and faunal biodiversity on urban golf courses can be enhanced by creating woody non-playing areas and, especially, by preserving, restoring or expanding remnant habitats.

AB  - The development of road networks over the years has caused serious damage to biodiversity. However, few studies have explored the impact of different road grades on ecological network connectivity, especially at multiple levels and at different dispersal distances. Here, we propose an analytical framework based on the integrated graph theory and the circuit theory method, in order to model the ecological network of virtual species, to evaluate connectivity at the landscape, patch, and corridor levels, and to identify the key patches and key corridors that contribute the most to the maintenance of connectivity. The empirical analysis in this study was performed on six scenarios, which were designed by successively integrating different road grades into the landscape. On this basis, the impact of different road grades on the connectivity, key patches, and key corridors in Wuhan, China, were explored. The results showed that: (1) High-grade roads have a significant impact on landscape-patch-corridor connectivity, while medium-grade roads have a similar degree of impact on patch-level connectivity as high-grade roads do. (2) Species with long dispersal ability (25 km) are susceptible to roads at the landscape and corridor levels; species with low and medium dispersal abilities (10, 15 and 20 km) are vulnerable to roads at the patch levels. (3) The importance of key patches and the resistance of key corridors are signifi-cantly increased by the influence of roads, while their spatial distribution changes slightly. This integrated framework contributes to an evaluation of the impacts of different grades road on ecological processes, so as to better provide targeted suggestions for biodiversity conservation and transportation planning.

AB  - As species biology and ecology is profoundly influenced by climate, any climatic alteration may have severe consequences on marine pelagic ecosystems and their food webs. It remains challenging to estimate the influence of climate on both structural and functional properties of food webs. In this study, we proposed an innovative approach to assess the propagating effects of climate change on ecosystem food web. The approach is based on a sensitivity analysis of a food-web model, a linear inverse model using a Monte Carlo method coupled with a Markov Chain, in which changes in the values of parameters are driven by external Ecological Niche Model outputs. Our sensitivity analysis was restricted to parameters regarding a keystone functional group in marine ecosystems, i.e. small pelagic fish. At the ecosystem level, the consequences were evaluated using both structural and functional ecological network indices. The approach is innovative as it is the first time that these three methods were combined to assess ecological network indices sensitivity to future climatic pressure. This coupling method was applied on the French continental shelf of the Bay of Biscay for which a food-web model already exists and where future changes in the distribution of small pelagic fish have already been examined through model building and projections. In response to the sensitivity analysis corresponding to an increase in small pelagics production only, our results suggested a more active system with an intense plankton-small pelagics-seabirds chain and an efficient recycling to maximize detritus use in the system in relation with detritus export. All results combined together seemed to be in favor of a system adapting to sustain the tested increase in production of small pelagic planktivores. Finally, regarding the innovative combination of numerical tools presented, even if further investigations are still necessary to get a more realistic view of cumulative effects resulting from one given pressure (or more) on a food web (e.g. altering different biological compartments at the same time), the Ecological Network Analysis indices values showed a higher variability under the scenarios of change. Our study thus pointed out a promising methodology to assess propagating changes in structural and functional ecosystem properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urbanization poses a serious threat to local biodiversity, yet towns and cities with abundant natural features may harbor important species populations and communities. While the contribution of urban greenspaces to conservation has been demonstrated by numerous studies within temperate regions, few consider the bird communities associated with different landcovers in Neotropical cities. To begin to fill this knowledge gap, we examined how the avifauna of a wetland city in northern Amazonia varied across six urban landcover types (coastal bluespace; urban bluespace; managed greenspace; unmanaged greenspace; dense urban; and sparse urban). We measured detections, species richness, and a series of ground cover variables that characterized the heterogeneity of each landcover, at 114 locations across the city. We recorded >10% (98) of Guyana's bird species in Georgetown, including taxa of conservation interest. Avian detections, richness, and community composition differed with landcover type. Indicator species analysis identified 29 species from across dietary guilds, which could be driving community composition. Comparing landcovers, species richness was highest in managed greenspaces and lowest in dense urban areas. The canal network had comparable levels of species richness to greenspaces. The waterways are likely to play a key role in enhancing habitat connectivity as they traverse densely urbanized areas. Both species and landcover information should be integrated into urban land-use planning in the rapidly urbanizing Neotropics to maximize the conservation value of cities. This is imperative in the tropics, where anthropogenic pressures on species are growing significantly, and action needs to be taken to prevent biodiversity collapse.

AB  - Rapid urbanization and drastic land-use change have led to landscape fragmentation and ecological environment deterioration in the regions along the Grand Canal. Building an ecological network is an important means to improve the connectivity of habitat patches and carry out ecological protection and restoration of territorial space, which is of great significance to ensure regional biodiversity and ecological security. In this article, we took the Huaiyang Section of the Grand Canal (Huaiyang Canal) as the study area, used the ecosystem service assessment model, morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA), and the landscape connectivity evaluation method to identify ecological sources, then used the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model and the gravity model to extract and grade ecological corridors. Based on these, the ecological network was constructed by combining the identification method of ecological nodes and ecological breakpoints. The aim of this was to provide a reference for the ecological space optimization of Huaiyang Canal and even the entire Grand Canal, the formulation of an ecological protection plan, and the implementation of territorial space ecological restoration. The results showed that the spatial distribution of the water conservation service, soil conservation service, carbon sequestration service, and biodiversity conservation service were significantly different, and the level of ecosystem services showed a trend of continuous degradation from 1990 to 2018. There were 12 ecological source patches comprehensively identified by multiple methods, with a total area of 2007.06 km(2). In terms of spatial distribution, large ecological source patches were mainly distributed in the central and western areas adjacent to the Grand Canal, while small ecological source patches were scattered in the eastern and southern border regions of the study area. The total length of ecological corridors was 373.84 km, of which the number of the primary ecological corridor, secondary ecological corridor, and tertiary ecological corridor were 9, 7, and 7, respectively, and the suitable width of the ecological corridor was 200-400 m. After optimization, the proposed ecological network was composed of 3 key ecological source patches, 9 important ecological source patches, 23 terrestrial corridors, 10 aquatic corridors, and 18 ecological nodes. Twenty-nine ecological breakpoints were key areas requiring ecological restoration. The overlap rate of the integrated ecosystem service change area and land-use change area was 99%, indicating that land-use change has a significant impact on regional ecosystem services. This study is of great significance for carrying out the ecological protection and restoration of the Huaiyang Canal and adjusting local land-use policies. It also provides a typical case demonstration for identifying an ecological network and formulating ecological restoration planning for other sections of the Grand Canal and cities along the canal.

AB  - Tropical mountains are areas of high species richness and endemism. Two historical phenomena may have contributed to this: (i) fragmentation and isolation of habitats may have promoted the genetic differentiation of populations and increased the possibility of allopatric divergence and speciation and (ii) the mountain areas may have allowed long-term population persistence during global climate fluctuations. These two phenomena have been studied using either species occurrence data or estimating species divergence times. However, only few studies have used intraspecific genetic data to analyse the mechanisms by which endemism may emerge at the microevolutionary scale. Here, we use landscape analysis of genomic SNP data sampled from two high-elevation plant species from an archipelago of tropical sky islands (the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt) to test for population genetic differentiation, synchronous demographic changes and habitat persistence. We show that genetic differentiation can be explained by the degree of glacial habitat connectivity among mountains and that mountains have facilitated the persistence of populations throughout glacial/interglacial cycles. Our results support the ongoing role of tropical mountains as cradles for biodiversity by uncovering cryptic differentiation and limits to gene flow.

AB  - Urbanisation threatens biodiversity globally, yet some animal populations persist within urban landscapes. Conservation of urban wildlife has prioritised parks and remnant bushland as critical habitat and neglected the role that residential gardens offer for conservation. We explored the potential for residential gardens to assist the conservation of mammals using an online questionnaire administered to residents of two case study cities in Australia to identify how widespread mammals in cities can be, which garden features promote mammal presence, and if the features varied among species with different habitat requirements. From 649 responses we found that three mammal species with different habitat requirements occurred in residential gardens throughout the city landscape. Garden features promoting mammal presence were consistent with broad ecological and habitat requirements of each species, but differed among both species and regions. Our study demonstrates that residential gardens offer a valuable habitat for mammals, and that garden features could be manipulated to promote use of gardens by these species. By considering gardens in urban planning and management actions aimed at conserving urban wildlife, residential gardens offer additional habitat to parks, roadside vegetation and urban bushland, and can play a significant role in biodiversity conservation.

AB  - High-intensity urban development and economic exploitation have led to the fragmentation and isolation of regional habitat patches, and biodiversity is under serious threat. Scientific identification and effective optimization of ecological networks are essential for maintaining and restoring regional ecosystem connectivity and guiding sustainable socio-economic development. Taking the mountainous areas of southwest Hubei Province (MASHP) in central China as an example, this study first developed a new integrated approach to identify ecological sources based on a quantitative assessment of ecosystem services and the morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) method; it then used the Linkage Mapper tool to extract ecological corridors, applied the principle of hydrological analysis to identify ecological nodes, evaluated each ecological element to quantify its importance, and finally constructed the ecological network and further proposed some optimization countermeasures. The results show that the ecological network in the MASHP is dominated by ecological resources composed of forestland. Connectivity in the central region is significantly better than in other regions, including 49 ecological sources with an area of 3837.92 km(2), 125 ecological corridors with a total length of 2014.61 km, and 46 ecological nodes. According to the spatial distribution of crucial ecological landscape elements, a complete and systematic ecological framework of "two verticals, three belts, three groups, and multiple nodes" was proposed. The internal optimization of the ecological network in mountainous areas should focus on improving ecological flow, and strategies such as enhancing the internal connectivity of ecosystems, unblocking ecological corridors, and dividing ecological functional zones can be adopted. Based on the above analyses, this study also made recommendations for ecological protection and development and construction planning in mountainous areas. This study can provide realistic paths and scientific guidelines for ecological security and high-quality development in the MASHP, and it can also have implications for the construction of ecological networks and comprehensive ecological management in other mountainous areas.

AB  - The conservation and promotion of biodiversity in urban spaces has become a core concern in urban greening. As cities continue to densify, however, urban green spaces are becoming smaller and more isolated. Many hope that wildflowers, and with them also faunistic biodiversity, can be maintained through networks of small informal green spaces. Currently, there are little data available for city planners to answer the questions of how patch size and ecological connectivity affect the population persistence of wildflowers in small vegetation patches. To address these concerns, we surveyed all vegetation patches greater than 1 m2 in public spaces across seven 1 km2 quadrats distributed across the city of Zurich, Switzerland. Our survey focused on a list of 166 herbaceous vascular plant species. We analyzed vegetation patch topologies (frequency distributions of size and connectivity) and related it to alpha and beta species diversity. Dispersal traits of investigated species were used to interpret connectivity patterns. Over 75 % of patches were <20 m2 in size, however, these small patches made up only 3.4 % of total vegetation area. Species richness was significantly positively correlated with patch area. Nevertheless, taken together, small patches had similar species richness and higher beta diversity than larger patches. These small patches contribute far more than expected to overall wildflower species richness in the city - "punching above their weight". This held true even for less common species. However, our research indicates that connecting these patches to one another and to larger green spaces is essential to unlocking their potential as habitats and potentially allowing for the natural colonization and reinforcement of existing populations. As cities densify, we must acknowledge that small vegetation patches such as tree discs or road margins are essential for the survival of wildflower populations and associated fauna, especially in highly urbanized areas.

AB  - Designing connected landscapes is among the most widespread strategies for achieving biodiversity conservation targets. The challenge lies in simultaneously satisfying the connectivity needs of multiple species at multiple spatial scales under uncertain climate and land-use change. To evaluate the contribution of remnant habitat fragments to the connectivity of regional habitat networks, we developed a method to integrate uncertainty in climate and land-use change projections with the latest developments in network-connectivity research and spatial, multipurpose conservation prioritization. We used land-use change simulations to explore robustness of species' habitat networks to alternative development scenarios. We applied our method to 14 vertebrate focal species of periurban Montreal, Canada. Accounting for connectivity in spatial prioritization strongly modified conservation priorities and the modified priorities were robust to uncertain climate change. Setting conservation priorities based on habitat quality and connectivity maintained a large proportion of the region's connectivity, despite anticipated habitat loss due to climate and land-use change. The application of connectivity criteria alongside habitat-quality criteria for protected-area design was efficient with respect to the amount of area that needs protection and did not necessarily amplify trade-offs among conservation criteria. Our approach and results are being applied in and around Montreal and are well suited to the design of ecological networks and green infrastructure for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services in other regions, in particular regions around large cities, where connectivity is critically low.

AB  - Habitat suitability index (HSI) models are increasingly used to guide ecological restoration. Successful restoration is a byproduct of several factors, including physical and biological processes, as well as permitting and logistical considerations. Rarely are factors from all of these categories included in HSI models, despite their combined relevance to common restoration goals such as population persistence. We developed a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based HSI for restoring persistent high-relief subtidal oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reefs protected from harvest (i.e., sanctuaries) in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, USA. Expert stakeholder input identified 17 factors to include in the HSI. Factors primarily represented physical (e.g., salinity) and biological (e.g., larval dispersal) processes relevant to oyster restoration, but also included several relevant permitting (e.g., presence of seagrasses) and logistical (e.g., distance to restoration material stockpile sites) considerations. We validated the model with multiple years of oyster density data from existing sanctuaries, and compared HSI output with distributions of oyster reefs from the late 1800's. Of the 17 factors included in the model, stakeholders identified four factors-salinity, larval export from existing oyster sanctuaries, larval import to existing sanctuaries, and dissolved oxygen-most critical to oyster sanctuary site selection. The HSI model provided a quantitative scale over which a vast water body (similar to 6,000 km(2)) was narrowed down by 95% to a much smaller suite of optimal (top 1% HSI) and suitable (top 5% HSI) locations for oyster restoration. Optimal and suitable restoration locations were clustered in northeast and southwest Pamlico Sound. Oyster density in existing sanctuaries, normalized for time since reef restoration, was a positive exponential function of HSI, providing validation for the model. Only a small portion (10-20%) of historical reef locations overlapped with current, model-predicted optimal and suitable restoration habitat. We contend that stronger linkages between larval connectivity, landscape ecology, stakeholder engagement and spatial planning within HSI models can provide a more holistic, unified approach to restoration.

AB  - Intertidal crabs are abundant in tropical estuaries and have bio-indicator potential. However, the use of intertidal crabs in guiding management actions is limited because high-replication, cost-effective tools to analyze their distribution patterns at large scales are lacking. This study used assemblage modeling and photography to rapidly build formal understanding of the spatial organization of crab communities in the low intertidal zone, between mean sea level at low spring tide and the edge of the mangrove forest, within and among estuaries. A classification and regression tree model revealed seven distinct habitats based on relative occurrence of five species (Uca coarctata, Uca seismella, Macrophthalmus japonicus, Metopograpsus frontalis, and Metopograpsus latifrons) among eight estuaries along 160 km of coast in North Queensland, Australia (18A degrees 28'aEuro"19A degrees 25' S, 146A degrees 12'aEuro"147A degrees 14' E), across four sampling trips between April 2009 and October 2010. Photography provided high-replication sampling across a large area relative to the aim of the study but did not represent the whole intertidal crab community. Complementary hand collections within one estuary allowed the occurrences of three other species (Perisesarma longicristatum, Australoplax tridentata, and Metopograpsus thukuhar) to be fitted into the model. Species occurred across habitats, yet a high occurrence of different species characterized each habitat. The presence of some species not usually found on low intertidal banks suggested connectivity across the intertidal landscape. The model provided a formal basis to add previous small "site or transect specific" scale spatial distribution knowledge as well as other ecological information. Areas with outlying values can be identified as research and management priorities in the absence of other information, although this prioritization should be done with care. The approach may be transferable to other organisms and systems to provide rapid, cost-effective information on the distribution of key fauna where background understanding and resources are limited.

AB  - The installation of green roofs, defined here as rooftops with a shallow soil cover and extensive vegetation, has been proposed as a possible measure to mitigate the loss of green space caused by the steady growth of cities. However, the effectiveness of green roofs in supporting arthropod communities, and the extent to which they facilitate connectivity of these communities within the urban environment is currently largely unknown. We investigated the variation of species community composition (beta diversity) of four arthropod groups with contrasting mobility (Carabidae, Araneae, Curculionidae, and Apidae) on 40 green roofs and 40 extensively managed green sites on the ground in the city of Zurich, Switzerland. With redundancy analysis and variation partitioning, we (1) disentangled the relative importance of local environmental conditions, the surrounding land cover composition, and habitat connectivity on species community composition, (2) searched for specific spatial scales of habitat connectivity for the different arthropod groups, and (3) discussed the ecological and functional value of green roofs in cities. Our study revealed that on green roofs community composition of high-mobility arthropod groups (bees and weevils) were mainly shaped by habitat connectivity, while low-mobility arthropod groups (carabids and spiders) were more influenced by local environmental conditions. A similar but less pronounced pattern was found for ground communities. The high importance of habitat connectivity in shaping high-mobility species community composition indicates that these green roof communities are substantially connected by the frequent exchange of individuals among surrounding green roofs. On the other hand, low-mobility species communities on green roofs are more likely connected to ground sites than to other green roofs. The integration of green roofs in urban spatial planning strategies has great potential to enable higher connectivity among green spaces, so that eventually even communities of low-mobility species become connected. Furthermore, improving the design of green roofs (composition and configuration of vegetation and soil types) could enhance the ecological value, particularly for low-mobility species.

AB  - AimEvery spring endangered Mexican long-nosed bats (Leptonycteris nivalis) migrate up to 1200km from central Mexico to southern United States. Evidence suggests that L.nivalis follows the blooms of paniculate agave plants (genus Agave, subgenus Agave). Paniculate agave inflorescences are adapted to attract bats, and studies have indicated that Leptonycteris spp. played a key role in Agave speciation. We test the hypothesis of the Agave migratory corridor by (1) modelling the distribution of the relevant Agave species; and (2) testing whether bat records are significantly related to Agave species richness as predicted by our models.
   LocationMexico and United States.
   MethodsWe selected nine paniculate Agave species based on a set of criteria and modelled the current distribution of those species using maxent and the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Production (GARP), and geographic information systems to analyse the spatial correspondence of Agave richness and presence of L.nivalis.
   ResultsWe combined the Agave presence maps that resulted from the models with higher performance to create a richness map. This map indicated up to five species overlapping. L.nivalis occurrence areas correspond with areas with two, three and four Agave species more often than random expectations at the 0.05 significance level. The opposite is observed for areas with 0 Agave species where L.nivalis correspond less often than random.
   Main conclusionsPresence-pseudo-absence and presence-background modelling tools allowed us to map potential Agave presence. These maps could guide conservation actions to ensure the maintenance of this pollination corridor. Areas with higher number of Agave species are distributed along mountain chains and may provide foraging resources for L.nivalis for longer period of time during its migration. We recommend implementing a long-term monitoring programme in those areas to document inflorescence timing in Agave species and the presence of L.nivalis.

AB  - Human development and roads threaten wildlife through distinct mechanisms and understanding the influence of these elements can better inform mitigation and conservation strategies. We used camera traps to quantify the effects of major roads, environmental factors, and human development on the mammalian community composition between sites north and south of a major interstate highway in northern Utah, USA. We found no significant differences in species richness nor community similarity across the north-south divide of the highway. Through Bayesian hierarchical modeling, we compared the effects of the distance to the highway, housing and human population density, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the human footprint index to changes in mammalian community composition and species-specific habitat usage. Community occupancy response, similarity, and species richness were negatively affected by increased housing and human population densities and positively affected by increased NDVI and decreased human footprint, whereas their response to the highway was more inconclusive. We conclude that mammalian community composition in our study area is influenced by both environmental conditions and human development while the effect of the highway was more nuanced, possibly due to the presence of a newly constructed wildlife overpass. Taken together, the lack of differences in species richness or community composition across the highway suggests that it may not currently exacerbate the effects of other anthropogenic sources of habitat fragmentation and highlights the need for additional research into human-wildlife conflict mitigation strategies.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation affects amphibian populations worldwide. Urban expansion and associated infrastructure are a main cause of habitat degradation and loss of landscape-scale habitat connectivity. Mitigation measures such as underpasses and associated fences are implemented to reduce the impacts of development on protected species. However, such efforts focus largely on local outcomes rather than envisioning how mitigation may contribute to habitat connectivity and population persistence at the landscape scale. We used a graph-theoretic approach to model structural and functional connectivity for a widespread but declining pond-breeding amphibian, the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus). This involved assessing species movement among breeding ponds and associated landscapes with different levels of urban and rural development and linear barriers. We used recent regional pond survey data for great crested newts combined with published data on movement and habitat use to explore connectivity. Landscape connectivity was affected by factors such as habitat quality and quantity, scale of movement and different degrees of road permeability. Linear barriers to movement and differences in their permeability were critical for predicting their impact on both migratory and dispersal movements in Triturus cristatus. Incorporating landscape connectivity modelling which includes the impact of barriers such as roads would substantially improve population-level outcomes from mitigation schemes. An accurate understanding of the far-reaching consequences of road mitigation as well as immediate, local effects, combined with our methods of assessing road permeability could transform future mitigation efforts by directing action to places that not only improve individual survival but also maximise connectivity at the landscape-scale.

AB  - Coastal vegetation is under increasing pressure with the expansion of urban developments, tourism, population and changing climates. This study sought to examine the effects of fragmentation on the threatened plant community, Coastal Moonah Woodland, in southern Victoria, Australia. We examined the effects on community composition of surrounding land use (urban, rural, native vegetation), remnant size and environmental attributes at three spatial scales. At larger scales, geographic and environmental attributes, such as annual rainfall and temperature, were important drivers of community composition. At finer scales, remnant size, disturbance, weed invasion, connectivity, and immediate surrounding land use impacted more on community composition. At these scales, increasing native vegetation cover in the landscape, remnant connectivity and size positively influenced community composition. If coastal development continues at the current rate, all but a few remnants of this community will be surrounded by the urban landscape. Thus, planning for the integration of these remnants in the urban landscape through long-term management plans and community involvement is essential for the survival of these remnants.

AB  - Wetlands within tallgrass prairie are among the most endangered ecosystems in North America and serve as critical habitat for many sensitive and endemic species. Although loss of these habitats has acutely affected reptiles and amphibians, most prairie restoration initiatives take an ecosystem restoration approach adapted for plant and/or game species, with few focusing particularly on herpetofauna. Limited information exists documenting the population responses of reptiles and amphibians to wetland restoration in tallgrass prairie ecosystems. We used multiple techniques to compare reptile and amphibian communities in recently (2006) restored and unrestored tallgrass prairie and associated wetland habitats at Woolsey Wet Prairie Sanctuary (WWPS), a wetland mitigation site in Northwest Arkansas (USA). We documented 24 reptile and amphibian species and found that Regina grahamii (Graham's Crayfish Snake) and Lithobates areolatus (Crawfish Frog), both of which are considered species of greatest conservation need in the state, showed preferential use of restored habitat, while common, widespread species did not use restored or unrestored habitat preferentially. Our results demonstrate that restoration of tallgrass prairie and associated wetlands benefits rare and sensitive herpetofauna and highlight two important management considerations: 1) promoting ephemeral (fishless) hydrology, and 2) emphasizing terrestrial movement corridors and critical upland habitat.

AB  - In 1998, Trinidad experienced its first major outbreak of dengue haemorrhagic fever. Data from the Trinidad Public Health Laboratory, the National Surveillance Unit and Insect Vector Control Division, Ministry of Health, Trinidad and Tobago were analysed to determine the impact of vector control measures on the dengue outbreak. Geographical Information Systems (GIS)/Global Positioning Systems (GPS) were used to map cases and to distinguish epidemiological clusters. The Aedes aegypti population densities were higher than the 5% transmission threshold in all counties. The spatial distribution of dengue fever cases was significantly correlated with the heavily populated east-west corridor in the north and several distinctly separate clusters in the western part of the island. The temporal distribution patterns showed significantly more dengue fever cases occurring during the rainy season than during the dry season. This study documents the importance of vector control in the prevention of dengue transmission since no vaccine is currently available, and emphasizes the urgent need to understand better the environmental factors which contribute to the proliferation of this disease vector Ae. aegypti.

AB  - Urban riparian corridors have the capacity to maintain high levels of bird abundance and biodiversity. How riparian corridors in cities are used by waterbirds has received relatively little focus in urban bird studies. The principal objective of our study was to determine how habitat and landscape elements affect waterbird biodiversity in an arid city. We surveyed 36 transects stratified across a gradient of urbanization and water availability along the Salt River, a riparian corridor that is monitored as part of the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long Term Ecological Research study system located in Phoenix, Arizona, USA. Habitat and landscape variables were reduced via Principal Component Analysis to be used in a constrained ordination that identified waterbird community composition patterns, and then used to model the responses of guild abundance and diversity. Habitat and landscape components from the constrained ordination explained 39% of the variation in the waterbird community. Land use components were related to the suite of species at each site, but had a weaker relationship to guild abundance or diversity. Habitat-level components (water physiognomy, shoreline composition, and terrestrial vegetation cover) were more important in predicting both guild abundance and diversity. We found that water physiognomy was the strongest driver shaping waterbird community parameters. The implications of our study are relevant to urban planning in arid cities, offering the opportunity to design and improve wildlife habitat while providing other important public amenities.

AB  - Ecologists are familiar with two data structures commonly used to represent landscapes. Vector-based maps delineate land cover types as polygons, while raster lattices represent the landscape as a grid. Here we adopt a third lattice data structure, the graph. A graph represents a landscape as a set of nodes (e.g., habitat patches) connected to some degree by edges that join pairs of nodes functionally (e.g., via dispersal). Graph theory is well developed in other fields, including geography (transportation networks, routing applications. siting problems) and computer science (circuitry and network optimization). We present an overview of basic elements of graph theory as it might be applied to issues of connectivity in heterogeneous landscapes, focusing especially on applications of metapopulation theory in conservation biology. We develop a general set of analyses using a hypothetical landscape mosaic of habitat patches in a nonhabitat matrix. Our results suggest that a simple graph construct. the minimum spanning tree, can serve as a powerful guide to decisions about the relative importance of individual patches to overall landscape connectivity. We then apply this approach to an actual conservation scenario involving the threatened Mexican Spotted Owl(Strix occidentalis lucida). Simulations with an incidence-function metapopulation model suggest that population persistence can be maintained de spite substantial losses of habitat area, so long as the minimum spanning tree is protected. We believe that graph theory has considerable promise for applications concerned with connectivity and ecological flows in general. Because the theory is already well developed in other disciplines, it might be brought to bear immediately on pressing ecological applications in conservation biology and landscape ecology.

AB  - Urbanization causes tremendous pressure on biodiversity and ecosystems at the global scale. China is among the countries undergoing the fastest urban expansion. For a long time, ecological environment protection has not been a priority in China's urban planning process. Current urban growth optimization research has some limitations regarding the selection of more scientific ecological constraint indicators and the interaction between urban expansion and ecological factors. This paper at first aimed to establish a reasonable comprehensive biodiversity constraint indicator based on the indicators of net primary productivity, habitat connectivity and habitat quality, and then conducted a case study in Beijing and compared biodiversity loss and urban growth patterns under different developing situations. The integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade-offs model and GIS-related methods were used to obtain biodiversity and ecological spatial distribution layers. Then an ecological priority-oriented urban growth simulation method was proposed to search for minimum biodiversity loss. The results showed that the important biodiversity security areas were mostly distributed in the western part of the study area and that the ecological degradation in 2000 had a radial pattern and was well in line with the urban construction and ring road distribution patterns. Meanwhile, biodiversity loss with the biodiversity constraint was much less than actual urban growth in 2000-2010. Under the guidance of ecological optimization, urban growth in the research results reflects decentralized and multi-center spatial development characteristics. This type of urban growth not only provides a new model for breaking the inertia of urban sprawl but also proposes 'biodiversity security' as an applicable regulatory tool for urban planning and space governance reforming.

AB  - Rapid urbanization development and construction has seriously threatened the connectivity of habitat patches in cities and hindered the construction of ecological networks in highly urbanized areas. Among them, China is affected by early compressed urbanization, and the broken ecological space in cities and towns has attracted the extensive interest of researchers. To avoid the subjective randomness and single analysis of ecological space in urbanization areas, this paper takes the central urban area of Wuhan as the main research area. It comprehensively evaluates the ecological network space by combining the MSPA-MCR model. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Identifying the ecological landscape types with important ecological significance in the study area: Core (88.29%), Islet (0.25%), Perf (0.63%), Edge (9.74%), Loop (0.22%), and Bridge (0.14%). Through the dPC landscape index, seven important ecological sources south of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River were identified. (2) According to the comprehensive factors of natural and human factors constructed by the MCR model, the minimum cumulative ecological resistance surface was established, with an average value of 2.65, a maximum value of 4.70, and a minimum value of 1.00, showing a trend that the ecological resistance values in the central and eastern parts are lower than those in the western part. (3) According to the standard deviation ellipse, the distribution direction of NE-SW in ecological sources was analyzed. The ecological sources distributed in the north were less, and the spatial distribution was scattered on the whole. The strong global positive correlation and local spatial aggregation characteristics of ecological resistance surface were evaluated according to spatial autocorrelation. Based on the gravity model, the interaction intensity of ecological corridors between source areas was evaluated, and the importance of ecological corridor protection and restoration was quantitatively analyzed. The research results provide scientific and reasonable references and a basis for ecological planning of Wuhan central city.

AB  - The construction of the urban ecological network has a comprehensive effect on urban aesthetics, society and economy, and provides the driving force for urban sustainable development. However, we found few studies on constructing and optimizing urban ecological networks in cities with the highest human density. In this paper, landscape patter n indexes were applied to analyze the landscape characteristics and morphological patter n analysis (MSPA) to identi f y the ecological source, the landscape connectivity and the region attributes revised the ecological resistance surface, and urban ecological network was constructed by MCR model. The results show that: (1) many ecological land types mainly distributed in the tributaries of the Yangtze River, while only forest land and water areas occupied in the northwest are. (2) Compared with 1995 and 2005, the number of ecological corridors in 2015 was decreasing. Although the ecological connectivity was improved, which of the Yangtze River was limited. (3) The coordinated development and the ecological protection ecological network optimi-zation plan would promote the connectivity of the urban ecological functioning stability. This study provides recommendations for the optimization of the urban ecological network, which ar e of great significance for protecting biodiversity, improving ecosystem functions, and maintaining the regional ecological security pattern.

AB  - Karst tiankengs are oases in degraded karst landscapes and act as repositories for biodiversity conservation; however, knowledge about the bacterial and fungal structure and function of the karst tiankeng ecosystems is limited. This study investigated the microbial communities in three different tiankeng (nondegraded, moderately degraded, and heavily degraded tiankeng) by Illumina NovaSeq sequencing. We found that the degradation of karst tiankeng can lead to changes in microbial community structure and functions, while there are differences in bacterial and fungal responses. There were significant differences in bacterial and fungal community composition and beta diversity in the three tiankeng soils. Random molecular ecological network analysis results indicated that a more complex and stable bacterial network existed in nondegraded tiankeng, while more complex fungal networks existed in moderately degraded tiankeng. The keystones of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota played essential roles in maintaining soil function and stability. The functional profiles revealed that tiankeng habitat changes may affect microbial survival strategies, such as increasing gene abundance associated with the carbon cycle. To our knowledge, this is the first report on bacterial and fungal communities in different degrees of karst tiankeng, which provides crucial insights into our understanding of the microbial communities' structure and potential function in karst tiankeng ecosystems.

AB  - Suburban habitats in naturally forested areas present a conundrum in the urban-rural habitat network. Typically, these habitats contain less than half of the native woodland bird species that would exist at these sites if they were not developed. They also contain more total bird species than if these sites were left in a natural state. This apparent contradiction raises the question of "How do suburban habitats function in the urban-rural habitat network?" In this study, we analyze bird distributions on three rural-to-urban gradients in different ecoregions of the United States: Oxford, Ohio; Saint Paul, Minnesota; and Palo Alto, California. All three gradients exhibit similar patterns of extinction of native species followed by invasion of common species and subsequent biotic homogenization with urbanization. This patterning suggests that suburban land uses, those represented by the intermediate levels of development on the gradients, are a point of extirpation for woodland birds as well as an entry point for invasive species into urban systems. Furthermore, there are consistent patterns in the functional characteristics of the bird communities that also shift with intensifying urbanization, providing insight on the possible mechanisms of homogenization and community structure in urban ecosystems including an increase in the number of broods per year, a shift in nesting strategies, a decrease in insectivorous individuals, an increase in granivorous individuals, and a decrease in territoriality. Consequently, it appears that there are specific traits that drive the shift in community composition in response to urban and suburban land use. These results have significant implications for improving understanding of the mechanisms of suburban community ecology and conserving birds in urban habitat networks.

AB  - Background. Because of its status as an ecocivilization pilot city, fundamental research on spatial distribution patterns and impact factors of the avian community within the Xiong'an New Area is necessary for future ecological planning and mitigation of negative impacts from future urbanization. Gradient research within small cities can provide important information for the development of urbanization gradient patterns of avian communities.
   Methods. A total of 30 sample points within the urbanization gradient were selected, and avian communities and environmental variables were measured within a 50 m radius sample circle. Principal component regression analysis was used to analyze bird-environment relationships. The Sorensen dissimilarity index was used to calculate the beta-diversity.
   Results. Our results showed that there was a significant urban-rural pattern with a gradient phenomenon in avian communities. Results of this study showed more resident, passenger and insectivore species, and a higher density of breeding insectivore and omnivore individuals appear in the urban fringe than in the other areas. A relatively high value of overall beta-diversity and spatial isolation probably exists among the three disjunct constructed regions. Both species richness and individual abundance were significantly influenced by the species diversity of the trees and foliage height diversity (FHD).
   Discussion. Based on our results and our goal of avian species diversity conservation, we first suggest that urban green spaces be established and ensure a high complexity of vegetation structure as this is critically needed to increase avian species ff-diversity within habitat patches. Second, different habitat types within and around the three constructed areas should be developed based on the important existing bird habitats to increase avian diversity in each city, especially in the areas within Xiongxian and Rongcheng that are well protected, and to elevate the beta-diversity of the total region. Finally, based on the biodiversity hotspots identified by this research, ecological corridors should be carefully planned to improve the stability of regional bird communities.

AB  - Spatially-explicit, individual-based models are increasingly used to evaluate the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on habitat use and population persistence. Yet, they are criticized on the basis that they rely on little empirical data, especially regarding decision rules of moving individuals. Here we report the results of an experiment measuring the gap-crossing decisions of forest birds attracted to a recording of chickadee (Poecile atricapillus) mobbing calls, and provided with options to travel to the speaker by either crossing an open area (short cut) or taking a longer route under forest cover (detour). We performed the experiment in winter and late summer near Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. We recorded 1078 travel paths from 6 resident and 12 migratory species in 249 experimental sites. In both seasons, birds preferred to travel under forest cover rather than cross open areas, even when the forested detour conveyed a substantially longer route than the short cut in the open. Only when the detour under forest cover. This was considerably longer than the short-cut in the open, in both relative and absolute terms, were birds more likely to take short cuts, indicating that gap-crossing decisions are scale dependent. However, birds rarely ventured > 25 m from forest edges despite having the opportunity to do so. Except for Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) which ventured further into the open, all species showed similar gap-crossing decisions. Residents remained marginally closer to forest edges in late summer as compared to in winter. Conspecific group size had no influence on gap-crossing decisions. This experiment supports the hypothesis that forest bird movements are constrained in fragmented landscapes, and provides opportunities to calibrate spatially-explicit, individual-based models addressing the influence of landscape composition and configuration on dispersal.

AB  - Copper (Cu) contamination threatens the stability of soil ecosystems. As important moderators of biochemical processes and soil remediation, the fungal community in contaminated soils has attracted much research interest. In this study, soil fungal diversity and community composition under long-term Cu contamination were investigated based on high-throughput sequencing. The co-occurrence networks were also constructed to display the co-occurrence patterns of the soil fungal community. The results showed that the richness and Chao1 index both significantly increased at 50 mg kg-1 Cu and then significantly decreased at 1600 and 3200 mg kg-1 Cu. Soil fungal diversity was significantly and positively correlated with plant dry weight. Specific tolerant taxa under different Cu contamination gradients were illustrated by linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe). Soil Cu concentration and shoot dry weight were the strongest driving factors influencing fungal composition. The relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increased first and then declined along with elevating Cu concentrations via FUNGuild analysis. The interactions among fungi were enhanced under light and moderate Cu contamination but weakened under heavy Cu contamination by random matrix theory (RMT)-based molecular ecological network analysis. Penicillium, identified as a keystone taxon in Cu-contaminated soils, had the function of removing heavy metals and detoxification, which might be vital to trigger the resistance of the fungal community to Cu contamination. The results may facilitate the identification of Cu pollution indicators and the development of in situ bioremediation technology for contaminated cultivated fields. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The relationships between the distribution patterns of threatened wildlife species and current land-use planning were investigated in a city of Japan to design a sustainable and land-use plan. Spatial distributions of 165 species of threatened wildlife (99 plants and 66 animals) were obtained by surveying most of the Chiba City, located in northeastern part of the Tokyo Bay area. Distribution maps were created within 334 rectangular cells, each measuring 1.1 km x 0.9 km, oriented in the cardinal directions. Four land-use zones, i.e., urbanization promotion, parkland, agricultural and urbanization control, and agricultural promotion zones were identified.
   The distribution of these threatened species was analyzed in terms of green cover and zoning categories. Few threatened wildlife species were found in the urbanization promotion or parkland zone. Most were concentrated in the surrounding arable areas with green covers of more than 50%. Areas other than those set aside for intensive agricultural development in the agricultural promotion development zone contained the greatest number of species. These areas belonged to the agricultural and urbanization control zone, where the traditional agricultural landscape still remains in and around narrow valleys called "yatsu".
   The results suggest that the regional biodiversity depends heavily on areas in which the traditional landscape remains relatively intact. Based on these results, a series of recommendations, including conservation and restoration of habitats, establishments of wildlife networks and corridors, and citizen involvement in conservation, were presented to the city studied. The data and recommendations will hopefully help the city, as well as many other areas faced with similar issues, devise future land-use plans that combine sustainable development with conservation of biodiversity and maintenance of high quality living environments.

AB  - Farmland abandonment often leads to an increase in vegetation cover in formerly cleared landscapes. In regions where forests and woodlands were cleared for agriculture, regrowth could be an effective way to increase species diversity by re-constructing a variegated landscape. Our study investigated the conservation outcomes for birds across a regenerating agricultural landscape. We compared bird composition across a range of land use and gradient of vegetation cover from cleared pasture, through regrowth sites of varying structure, to remnant forests. Bird community composition differed significantly among vegetation classes, with regrowth providing habitat for a complementary group of high conservation value species, rather than simply providing extra habitat for species that were otherwise well represented in the region. Variations in bird community composition were best explained by site variables that contributed to vegetation structure and internal patch variation. Regrowth had a higher diversity of cover than forest or pasture, and this created habitat for many woodland bird species. Regrowth vegetation may be slower to proceed, but it has the potential to complement active revegetation activities in adjacent production areas and enhance connectivity between remnant forest patches. While the benefits of regrowth are context specific, where regrowth improves landscape heterogeneity, there is great potential for conservation gains for birds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In recent decades, the biodiversity of freshwater environments has decreased sharply due to anthropogenic disturbances that damaged ecosystem structures and functions. Habitat restoration has emerged as an important method to mitigate the degradation of river ecosystems. Although in many cases a post-project monitoring has been promoted to access the restoration progress, it is still unclear how aquatic community changes following river habitat restoration in China. Macroinvertebrate communities intermediately positioned within ecosystem food webs play a key role in ecosystem processes within river ecosystem, driving energy flow and nutrient cycling. Here, benthic macroinvertebrates are used as bio-indicators to assess the ecosystem health of degraded urban rivers, restored urban rivers, and undisturbed rivers. This study aims to determine (i) how habitat restoration influences macroinvertebrates diversity and how this compared to degraded and reference conditions; (ii) how did macroinvertebrate community compositions differ in restored, degraded, and reference sites; and (iii) the environmental factors shaping macroinvertebrate communities. Habitat restoration significantly increased the diversity and richness of macroinvertebrate community and intolerant species and shifted the community composition towards reference status. Habitat characteristics and water chemistry, including substrate diversity, water velocity, and both nutrients (TN) and organic pollutants (TOC), appeared to shape the turnover of these communities. Habitat characteristics contributed to most of the variation of the entire macroinvertebrate community. Our research indicates that habitat restoration is an efficient approach to restore the aquatic community and hence improve river ecosystem health for freshwater conservation and sustainable management in Zhejiang province. This study strengthens our understanding of the changes of macroinvertebrate community after habitat restoration and important controlling variables that attribute to these changes, which provides an important guidance for future freshwater management.

AB  - Amidst global shifts in the distribution and abundance of wildlife and livestock, we have only a rudimentary understanding of ungulate parasite communities and parasite-sharing patterns. We used qPCR and DNA metabarcoding of fecal samples to characterize gastrointestinal nematode (Strongylida) community composition and sharing among 17 sympatric species of wild and domestic large mammalian herbivore in central Kenya. We tested a suite of hypothesis-driven predictions about the role of host traits and phylogenetic relatedness in describing parasite infections. Host species identity explained 27-53% of individual variation in parasite prevalence, richness, community composition and phylogenetic diversity. Host and parasite phylogenies were congruent, host gut morphology predicted parasite community composition and prevalence, and hosts with low evolutionary distinctiveness were centrally positioned in the parasite-sharing network. We found no evidence that host body size, social-group size or feeding height were correlated with parasite composition. Our results highlight the interwoven evolutionary and ecological histories of large herbivores and their gastrointestinal nematodes and suggest that host identity, phylogeny and gut architecture-a phylogenetically conserved trait related to parasite habitat-are the overriding influences on parasite communities. These findings have implications for wildlife management and conservation as wild herbivores are increasingly replaced by livestock.

AB  - 1. Urban environments are fragmented habitats characterised by the presence of physical barriers, which may negatively affect dispersal and colonisation by insect herbivores and their natural enemies. Conversely, plants growing along pavements may function as dispersal corridors, helping to moderate the harmful effects of resource patch isolation on organism movement and population persistence.
   2. We experimentally tested the effects of walls as physical barriers to the dispersal of the leaf miner Liriomyza commelinae Frost and colonisation of its host plant, Commelina erecta L., in urban habitats. We also evaluated whether plants along pavements could act as corridors for this species.
   3. We exposed experimental host plants to the leaf miner in houses with front gardens and back yards, the latter being completely surrounded by walls. The front gardens had walls but none separating them from the pavement. Previously mined plants were also exposed to parasitoids in the yards to determine parasitoid attack.
   4. Liriomyza commelinae took longer to colonise back yards with higher walls, and the abundance of mined plants along pavements reduced the colonisation time. Leafminer abundance was marginally affected by the yard type, and was lower in back yards. Cumulative parasitism rates decreased with increasing distance at which mined plants were placed from pavements.
   5. Constructions act as physical barriers, having a negative impact on colonisation of host plants by leaf miners. The function of pavements as corridors seems to depend on the abundance of mined plants. Parasitism may be affected by distance from the corridor rather than physical barriers or other potential hosts.

AB  - In recent years, Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) has gained broad political support and has evolved to become a new research topic in the area of sustainable urban development. The focus has been largely on green urban structures, such as parks and urban forest. The role and contribution of farmland has often been neglected. This work wants to scrutinise the potential of farmland's contribution to the basic conception of UGI, in particular, with regard to connectivity. It reports on three case studies from Southern Germany, in the peri-urban regions of the three largest and expanding cities of Bavaria: Munich, Nuremberg and Augsburg. The spatial analysis we used is transparent, simple and repeatable. It is transferable to any European urban area. We use habitat suitability modelling to map the potential spatial distribution of low-intensity farmland, with emphasis on grassland systems. Based on these potential distributions, landscape indicators are used to analyse structural connectivity. Structural connectivity is used as a surrogate for functional connectivity, which supports ecological and abiotic processes and functions, but on the other hand characterises functional social connectivity, with respect to the accessibility of recreation. The results of this study suggest that farmland bears a great potential to contribute to UGI. The immediate surroundings of the cities do not just offer spatial potential but can enhance connectivity significantly. Based on these results some recommendations have been formulated to enable a better appreciation of farmland and farmers as partners for effectively developing strategies for UGI planning and sustainable urban development.

AB  - The negative impact of urbanization on biodiversity can be buffered by blue (e.g., rivers, ponds) and green (e.g., parks, forests) spaces. However, to prevent biodiversity loss and reduce the risk of local extinctions, blue and green spaces need to be connected by corridors, so that organisms may disperse between sites. Landscape connectivity affects local community composition and metacommunity dynamics by facilitating dispersal. The goal of this study was to test the relative roles of pond environmental properties, spatial structure, and functional landscape connectivity on differentiation of invertebrate metacommunities in urban ponds in the city of Stockholm, Sweden. We characterized functional connectivity as blue connectivity (distance to water bodies), green connectivity (land use), and combined blue-green connectivity. We estimated functional connectivity by using electrical circuit theory to identify dispersal corridors. Interestingly, while circuit theory is often used in single-taxon studies, this method has rarely been applied to multiple taxa forming a metacommunity, as we have done in this study. Indeed, our study contributes toward an increased focus on the role of dispersal at the metacommunity level. We deter-mined that functional connectivity was the most important factor in explaining community differentiation, with the local environment contributing comparatively little, and spatial structure the least. Combined blue-green functional connectivity had a major influence on structuring urban pond communities, explaining 7.8% of the variance in community composition across ponds. Furthermore, we found that increased functional connectivity was associated with an increase in the number of species. In summary, our results suggest that to preserve biodiversity in urban ponds, it is important to enhance functional connectivity, and that open green spaces could augment blue corridors in maintaining functional connectivity in urban pond metacommunities. To generalize these findings, future urban biodiversity studies should compare how functional connectivity affects meta-communities across multiple major cities. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Green roofs offer numerous environmental benefits, and thus their implementation is considered an initiative to create sustainable cities. However, the characteristics of green roofs that could enhance arthropod biodiversity and ecological functioning are poorly known, especially for South American countries. Here, we analyzed the influence of several characteristics of green roofs (plant species richness, vegetation cover of the roof, age, substrate depth, area, and isolation in terms of height and green cover in the landscape scale) on the abundance, richness (total and by functional feeding groups), and community composition of arthropods. To do that, we selected 30 green roofs located in different urbanization contexts, from small towns in semi-rural areas to Cordoba, the second-largest city of Argentina. Our results indicated a high diversity of arthropods, registering a total of 12,942 individuals corresponding to 505 species from 14 orders, being herbivores and parasitoids the dominant groups. The area of the green roofs was positively linked to total species richness, species richness of most functional feeding groups, and total abundance of arthropods. The community composition of arthropods on green roofs was also affected by their area, and by the green cover in the landscape. Moreover, green roofs with higher plant richness, mainly spontaneous, and less isolated (both vertically and horizontally) favored entomophagous arthropods. Other variables, such as age and vegetation cover of the green roofs, were also important for herbivores, predators, parasitoids and detritivores. Our study clearly demonstrates that green roof size is not all that matters for supporting arthropod biodiversity because promoting high plant diversity, allowing spontaneous ecosystem dynamics, and diminishing roof isolation foster entomophagous arthropod diversity. Our study is the first that considers multiple factors of roofs in South America and provides key knowledge for stakeholders interested in the development and management of this green infrastructure in semi-rural and urban landscapes.

AB  - In spite of widely documented studies of deforestation rates and land use/cover changes in tropical dry forests in Mexico, relatively little is known about fragmentation patterns in such forests. This study defines the spatial distribution of landforms and land use/cover types the lower Papagayo River basin and examines their influence on fragmentation patterns and biological diversity in a tropical dry forest in that southern Pacific region. The land use/cover map was constructed from aerial photographs, Landsat TM imagery (2000) and fieldwork. Landform units were defined based on altitude, slope, lithology and morphology. Landscape fragmentation parameters were obtained using FRAGSTATS (version 3.3) considering the numbers of patches, mean, minimum and maximum patch size, edge density, total edge and connectivity. Results show tropical dry forest to be remnant vegetation (similar to 11 per cent), characterized by isolation and low connectivity. Land use/cover types have different effects on fragmentation patterns. Agriculture and cattle raising produce similar numbers of patches, but with a different mean size; and human settlements have a scattered distribution pattern. The abandonment of rural agricultural livelihoods has favoured the expansion of secondary tropical dry forest characterized by continuity and high connectivity, which suggests a high regeneration potential from land abandonment. It can be concluded that tropical dry forest fragmentation and recovery at regional scales depend on such landscape attributes as lithology, slope, geomorphology and management.

AB  - This paper presents a method based on a geographical information system (GIS) to model ecological networks in a fragmented landscape. The ecological networks are generated with the help of a landscape model (which integrate human activities) and with a wildlife dispersal model. The main results are maps which permit the analysis and the understanding of the impact of human activities on wildlife dispersal. Three applications in a study area are presented: ecological networks at the landscape scale, conflicting areas at the farmstead scale and ecological distance between biotopes. These applications show the flexibility of the model and its potential to give information on ecological networks at different planning scales. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Globally, montane tropical diversity is characterized by extraordinary local endemism that is not readily explained by current environmental variables indicating a strong imprint of history. Montane species often exist as isolated populations under current climatic conditions and may have remained isolated throughout recent climatic cycles, leading to substantial genetic and phenotypic divergence. Alternatively, populations may have become contiguous during colder climates resulting in less divergence. Here we compare responses to historical climate fluctuation in a montane specialist skink, Lampropholis robertsi, and its more broadly distributed congener, L. coggeri, both endemic to rainforests of northeast Australia. To do so, we combine spatial modelling of potential distributions under representative palaeoclimates, multi-locus phylogeography and analyses of phenotypic variation. Spatial modelling of L. robertsi predicts strong isolation among disjunct montane refugia during warm climates, but with potential for localized exchange during the most recent glacial period. In contrast, predicted stable areas are more widespread and connected in L. coggeri. Both species exhibit pronounced phylogeographic structuring for mitochondrial and nuclear genes, attesting to low dispersal and high persistence across multiple isolated regions. This is most prominent in L. robertsi, for which coalescent analyses indicate that most populations persisted in isolation throughout the climate cycles of the Pleistocene. Morphological divergence, principally in body size, is more evident among isolated populations of L. robertsi than L. coggeri. These results highlight the biodiversity value of isolated montane populations and support the general hypothesis that tropical montane regions harbour high levels of narrow-range taxa because of their resilience to past climate change.

AB  - Damage to homesteads by brown bears (Ursus arctos) has become commonplace in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Science-based solutions for preventing damages can contribute to the establishment of mechanisms that promote human-bear coexistence. We examined the spatial distribution patterns of house break-ins by Tibetan brown bears (U. a. pruinosus) in Zhiduo County of the Sanjiangyuan region in China. Occurrence points of bear damage were collected from field surveys completed from 2017 to 2019. The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model was then used to assess house break-in risk. Circuit theory modeling was used to simulate risk diffusion paths based on the risk map generated from our MaxEnt model. The results showed that (a) the total risk area of house break-ins caused by brown bears was 11,577.91 km(2), accounting for 29.85% of Zhiduo County, with most of the risk areas were distributed in Sanjiangyuan National Park, accounting for 58.31% of the total risk area; (b) regions of alpine meadow located in Sanjiangyuan National Park with a high human population density were associated with higher risk; (c) risk diffusion paths extended southeast to northwest, connecting the inside of Sanjiangyuan National Park to its outside border; and (d) eastern Suojia, southern Zhahe, eastern Duocai, and southern Jiajiboluo had more risk diffusion paths than other areas examined, indicating higher risk for brown bear break-ins in these areas. Risk diffusion paths will need strong conservation management to facilitate migration and gene flow of brown bears and to alleviate bear damage, and implementation of compensation schemes may be necessary in risk areas to offset financial burdens. Our analytical methods can be applied to conflict reduction efforts and wildlife conservation planning across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

AB  - BackgroundUrban forests are under increased pressure from invasion by exotic (alien) species. The vegetation present in the matrix of urban sites is a rich source of alien invasive propagules, which increases the risk of alien invasion in forests within an urban space, leading to a decline in indigenous species. Therefore, determining the distribution patterns of native and exotic species as influenced by environmental factors can assist in quantifying the impact of exotic species at broad scales based on responses on a finer scale. Quantifying the effects of multiple environmental factors on the distribution patterns of both indigenous and alien species in the ecosystem may help in prescribing suitable management efforts.MethodsFifteen forest patches were sampled in the eThekwini (Durban) Municipality and data collected from 74 100-m(2) plots with different degrees of invasion. Indigenous and alien species of trees, shrubs and climbers occurring in ten and more plots were considered for analysis and the CANOCO 5.1 package was used to run various constrained ordination analyses. Variation partitioning analysis was used to assess the impact of environmental variables at different spatial scales, namely the plot and patch scales.ResultsCanopy gaps are the major controlling factor for invasive alien plants (IAPs) occurrence at fine scale. At patch level, residential and industry areas outside the boundaries (buffer area) of forest patches have a high influence on the distribution of IAPs. Communities dominated by the invasive Chromolaena odorata (L.) R.M. King are most common on the lowland coastal forests while communities dominated by either Litsea glutinosa (Lour.) C.B.Rob. or Cardiospermum grandiflorum Sw. can prevail in both lowland coastal and scarp forests.ConclusionsCanopy gaps in lowland forests can facilitate the transition of native forests to novel communities containing a variety of alien plant species. Communities of shrub, climber and tree IAPs occur in lowland coastal forests while climber and tree IAPs dominate the high-elevation scarp forests. The resilience shown by some native species to the tree, shrub and climber IAPs by remaining when IAPs establish makes these species very suitable for restoration projects. Forest patches surrounded by a high incidence of residential and industrial areas in the buffer matrix are likely to have a high diversity of IAPs. Larger patch size and high connectivity to nearby native forests are key in reducing invasion by IAPs.

AB  - The spatial distribution of exotics across riparian landscapes is not uniform, and research elaborating the environmental constraints and dispersal behavior that underlie these patterns of distribution is warranted. This study examined the spatial distribution, growth patterns, and habitat constraints of populations of the invasive Dioscorea oppositifolia in a forested stream corridor of a tributary of Drury Creek in Giant City State Park, IL. The distribution of D. oppositifolia was determined at the watershed scale mainly by floodplain structure and connectivity. Populations of D. oppositifolia were confined to the floodplain, with overbank flooding from the stream. Dioscorea oppositifolia probably originates in disturbed areas upstream of natural corridors, and subsequently, the species disperses downstream into pristine canyons or ravines via bulbils dispersing in the water. In Giant City State Park, populations of D. oppositifolia were distributed on the floodplain across broad gradients of soil texture, light, slope, and potential radiation. The study also examined the longevity of bulbils in various micro-environments to illuminate strategies for the management of the species in invaded watersheds. After 1 year, the highest percentages of bulbils were viable under leaves, and much lower percentages were viable over leaves, in soil, and in the creek (76.0 +/- 6.8, 21.2 +/- 9.6, 21.6 +/- 3.6, and 5.2 +/- 5.2%), respectively. This study suggests that management procedures that reduce leaf litter on the forest floor (e.g., prescribed burning) could reduce the number of bulbils of D. oppositifolia stored in the watershed.

AB  - Population persistence often depends on functional connectivity for animals that transit multiple vegetation types to acquire resources, particularly for dispersers navigating a landscape matrix fragmented by agriculture, forestry, or urbanization. For many pool-breeding amphibians, population viability depends on the ability of juveniles to locate and reach suitable habitat in the terrestrial matrix. Thus, identifying the scale and orientation of movements is necessary to predict the consequences of landscape configuration for populations. We conducted three experiments to evaluate if different vegetation types alter the behavior of post-metamorphic wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus). We measured the: (1) fine-scale movement (velocity, latency, path length, net displacement, path tortuosity, and orientation) of individuals (n = 150) released on five substrates (asphalt, corn, forest leaf litter, hay, lawn); (2) directionality of frogs (n = 168) released at different distances from forest in two open-cover types (lawns, hayfields); and (3) willingness of frogs (n = 240) to enter three land-cover types (asphalt, lawn, forest) when released within artificial refugia islands at different distances from forest. Using fluorescent powder, we mapped 318 movement paths and performance differed. Frogs demonstrated straighter paths, and greater net movements, path lengths, and velocities through treatments with lower structural complexity (asphalt > lawn > corn > forest leaf litter > hay). Frogs also exhibited forest-oriented directionality in asphalt, lawn, and corn but random orientation in forest control and hay. The willingness of individuals to leave a refugia island was lowest on asphalt (12% of released frogs), moderate on lawn (40%), and very high in forest (90%). Overall, results indicate that the quality of nonforest matrix may influence the ability of frogs to traverse open cover and orient toward forest from distances of >= 40-55 m. Thus, it is inaccurate to assume movement performance is uniform across all open-matrix types, an important distinction because many landscape-population models use expert-based values that are a one-size-fits-all measure for open cover. Our study provides field-based, mechanistic approximations of juvenile movement that can be useful for predicting how matrix composition and configuration might be managed to maintain or restore functional connectivity.

AB  - On-road vehicles have become a pervasive source of low frequency noise in both urban environments and natural protected areas. Because many species rely on low-frequency signals to communicate with conspecifics, they are likely to be especially vulnerable to signal masking and the concomitant biological effects associated with exposure to traffic noise. Here, we show that the spectral characteristics of traffic noise overlap extensively with footdrumming signals of the endangered Stephens' kangaroo rat (Dipodomys stephensi; SKR). Playbacks of footdrumming overlaid with experimental and control background noises indicate that traffic noise masks and may mimic footdrumming signals. SKR showed no response to footdrumming playbacks overlaid with traffic noise. Yet, traffic noise itself may mimic footdrumming and prompt a false response in SKR - playbacks of traffic noise alone and footdrumming overlaid with control sounds elicited similar behavioral responses. These results provide the first evidence that anthropogenic noise may function as a deceptive signal to wildlife, causing animals to engage in false responses that may be energetically and biologically costly. More broadly, these results indicate that anthropogenic noise can have multiple, concurrent effects. For SKR, the combined effects of communication disruption and signal deception may further tax already endangered populations. Roads and road margins on and off reserves serve as dispersal corridors and refugia for SKR and other semifossorial taxa: these areas may therefore function as ecological traps if anthropogenic roadway noise negatively affects population persistence.

AB  - The influence of urban structures and land use patterns of metropolitan cities on the distribution of contaminants is not well understood. In this study, two metropolitan cities [Jeddah (a typical corridor city) and Madinah (a typical compact city)], featuring different spreading patterns and urban structures, were selected to investigate the contamination level and potential risk caused by metals (i.e., Pb, Zn, Co, Fe, Al, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Mn) associated with urban dust. The findings of this study show that a metropolitan city with a limited variety of activities and a polar center (e.g., Madinah) displays a typical distribution pattern of metals, i.e., concentrations of metals increase gradually toward the center of the city. In contrast, a metropolitan city with multiple major activities (e.g., Jeddah) displays a different distribution pattern, controlled by multiple key actors (e.g., seaports, oil refineries, and desalination/power plants) able to shift the location of highest contamination away from the city center. The above findings are supported by the results of several contamination and health indices. In Jeddah, the highest Pb contamination was found near an oil refinery based on geoaccumulation index (Igeo), contamination factor (CF), enrichment factor (EF), and ecological risk (Ei) values; whereas, the highest Zn contamination was found near a seaport, based on EF, CF, and Ei values. However, in Madinah, the contamination indices indicate that the most contaminated locations are near the city center. The highest non-carcinogenic health risk in Jeddah was found near an oil refinery and in the city center; whereas in Madinah, it was found mainly in the city center. Although there is no significant risk of cancer due to metals associated with dust in the two cities, Cr, representing a health risk contribution of >24%, was the major contributor of non-carcinogenic health risk in the two metropolitan cities.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has led to increasingly fragmented urban habitat patches, and the biodiversity within these patches and in their surrounding areas is severely threatened. This ecological problem is spreading from cities to counties dominated by villages and towns, and is especially prevalent in economically developed areas. Constructing a reasonable ecological network is an effective way to balance the contradiction between regional development and ecological protection. Taking Anji County of the Zhejiang Province, China as an example, this study first identified ecological sources based on morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and connectivity analysis, and then extracted and constructed ecological networks by using a minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model and network analysis. Finally, the results were optimized by adding additional ecological sources and setting stepping stones. The priority of the corridor is determined by the gravity model, and the analysis of the ecological networks in this study drills down to the town scale. The results show that the initially constructed ecological network includes 10 ecological sources and 22 ecological corridors, of which six are important ecological corridors that need priority construction. However, the ecological networks were less distributed in the central and northern regions, so four supplementary ecological sources and two stepping stones were added to optimize the ecological network. The connectivity of the optimized ecological network improved, and the values of alpha (the closure), beta (line-point rate) and gamma (network connectivity) increased by 4.6%, 10.45% and 2.18%, respectively. In addition, there were obvious differences in the area and land use types of ecological networks among towns, so it is necessary to formulate targeted construction strategies. Through an in-depth analysis from county to town, this study makes the construction and management of ecological networks more operable for country administration, and provides reference for the balance of ecological protection and regional development at the county level.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation does predominantly focus on protected natural areas, but has to consider also the usually Human-dominated matrix in which these natural areas are embedded. Here we study highway stormwater retention ponds, which may act as refuges for native flora and fauna and contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity in Human-dominated landscapes. However, the biodiversity supported by such artificial ponds has received little attention so far. Using standardised methods, we addressed the potential role of highway stormwater ponds as refuges by comparing aquatic macroinvertebrate communities (Coleoptera, Heteroptera, Odonata and Gastropoda) in highway stormwater ponds with ponds in the wider landscape. As expected from their pollutant retention function, highway ponds differed in abiotic conditions from surrounding ponds. However, they supported aquatic macroinvertebrate communities at least as rich and diverse at the family level as surrounding ponds and exhibited similar variability in family community composition and structure. The main difference we observed was a higher abundance of small and/or short-lived invertebrates in the highway ponds. These similar community compositions and structures suggest that highway ponds contribute to the biodiversity of the pond network at a regional scale. Thus, road practitioners should consider highway ponds not only for their hydrological and pollutant retaining purposes but also as a possibility to increase the role of highway verges as a refuge and, consequently, landscape connectivity. The management of these water bodies should recognise their potential for biodiversity especially in Human-dominated landscapes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is an important role player in the savannah ecosystem. It has become a species of relevance because of its role as a wildlife maintenance host for an array of infectious and zoonotic diseases some of which include corridor disease, foot- and- mouth disease and bovine tuberculosis. To date, no complete genome sequence for S. caffer had been available for study and the genomes of other species such as the domestic cow (Bos taurus) had been used as a proxy for any genetics analysis conducted on this species. Here, the high coverage genome sequence of the African buffalo (S. caffer) is presented.
   Results: A total of 19,765 genes were predicted and 19,296 genes could be successfully annotated to S. caffer while 469 genes remained unannotated. Moreover, in order to extend a detailed annotation of S. caffer, gene clusters were constructed using twelve additional mammalian genomes. The S. caffer genome contains 10,988 gene clusters, of which 62 are shared exclusively between B. taurus and S. caffer.
   Conclusions: This study provides a unique genomic perspective for the S. caffer, allowing for the identification of novel variants that may play a role in the natural history and physiological adaptations.

AB  - AimDisturbance and connectivity shape the structure and spatial distribution of animal populations in all ecosystems, but the combined effects of these factors are rarely measured in coastal seascapes. We used surf zones of exposed sandy beaches in eastern Australia as a model seascape to test for combined effects of coastal urbanization and seascape connectivity (i.e. spatial links between surf zones, estuaries and rocky headlands) on fish assemblages.
   LocationFour hundred kilometres of exposed surf beaches along the eastern coastline of Australia.
   MethodsFish assemblages were surveyed from surf zones of 14 ocean-exposed sandy beaches using purpose-built surf baited remote underwater video stations.
   ResultsThe degree of coastal urbanization and connectivity were strongly correlated with the spatial distribution of fish species richness and abundance and were of greater importance to surf fishes than local surf conditions. Urbanization was associated with reductions in the abundance of harvested piscivores and fish species richness. Piscivore abundance and species richness were lowest on highly urbanized coastlines, and adjacent to beaches in wilderness areas where recreational fishing is intense. By contrast, seascape connectivity was correlated with the spatial distribution of omnivore and planktivore abundance. Spatial linkages between surf zones and estuaries were also important to two globally threatened guitarfish that are of international conservation significance.
   Main conclusionsWe show for the first time how vulnerable and iconic fish species in surf zones are affected by the presence of coastal cities and the attributes of seascapes in which these cities are embedded. It is possible that greater connectivity may lessen urbanization' impacts for species with broad diets and strong ecological links to other ecosystems - this offers new perspectives in coastal conservation, for fishes and beyond.

AB  - Biogeography has traditionally focused on the distribution of species, while community ecology has sought to explain the patterns of community composition. Species interactions networks have rarely been subjected to such analyses, as modeling tools have only recently been developed for interaction networks. Here, we examine beta diversity of ecological networks using pollination networks sampled along an urbanization and agricultural intensification gradient in east Leinster, Ireland. We show, for the first time, that anthropogenic gradients structure interaction networks, and exert greater structuring force than geographical proximity. We further showed that species turnover, especially of plants, is the major driver of interaction turnover, and that this contribution increased with anthropogenic induced environmental dissimilarity, but not spatial distance. Finally, to explore the extent to which it is possible to predict each of the components of interaction turnover, we compared the predictive performance of models that included site characteristics and interaction properties to models that contained species level effects. We show that if we are to accurately predict interaction turnover, data are required on the species-specific responses to environmental gradients. This study highlights the importance of anthropogenic disturbances when considering the biogeography of interaction networks, especially in human dominated landscapes where geographical effects can be secondary sources of variation. Yet, to build a predictive science of the biogeography of interaction networks, further species-specific responses need to be incorporated into interaction distribution modeling approaches.

AB  - Context Ecological networks are systems of interconnected components that support biodiversity, ecological processes and ecosystem services. Such structures play a crucial role for nature conservation and people well-being in anthropogenic landscapes. Assessing connectivity by using efficient models and metrics is a sine qua non condition to preserve and improve appropriately these ecological networks.
   Objectives This study aims to present a novel methodological approach to assess and model connectivity for species conservation (Bufo calamita; the natterjack toad) and human recreation in the city.
   Methods The study used a combination least cost and circuit models to identify priority corridors in the City of Liege, Belgium. Green areas, habitats and relevant movement parameters were derived based on existing studies around (i) the occurrence, ecology and biology of the natterjack toad and (ii) human behavioural studies on urban pedestrians. Combining the two models allowed the assessment of connectivity for both species via two different metrics visualised using priority corridors on maps.
   Results The connectivity assessments identified lack of connectivity as the potential route to extinction of natterjack toads at one of the source sites.
   Conclusions This study provides examples of how combining least cost and circuit models can contribute to the improvement of urban ecological networks and demonstrates the usefulness of such models for nature conservation and urban planning.

AB  - A spatial distribution model has been developed to predict the pattern of stormwater catchment facilities in developing urban areas. The model has been validated through comparison of predicted results with historical data in Guelph, Canada, using nearest neighbour analysis. The validated model has been applied to developing urban-rural fringe lands in Guelph to illustrate land use patterns likely to occur under different scenarios, Simulations of various scenarios for incorporating stormwater catchment facilities into greenways have been tested with the model and the resultant land use patterns compared with the status quo, through measures of landscape ecological integrity such as connectivity and porosity. The model was applied to an area on the edge of Guelph scheduled for development. The predicted land use patterns of various planning scenarios were generated and analysed. The results demonstrated that landscape integrity could be increased, urban wildlife habitat enhanced, and opportunities for residential non-consumptive wildlife recreation improved through integration of the evolving 'blue-green' open space provided by urban stormwater management facilities into existing greenways.

AB  - It is widely documented that elevated ground-level ozone (O-3) has negative effects on tree physiological characteristics, and in return, affects forest ecosystem function. However, the effect may be modified by soil nitrogen (N) availability. Numerous studies have focused on the aboveground part of trees under elevated O-3 alone or in combination with soil N; however, little is known about the response of soil bacterial communities. Here, we investigated the effects of O-3 (charcoal-filtered air, CF, versus ambient air +40 ppb of O-3, E-O3), N addition (0 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), N0, versus 200 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), N200), and their combination on rhizosphere soil bacterial communities of hybrid poplar, using an MiSeq targeted amplicon sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. E-O3 significantly decreased bacterial abundance, and N200 significantly decreased the alpha-diversity. The negative impacts of N200 on alpha-diversity were alleviated by E-O3. Nitrogen and E-O3-N200 combination altered bacterial community composition, with a significant increase in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes and a decrease in the abundance of Firmicutes. From an ecological network analysis, E-O3, alone and in combination with N200, complicated the co-occurrence network of bacterial communities by inducing a microbial survival strategy, shifting the hub species from RB41 to Bacillus and Blastococcus. Conversely, N200 led to simplification and decentralization of the co-occurrence network. These findings demonstrate that the rhizosphere bacterial communities exhibit divergent responses to E-O3 and N200, suggesting the need to consider the stability of the belowground ecosystem to optimize plantation management in response to environmental changes.

AB  - Urban-rural landscape planning research is nowadays focusing on strategies and tools that support practitioners to design local areas where human and natural pressures interfere. A prominent framework is provided by ecological network studies, whose design regards the combination of a set of green areas and patches (nodes) interconnected through environmental corridors (edges). Ecological networks are key for biodiversity protection and enhancement, as they are able to counteract fragmentation, and to create and strengthen relations and exchanges among otherwise isolated elements. Biodiversity evolution, indeed, depends on the quantity and quality of spatial cohesion of natural areas. In this paper, we propose a methodological framework based on network modelling for the study and modelling of ecological networks. We use network properties and centrality measures (degree, clustering coefficient, and betweenness centrality) and take into account the intensity of the dispersal capacity by introducing the corresponding weighted centrality measures. We simulate the dynamics of ecological networks by monitoring the residual dispersal capacity and the number of connected components from three perspectives: random attacks, deterministic attacks according to decreasing betweenness centrality and influence of master plans. We demonstrate that spatial network analysis is useful to monitor the performance of ecological networks and support decision-making, management, and planning.
   The proposed methodology is applied to the case study of the pen-urban and urban areas of the town of Nuoro (Italy). Patches (nodes) have been selected among the ecosystems with target vegetal species Holm oak and cultivated and wild Olive while the connecting corridors (links) enable for seed dispersal.

AB  - Obtaining the characteristics of an urban ecological network structure and connectivity plays an important guiding role in the concrete implementation of ecological construction in a space. Resistance assignment is a key step in ecological network construction. However, most research ignores the diversity of land use in an urbanization environment and the difference between ecological space centres and boundaries. Taking Minhang District of Shanghai as an example, this paper puts forward an optimal evaluation method for an urban ecological network. By combining the morphological spatial pattern analysis method and graph theory, the resistance value of different urban land uses was evaluated, and the ecological network was constructed by comprehensively considering the land use types, land area, forms, and positions. The connectivity and the importance of individual nodes at four different thresholds were quantified. The results revealed that the core and the edge areas of the morphological spatial pattern analysis occupied the highest amount of space, 33.34 % and 21.92 %, respectively. In addition, there were relatively few large and high-quality ecological spaces, and the green space was seriously fragmented in the study area. The degree of structural connectivity was related not only to the area proportion of the ecological space but also to the area of connected patches. The contribution value of each node to the overall network connectivity was affected by the mobility of the species, the node area, the spatial location, and the surrounding matrix environment. This study provided a framework designed to optimize the evaluation method of an urban ecological network. The influence of the type and structure of urban land use on the resistance value was analysed in a more detailed way, and the results of the connectivity and the important nodes were obtained more accurately.

AB  - Vegetation plays a key role in not only improving urban environments, but also conserving ecosystems. The spatial distribution of vegetation can be expected to make green corridors for landscape management, wind paths against heat island phenomena, etc. It is required to investigate the spatial distribution of vegetation on a regional scale because there should be green corridors and wind paths in the areas between urban areas and suburbs. We have developed a spatial analysis method of vegetation distributions using remotely sensed data on a regional scale. The method consists of a spatial autocorrelation analysis, an overlay analysis, and a hydrological analysis with the NDVI adopted as the potential of the vegetation abundance. Application of the method leads to the extraction of the lines between the core areas and sparse areas of vegetation. The purpose of this study was to analyze the vegetation distributions in urbanized areas. We applied our method to the urbanization areas and analyzed the features of vegetation distributions regarding spatial continuity through the verification of its applicability. We used a vegetation map digitized from aerial photographs as the reference. The map contained three vegetation types of land cover: grasslands, agricultural fields, and tree-covered areas.

AB  - Ensuring the transport of colder air masses from rural surroundings or inner urban open spaces into the dense urban center is a vital approach for reducing nocturnal warming of urban areas in summer, i.e. the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Hence, cold-air paths are an important mitigation aspect in urban planning. The identification of cold-air paths by field measurements, however, is time-consuming and it is difficult to cover larger spatial domains (e.g. entire cities). Therefore, we used a machine learning technique, boosted regression trees (BRT), for estimating the spatial distribution of cold-air paths in three German cities (Braunschweig, Freiburg, Stuttgart). We identified the most important predictor variables for cold-air path occurrence and tested the spatial transferability of BRT models from one training city to the other study cities.
   Three variables explaining differences in surface elevation indicated strongest influence on spatial distribution of cold-air paths: relative surface elevation, topographic position index, and topographic wind index. We achieved predictions for the spatial distribution of cold-air paths for cities the model was trained on, resulting in model performances of 0.85 < AUC < 0.96 (AUC: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve). Model transfers to other cities, however, achieved only poor to moderate results (0.5 < AUC < 0.8). The city of Freiburg tended to be the most suitable basis for a general model, since it covers the largest range of conditions. Transfer works best for 'similar' cities, i.e. cities with a comparable range of predictor variables and morphological structure. Cold-air path identification via BRT modelling appeared to be a promising method delivering helpful information for urban planning.

AB  - Urban-rural landscape planning research is nowadays focusing on strategies and tools that support practitioners in designing integrated spaces starting from the analysis of local areas, where human and natural pressures interfere. A prominent framework is provided by the ecological networks, whose design regards the combination of a set of green areas or patches (the nodes) interconnected through environmental corridors (the edges). Ecological networks are useful for biodiversity protection and enhancement, as they are able to counteract fragmentation, and to create or strengthen relations and exchanges among otherwise isolated elements. Biodiversity evolution, indeed, depends on the quantity and quality of spatial cohesion of natural areas. In this paper, we aim at designing an ecological network for the periurban area on the town of Nuoro in central Sardinia. The narrative unfolds in two parts. Part A is presented in this paper and includes its methodological premises, i.e. biodiversity conservation and ecological network analysis and design, and the introductory elements of a spatial analysis on a pilot ecological network of one hundred patches. We locate patches by focusing on the ecosystems supported by the target vegetal species holm oak (Quercus ilex) and cultivated or wild olive (Olea europaea var. sativa, O.europaea var. sylverstis). These are very common plants species in the municipality and some animal species are active as seed dispersal. The reminder, i.e. Part B, of the essay is presented in an homonymous paper that focuses on the illustration of the network analysis conceived as a monitoring system and, in future perspective, as a planning support system.

AB  - The optimization of park green space landscape pattern is of great significance to the construction of an ecological civilized city. Through a case study of the national garden city - Mianyang City, Sichuan Province - and with the help of analysis softwares such as ENVI and ArcMap, the public green space landscape pattern in the central urban area has been quantitatively analyzed in terms of Normalized Vegetation Difference Index (NVDI) and landscape pattern index, and corresponding optimization strategies have been proposed. It is found out that: 1. NVDI in Fucheng District presents a growing trend from the perspective of spatial distribution characteristics, although the balance of NVDI increased significantly. 2. Urban park green space is highly fragmented under city scale, and the park green space landscape is featured by small patches and medium-sized and large scale coexisting. 3. Spatial distribution of park green space landscape types in Fucheng District is badly imbalanced and landscape structures are unreasonable 4. Calculation and analysis of landscape pattern index show the small patches in Fucheng District are highly spatially heterogeneous and fragmented with a large patch shape index. This paper aims to provide reference for the planning and construction of an urban park green space landscape.

AB  - Habitat islands, corridors, and patches within the urban-rural mosaic provide important resources for migratory and resident species and may be crucial for breeding success and survival. In suburban areas, corridor width and patch size arc strongly correlated with community composition. We assessed the breeding bird community in the Historic Bethabara Park Complex (HBPC) by territory mapping during April-July 2009 and 2010. HBPC is a 77-ha habitat island in Winston-Salem (Forsyth County), NC. We detected 109 bird species in HBPC, including 60 for which we documented at least 1 breeding territory in either year. Each year we found territories of 58 species; 57 species were the same between years. The majority of birds encountered in this study nest in the canopy, in shrubs, or in cavities. The breeding community was roughly split between migrants (32) and residents (34) and included 3 exotic species. We documented territories for 10 woodland interior specialists including Hylocichla mustelina (Wood Thrush), Seiurus aurocapilla (Ovenbird); and Piranga olivacea (Scarlet Tanager). Two of these observed bird species-Wood Thrush and Sala pusilla (Brown-headed Nuthatch)-are designated as US birds of conservation concern by Partners in Flight (PIF). Eight of the species we documented are considered by PIF to be species of conservation concern in the Piedmont Region during the breeding season and and 3 of these are common species in steep decline: Chaetura pelagica (Chimney Swift), Megaceryle alcyon (Belted Kingfisher), and Colaptes aura! us (Northern Flicker). HBPC is historically and currently species-rich and has a community composition similar to that seen in other NC Piedmont studies. We recommend periodic monitoring as the local landscape and climate change. Further research is needed to determine to what degree the park complex functions as an oasis or population sink for the bird community, especially for forest-interior obligates, Ncotropical migrants, and species of concern.

AB  - Urbanisation is associated with the loss and fragmentation of natural land, the disruption of ecosystem functioning and services, and the loss of biodiversity. Cape Town is situated in a global biodiversity hotspot, with high rates of endemism, but both agricultural and housing demands are increasing pressure on remaining patches of natural land and consequently the biodiversity they support. The aims of this study were to use a standardised camera trap survey to determine which native medium and large mammal species still survive in 12 City of Cape Town (CCT) municipal reserves (range 32-8400 ha), and to understand how reserve size, area-perimeter ratio, connectivity, habitat heterogeneity and presence of permanent freshwater aquatic habitat might influence medium and large mammal (>0.5 kg) community composition. Cameras were placed at 151 locations across all reserves using a stratified placement protocol that resulted in 13,360 independent trigger events by targeted taxa. Nineteen native species (11 carnivores, 7 herbivores, 1 omnivore) were recorded, which is 49% of the 39 species believed to have been present historically. Species richness varied from 1 to 12 species (mean +/- SD = 7 +/- 3.6) across reserves, and linear models showed that higher species richness and the presence of large carnivores was best explained by improved connectivity to large amounts of natural habitat. It is recommended that maintaining biodiversity in urban reserves will be best achieved by preserving and establishing corridors of suitable habitat that allow for the movement of animals to and from other patches.

AB  - Due to habitat loss and hunting, the Hainan gibbon (Nomascus hainanus), the world's rarest primate, was reduced to only two social groups and seven known individuals in 1978. Following the establishment of Bawangling National Natural Reserve (BNNR), gibbon forest habitat increased within this landscape from 56 km(2) in 1980 to 300 km(2), and the species had increased to five groups and 35 individuals by 2021. It is important to assess whether the large increase in habitat area was responsible for gibbon population increase, or whether gibbon recovery was associated with other factors. Here we use a 21-year longitudinal dataset of Hainan gibbon population change and habitat change, combined with vegetation survey plot data for 2021, to establish an accurate distribution baseline for natural tropical broadleaf forest across the BNNR landscape from 400 to 1300 m (the elevational range of gibbons at BNNR) and within the home range for each of the five Hainan gibbon social groups. We then utilized Landsat time-series images and analysis to compute non-linear causal relationships between forest dynamics and gibbon population growth from 2000 to 2021, both across BNNR and within each gibbon group home range. Metrics of forest dynamics include change in total forest area and forest fragmentation, and metrics of gibbon population dynamics include variation in total number of individuals for the entire population and within each social group, and variation in total number of groups. Our results demonstrate that overall gibbon population growth shows a positive relationship with improved habitat quality, with a one-year time lag of population response. However, changes in numbers of individuals within social groups do not show a similar relationship with improving habitat quality, suggesting that increasing forest cover and connectivity within the BNNR landscape are not direct determinants of Hainan gibbon recovery and that other environmental and/or anthropogenic factors are likely to be involved.

AB  - Worldwide, the expansion of settlement and transport infrastructure is one of the most important proximate as well as ultimate causes of biodiversity loss. As much as every modern human society depends on a network of settlements that is well-connected by transport infrastructure (i.e., settlement network), animal and plant species depend on networks of habitats between which they can move (i.e., habitat networks). However, changes to a settlement network in a region often threaten the integrity of the region's habitat networks. Determining plans and policy to prevent these threats is made difficult by the numerous interactions and feedbacks that exist between and within the settlement and habitat networks. Mathematical models of coupled settlement and habitat networks can help us understand the dynamics of this social-ecological system. Yet, few attempts have been made to develop such mathematical models. In this paper, we promote the development of models of coupled settlement and habitat networks for biodiversity conservation. First, we present a conceptual framework of key variables that are ideally considered when operationalizing the coupling of settlement and habitat networks. In this framework, we first describe important network-internal interactions by differentiating between the structural (i.e., relating to purely physical conditions determining the suitability of a location for living or movement) and functional (i.e., relating to the actual presence, abundance or movement of people or other organisms) properties of either network. We then describe the main one-way influences that a settlement network can exert on the habitat networks and vice versa. Second, we give several recommendations for the mathematical modeling of coupled settlement and habitat networks and present several existing modeling approaches (e.g., habitat network models and land-use transport interaction models) that could be used for this purpose. Lastly, we elaborate on potential applications of models of coupled settlement and habitat networks in the development of complex network theory, in the assessment of system resilience and in conservation, transport and urban planning. The development of coupled settlement and habitat network models is important to gain a better system-level understanding of biodiversity conservation under a rapidly urbanizing and growing human population.

AB  - The spatial distribution of biodiversity has specific patterns in urban environments. The aim of this study was to compare the ecological profiles of plants in man-made traffic corridors and natural river corridors in the city of Vantaa. The number of corridor species represented 76.3 % of Vantaa's total flora, even though corridors covered only 2.7 % of the city area. Corridor plants are mostly generalist species with wide ecological niches, and have ruderal and competitor life-strategies, while plants without occurrences in corridors are habitat specialists and species with narrow ecological niches. The conservation value of non-corridor habitats arises from the rarity of species, and the representation of the original boreal nature, while corridors contribute to the total diversity of species. The potential of corridors in urban conservation has not been fully appreciated.

AB  - The aim of the study is to assess the current state of the elements of the natural-ecological framework of the steppe regions of European Russia and the peculiarities of its spatial distribution. Discussion. The most important component of the environmental framework of the steppe regions of European Russia is the system of relatively large zonal landscape areas of the nature reserve fund which contribute to the preservation of biodiversity, the functional integrity of landscapes and the development of ecological networks. As of January 1, 2018, the natural reserve fund of the federal level in the territory of the considered mezoregion is represented by 22 specially protected natural territories (10 reserves, 5 national parks and 7 wildlife sanctuaries) with a total area of 16.1 thousand km(2). The share of the area of specially protected natural reservation is about 2% of the area of the considered mezoregion. Practically for all the regions under consideration, there is a situation where numerous natural territories with "prospective" status are considered for integration into the nature reserve fund; however, the efforts of the scientific community, environmental services and relevant ministries are not very active in implementing projects to give them corresponding status. Conclusion. For the territory stretching from the northern border of the Saratov region to the central part of the Krasnodar Territory, the problem of the absence of cores and key elements constituting the framework of the nature reserve fund is most acute. In six territorial subjects of the Mesoregion, there are no specially protected natural steppe reservations of the federal level. The analysis of modern territorial planning schemes of the steppe regions indicates that the environmental framework of European Russia has not yet become the basis for the adoption of urban planning decisions. At the same time, its structural elements (preserved zonal landscapes, natural and derived landscape complexes), along with autonomously functioning nature-like territorial complexes, will help create a favorable environment for the population.

AB  - In North-western Germany woodland fragmentation has caused a decline in many forest plant species. Hedgerows partly offer a similar environment as forests and have been identified as potential habitats for forest plants in various studies from North America and Western Europe. The objective of this study was to examine whether this applies also to Central Europe and which variables affect the spatial distribution and abundance of forest plant species in hedgerows on a local scale. Three hedgerow networks north of the city of Bremen, Germany, were selected as study areas and divided into totally 515 hedgerow segments. In each segment we recorded all vascular plants and a large number of explanatory variables relating to structure, spatial configuration, environment and management. Averaged across species there was a predominant effect of environmental factors on the occurrence of forest species in the hedgerows, followed by spatial configuration and management. Hedgerow structure was found to be less important. In general, forest species were favored by low nutrient and light availability as well as high connectivity with other hedgerows or forest; they avoided hedgerows with a west-easterly orientation and an adjacent land use in the form of fields or grasslands. Forest species found and not found in hedgerows did not differ in their environmental preferences or life history traits. The number of threatened forest species in the hedgerows, however, was lower than expected with respect to their overall proportion to the total number of forest species in the region.

AB  - It is hypothesized that biodiversity is maintained by interactions at local and regional spatial scales. Many sustainability plans and management practices reflect the need to conserve biodiversity, yet once these plans are implemented, the ecological consequences are not well understood. By learning how management practices affect local environmental factors and dispersal in a region, ecologists and natural resource managers can better understand the implications of management choices. We investigated the interaction of local and regional scale processes in the built environment, where human-impacts are known to influence both. Our goal was to determine how the interaction between spatial variation in habitat heterogeneity in algal management of urban ponds and dispersal shape biodiversity at local and regional spatial scales. A twelve-week mesocosm study was conducted where pond management and dispersal were manipulated to determine how spatial variation in habitat and dispersal from various source pools influence zooplankton metacommunities in urban stormwater ponds. We hypothesized that dispersal from managed or unmanaged source pools will lead to community divergence and local management practices will act as an environmental filter, both reducing beta diversity between managed ponds and driving compositional divergence. Our results suggest that zooplankton dispersal from managed or unmanaged source pools was important to explaining divergence in community composition. Furthermore, local management of algae marginally reduced compositional turnover of zooplankton among ponds but did not lead to significant divergence in community composition. Management practices may act as strong environmental filters by reducing beta diversity between ponds. As hypothesized, source pool constraints led to compositional divergence and local management practices resulted in reduced compositional turnover between ponds. The results of this study suggest that sustainability and management plans may have complex effects on biodiversity both within and across spatial scales. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Within oasis-desert ecotone regions, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is an important parameter for evaluating the growth of vegetation. An accurate quantitative study between NDVI and environmental and anthropogenic factors is critical for understand the driving factors of vegetation growth in oasis-desert ecotone. In 2016, four periods Landsat 8 OLI_TIRS images, relevant climatological parameters data (air temperature, air relative humidity, wind velocity and accumulated temperature), land cover type data and soil data were selected as proxies. In order to quantify the explanatory power for NDVI spatial and temporal distribution in the southern edge of Dunhuang City and northern side of the Mingsha Mountain, the geographical detector model was used to explain the potential influences of factors versus the spatial distribution of NDVI, and each explanatory variable's relative importance can be calculated. The factor detector results disclose that the spatial distribution of NDVI is primarily dominated by land cover type. The risk detector results show that, high NDVI region is located within woodland. The mean value of NDVI displays an increase and then decrease trend with air temperature increase. With the increase of wind velocity and decrease of air relative humidity, the NDVI value shows a decrease trend. The interactive q values between the two factors are higher than any q value of separated factors. Results also indicate that the strongest interactive effects of NDVI are different in distinct seasons. Consequently, anthropogenic activity is more important than environmental factors on NDVI in oasis-desert ecotone. We also demonstrate that air relative humidity rather than air temperature have played a greater role in NDVI spatial distribution.

AB  - Rapid urbanization throughout the world is expected to cause extensive loss of biodiversity in the upcoming decades. Disturbances associated with urbanization frequently operate over multiple spatial scales such that local species extirpations have been attributed both to localized habitat degradation and to regional changes in land use. Urbanization also may shape stream communities by restricting species dispersal within and among stream reaches. In this patch-dynamics view, anthropogenic disturbances and isolation jointly reduce stream biodiversity in urbanizing landscapes. We evaluated predictions of stream invertebrate community composition and abundance based on variation in environmental conditions at five distinct spatial scales: stream habitats, reaches, riparian corridors and watersheds and their spatial location within the larger three-river basin. Despite strong associations between biodiversity loss and human density in this study, local stream habitat and stream reach conditions were poor predictors of community patterns. Instead, local community diversity and abundance were more accurately predicted by riparian vegetation and watershed landscape structure. Spatial coordinates associated with instream distances provided better predictions of stream communities than any of the environmental data sets. Together, results suggest that urbanization in the study region was associated with reduced stream invertebrate diversity through the alteration of landscape vegetation structure and patch connectivity. These findings suggest that maintaining and restoring watershed vegetation corridors in urban landscapes will aid efforts to conserve freshwater biodiversity.

AB  - 1. Recognizing the factor(s) that caused a demographic crash is a prerequisite to the development of a tailored population restoration plan. While habitat destruction leaves little scope for population persistence, cryptic habitat deterioration (for example through reduction of food resources) may similarly render an area totally inhospitable, while it still appears to have a suitable habitat configuration.
   2. Most European bat species have undergone dramatic declines over the past decades. Once among the most widespread and abundant bat species of Central Europe, the lesser horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus hipposideros (Bechstein 1800), is today extinct in many regions. Although changes in the agricultural landscape have been suggested as the major cause of decline, recent studies have shown that this bat forages almost exclusively in woodland, a habitat that has increased in area across continental Europe over the past decades. This suggests that habitat eradication per se is unlikely to be the main cause of decline. But could cryptic habitat deterioration play a harmful role?
   3. We looked at the abundance of insect prey in woodland in the vicinity of colonial roosts with diverging demographic status (extinct, declining or recovering populations), both in the Swiss lowlands (Swiss Plateau) and in the Alps. We predicted that population size correlates positively with prey abundance.
   4. Diet composition mirrored local insect prey abundance, confirming an opportunistic foraging strategy. Prey abundance showed marked seasonal variation, but did not differ between sites harbouring extinct, declining or recovering populations. There was also no difference in food abundance between extinct populations in the lowlands and recovering populations in the Alps.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Cryptic habitat deterioration through a reduction in prey abundance is unlikely to preclude recolonization of abandoned areas by presently recovering populations. However, sufficient areas of natural forest should be preserved or created around potential nursery roosts. Moreover, connectivity between forest patches must be ensured (by creation of hedges and tree lines) to prevent any spatial gap in recolonization within semi-open agricultural landscapes. Other threatened European forest bats may also benefit from these measures.

AB  - Stream temperatures in urban watersheds are influenced to a high degree by changes in landscape and climate, which can occur at small temporal and spatial scales. Here, we describe a modelling system that integrates the distributed hydrologic soil vegetation model with the semi-Lagrangian stream temperature model RBM. It has the capability to simulate spatially distributed hydrology and water temperature over the entire network at high time and space resolutions, as well as to represent riparian shading effects on stream temperatures. We demonstrate the modelling system through application to the Mercer Creek watershed, a small urban catchment near Bellevue, Washington. The results suggest that the model was able to produce realistic streamflow and water temperature predictions that are consistent with observations. We use the modelling construct to characterize impacts of land use change and near-stream vegetation change on stream temperatures and explore the sensitivity of stream temperature to changes in land use and riparian vegetation. The results suggest that, notwithstanding general warming as a result of climate change over the last century, there have been concurrent increases in low flows as a result of urbanization and deforestation, which more or less offset the effects of a warmer climate on stream temperatures. On the other hand, loss of riparian vegetation plays a more important role in modulating water temperatures, in particular, on annual maximum temperature (around 4 degrees C), which could be mostly reversed by restoring riparian vegetation in a fairly narrow corridor - a finding that has important implications for management of the riparian corridor.

AB  - We found that phyllosphere bacterial communities in European cities are associated to urban intensity and that this effect is mediated by several combined stress factors.
   The phyllosphere harbours a diverse and specific bacterial community, which influences plant health and ecosystem functioning. In this study, we investigated the impact of urban green areas connectivity and size on the composition and diversity of phyllosphere bacterial communities. Hereto, we evaluated the diversity and composition of phyllosphere bacterial communities of 233 Platanus x acerifolia and Acer pseudoplatanus trees in 77 urban green areas throughout 6 European cities. The community composition and diversity significantly differed between cities but only to a limited extent between tree species. We could show that urban intensity correlated significantly with the community composition of phyllosphere bacteria. In particular, a significant correlation was found between the relative abundances for 29 out of the 50 most abundant families and the urban intensity: the abundances of classic phyllosphere families, such as Acetobacteraceae, Planctomycetes, and Beijerinkiaceae, decreased with urban intensity (i.e. more abundant in areas with more green, lower air pollution, and lower temperature), while those related to human activities, such as Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillaceae, increased with urban intensity. The results of this study suggest that phyllosphere bacterial communities in European cities are associated with urban intensity and that effect is mediated by several combined stress factors.

AB  - Ecological connectivity is the foundation of maintaining urban biodiversity and ecosystem health. Identifying and managing ecological (connectivity) networks can help maintain the stability of urban ecosystems. However, few studies have explored the cluster effect in the ecological network caused by the imbalance in connectivity strength between habitat patches, which is not conducive to the in-depth restoration of ecological networks. In the present study, a typical urban area, Shenzhen, was used as an example to analyze the important habitats in the city based on the focal species and to identify an ecological network. Habitat patch clusters in the ecological network were explored based on random walk network community detection. These are clusters of closely connected habitat lands. Finally, we analyzed existing urban policies for the protection of clusters and the points to be repaired in the network. The results showed that 50 ecological corridors connected 39 habitats in the study area, which further formed seven habitat patch clusters. Most of the clusters were well-protected by existing policies. Nineteen barrier points were identified between the clusters, and their restoration helped strengthen the connectivity between clusters. This study provides a reference for future urban ecological restoration.

AB  - As large amounts of natural environments are lost due to urbanization, the role of remnant native vegetation in the preservation of biodiversity has become even more significant. Remnant native forest patches are essential refugia for flora and fauna and are crucial for the maintenance of ecosystem processes in urbanized landscapes. We evaluated the influence of landscape structure on ants and spiders associated with Atlantic Forest remnants in urban landscapes. We sampled 14 forest areas in the Metropolitan Region of Salvador and tested the effect of the landscapes' proportion of forest cover, mean landscape isolation, and mean landscape shape complexity on the taxonomic and functional richness and the community composition of both groups. The species collected were classified into functional groups based on behavioral attributes and environmental preferences. Overall, there were strong adverse effects of forest loss, decreased connectivity, and an increase in edge effects associated with the mean shape complexity of the forest remnants. However, the spiders responded to all three landscape structure characteristics whereas the ants only responded to the landscape mean shape complexity. Our findings indicate that the maintenance of urban forest habitats is essential for the conservation of biodiversity in the Metropolitan Region of Salvador and the preservation of ecological functions performed by species within the forest areas.

AB  - Increased urbanization drives habitat loss, yet residential land-use represents significant habitat potential for mammals and could provide connectivity between patches of green spaces. Diverse mammal communities exist across urban gradients, but it is unclear how mammal community composition varies within residential lands. We conducted a camera trapping study in 36 residential yards across an urban gradient to assess the relative contributions of the degree of urbanization in the land-use context versus parcel habitat features, such as vegetation structure, on mammal community diversity and composition. We hypothesized that land-use context would more strongly influence mammal community metrics than parcel features, and that there would be species-specific differences in response. We detected 14 non-domesticated mammal species and found that species richness peaked in the suburbs and tapered off at the rural and urban ends of the gradient in accordance with patterns seen in other taxonomic groups, yet rarely quantified in mammals. Large-bodied interior forest species were associated with rural sites, urban-dwelling species were associated with urban sites, and suburban sites had an overlap of species types. Although composition of mammal species in residential yards appears to be strongly related to land-use context, which is often outside of residents' control, management of parcel habitat features such as retention of large mature trees may facilitate connectivity between patches of habitat across urbanizing landscapes. Informed residential yard management remains an important tool for urban wildlife management in an era of global change.

AB  - Most studies on ecological networks consider only a single interaction type (e.g. competitive, predatory or mutualistic), and try to developrules for system stability based exclusively on properties of this interaction type. However, the stability of ecological networks may be more dependent on the way different interaction types are combined in real communities. To address this issue, we start by compiling an ecological network in the Donana Biological Reserve, southern Spain, with 390 species and 798 mu-tualistic and antagonistic interactions. We characterize network structure by looking at how mutualistic and antagonistic interactions are combined across all plant species. Both the ratio of mutualistic to antagonistic interactions per plant, and the number of basic modules with an antagonistic and a mutualistic interaction are very heterogeneous across plant species, with a few plant species showing very high values for these parameters. To assess the implications of these network patterns on species diversity, we study analytically and by simulation a model of this ecological network. We find that the observed correlation between strong interaction strengths and high mutualistic to antagonistic ratios in a few plant species significantly increases community diversity. Thus, to predict the persistence of biodiversity we need to understand how interaction strength and the architecture of ecological networks with different interaction types are combined.

AB  - The range-wide habitat status of many endangered species is unclear. We evaluated the status and spatial distribution of the habitat of the endangered giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) across its entire geographic range (i.e., six mountain regions located in Sichuan. Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, China) by integrating field and remotely sensed data to develop a habitat distribution model. Results suggest that current suitable habitat corresponds to ca. 1/4 of the habitat baseline (i.e., maximum amount of habitat possible). The highest proportion of suitable habitat relative to the baseline is in the Qinling mountain region. Overall, around 40% of the suitable habitat is inside nature reserves, but the proportion of habitat inside them varied among different mountain regions, ranging from ca. 17% (Lesser Xiangling) to ca. 66% (Qinling). The habitat model also predicted the occurrence of potentially suitable habitat outside the currently accepted geographic range of the species, which should be further evaluated as potential panda reintroduction sites. Our approach is valuable for assessing the conservation status of the entire habitat of the species, for identifying areas with significant ecological roles (e.g., corridors), for identifying areas suitable for panda reintroductions, and for establishing specific conservation strategies in different parts of the giant panda geographic range. It might also prove useful for range-wide habitat analyses of many other endangered species around the world. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Three forest fragments located along a gradient from the central area of the city (an urban historical park) to increasingly peripheral areas (a suburban nature reserve, an extraurban nature reserve) were identified in the western sectors of the Metropolitan City of Capital Rome administrative district and its surroundings (Central Italy). With the aims to describe the structural parameters of Chilopod assemblages in these forest fragments for determine their status of conservation and to evaluate the effects of some environmental variables (coverage of the canopy layer, shrub layer, herb layer, litter layer) on selected species, sampling took place by pitfall traps from June 2015 to June 2016. The relevance of these kind of studies is in precisely identifying the areas of greatest conservation value; the purpose is to provide guidelines for the planning of the ecological network of the city of Rome towards the protection of the areas inhabited by more sensitive fauna and flora elements rather than protecting as many areas as possible. Chilopods are strictly forest arthropods, therefore they are considered useful biondicators of these ecosystems. The centipede assemblage of suburban forest fragment is characterized by a greater complexity and stability compared to the centipede assemblages of central and extraurban forest fragments, both apparently in a typical state of successional stages. The distribution pattern of the centipede diversity of the study area seems to deviate from the usual patterns found in other European cities for other arthropod assemblages as well as for the centipedes, as the greater biodiversity has been recorded in the suburban forest fragment, not in the extraurban one. The suburban forest fragment is moreover characterized by a higher degree of stratification and structural complexity than the other two forest fragments, with a largest number of forest species, some of these absent both in the urban and the extraurban fragments.

AB  - The promotion of urban biodiversity mainly relies on all kinds of urban green land, especially the green land affiliated with fragmentation and smaller dimensions that receives less attention. Based on small-scale connected urban green spaces, the construction of habitat networks is very important for biodiversity protection. Considering the importance of the habitat networks constructed by the affiliated green land with smaller dimensions to biodiversity protection, this research attempted to apply a new technique to construct a habitat network and an urban block unit structure for ecological restoration and green space biodiversity at the city-block scale. By analyzing the related ecological principles, this research extracted four design approaches: the green land habitat patch-companion method; the corresponding shape and function method; the newly increased and protective patch location method; the bunching patch substitution method; and the approaches for designing campus habitat galleries, such as the 3D greening method of narrow and long campus galleries, the method of designing a campus main road green belt, the method of designing a relaxed campus landscape green belt, the method of designing a core campus landscape green belt, the method of connecting the habitat patch node, and the method of covering habitat diversity. By comparing the network pattern indexes, determining the key habitat patches, constructing the habitat network frameworks, and improving the habitat aggregation quality, this research constructed three ideal network models for urban university campus habitats and explained the butterfly biodiversity model graphic representation, application conditions, and features. The "crosswise radiation" network was effective for ecological restoration, and the "dendritic zoning" network significantly enhanced butterfly biodiversity.

AB  - Urban expansion increases fragmentation of the landscape. In effect, fragmentation decreases connectivity, causes green space loss and impacts upon the ecology and function of green space. Restoration of the functionality of green space often requires restoring the ecological connectivity of this green space within the city matrix. However, identifying ecological corridors that integrate different structural and functional connectivity of green space remains vague. Assessing connectivity for developing an ecological network by using efficient models is essential to improve these networks under rapid urban expansion. This paper presents a novel methodological approach to assess and model connectivity for the Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus) and Yellow-vented bulbul (Pycnonotus goiavier) in three cities (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Jakarta, Indonesia and Metro Manila, Philippines). The approach identifies potential priority corridors for ecological connectivity networks. The study combined circuit models, connectivity analysis and least-cost models to identify potential corridors by integrating structure and function of green space patches to provide reliable ecological connectivity network models in the cities. Relevant parameters such as landscape resistance and green space structure (vegetation density, patch size and patch distance) were derived from an expert and literature-based approach based on the preference of bird behaviour. The integrated models allowed the assessment of connectivity for both species using different measures of green space structure revealing the potential corridors and least-cost pathways for both bird species at the patch sites. The implementation of improvements to the identified corridors could increase the connectivity of green space. This study provides examples of how combining models can contribute to the improvement of ecological networks in rapidly expanding cities and demonstrates the usefulness of such models for biodiversity conservation and urban planning.

AB  - To alter the sharply decreasing trend of biodiversity due to human disturbances, much emphasis has been placed on the ecological networks comprised of core areas with high ecological significance and corridors connecting them. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a novel viewpoint and method to identify, analyze and optimize the ecological network of Wuyishan City. The bidirectional least-cost distance model is applied to identify the landscape network in Wuyishan City for the year 1995 and 2005, which can incorportate digraph in ecological network modeling, overcome the limitation of failing to reflect the orientation of the species' dispersal process, and make the process of modeling more convincing by distinguishing flux orientation of "go" and "return" of two random patches. Three new metrics, i.e., network cyclicity, degree of cyclicity, and degree of connectedness, which can quantify the integrity and continuity of network and the relation between network organization and ecological process, are introduced to measure the presence and strength of cyclic pathways in a network and reflect the network's ability to transfer bio-flux. The results show that the ecological network of Wuyishan City in the year 1995 and 2005 have respectively a network size of 18 and 17, degree of connectedness of 1 and 0.7647, network cyclicity of 7.1378 and 8.2570, and degree of cyclicity of 0.3965 and 0.4857, which indicate that the network in Wuyishan City for the year 2005 has strong ability to transfer bio-flux, a high level of eco-process diversity, and a low level of integrity and continuity. It can be concluded that during the past 10 years, different areas of Wuyishan City have gone through landscape degradation and restoration. In the northeast, network components degraded severely and made several patches "isolated islands", while in the southwest, the network has been developed because of landscape restoration. In particular, the linkages among the patches of natural reserve and its neighborhood increased remarkably, which directly increased the interaction strength and the whole network cyclicity. Then, via scenario analysis, we also identify the patches and linkages that make great contributions to the entire cyclicity and connectedness, such as patches [1,2,3,4,5,6] (Nature reserve and its neighborhood), [12] (bridging the north and west part) and [19] (bridging the south and west part), and linkages among the central patches.

AB  - The fragmentation of protected areas is a common issue in global conservation, which means a new approach to planning and management needs to be explored. In this paper, we proposed the concept of a group of natural protected areas (GNPA) and studied the construction of GNPAs. Firstly, the spatial distribution characteristics of 1363 natural protected areas (NPAs) in Guangdong Province were qualitatively studied. The overall spatial pattern among NPAs and the spatial distribution characteristics of mountain ranges, river basins, urbanization level and economic density were analyzed, and the relationship between the distribution of NPAs and physical geography and social development was clarified. Then, the geographical concentration index, nearest index and Gini coefficient were used for quantitative analysis. The geographical concentration index was 24.6, and the nearest neighbor index was 0.8. The Gini coefficients of the spatial distribution of NPAs in Guangdong Province were Gini = 0.956 and C = 0.044. These indices proved that the overall spatial patterns of NPAs in Guangdong Province had the tendency and characteristics of agglomeration. On this basis, 29 agglomeration areas were constructed using kernel density analysis and the natural break point classification method. According to the requirements of spatial connectivity and management feasibility, combined with the characteristics of physical geography, ecosystems and biodiversity, 32 GNPAs were constructed based on the reasonable adjustment of 29 agglomeration areas. Using Geodetector statistics to analyze the spatial stratified heterogeneity of the GNPAs, the results showed that mountain range, water system, population density, economic density and urbanization level were all factors that could explain the clustering distribution of the natural protected areas. The most important factor was mountain range (p = 0.190), followed by population density (p = 0.162). The 32 GNPAs covered the most representative natural ecosystems in the province and had compact spatial organization, a close ecological relationship and feasible unified management, which means they could aid in resolving the fragmentation of protected areas and improving management efficiency.

AB  - Riparian corridors are critical refuges for biodiversity in arid regions like the southwestern US. Birds in particular rely on these habitats for breeding and as migratory stopover sites within a resource-scarce landscape. Climate change is likely to affect the distribution of resources across such landscapes and how birds use riparian zones. In this study, we used 15 years of bird-banding data (1994-2008) from eight riparian sites across the state of Utah to examine the effects of variation in climate and vegetation on birds at the community and population level. We used generalized linear mixed models to analyze the effects of temperature, precipitation, El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) on daily total captures, species richness and community composition. We found that total captures and species richness increased in hotter, drier, less green years and in El Nino years, and the relationships were more pronounced for non-riparian species than for species breeding in riparian zones. We also found changes in community composition in relation to temperature and precipitation. At the population level, we used capture-mark-recapture (CMR) models to analyze the effects of these covariates on the rates of population growth, recruitment and apparent survival. We found that population growth rates were negatively associated with temperature and ENSO for roughly half of the focal species. This pattern was almost entirely due to lower recruitment, likely caused by the combination of fewer resources and increased competition from the influx of non-riparian birds into riparian oases. Our results have important implications for arid areas which are expected to become hotter and drier. Reducing other anthropogenic threats to riparian corridors, such as cattle grazing and water management, is likely to increase the resilience to climate change of riparian habitats and their avian residents.

AB  - One response to biodiversity decline is the definition of ecological networks that extend beyond protected areas and promote connectivity in human-dominated landscapes. In farmland, landscape ecological research has focused more on wooded than open habitat networks. In our study, we assessed the influence of permanent grassland connectivity, described by grassland amount and spatial configuration, on grassland biodiversity. We selected permanent grasslands in livestock farming areas of north-western France, which were sampled for plants, carabids and birds. At two spatial scales we tested the effects of amount and configuration of grasslands, wooded habitats and crops on richness and abundance of total assemblages and species ecological groups. Grassland connectivity had no significant effects on total richness or abundance of any taxonomic group, regardless of habitat affinity or dispersal ability. The amount of wooded habitat and length of wooded edges at the 200 m scale positively influenced forest and generalist animal groups as well as grassland plant species, in particular animal-dispersed species. However, for animal groups such as open habitat carabids or farmland bird specialists, the same wooded habitats negatively influenced richness and abundance at the 500 m scale. The scale and direction of biodiversity responses to landscape context were therefore similar among taxonomic groups, but opposite for habitat affinity groups. We conclude that while grassland connectivity is unlikely to contribute positively to biodiversity, increasing or maintaining wooded elements near grasslands would be a worthwhile conservation goal. However, the requirements of open farmland animal species groups must be considered, for which such action may be deleterious.

AB  - Formulation of the problem. Urban landscapes are distinguished from the surrounding territories by the radical transformation of all components under the influence of anthropogenic factor. Flora and fauna which are one of the most important factors in maintaining the ecological balance of urban landscapes are undergoing the largest changes in cities. Therefore, an urgent problem is the conservation of biota in cities. The solution of this problem involves protection of existing and restoration of degraded habitats of flora and fauna in cities; creation of the necessary migration conditions for the exchange of genetic information.
   Purpose. The purpose of the article is to identify the peculiarities of flora and fauna, landscape complexes of biocentres of Vinnytsia ecological network.
   Methods. In order to achieve this purpose, a study of flora and fauna and landscape complexes of the urban territory was conducted; the habitats of rare species of flora and fauna, the areas of occurrence of the associations of the Green Book of Ukraine were revealed; features of quasi-natural areas valuable for the conservation of biodiversity were analyzed. The studies were conducted using the following methods: field research (key, area and route), analytical-cartographic analysis, collecting and processing of statistical information, literary-cartographic, theoretical generalization and systematization of facts, analysis, abstraction, analogy, synthesis.
   Results. 25 biocentres are singled out in the structure of Vinnytsia local ecological network. They represent all the landscapes of the city: typical forest-steppe and mixed forests; river-beds, floodplains, above-floodplain terraces, slopes and watersheds; forest-steppe woodlands, passage valleys and upland oakery; conditionally natural and anthropogenic.
   The characteristic features of urban ecological network biocentres are determined by their location within certain types of landscape terrain. Therefore, the floodplain, above-floodplain-terrace, slope, watershed and complex groups of biocentres of Vinnytsia are distinguished. Complex biocentres dominate in areas (70.7%). They cover several types of landscape terrains. But slope and watershed types prevail among them. Large areas (22.8%) are covered by biocentres of the above-floodplain-terrace group. Slope (1.9%) and watershed (1.3%) biocentres are the least common. Biocentres are represented by quasi-natural areas where rare species of living organisms and plant associations are frequently seen.
   Scientific novelty. For the first time since 2015, after increasing the area of Vinnytsia, local biocentres of the city's ecological network have been singled out. The peculiarities of landscape complexes, flora and fauna of biocentres have been revealed, in particular the list of rare species of flora and fauna has been defined.
   Practical importance. Distinguished biocentres of Vinnytsia local ecological network will help preserve the biotic and landscape diversity of the city, maintain ecological balance of the city territory.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation are leading threats to biodiversity today, and primates are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic habitat disturbance. However, few studies have examined how differential effects of variation in forest fragment characteristics on males and females in a primate population may affect demography and population persistence. We quantified the effects of variation in forest fragment characteristics on the within-fragment demography of black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra) in forest fragments around Palenque National Park, Mexico, and how these effects differed between adult males and females. We quantified forest loss in the landscape between 2000 and 2017, and used a redundancy analysis to examine the effects of 15 variables quantifying fragment dimensions, forest composition and physical structure, and isolation on fragment population size and density, the proportion of adult males and females in the fragment population, and the mean number of adult males and females per group in 34 fragments (N = 393 monkeys). We hypothesized that (i) population size is positively correlated with fragment area, while population density is negatively correlated, and (ii) the composition of fragment populations results from differential effects of fragment variables on adult males and females. Forest cover decreased by 23.3% from 2000 to 2017. Our results showed a significant effect of fragment variables on population demography in fragments, accounting for 0.69 of the variance in the demographic response variables. Population size increased with fragment area and connectivity, while density decreased. Larger, less isolated fragments with better connectivity, characteristics indicative of abundant secondary growth, and those with more diverse vegetation but lower Simpson's evenness indices tended to have more adult females per group and a higher proportion of adult females in the population. In contrast, fragments that were largely similar in characteristics of forest composition and structure, but that were more isolated from nearby fragments, had more adult males per group and a higher proportion of adult males. These results may stem from black howler females preferentially remaining in natal groups and fragments when possible, and dispersing shorter distances when they disperse, while males may be more likely to disperse between fragments, traveling longer distances through the matrix to more isolated fragments. These differential effects on males and females have important conservation implications: if females are more abundant in larger, less isolated fragments, while males are more abundant in more isolated fragments, then to effectively conserve this population, both landscape connectivity and fragment areas should be maintained and increased.

AB  - Urban-ecological landscape connectivity and pattern optimization can significantly enhance biodiversity and sustainable development capacity, which play an important role in continued ecosystem functioning. Previous studies identified ecological sources based on the area threshold method or combination with morphological spatial pattern analysis and the landscape connectivity index (CMSPACI) method, but few studies have compared the advantages, disadvantages, and applicability of the two methods. In this paper, taking Nanchang as the study area, we address the ecological sources via area threshold and the CMSPACI method. Then, the minimum cost distance method is used to generate potential corridors of different methods, and the differences in ecological networks are analyzed. Finally, the circuit theory is used to identify barriers, and we provide targeted recommendations for ecological network pattern optimization in the study area. The results show that (1) the ecological sources extracted by different methods are different. The ecological sources extracted by the area threshold are far away from the surrounding sources, and the landscape connectivity is low. The ecological sources identified by the CMSPACI method are closely related to the surrounding sources, and the landscape connectivity is high. (2) Compared with the area threshold method, the habitat quality of corridors under the CMSPACI method is better, and the interaction intensity between patches is larger. (3) There is little difference in the number of ecological barriers under different methods; all of them are located between patches or on the edge of patches, and most of them are roads or construction land. Overall, the area threshold method is simpler. Ecological sources can be effectively addressed through the CMSPACI method, and the landscape connectivity of the ecological network will be better. This study provides an important reference for the selection of ecological sources in the construction of ecological networks.

AB  - Urbanization is currently responsible for widespread declines of amphibian populations globally through the loss, isolation, and degradation of habitat. However, it is not clear how urbanization affects amphibian communities at both local (pond) and landscape scales. We assessed the breeding distribution of frogs in ponds along an urban-rural gradient in Greater Melbourne, Australia, and examined community relationships with habitat quality and landscape context. We sampled frog larvae at 65 ponds on four separate occasions and collected data on local pond and landscape variables. Using Bayesian Poisson regression modeling we found that species richness decreased at ponds surrounded by high densities of human residents and at ponds with high water conductivity, whereas species richness increased substantially at ponds surrounded by a high proportion of green open space. Ordination of individual species presence-absence data by canonical correspondence analysis largely confirmed these findings. Ordination also highlighted the negative influences of pond shading and density of predatory fish, and the positive influence of aquatic vegetation, on community composition. Individual species' responses to urbanization varied. Urbanization had strong negative effects on species that were associated with well-vegetated, sunny, fish-free ponds. Our study highlights the importance of strategic management actions in urban landscapes to improve terrestrial habitat and connectivity around ponds and other wetlands, and local management actions to improve water quality, remove predatory fish, and plant aquatic vegetation at breeding sites.

AB  - Based on GIS and CBERS/CCD which was obtained on June 16, 2006, patches of urban green in the main urban areas of Chengdu are extracted using many quantitative indicators and by method of decision tree classification, according to principles and methods of landscape ecology. Patches of urban green are divided into four grades, and they are respectively small-scale patch, medium-scale patch, large-scale patch and special large-scale patch. The area proportion of small-scale patch is 3.8%, and that of medium-scale patch is 11.1%, that of large-scale patch is 22.3% and that of special large-scale patch is 62.8%. The results of fragmentation, contagion, diversity index, dominance and evenness are obtained. They are 0.854, 0.600, 0.657, 0.730 and 0.690 respectively. The research results think that scalability characteristics and divisional differences of green patches are obvious. A little number of green whose area is bigger mainly is composed of scenic spots, gardens and universities. There are many problems, for example, connectivity of urban green is low, structure of landscape is single, and spatial distribution is unbalanced. So, the government should attach importance to greening and management of urban and rural transitional zone which is being developed now.

AB  - The creation of cities, towns and farms following European settlement of Australia has fragmented the original vegetation. Many native species that were previously widespread are now found only within isolated remnants of their original habitat. These relictual populations are at increased risk of decline and local extinction, so identifying the factors that determine their persistence is important for ongoing management and conservation. I compared the effects of site area, connectivity, vegetation condition and habitat resources on the presence, abundance and total number of species of butterflies and day-flying moths within 46 urban fragments of remnant vegetation in south-west Western Australia. Site area and vegetation condition were the dominant determinants of species presence: large sites with more undisturbed vegetation favoured 16 of 20 native species and only one (Geitoneura minyas) benefited from disturbance. Another nine species that were not sufficiently widespread or abundant to enable individual analysis were collectively more prevalent in larger sites. Resource quality and quantity dominated the patterns of site occupancy, consistent with habitat resources, not metapopulation effects, determining current distribution patterns. The total number of species at each site reflected the collective responses of the individual species: increasing with area and declining with vegetation disturbance. The effects of area and vegetation condition were not simply additive: disturbance had a far greater impact on small remnants. Restoration or maintenance of high vegetation condition will be essential to maintain regional species diversity and to prevent local extinctions of butterflies and day-flying moths, especially in small remnants.

AB  - Urban areas are expanding worldwide, yet little is known how anthropogenic landscape fragmentation affects the connectedness and gene flow in urban wildlife. The European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) is a ground dwelling mammal which also inhabits variable urban habitats. We investigated habitat connectivity and the spatial genetic structure of urban hedgehogs in the largest Swiss city. We addressed the following questions: i) At the city-scale, which prominent landscape elements affect the spatial distribution of genetic clusters? ii) Which landscape elements affect gene flow in an urban mammal within the clusters? iii) Does individual movement data improve the prediction of landscape-wide gene flow?
   We used two Bayesian methods to examine the influence of water bodies and major traffic routes on genetic hedgehog clusters, using microsatellite data of 147 hedgehogs. Further, we used extensive movement data to parameterise single-path and multi-path connectivity models, which were then used to predict genetic distance between hedgehog individuals.
   First, we found that both Bayesian methods consistently showed three distinct genetic clusters, separated by the main rivers and the parallel running transportation axes. Second, the best model indicates that gene flow was facilitated by urban green areas and hampered by all other land cover types. Third, multi-path models based on detailed GPS movement data clearly outperformed models based on a priori assumptions to predict gene flow.
   Multi-path connectivity models based on movement data reveal to be a powerful tool to detect gene flow in highly fragmented habitats and could be a crucial step in implementing effective conservation measures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent decades, the City of Stockholm, Sweden, has grown substantially and is now the largest city in Scandinavia. Recent urban growth is placing pressure on green areas within and around the city. In order to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services, green infrastructure is part of Stockholm municipal planning. This research quantifies land-cover change in the City of Stockholm between 2003 and 2018 and examines what impact urban growth has had on its green infrastructure. Two 2018 WorldView-2 images and three 2003 QuickBird-2 images were used to produce classifications of 11 land-cover types using object-based image analysis and a support vector machine algorithm with spectral, geometric and texture features. The classification accuracies reached over 90% and the results were used in calculations and comparisons to determine the impact of urban growth in Stockholm between 2003 and 2018, including the generation of land-cover change statistics in relation to administrative boundaries and green infrastructure. For components of the green infrastructure, i.e., habitat networks for selected sensitive species, habitat network analysis for the European crested tit (Lophophanes cristatus) and common toad (Bufo bufo) was performed. Between 2003 and 2018, urban areas increased by approximately 4% while green areas decreased by 2% in comparison with their 2003 areal amounts. The most significant urban growth occurred through expansion of the transport network, paved surfaces and construction areas which increased by 12%, mainly at the expense of grassland and coniferous forest. Examination of urban growth within the green infrastructure indicated that most land area was lost in dispersal zones (28 ha) while the highest percent change was within habitat for species of conservation concern (14%). The habitat network analysis revealed that overall connectivity decreased slightly through patch fragmentation and areal loss mainly caused by road expansion on the outskirts of the city. The habitat network analysis also revealed which habitat areas are well-connected and which are most vulnerable. These results can assist policymakers and planners in their efforts to ensure sustainable urban development including sustaining biodiversity in the City of Stockholm.

AB  - Ponds are lentic waterbodies with a high conservation value for biodiversity that have long been overlooked by management policies. Recent initiatives aimed to promote the conservation of these ecosystems by restoring or creating new ponds throughout Europe. Therefore, studying responses of aquatic invertebrates to local pond characteristics and connectivity between them is determinant to understand community dynamics and colonization processes of these scattered ecosystems. We studied larval communities of odonates in 20 created or restored ponds to assess their colonization during the first 2 or 3 years. Community dynamics in relation to pond vegetation, landscape context and connectivity with other ponds were also investigated. No difference in species richness was found between restored and created ponds. Most species colonized the ponds during the first year, but a different pattern in colonization was observed between Anisoptera and Zygoptera. Community composition was related to the landscape context of ponds and the time since pond creation or restoration. Abundances were positively related to pond connectivity, especially in the suborder Zygoptera. No relationship was found between vegetation and Anisopteran larvae, while Zygoptera seem more sensible to the vegetation structure due to their endophytic oviposition. This work confirms the high colonization capacity of odonates and shows that creation of new ponds could be as efficient as pond restoration to enhance the conservation of freshwater species. It also highlights that landscape characteristics and connectivity between ponds are determinant to support higher abundances and a posteriori increase population viability at the landscape scale.

AB  - A prospective strategy is necessary to mitigate the negative impacts of habitat fragmentation in Germany. The traditional concept of protecting isolated remnants of endangered habitats as nature reserves could not stop the continuing decline of endangered species and the regional losses in biodiversity sufficiently. During the last century, different approaches to protect open space, species, and habitats have been developed. Based on a literature review, an analysis of the legal framework and a representative case study, this paper tries to characterise the development of greenways and habitat networks in Germany and to discuss the general possibilities and limitations in an European context. In Germany, greenways were first established to prevent urban sprawl, to separate settlements, to provide recreational opportunities and to improve air quality in industrialised urban areas. The increased relevance of nature conservation has led to the development of new types of habitat networks in addition to the greenway concept since 1980. Species-oriented habitat networks focus on the specific requirements of target species, while multifunctional habitat networks try to address many landscape functions when reconnecting the remnant habitats. The Kronsberg Project is an example of a local, multifunctional habitat network. It illustrates some of the implementation difficulties resulting from conflicting interests of the various user groups. In addition, the need became obvious to plan multifunctional networks which allow for spatial separation of conflicting site related objectives. The legal framework for habitat networks in Germany is, in principle, a sound legislation which requires that habitat networks cover a minimum of 10% of the total land area of the German states. The conceptualisation of the networks must not be restricted to the boundaries of the individual German states because the networks should have an interstate character and also contribute to the European network of Natura 2000. However, this national and European network cannot be presently implemented by the German national authorities. Instead, the framework legislation must be passed as nature conservation laws at the state level, while concrete implementation takes place at the regional and local levels. There the implementation is hampered primarily by property ownership considerations or conflicting interests of landowners. This situation hinders the implementation of national and European objectives for habitat networks. In order to create a forward looking network strategy for Germany, more authority should be transferred to the national level. In addition, a stronger link between the scientific and conceptual basis of habitat networks is needed. Prioritising landscape functions and the selection of target species require better coordination. Economic incentives could be used to reduce the conflicts with landowners. Hopefully, a change in the EU-agricultural policy will facilitate this development. (c) 2004, Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim
   The main drainages of the Plata Basin - the Parana, Paraguay and Uruguay rivers - begin in tropical latitudes and run in a north-south direction into subtropical-temperate latitudes. Consequently, the biota of these rivers has tropical elements that contrast with temperate biomes through which the rivers run. We apply a panbiogeographical approach, to test whether the large rivers of the Plata Basin have a differential influence on distributional patterns of tropical snakes in subtropical and temperate latitudes of South America.
   Location
   Subtropical and temperate sections of the major Plata Basin rivers, South America.
   Methods
   We compared the individual tracks of 94 snake taxa. The track analysis consisted of: (1) plotting the localities of each taxon on maps, (2) connecting the localities of each taxon using a minimal geographical proximity determinant of the 'individual tracks', and (3) superimposing the individual tracks to determine generalized tracks. To detect tropical snakes that reach higher latitudes through the rivers we used the preferential direction of distribution concept. For each taxon we measured the angular deviations between the line of its individual track and the course of the rivers in a 100 x 100 km scaled grid. Average angular values < 45 degrees indicated a positive association with the rivers.
   Results
   Thirty-five of 94 taxa showed distributions associated with the major rivers of the Plata Basin, including fauna from distinct biogeographical lineages, supported by the occurrence of five generalized tracks as follows: (1) the Paraguay-Middle Parana, (2) the Paraguay-Parana fluvial axis, Upper Parana and Middle Parana to Upper Delta, (3) the Lower Paraguay, Parana and Uruguay rivers, excluding the sectors High Parana and High Uruguay, (4) the Uruguay River and Upper Parana, and (5) the High Parana. The Atlantic species occurred with significantly higher frequency in the Uruguay River and High Parana river sections, the Amazon species were found with significantly higher frequency in the Paraguay and Middle Parana sections, and the species with a Pantanal distribution were found in all sections.
   Main conclusions
   The observed distributional patterns may be explained by the interaction of ecological, geographical and historical factors. Previous authors have developed ecological (hydrological or environmental similarity) or dispersalist (effect of rivers as migration routes) explanations. The coincidence between generalized tracks and past geomorphological events that caused displacements and changed relationships between the Paraguay, Parana and Uruguay river sections supports hypotheses involving the strong influence of historical factors in the present configuration of tropical snake distribution in temperate latitudes.

AB  - Construction and protection of ecological networks (ENs) is considered to be an effective means to curb habitat fragmentation and strengthen landscape connectivity. In this study, a complete evaluation framework of ENs based on "quality-function-structure" was proposed to support the formulation of protection strategies for ENs. First, we built the ENs of Wuhan urban agglomeration (WUA) from 2000 to 2020 based on the advantages of circuit theory and remote sensing data of land use monitoring. The results showed that land development activities are an important driving force for the temporal and spatial evolution of global ENs. Forest fragmentation, transitional urban expansion, and agricultural reclamation were important inducements for the shrinkage of ecological sources. They may also increase the resistance of species migration, which will lead to qualitative change and even fracture of ecological corridors. Second, circuit theory, centrality index, and complex network theory were applied to evaluate the quality defects, functional connectivity, and topology characteristics of ENs in WUA, respectively, from 2000 to 2020. The results showed that the antagonism between ecological corridors and land development activities led to ecological quality defects (ecological barriers and pinchpoints). Different land development models had differential effects on centrality indexes. Moreover, the main trunk in the northern Dabie Mountains and the southern Mufu mountains was developed, while the secondary trunks were abundant in the middle of WUA. Finally, we proposed protection strategies for ENs based on the coupling of the "quality-function-structure" of WUA in 2020. It is suggested that all ecological sources must be included in nature reserves to prevent natural or manmade erosion. The key areas to be repaired were determined through the quality evaluation of ecological corridors. The priority of construction and protection of ecological corridors was determined by coupling two topological structures and functions. We argue that specific protection strategies and directions can be determined according to the construction objectives of local ENs.

AB  - Campus landscape reflects the identity and character of a college. The need of public accessibility in the form of pedestrian pathway in campus should be provided particularly to realize a campus life that is environmentally friendly and sustainable In addition, the presence of a green way on the edge of the pedestrian track in the campus landscape can provide benefits as ecological network corridors that facilitate wildlife movement, linking wildlife habitats, and improve the aesthetic quality of pedestrian pathways. This study aimed to evaluate the visual aesthetic qualities of pedestrian pathways based on ecological network corridors within campus landscape. This study was conducted at campus of Bogor Agricultural University (IPB) Dramaga. The used method in this study was descriptive quantitative with analyses of Scenic Beauty Estimation (SBE), Shannon Wiener Index (H), and correlation analysis with Rank Spearman. The results showed that the aesthetic quality of pedestrian pathways based on ecological network corridors at IPB Dramaga campus overall showed good results which is characterized by the neatness of pedestrian characteristics and dominant of trees presence. This was indicated by a very high SBE value with a moderate H value. However, there were inadequate pedestrian pathways that have medium SBE value with low H value which is characterized by misused of pedestrian pathways, surrounding building appearance that were not neat, and minimum of trees presence. The correlation test showed positive correlation between SBE aspect and trees diversity aspect (0.335) though there is no significant correlation between the two aspects.

AB  - Rapid urbanization is emerging as one of the leading threats to the biodiversity globally. But is especially a cause of concern for tropical countries which are urbanizing much faster and with relatively less urban planning than temperate ones. Urban green spaces are established to reduce the negative impacts of urbanization by conserving a large suite of species. Yet our knowledge on the significance of urban green spaces for supporting urban fauna and enhancing species richness is lacking for tropical countries such as India. We examined how landscape and local scale features of urban green spaces influence bird species richness, density, fine-foraging guild richness and composition during breeding and non-breeding season in Dehradun, India. We quantified landscape level variables in the 250 m buffer around 18 urban green spaces. We sampled vegetation and bird community during breeding and non-breeding season through 52 intensive sampling point spread across 18 urban green spaces. Size of the urban green space at landscape level and tree species richness at the local scale emerged as important predictors influencing bird species richness, density and richness of imperilled insectivorous guild across seasons. Urban green spaces within education institutions and offices experiencing less vegetation management supported higher bird species richness and density whereas city parks were species poor. Community composition was affected more strongly by built-up cover and barren area in the landscape matrix and also by tree species richness at the local scale within urban green spaces. City planners should focus on allocating green spaces within urban settings and expand the formal green spaces. Existing green spaces could be improved by augmenting compositional and structural heterogeneity of vegetation as well as conservation of large old native trees.

AB  - Context Urbanisation is an environmental filter for many species that leads to community homogenisation, with a few species inhabiting isolated patches (e.g. public and private gardens and parks) embedded within the urban landscape. Promoting biodiversity in urban areas requires understanding which species traits allow species to survive the urban landscape. Objectives The objective of this study was to assess how species traits and landscape factors combine to allow species functional groups to live in the city. Methods We used butterfly count data collected by volunteers in 24 gardens of Barcelona city, during 2018 and 2019. Species were clustered in functional groups according to their traits. We applied a multinomial choice model to test for the effect of the landscape on the different functional groups. Results Three functional groups became prevalent in the city while a fourth, containing most sedentary specialist species, was filtered out. Although the observed groups had similar species richness, abundances varied depending on urban landscape characteristics. Specialist sedentary specialists and medium mobile species were all favoured by patch connectivity; while the presence of mobile generalist species was only enhanced by habitat quality. Our results indicate that butterfly communities are more diverse in highly connected gardens. Conclusions Our study highlights the need of contextualised management with actions accounting for the species functional groups, rather than a management focused on general species richness. It demonstrates that urban landscape planning must focus on improving connectivity inside the city in order to diversify the community composition.

AB  - Vegetated roofs are human-manufactured ecosystems and potentially promising conservation tools for various taxa and habitats. Focussing on arthropods, we conducted a 3 year study on newly constructed vegetated roofs with shallow substrates (up to 10 cm) and vegetation established with pre-grown mats, plug plants and seeds to describe pioneer arthropod communities on roofs and to compare them with ground level communities. We vacuum sampled arthropods from the roofs and nearby ground level sites with low, open vegetation, i.e., potential source habitats. We showed that the roofs and ground sites resembled each other for ordinal species richness but differed in community composition: with time the roofs started to resemble each other rather than their closest ground level habitats. Species richness increased with time on roofs and at ground level, but the roofs had consistently less species than the ground sites and only a few species were unique to the roofs. Also, the proportion of predators increased on roofs, while not at ground level. We conclude that vegetated roofs established with similar substrates and vegetation, filter arthropods in a way that produces novel communities that are different from those at ground level but similar to one another. The role of these insular communities in species networks and ecosystem function remains to be investigated.

AB  - Green roofs are a promising tool to return nature to cities and mitigate biodiversity loss brought about by urbanization. Yet, we lack basic information on how green roofs contribute to biodiversity and how their placement in the urban landscape affects different taxa and community composition. We studied the effects of local and landscape variables on beetle communities on green roofs. We expected that both local roof characteristics and urban landscape composition shape communities, but that their relative importance depends on species characteristics. Using pitfall traps, we collected beetles during two consecutive years from 17 green roofs in Basel, Switzerland. We evaluated the contribution of six local and six landscape variables to beetle community structure and to the responses of individual species. Communities on the roofs consisted of mobile and open dry-habitat species, with both local and landscape variables playing a role in structuring these communities. At the individual species level, local roof variables were more important than characteristics of the surrounding urban landscape. The most influential factors affecting the abundances of beetle species were vegetation, described as forb and grass cover (mainly positive), and roof age (mainly negative). Therefore, we suggest that the careful planning of green roofs with diverse vegetation is essential to increase their value as habitat for beetles. In addition, while beetle communities on green roofs can be diverse regardless of their placement in the urban landscape, the lack of wingless species indicates the need to increase the connectivity of green roofs to ground level habitats.

AB  - Context Large cities contain different sizes and distributions of green spaces in a sea of buildings and roads. This urban landscape establishes habitats for different species that migrant through or persist in cities. Objectives To describe and analyze how green spaces patterns differ in large cities by using new mapping methods. This tool helps urban planning for land use decisions. Methods Using Patch Analyst Metrics, we propose a new method to analyze the current spatial arrangement of green spaces in Mexico City and New York City, long-established urban areas, as case studies. Results The two cities differ in the number, size, and spatial distribution of green spaces. Mexico City has high numbers of large green spaces for native species habitat, but most of them are in a cluster in the south. In New York City, large spaces are distributed scattered throughout the whole territory, but New York City has much small areas than Mexico City. This spatial analysis shows areas for connectivity among existing green spaces that can improve the dispersal of many taxa of plants and animals. However, ecological planning must vary between the cities; no single generalization is appropriate. Conclusions Much data are available on the potential dispersal of species through cities, but a easily applied framework for understanding the existing habitat distribution is needed for future decisions. The results suggest mapping mechanisms can help to increase plant and animal movement patterns. However, these older cities have idiosyncratic starting points that must be the basis of future improvements.

AB  - This study calculated the ecological network index (City Biodiversity Index 2) of 85 cities in Korea using the Land Cover Map. Based on the values of the index, four types of city were studied, including Miryang (Cluster A), Anseong (Cluster B), Samcheok (Cluster Cluster), and Yongin (Cluster D). Based on the current status of land use and natural green space in urban areas, small and medium-sized cities do not show many disconnected factors and have a positive (+) effect on the ecological network index (ENI) value. In order to promote urban biodiversity, it is necessary not only to expand the green area quantitatively, but also to improve the quality, such as expanding and connecting natural green areas, and reducing linear disconnection factors.

AB  - Urban green infrastructure provides a wide variety of ecological, social, and economic benefits to urban dwellers. Understanding the dynamics of urban ecosystem services is essential for planning and managing the practice of urban green infrastructure.
   This paper aims to assess spatial distribution of urban green areas and calculate two regulating ecosystem services (carbon sequestration and runoff retention) generated by green infrastructure in Bornova, which is one of the metropolitan districts of the city of Izmir, Turkey.
   Results show that although almost 45% of the district is covered by components of the green infrastructure, they are mostly small and unevenly distributed in the current urban fabric with low connectivity. The total carbon sequestration capacity of the green infrastructure is estimated 8368.25 t year(-1) and the total rate of runoff is predicted at 3,788,651.31 m(3). It can be concluded that this finding implies that green infrastructure and ecosystem services need to be profoundly improved by adding new green spaces to the existing green infrastructure and providing linkages as well as increasing tree cover and creating retention and detention facilities.

AB  - The Karakoram Highway (KKH), a part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), is a major highway connecting northern Pakistan to China. The inventorying and analysis of landslides along KKH are challenging because of poor accessibility, vast study area, limited availability of ground-based datasets, and the complexity of landslide processes in the region. In order to preserve life, property, and infrastructure, and to enable the uninterrupted and efficient operation of the KKH, it is essential to strengthen measures for the prevention and control of geological disasters. In the present study, SBAS-InSAR (Small Baseline Subsets-Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) was used to process 150 scenes of Sentinel 1-A images in the year 2017 along the Karakoram Highway. A total of 762 landslides, including 57 complex landslides, 126 rock falls, 167 debris slides, and 412 unstable slopes, ranging in size between 0.0017 and 10.63 km(2) were identified. Moreover, this study also gains an inventory of 40 active glacier movements in this region. Landslide categorization, displacements characteristics, spatial distribution, and their relationship with various contributing factors have been successfully investigated along the entire KKH using image interpretation and frequency-area statistics. The criteria adopted for landslides categorization is presented in the study. The results showed that the 2-D ground deformation derived in Hunza valley echoes well with the general regional landslides characteristics. The spatial distribution analysis revealed that there are clumped distributions of landslides in the Gaizi, Tashkurgan, and Khunjerab in China, as well as in Hunza valley, and north of Chilas city in Pakistan. Statistical results indicated that these landslides mainly occur on south-facing slopes with a slope angle of 20 degrees-45 degrees and elevation relief of 550-2,100 m. Landslide development is also related to low vegetation cover and weathering effects in mountain gullies. Overall, our study provides scientific data support and theoretical references for prevention, control, and mitigation of geological disasters in the Karakoram region.

AB  - Although biological invasion often alters ecosystem properties and community composition at different scales, considerable uncertainty still exists regarding the underlying mechanisms that regulate the spread of alien species into new habitats. An alien invasion is generally achieved through multiple processes from multiple sources; this type of invasion often prevents us from understanding of the dispersal mechanisms. Here, we aim to disentangle the processes of alien invasion by focusing on a single migration source. We surveyed the distribution of alien and native plant species in Shiretoko National Park, located in northern Japan. We measured the coverage of each species and the environmental and spatial factors in 362 quadrats established along roadsides. We found 101 native species and 35 alien species (gamma-diversity) throughout the quadrats. The local species richness (alpha-diversity) was higher for the alien species (6.1 species) than for the native species (3.2 species). There was a significant negative correlation in alpha-diversity between native and alien species. Moreover, the alpha-diversity and distance from the nearest town (migration source) showed a negative relationship for alien assemblages while the native assemblages showed the opposite trend. These results suggest that the alien species are expanding their distribution outward from the town, resulting in a decrease in the alpha-diversity of native species in localities close to the migration source. Overall, our results emphasize that roadsides could unintentionally act as corridors for alien species, even in protected areas. Careful consideration is thus needed for utilizing these human-created habitats even though they were designed for conservation and management purposes.

AB  - As a newly established World Natural Heritage site, the conservation of rare waterbird habitats in the Yancheng coastal wetlands has attracted wide international attention. In view of the importance of this area in international biodiversity conservation and waterbird habitat conservation, the study of the current situation of rare waterbird habitat networks with spatial isolation features of great demonstration significance to improve the habitat conservation quality of the heritage site. Based on the data obtained from habitat suitability assessments of rare waterbirds, this paper used com-plex network theory, ecological stepping-stone theory and circuit models to analyze the current status and robustness of rare waterbird habitat networks in the Yancheng coastal wetlands. The results showed that the stepping stones of the red-crowned cranes and the Oriental storks were mainly distributed around important habitat areas, including aqua-culture ponds and reed marshes, with areas of 1275.68 hm(2) and 1247.74 hm(2), respectively, while the stepping stones of Saunders's gulls were mainly distributed within the Tiaozini habitat site, with an area of 1180.76 hm(2). The stability and connectivity of the habitat networks of red-crowned cranes and Oriental storks in the northern habitat area were better. At the Tiaozini habitat site, there was spatial isolation and low connectivity among the habitats and stepping stones of Saunders's gulls. In the optimal protection scenario, the stability and connectivity of the habitat network structure of red-crowned cranes and Oriental storks were the best, and the networks tended to exhibit assortativity. In the random destruction scenario, the connectivity of the habitat networks of Saunders's gulls was the lowest, and the network structure was the most fragile. Finally, the optimization and restoration patterns of habitat network based on improving the support capacity of important habitat nodes and the enhancement of the stability and connec-tivity of the stepping-stone networks were proposed.

AB  - In recent decades, the decline of biodiversity due to land-use changes in agricultural landscapes has become a central issue in ecology. Paddy management practices support animal diversity in agricultural landscapes. Using an endangered fish (the Itasenpara bitterling) inhabiting rivers connected to paddy fields as its subject, this study investigated two hypotheses: first, paddy field management affects the spatial distribution of Itasenpara bitterling in the adjacent river, and second, zooplankton and warm water supplied by paddy fields to the adjacent river are the primary factors influencing bitterling abundance. To model habitat suitability for the juvenile Itasenpara bitterling, rivers around paddy fields were examined using geographical information system tools and field survey methods in conjunction with a generalized linear model. The supply of zooplankton from paddy fields to the adjoining river positively contributed to juvenile Itasenpara bitterling abundance. This finding suggests that paddy management practices contribute to zooplankton abundance, and thus increase habitat suitability for juvenile Itasenpara bitterling.

AB  - Background Urbanization process around the world has not only changed the patterns of land use, but also fragmented the habitat, resulting in significantly biodiversity loss. Urban rivers, serve as one of the natural corridors in urban ecosystems, are of importance for urban ecosystem stability. However, few studies have been done to explore the relationship between vegetation and pollinators in urban river segments. In this study, two urban streams in the city of Chongqing were selected as the study area, riparian vegetation, butterflies and bees were investigated along all four seasons of a year to illustrate the spatial and temporal distribution patterns. Simultaneously, the ecological functions of the river corridor were analyzed. Result In this study, 109 plant species belonging to 95 genera of 39 families were recorded; the number of sampled species for butterflies and bees were 12 and 13, respectively. The temporal and spatial patterns of species diversity among vegetation, butterfly, and bee are different, but the trends of variation among them are similar between the two streams. Bees were found to be more closely correlated with native flowering plants in riparian zone, rather than with cultivated riparian vegetation. Conclusions The native riparian vegetation in urban rivers plays an important role in urban biodiversity conservation by serving as a corridor. This study provides data supporting the protection of the remaining natural patches and restoration of damaged habitats in the city. The survey has accumulated data on native riparian vegetation and pollinators in urban rivers.

AB  - Aim Mammalian carnivores are among the best studied groups in terms of evolutionary history. However, the effects of species interactions in shaping community assemblages remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that indirect interactions via ecological trait filtering play a key role in structuring carnivoran assemblages, mediate coexistence and thus should show high functional diversity (FD) in space and time at continental scales. Location The Americas. Taxon Mammalian carnivores (Mammalia: Carnivora). Methods We followed a macroecological perspective via ecological network analyses for indirect interactions and assessed the underlying FD across space and from the last interglacial to the present in the Americas. We analysed the potential distributions and six ecological traits of 88 species to establish possible mechanisms that enables species to coexist and the underlying diversity patterns. We compared the empirical results with two null models and two sensitivity analyses. Results Co-occurring carnivore species presented ecological segregation driven mainly by a size ratio (S-R) relationship, called here the body size spatial anti-clustering effect. The underlying FD patterns showed low redundancy towards the tropics and the poles during the times evaluated. However, during the last glacial maximum, shifts occurred primarily at high latitudes in North America. This shift affected the S-R relationship and therefore changed FD patterns. These local-to-continental interactions mediated by the S-R are significant from an ecological and biogeographic perspective, suggesting a robust and consistent trend in which carnivore species of similar size have a lower probability of occupying the same area unless they differentiate in other ecological trait spaces. Main conclusions The S-R relationship is potentially a primary mechanism limiting carnivore coexistence, reflecting functional filtering. The S-R tends to be conservative across different ecological trait groups and through time and space. We propose that the body-size spatial anti-clustering effect can directly measure species' coexistence and mediate FD patterns in the Americas.

TI  - Pigs in space: An agent-based model of wild boar (Sus scrofa) movement into cities
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING

KW  - AREA
AB  - Last decades saw a dramatic increase in wildlife populations within urban areas. Policymakers seek to minimize human-wildlife conflicts resulting from overabundance of species, such as wild boars (Sus scrofa). To this end, there is a need to understand the drivers governing infiltration of wildlife into cities. In this paper we study the availability and distribution of food resources in urban areas as driver of wild boar movement patterns. Based on the optimal foraging theory, we utilize an agent-based simulation model to investigate the ever-growing infiltration of wild boars into some cities. We apply the model to an artificial city that mimics the landscape of the city of Haifa. Manipulating food availability and relative resistance costs of different land-covers we demonstrate that infiltration of boars depends on population size of wild boars and on the amount and spatial distribution of attractors (e.g., food). Model outputs for likely sets of parameters demonstrate good correspondence to the reports of boar observations within the city of Haifa, Israel, where the porosity of the urban fabric and the connectivity of open space patches provide a trail network that makes food throughout the city accessible at a relatively low search-cost. Our results indicate that land cover and food patterns determine critically boars' foraging movement and infiltration into the city. The proposed modeling framework provides a tool to investigate wildlife management policies that aim at reducing people-wildlife conflicts in cities.

AB  - Theory and experiments support that plant invasions largely impact aboveground biodiversity and function. Yet, much less is known on the influence of plant invasions on the structure and function of the soil microbiome of coastal wetlands, one of the largest major reservoirs of biodiversity and carbon on Earth. We studied the continental-scale invasion of Spartina alterniflora across 2451 km of Chinese coastlines as our model-system and found that S. alterniflora invasion can largely influence the soil microbiome (across six depths from 0 to 100 cm), compared with the most common microhabitat found before invasion (mudflats, Mud). In detail, S. alterniflora invasion was not only positively associated with bacterial richness but also resulted in important biotic homogenization of bacterial communities, suggesting that plant invasion can lead to important continental scale trade-offs in the soil microbiome. We found that plant invasion changed the community composition of soil bacterial communities across the soil profile. Moreover, the bacterial communities associated with S. alterniflora invasions where less responsive to climatic changes than those in native Mud microhabitats, suggesting that these new microbial communities might become more dominant under climate change. Plant invasion also resulted in important reductions in the complexity and stability of microbial networks, decoupling the associations between microbes and carbon pools. Taken together, our results indicated that plant invasions can largely influence the microbiome of coastal wetlands at the scale of China, representing the first continental-scale example on how plant invasions can reshuffle the soil microbiome, with consequences for the myriad of functions that they support.

AB  - Loss of forest naturalness challenges the maintenance of green infrastructure (GI) for biodiversity conservation and delivery of diverse ecosystem services. Using the Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi target #11 with its quantitative and qualitative criteria as a normative model, we aim at supporting landscape planning through a pioneering assessment of the extent to which existing amounts and spatial distributions of High Conservation Value Forests (HCVFs) meet these criteria. Highly forested and committed to both intensive wood production and evidence-based conservation targets of 17-20% protected areas, Sweden was chosen as a case study. Specifically, we estimated the amount, regional representation, and functional connectivity of HCVF patches using virtual bird species, validated the results using field surveys of focal bird species, and assessed conservation target fulfilment. Finally, we linked these results to the regional distribution of forest land ownership categories, and stress that these provide different opportunities for landscape planning. Even if 31% of forest land in Sweden is officially protected, voluntarily set-aside, or not used for wood production now and in the future, we show that applying the representation and connectivity criteria of Aichi target #11 reduces this figure to an effective GI of 12%. When disaggregating the five ecoregions the effective GI was 54% for the sub-alpine forest ecoregion, which hosts EU's last intact forest landscapes, but only 3-8% in the other four ecoregions where wood production is predominant. This results in an increasing need for forest habitat and landscape restoration from north to south. The large regional variation in the opportunity for landscape planning stresses the need for a portfolio of different approaches. We stress the need to secure funding mechanisms for compensating land owners' investments in GI, and to adapt both the approaches and spatial extents of landscape planning units to land ownership structure.

AB  - This paper aims to identify and evaluate a potential ecological network including core areas and large-scale corridors in the Izmir Province and its surrounding areas, Turkey. it is one of the first studies on the connectivity for mammal species and the detection of potential ecological corridors for Turkey. Four wide-ranging species (Hyaena hyaena, Lynx lynx, Caracal caracal, and Felis chaus) have been chosen as target species. Existing Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) and surrounding lands have been evaluated based on a three criteria: (1) vegetation/habitat types, (2) carrying capacity and (3) road density using simple GIS-based models.
   The results are evaluated using the Minimum Viable Metapopulation (MVMP) standards. No KBA in the study region has a Key Population (KP) or Minimum Viable Population (MVP) with the exception of Boz Daglar. Least cost-path analysis has been applied to identify linkages between KBAs relevant for the four target species. The conclusion is that it is possible to maintain MVPs in the region when the KBAs are linked by ecological corridors. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Estimating the abundance or density of populations is fundamental to the conservation and management of species, and as landscapes become more fragmented, maintaining landscape connectivity has become one of the most important challenges for biodiversity conservation. Yet these two issues have never been formally integrated together in a model that simultaneously models abundance while accounting for connectivity of a landscape. We demonstrate an application of using capture-recapture to develop a model of animal density using a least-cost path model for individual encounter probability that accounts for non-Euclidean connectivity in a highly structured network. We utilized scat detection dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) as a means of collecting non-invasive genetic samples of American mink (Neovison vison) individuals and used spatial capture-recapture models (SCR) to gain inferences about mink population density and connectivity. Density of mink was not constant across the landscape, but rather increased with increasing distance from city, town, or village centers, and mink activity was associated with water. The SCR model allowed us to estimate the density and spatial distribution of individuals across a 388 km(2) area. The model was used to investigate patterns of space usage and to evaluate covariate effects on encounter probabilities, including differences between sexes. This study provides an application of capture-recapture models based on ecological distance, allowing us to directly estimate landscape connectivity. This approach should be widely applicable to provide simultaneous direct estimates of density, space usage, and landscape connectivity for many species.

AB  - Owing to the ability of depicting the spatial distribution of land surface temperatures (LST) and land cover, remote sensing images have been used to analyze the relationship between urban heat island (UHI) and land use/cover changes (LUCC) in recent years. As one prominent feature of LUCC in urbanization process, urban roads are extended and expanded to form complex urban thermal corridors. This study estimates the relationship by investigating urban thermal environmental impacts caused by LUCC in the buffer areas of the urban roads. Multi-temporal remote sensing images, including Landsat TM/ETM+ data from September 19, 1987, September 6, 1994 September 14, 2000 and August 12, 2005 in Xuzhou city, are employed to explore land use types and derive land surface temperatures at different period. An integrating classification method based on decision tree classifier and object-oriented method is used for improving land cover classification accuracy. By analyzing the relationship between brightness temperature and vegetation indices, e.g., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), the relationship between UHI and LUCC is estimated quantitatively. Change results and regression analysis show that total transformation rate of LUCC behaves linearly decreased with increasing distance to roads while the transformation rate from other types to building/road has a negative exponent relation with the distance to roads. Analysis to urban green space and thermal landscape indicates that brightness temperature is negatively correlated with the. NDVI but positively related with NDBI. It is concluded that urban vegetation system plays a unique role in monitoring the urban thermal environment.

AB  - Trapping was used to investigate small-mammal community composition of a cleared powerline corridor compared with that of surrounding tropical rainforest in the wet tropics of north-eastern Queensland and to determine whether movements from the rainforest across the corridor were inhibited. The dense exotic grassland of the cleared powerline corridor supported a small-mammal community composed mainly of the grassland species Melomys burtoni (73.3%) and Rattus sordidus (15.0%) with rainforest small mammals being restricted to woody-weed thickets along the rainforest-powerline corridor edge. The rainforest species Rattus sp. (80.3%), Melomys cervinipes (10.9%) and Uromys caudimaculatus (8.8%) comprised the small-mammal community of the forest interior. These rainforest species also inhabited rainforest edge habitat and regrowth rainforest connections across gullies. Movements of rainforest species across the grassland corridor were almost completely inhibited even under bait inducement, a result attributable to the substantial structural and microclimatic habitat differences within the clearing and to interspecific competition with the better-adapted species of the grassland community. Rainforest species used regrowth connections along gullies to cross the powerline corridor. Mitigation of the fragmentation effects caused by powerline grassy swathes can best be achieved by strengthening extant canopy connections in regrowth gullies, and by establishing new connections across the clearings.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Trypophloeus klimeschi Eggers (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) causes substantial mortality to Populus alba var. pyramidalis individuals in Xinjiang, China. Currently, the number of host trees killed by this bark beetle is increasing. Climate change has exacerbated this problem, causing its range to expand. Here, using Maxent, we simulated its distributions in the 2030s and 2050s under representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5. The distribution expanded the most under RCP 8.5. It is large enough to pose substantial challenges for forest managers across northern China. Our study contributes to the construction and protection of shelter forests in Northern China because we present novel evidence of the potential impacts of climate change on forestry.
   Temperature and precipitation are the two main factors constraining the current distribution of Trypophloeus klimeschi. Currently, T. klimeschi is mainly distributed in South Xinjiang, where it occurs between the southern edge of the Tianshan Mountains and northern edge of the Tarim Basin. In addition, Dunhuang in northern Gansu also provide suitable habitats for this bark beetle. Two other potential areas for this species are in or near the cities of Alaer and Korla. Under future climate scenarios, its total suitable area is projected to increase markedly over time. Among the climate scenarios, the distribution expanded the most under the maximum greenhouse gas emission scenario (representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5). Jiuquan in Gansu is projected to become a suitable area in the 2030s. Subsequently, T. klimeschi is expected to enter western Inner Mongolia along the Hexi Corridor in the 2050s. In southeastern Xinjiang, however, the suitable area in northern Ruoqiang and most areas of Korla may decrease. By the 2050s, it is large enough to pose substantial challenges for forest managers across northern China. Our findings provide information that can be used to monitor T. klimeschi populations, host health, and the impact of climate change, shedding light on the effectiveness of management responses.

AB  - The problem of how ecological mechanisms create and interact with patterns across different scales is fundamental not only for understanding ecological processes, but also for interpretations of ecological dynamics and the strategies that organisms adopt to cope with variability and cross-scale influences.
   Our objective was to determine the consistency of the role of individual habitat patches in pattern-process relationships (focusing on the potential for dispersal within a network of patches in a fragmented landscape) across a range of scales.
   Network analysis was used to assess and compare the potential connectivity and spatial distribution of highland fynbos habitat in and between protected areas of the Western Cape of South Africa. Connectivity of fynbos patches was measured using ten maximum threshold distances, ranging from five to 50 km, based on the known average dispersal distances of fynbos endemic bird species.
   Network connectivity increased predictably with scale. More interestingly, however, the relative contributions of individual protected areas to network connectivity showed strong scale dependence.
   Conservation approaches that rely on single-scale analyses of connectivity and context (e.g., based on data for a single species with a given dispersal distance) are inadequate to identify key land parcels. Landscape planning, and specifically the assessment of the value of individual areas for dispersal, must therefore be undertaken with a multi-scale approach. Developing a better understanding of scaling dependencies in fragmenting landscapes is of high importance for both ecological theory and conservation planning.

AB  - Tsuga canadensis (Eastern Hemlock) forests provide unique riparian zones that can influence adjacent streams, but increasing mortality from the invasive Adelges tsugae (Hemlock Woolly Adelgid) is eliminating this distinctive landscape component in some regions. The objective of this study was to determine if a stream section within a hemlock ravine harbored a unique benthic community as compared to other sections of the stream that could be threatened in the event of a Hemlock Woolly Adelgid outbreak. We sampled benthic algae and macroinvertebrates in an unnamed tributary of Sugar Creek within Beach City Wildlife Area, OH, in April and September 2015. The stream flows through 3 riparian habitats: beech-maple upland forest, hemlock ravine, and lowland forest dominated by Acer saccharinum (Silver Maple), A. negundo (Box Elder), and Platanus occidentalis (American Sycamore). Our results show that Chironomidae, Navicula, Caloneis, and Nitzschia were the dominant taxa across all 3 stream sections, but that benthic macroinvertebrate richness and density were significantly lower in the hemlock ravine when compared to the lowland habitat. Periphyton community metrics were not significantly affected by riparian habitat. Overall, seasonality was more influential than riparian habitat on benthic community composition; specific taxa were indicative of either the spring or summer season. Connectivity between stream sites and/or the abundance of sandstone bedrock substrate at many sample locations might account for the similarity in benthic communities across these 3 habitats.

AB  - Wetland assessment techniques have generally focused on rapid evaluations of local and site impacts; however, wetland biodiversity is often influenced both by adjacent and regional land use. Forty wetlands were studied in the Red River Valley (RRV), Southwest Prairie (SWP), and the Northern Hardwood Forest (NHF) ecoregions of Minnesota, USA, to assess the strength of association between local and landscape condition and avian community composition. We examined the relationship between bird assemblages and local and landscape factors (connectedness, isolation, road density, and site impacts). Landscape variables were calculated for three spatial scales at 500 m (79 ha), 1000 m (314 ha), and 2500 m (1963 ha). Connectedness and road density are important measures for predicting bird assemblages in both agricultural ecoregions (SWP and RRV). Connectedness and its relationship with wetland bird assemblages were most pronounced at the larger scale (2500 m), where the largest remnant patches can be discerned. In contrast, road effects on bird assemblages were most pronounced at the smallest scale (500 m). Wetland isolation corresponded to bird community patterns as well, but only in one ecoregion (SWP). In the urbanizing ecoregion (NHF), species richness was considerably lower than elsewhere but community patterns did not correspond to landscape variables. The focus of wetland conservation planning needs to shift from the site scale to the landscape scale to ensure that connection with the regional wetland pattern is accounted for, therefore, affording the best opportunity to successfully maintain wetland avian diversity.

AB  - Aiming at assessing the ecological stress of land urbanization comprehensively, three perspectives are considered and combined, i.e. the amount effect with the proportion of construction lands as the indicator, the intensity effect per the density of environmental pollutant emissions, and the location effect based on their spatial distribution in the heterogeneous landscape. The quantitative results of Southern Jiangsu case in Eastern China show the single-perspective ecological stress are spatially different; the proportion effect is higher in city propers which are more densely populated and industrialized. However, the intensity effect is more significant for units along the Yangtze river where heavy industries are gathered, while the location effect is higher in "ecologically suitable" regions. As the integration of proportion, intensity, and location effects, the comprehensive stress differs across Southern Jiangsu and are also different with the single-perspective results. Dominant stressors of each unit are spatially distinct, which benefits policy-makers in targeting their objectives as per primary influencing factors. It is concluded that the comprehensive assessment could efficiently reveal the spatial differentiation of the ecological effects of land urbanization and also the differentiated role of different factors for each unit.

AB  - Landscape heterogeneity plays a central role in shaping ecological and evolutionary processes. While species utilization of the landscape is usually viewed as constant within a year, the spatial distribution of individuals is likely to vary in time in relation to particular seasonal needs. Understanding temporal variation in landscape use and genetic connectivity has direct conservation implications. Here, we modelled the daily use of the landscape by caribou in Quebec and Labrador, Canada and tested its ability to explain the genetic relatedness among individuals. We assessed habitat selection using locations of collared individuals in migratory herds and static occurrences from sedentary groups. Connectivity models based on habitat use outperformed a baseline isolation-by-distance model in explaining genetic relatedness, suggesting that variations in landscape features such as snow, vegetation productivity and land use modulate connectivity among populations. Connectivity surfaces derived from habitat use were the best predictors of genetic relatedness. The relationship between connectivity surface and genetic relatedness varied in time and peaked during the rutting period. Landscape permeability in the period of mate searching is especially important to allow gene flow among populations. Our study highlights the importance of considering temporal variations in habitat selection for optimizing connectivity across heterogeneous landscape and counter habitat fragmentation.

AB  - Natal dispersal promotes inter-population linkage, and is key to spatial distribution of populations. Degradation of suitable landscape structures beyond the specific threshold of an individual's ability to disperse can therefore lead to disruption of functional landscape connectivity and impact metapopulation function. Because it ignores behavioral responses of individuals, structural connectivity is easier to assess than functional connectivity and is often used as a surrogate for landscape connectivity modeling. However using structural resource selection models as surrogate for modeling functional connectivity through dispersal could be erroneous. We tested how well a second-order resource selection function (RSF) models (structural connectivity), based on GPS telemetry data from resident adult leopard (Panthera pardus L.), could predict subadult habitat use during dispersal (functional connectivity). We created eight non-exclusive subsets of the subadult data based on differing definitions of dispersal to assess the predictive ability of our adult-based RSF model extrapolated over a broader landscape. Dispersing leopards used habitats in accordance with adult selection patterns, regardless of the definition of dispersal considered. We demonstrate that, for a wide-ranging apex carnivore, functional connectivity through natal dispersal corresponds to structural connectivity as modeled by a second-order RSF. Mapping of the adult-based habitat classes provides direct visualization of the potential linkages between populations, without the need to model paths between a priori starting and destination points. The use of such landscape scale RSFs may provide insight into predicting suitable dispersal habitat peninsulas in human-dominated landscapes where mitigation of human-wildlife conflict should be focused. We recommend the use of second-order RSFs for landscape conservation planning and propose a similar approach to the conservation of other wide-ranging large carnivore species where landscape-scale resource selection data already exist.

AB  - Landscape architecture with urban green space as the main research object is an evidence-based science. It is an important issue to optimize green space systems from the point of view of ecosystem services. In this paper, high-resolution (1.5 m resolution) remote sensing images are combined with data-processing software, such as ENVI, ArcGIS, and Fragstats, to evaluate ecosystem service quality and compute the landscape pattern in the Haidian District (Beijing, China), so that the relationship between the ecosystem service quality and landscape pattern can be quantitatively studied and a strategy can be provided for green space optimization in cities. The following conclusions are drawn: (1) for the evaluated quality of 14 ecosystem services in Haidian District (refer to Section Analysis of the Association of the Percentage of Patches (PLAND) Index of Forest Land and Quality of Ecosystem Service in Haidian District). Forest land is the main provider of the ecosystem service in Haidian District, while construction land only provides cultural services; (2) on the whole, the spatial distribution of the ecosystem services in Haidian District gradually decreases from the west to the east, which basically matches with the spatial distribution of the forest land. The regulating service and supporting service are matched with the distribution of the urban green space. The cultural service is closely associated with history resource points; and (3) the analysis results of the association between landscape pattern and ecosystem service quality show that the percentage of patches (PLAND) index for forest land has a significant logarithmic relationship with the regulating service and supporting service. The critical value of the PLAND index is 30. Besides the Xishan area with the most coverage of forest land, the landscape shape index (LSI) of the brushwood has a logarithmic relationship with the ecosystem service quality. The critical value of the LSI value is 50. Finally, this paper proposes an area optimization strategy of green space in Haidian District from the view of the ecosystem system service. The Xishan area is classified into the ecosystem red line to control city expansion. The regulating and supporting services can be enhanced in the north flat area by improving the patch shape index. The ecosystem service capabilities can be improved by adding the forest land in the existing green space for the southeast urban areas.

AB  - Constructing an urban ecological corridor system is a major component and critical factor of forming an effective network within an urban ecosystem. Shenzhen, as a highly urbanized area in China, is facing the dual pressures of urban development and ecological conservation. The ecological corridors in Shenzhen are being constantly eroded by urban expansion, resulting in an urgent need to carry out sensitivity evaluations and ecological land management studies. By identifying the spatial range of planned ecological corridors in Shenzhen, we develop a GIS-based ecological sensitivity evaluation model from the perspectives of soil environment, habitat conditions, geological hazards, and human disturbance. Management strategies are proposed with regard to macroscopic protection guidance and microscopic land-use control. The results show that there is little difference in the sensitivity grade of ecological corridors in Shenzhen. With regard to spatial distribution, the sensitivity level is high in the north and low in the south, with moderately sensitive corridors being the dominant type. Meanwhile, we design the land-use control program by taking into account the present management and new land demand and provide the path for implementing the withdrawal, reservation, occupation, and avoidance polices. The results of the sensitivity evaluation objectively reflect the eco-environmental condition of ecological corridors in Shenzhen. The classified and graded protection guidance and space regulatory framework proposed in this study are of significance for guiding the ecological conservation, land use, and sustainable development in urban contexts with similar issues.

AB  - Streams and rivers have essential roles in landscape connectivity; however, urban watersheds are frequently modified to drain stormwater from urban areas. To determine whether an earthen stormwater drain in an urban landscape provides fish habitat temporally, we compared the fish assemblage among three reaches of a contiguous urbanized watershed in Kanata, Ontario, Canada. Watts Creek is connected to an earthen municipal surface stormwater drain (herein Kizell Drain), before discharging into the Ottawa River. We delineated transects in three reaches of the system, in Watts, in the Drain, and below their confluence (Main) and assessed the fish community using single-pass electrofishing repeated across eight months covering all seasons. Fish community composition was compared among reaches using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and permutated multivariate analyses of variance (perMANOVA). Sign association tests identified indicator species driving assemblage patterns among reaches. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to assess the influence of physical characteristics of the transects on fish assemblage structure. Finally, fish assemblage measures were separated by month and temporal comparisons of fish assemblage were performed with NMDS and perMANOVA. Over the year, fish assemblages were distinct among the three reaches, and appear to be significantly influenced by temperature, undercut banks, and riparian vegetation type. Biotic homogenization in the Drain can be attributed to degraded physical features associated with channel modification in stormwater drains. Despite management and jurisdictional differences between streams and stormwater drains, evidence that earthen stormwater drains can maintain fish assemblages temporally demonstrates their biological potential and need to be considered as interconnected fish habitat elements within the overall watershed.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation requires modeling tools capable of predicting the presence or absence (i.e., occurrence-state) of species in habitat patches. Local habitat characteristics of a patch (lh), the cost of traversing the landscape matrix between patches (weighted connectivity [wc]), and the position of the patch in the habitat network topology (nt) all influence occurrence-state. Existing models are data demanding or consider only local habitat characteristics. We address these shortcomings and present a network-based modeling approach, which aims to predict species occurrence-state in habitat patches using readily available presence-only records. For the tree frog Hyla arborea in the Swiss Plateau, we delineated habitat network nodes from an ensemble habitat suitability model and used different cost surfaces to generate the edges of three networks: one limited only by dispersal distance (Uniform), another incorporating traffic, and a third based on inverse habitat suitability. For each network, we calculated explanatory variables representing the three categories (lh, wc, and nt). The response variable, occurrence-state, was parametrized by a sampling intensity procedure assessing observations of comparable species over a threshold of patch visits. The explanatory variables from the three networks and an additional non-topological model were related to the response variable with boosted regression trees. The habitat network models had a similar fit; they all outperformed the non-topological model. Habitat suitability index (lh) was the most important predictor in all networks, followed by third-order neighborhood (nt). Patch size (lh) was unimportant in all three networks. We found that topological variables of habitat networks are relevant for the prediction of species occurrence-state, a step-forward from models considering only local habitat characteristics. For any habitat patch, occurrence-state is most prominently influenced by its habitat suitability and then by the number of patches in a wide neighborhood. Our approach is generic and can be applied to multiple species in different habitats.

AB  - As a form of green infrastructure, green roofs can enhance urban biodiversity by providing complex vegetation structures, supplying increased foraging and roosting opportunities for animals and increasing habitat connectivity. Although it is widely believed that green roofs can promote urban biodiversity, this idea has not been widely studied on an empirical scale. Therefore, a systematic understanding of the relationship between green roofs and biodiversity from different perspectives is still lacking. Here we provide a systematic review of the empirical literature on the relationship between green roofs and biodiversity. The results suggest that green roofs benefit urban biodiversity to some extent but cannot replace quondam natural habitats or complex artificial greening environments. Additionally, the studies reviewed here focused primarily on the diversity of plants or arthropods and were conducted almost exclusively in the United States and the United Kingdom. Moreover, most studies investigating the factors of green roofs affecting biodiversity focused on roof area, height, age, substrate depth, and plant community. To improve our understanding of the relationship between green roofs and urban biodiversity, more extensive research, particularly in developing countries, as well as more in-depth studies of a greater number of species and taxa, including chordates, mollusks and microbes, from different perspectives (e.g. at the genetic level) and other potential pathways are needed. In the future, the density, distribution pattern, distance and location relationship between different green roofs should be considered in an integrated manner. In order to more effectively support urban biodiversity, green roofs should be used in conjunction with other urban green spaces.

AB  - Green infrastructure is one of the key components that provides critical ecosystems services in urban areas, such as regulating services (temperature regulation, noise reduction, air purification), and cultural services (recreation, aesthetic benefits), but due to rapid urbanization, many environmental impacts associated with the decline of green space have emerged and are rarely been evaluated integrally and promptly. The Chinese government is building a new city as the sub-center of the capital in Tongzhou District, Beijing, China. A series of policies have been implemented to increase the size of green urban areas. To support this land-use decision-making process and achieve a sustainable development strategy, accurate assessments of green space are required. In the current study, using land-use data and environmental parameters, we assessed the urban green space in the case study area. The bio-energy and its fluxes, landscape connectivity, as well as related ecosystem services were estimated using a novel approach, the PANDORA model. These results show that (1) in the highly urbanized area, green space is decreasing in reaction to urbanization, and landscape fragmentation is ubiquitous; (2) the river ecology network is a critical part for ecosystem services and landscape connectivity; and (3) the alternative non-green patches to be changed to urban, urban patches which can improve landscape quality the most by being changed to green, and conservation priority patches for biodiversity purposes of urban green were explicitly identified. Conclusively, our results depict the spatial distribution, fluxes, and evolution of bio-energy, as well as the conservation prioritization of green space. Our methods can be applied by urban planners and ecologists, which can help decision-makers achieve a sustainable development strategy in these rapidly urbanizing areas worldwide.

AB  - Aim Cities worldwide are characterized by unique human stressors that filter species based on their traits, potentially leading to biodiversity loss. The knowledge of which species are filtered and at which scale is important to gain a more mechanistic understanding of urban community assembly and to develop strategies to manage human impact on urban ecosystems. We investigate the ecological mechanisms shaping urban community assembly, taking into account changes across scales, taxa and urban green space types. Location City of Zurich, Switzerland. Taxon Carabid beetles and wild bees. Methods We use a large species occurrence and trait dataset with a high spatial resolution to assess the filtering effect of a medium-sized city on a regional pool of potential colonists. We then assess the filtering from the urban pool to five widely distributed types of urban green spaces. Results We found that our model city selects for functionally similar but taxonomically diverse bee and carabid beetle species from the regional species pool. Within the city, community assembly processes vary among green space types and taxa resulting in important changes in community taxonomic and functional composition. Main conclusions Our findings suggest that urban community assembly is a multi-scale process dominated by the strong environmental filtering from a regional to an urban species pool. This leads to the selection of species pre-adapted to urban conditions. Spatial habitat heterogeneity within and among UGS types can maintain an important taxonomic diversity within cities. However, increasing urban functional diversity would require stronger management efforts that consider regional ecological processes.

AB  - Ecological networks can provide insight into how biodiversity loss and changes in species interactions impact the delivery of ecosystem services. In agroecosystems that vary in management practices, quantifying changes in ecological network structure across gradients of local and landscape composition can inform both the ecology and function of productive agroecosystems. In this study, we examined natural-enemy-herbivore co-occurrence networks associated withBrassica oleracea(cole crops), a common crop in urban agricultural systems. Specifically, we investigated how local management characteristics of urban community gardens and the landscape composition around them affect (1) the abundance ofB. oleraceaherbivores and their natural enemies, (2) the natural-enemy : herbivore ratio, and (3) natural-enemy-herbivore co-occurrence network metrics. We sampled herbivores and natural enemies inB. oleraceaplants in 24 vegetable gardens in the California, USA central coast region. We also collected information on garden characteristics and land-use cover of the surrounding landscape (2 km radius). We found that increased floral richness andB. oleraceaabundance were associated with increased parasitoid abundance, non-aphid herbivore abundance, and increased network vulnerability; increased vegetation complexity suppressed parasitoid abundance, but still boosted network vulnerability. High agricultural land-use cover in the landscape surrounding urban gardens was associated with lower predator, parasitoid, and non-aphid herbivore abundance, lower natural-enemy : herbivore ratios, lower interaction richness, and higher trophic complementarity. While we did not directly measure pest control, higher interaction richness, higher vulnerability, and lower trophic complementarity are associated with higher pest control services in other agroecosystems. Thus, if gardens function similarly to other agroecosystems, our results indicate that increasing vegetation complexity, including trees, shrubs, and plant richness, especially within gardens located in intensively farmed landscapes, could potentially enhance the biodiversity and abundance of natural enemies, supporting ecological networks associated with higher pest control services.

AB  - The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area urban agglomeration is an urban agglomeration with some of the most intensive urbanization since 1980s. A large amount of cultivated land, forest land, water bodies and other land types in the region has been occupied by construction land, resulting in fragmented ecological landscapes and biodiversity in the region and causing many other ecological problems. Based on this, this paper takes the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area as a case study, constructs an ecological network of the dispersion scale of five species from 1990 to 2020 based on a morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) method, identifies the ecological groups in the network and uses the core node-based community evolution path tracking algorithm to analyze the ecological groups in order to explore the changes of ecological network connectivity at different scales in the region and to reveal the overall and local characteristics and changes of the migratory space of terrestrial mammals with different dispersion capabilities. The research results show that: (1) From 1990 to 2020, the area of construction land in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area increased sharply, with good connectivity in the northwest, southwest and eastern regions and poor connectivity in the central region. (2) There are obvious differences between the overall and local changes in the connectivity trends of multi-scale regional ecological networks. On the whole, the overall ecological connectivity of the ecological network at each scale showed a gradual upward trend, and the overall connectivity index IIC and the possible connectivity index PC gradually increased with the increase of the maximum dispersal distance of species. From the perspective of local patches, the larger the species dispersion scale, the larger the value of the revised betweenness centrality index and the patch possible connectivity index. (3) The distribution of ecological groups at different species dispersion scales is different, and the smaller the dispersal scale of the species, the greater the distribution of ecological groups. Small-scale species are limited by the maximum dispersal distance, and the range of their ecological groups is generally small. Small-scale (3 km), mesoscale (10 km) and large-scale (30 km) core nodes of ecological groups show a gradual increase trend, and the overall connectivity of ecological groups has improved. However, the core nodes of the extra-large-scale (60 km) and ultra-large-scale (100 km) ecological groups show a trend of decreasing fluctuations, and the overall connectivity within the ecological group has declined. This study is helpful to clarify the structural characteristics of regional ecological space and provide a theoretical basis for regional ecological planning.

AB  - Community composition in a given landscape is a complex product of the constituent species' niche requirements, geographic connectivity, environmental properties, species interactions and drift. In this study, we examined niche use of 16 cladoceran species in 81 zooplankton communities that inhabit environmentally variable sites along a strong urbanization gradient. We tested to what extent niche shifts occurred along the urbanization gradient. We also quantified to what extent niche overlap can explain co-occurrence patterns and tested whether alternative processes such as dispersal limitation or environmental heterogeneity impact co-occurrence patterns. Niche use in the study region was size-mediated, with larger species preferring nutrient-rich environments while smaller species were more specialized on distinct niche axes. Our analyses also revealed that mainly generalist species were able to establish in urban sites. While the average niche position for most species was conserved from rural to urban sites, the niches of those species occurring in both rural and urban areas remain partly unfilled in the urban populations. We observed that a relatively small proportion (13%) of species pairs co-occurred more or less often than expected by chance, but also that niche overlap was the only predictor that was strongly and significantly associated with co-occurrence scores in our study. While most of these species pairs showed evidence for a role of environmental filtering, a few common, generalist species pairs displayed segregated co-occurrence patterns and high niche overlap, suggesting a role of limiting similarity relationships as well. Our study highlights the damaging effects on biodiversity of urbanization through biotic homogenization benefitting generalist species, as well as the difficulty species may face in occupying available niche space in urbanized habitats.

AB  - Alongside modernity, the human activity has been a key factor in global environmental risks, with worldwide anthropic modification being the cause of the emergence of diseases for wild and livestock animals, and even humans. In special, the increase in the spatial distribution and in the incidence of some emerging infectious diseases (EID) are directly associated to deforestation and global climate changes. Moreover, the arise of new EID agents, such as the SARS-COV-2 have been reported for the last 30 years. On the other hand, biodiversity has been shown to be a key indicator for ecosystem health, and to pose a role to increase the promotion of human public health. In neotropical regions, and in special, in Brazil, several infectious diseases have been demonstrated to be directly affected for the biodiversity loss, such as malaria, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, yellow fever, urban arboviruses, spotted fever, amongst other. To better understand the ecosystem capacity of regulation of infectious diseases, FAPESP BIOTA program have supported researchers and research projects to increase knowledge about Brazilian biodiversity and the ecosystems, such as diversity of bird bioagents, venomous animals biodiversity, diversity of mosquitos species in forest patches inside urban areas, propagation of the yellow fever virus over fragmented forest territories, loss of ecological corridors and occurrence of spotted fever and malaria, amongst others. It is noteworthy that FAPESP BIOTA is a successful program and must be expanded as an important tool for present and future public health promotion.

AB  - Ongoing, rapid urban growth accompanied by habitat fragmentation and loss challenges biodiversity conservation and leads to decreases in ecosystem services. Application of the concept of ecological networks in the preservation and restoration of connections among isolated patches of natural areas is a powerful conservation strategy. However, previous approaches often failed to objectively consider the impacts of complex 3-D city environments on ecological niches. We used airborne lidar-derived information on the 3-D structure of the built environment and vegetation and detailed land use and cover data to characterize habitat quality, niche diversity, and human disturbance and to predict habitat connectivity among 38 identified habitat core areas (HCAs) in Nanjing, China. We used circuit theory and Linkage Mapper to create a landscape resistance layer, simulate habitat connectivity, and identify and prioritize important corridors. We mapped 64 links by using current flow centrality to evaluate each HCA's contribution and the links that facilitate intact connectivity. Values were highest for HCA links located in the west, south, and northeast of the study area, where natural forests with complex 3-D structures predominate. Two smaller HCA areas had high centrality scores relative to their extents, which means they could act as important stepping stones in connectivity planning. The mapped pinch-point regions had narrow and fragile links among the HCAs, suggesting they require special protection. The barriers with the highest impact scores were mainly located at the HCA connections to Purple Mountain and, based on these high scores, are more likely to indicate important locations that can be restored to improve potential connections. Our novel framework allowed us to sufficiently convey spatially explicit information to identify targets for habitat restoration and potential pathways for species movement and dispersal. Such information is critical for assessing existing or potential habitats and corridors and developing strategic plans to balance habitat conservation and other land uses based on scientifically informed connectivity planning and implementation.

AB  - Within urbanized areas, the importance of greenspaces for wildlife has been widely investigated for some animal groups, but reptiles have generally been neglected. To assess the importance of the amount, spatial distribution, and configuration of greenspaces (comprised of terrestrial and aquatic areas), we examined semi-aquatic turtle species richness in urbanized areas. In this study, we sampled turtles from 2010 to 2011 at 20 ponds, including farm (rural) ponds, ponds in urbanized environments, and golf course ponds. We used a hierarchical Bayesian species-richness model to estimate species richness and species-specific occupancy responses to three pond types (rural, golf, or urban) and four landscape measurements of greenspace (i.e., Euclidean nearest neighbor, interspersion juxtaposition, percent of landscape, and connectance), generated in FRAGSTATS. We found that probability of occupancy of four species, Kinosternon subrubrum, Trachemys scripta, Chelydra serpentina, and Pseudemys concinna increased substantially with an increase in connectance of greenspace within 500 m of each pond. When the model examining the configuration of greenspaces was analyzed, estimated species richness was greater at golf ponds as compared to either rural or urban ponds, and richness increased with increasing connectivity of greenspaces. Our results indicate that in golf course ponds can potentially support a greater diversity of semi-aquatic turtle species than rural or urban ponds and thus may be considered superior habitat in suburban environments. In addition, we suggest that maintaining connectivity of greenspaces in suburban areas is important for semi-aquatic turtles and should be considered in urban planning. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Urbanization causes fragmentation creating "islands" of natural habitat. The resulting fragmented landscapes represent a challenge for migratory and resident species because of decreased connectivity among fragments. We examined the effects of urbanization on avifauna communities in remnant and restored parks in the greater St. Louis area (St. Louis), Missouri and Illinois, USA. St. Louis is located along the Mississippi flyway, a significant North American migratory bird route, and ranks second among the most sprawl-threatened large cities. We compiled bird assemblages for 20 parks and used multiple linear regressions and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) to analyze seven potential predictors of species richness for breeding, migratory and wintering species: area, habitat diversity, external development within 1 km and 5 km buffers, internal developed areas, road length, and presence of water bodies. The best predictors of resident bird (i.e., breeding and wintering) species richness was park area and external developed area within 5 km, a surrogate for isolation. We suspect that the high species richness in parks in heavily urbanized areas is explained by the parks' relatively large size and the funneling of species to two large parks within the most urbanized areas of St. Louis. For migratory species, the best predictors were habitat diversity and developed area within the park. As development continues to transform natural habitat along important avian migratory flyways, urban planning that includes large, diverse natural areas within urbanized landscapes is key to conserving local and migratory avifauna diversity.

AB  - Linear green infrastructures along rivers and canals serve different functions: Green corridors, or ecological network, maintain biological diversity, improve water quality, and provide areas for fauna and flora to grow and thrive. Greenways connect people with landscape resources and serve as recreational areas that are easy to use and accessible to the greatest number of potential human users. Both ecological networks and greenways are linear structures crossing the landscape, both perform a connecting function in that they are elements created for migration and movement (in one case of flora and fauna and in the other of humans), and both generally contain vegetation. Greenways can be divided into three major categories: ecological greenways, recreational greenways, and greenways with historical/cultural value. When an ecological greenway is planned and designed, human-wildlife conflicts must be minimised.

AB  - Ecological network theory predicts that in mutualistic systems specialists tend to interact with a subset of species with which generalists interact (i.e. nestedness). Approaching plant-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) association using network analyses will allow the generality of this pattern to be expanded to the ubiquitous plant-AMF mutualism.
   Based on certain plant-AMF specificity recently suggested, networks are expected to be nested as a result of their mutualistic nature, and modular, with certain species interacting more tightly than others. Network analyses were used to test for nestedness and modularity and to compare the different contribution of plant and AMF to the overall nestedness.
   Plant-AMF networks share general network properties with other mutualisms. Plant species with few AMFs in their roots tend to associate with those AMFs recorded in most plant species. AMFs present in a few plant species occur in plant species sheltering most AMF (i.e. nestedness). This plant-AMF network presents weakly interlinked subsets of species, strongly connected internally (i.e. modularity). Both plants and AMF show a nested structure, although AMFs have lower nestedness than plants.
   The plant-AMF interaction pattern is interpreted in the context of how plant-AMF associations can be underlying mechanisms shaping plant community assemblages.

AB  - Watershed urbanization leads to chemical and thermal pollution of urban streams and significant declines in aquatic biodiversity. Most investigators have focused on variation in total watershed impervious surface cover (ISC) as the primary driver of urban stream degradation. We asked instead whether the degree of connectivity between ISC and urban stream channels alters its effect. We compared 7 streams in the Raleigh-Durham metropolitan area of the southeastern USA that drained watersheds with similar amounts of pavement (ISC = 7-16% of watershed area) but spanning a wide range of hydrologic connectivity between these pavements and their receiving streams via both subsurface (pipe density range: 1.1-6.9 km/km(2)) and surface (road density range: 5.8-10.7 km/ km(2) ) flowpaths. Despite draining watersheds with similarly low levels of development, these 7 streams exhibited remarkable variability in their hydrologic and thermal regimes and varied in their macroinvertebrate diversity from a low of only 11 taxa to a high of 22. Both macroinvertebrate community composition and the tissue concentrations of Cu, Pb, and Zn in 3 stream invertebrate taxa (Cambaridae, Tipulidae, and Hydropsychidae) found across all sites were correlated with watershed hydrologic connectivity. These results suggest that the connectivity of ISC may drive considerable variation in the magnitude of ecosystem degradation associated with the same level of watershed development, with less connected or disconnected impervious surfaces having proportionally lower negative effects on aquatic organisms.

AB  - The Earth's freshwater ecosystems are currently under threat, particularly in developing countries. In Mexico, intensive land use and inadequate monitoring policies have resulted in the severe degradation of the country's freshwater ecosystems. This study assesses how the macroinvertebrate communities in the Pesqueria River, located in Northeastern Mexico, are affected by riparian land use, in order to determine their potential use as bioindicators to evaluate the macroinvertebrate integrity of the Pesqueria River. First, we characterized the land use cover in the riparian channel. Second, we sampled 16 sites for benthic macroinvertebrates along the main channel during the wet and dry seasons. Third, we evaluated the influence of the riparian channel land use on the macroinvertebrate community using 42 different biological metrics. The land use characterization depicted a riparian channel mainly influenced by agricultural and urban land use. Eighty-one invertebrate taxa were identified during the study. Permutational analysis of the variance analysis confirmed significant differences across the different land use classes and the macroinvertebrate community composition while no differences were found between seasons. The indicator species analysis revealed 31 representative taxa for natural land use, 1 for urban, and 4 for agricultural land use. Our modelling analysis showed that 28 of the 42 biological metrics tested responded significantly to land use disturbances, confirming the impact of land use changes on the Pesqueria River's macroinvertebrate communities and suggesting that these metrics may have a use as bioindicators. Finally, this study may provide significant biological information for further studies in similar conditions.

AB  - Non-native plant species can provide native generalist insects, including pests, with novel food and habitats. It is hypothesized that local and landscape-level abundances of non-native plants can affect the population size of generalist insects, although generalists are assumed to be less sensitive to habitat connectivity than specialists. In a heterogeneous landscape in Japan, the relationship between the density of a native pest of rice (Stenotus rubrovittatus (Matsumura) (Heteroptera: Miridae)) and the abundance of Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam. (Poales: Poaceae)), a non-native meadow grass known to facilitate S. rubrovittatus, was analyzed. Statistical analyses of data on bug density, vegetation, and the spatial distribution of fallow fields and meadows dominated by Italian ryegrass, obtained by field surveys, demonstrated that local and landscape-level abundances of Italian ryegrass (the unmowed meadow areas within a few hundred meters of a sampling plot) positively affected bug density before its immigration into rice fields. Our findings suggest that a generalist herbivorous insect that prefers non-native plants responds to spatial availability and connectivity of plant species patches at the metapopulation level. Fragmentation by selective mowing that decreases the total area of source populations and increases the isolation among them would be an effective and environmentally-friendly pest management method.

AB  - Urbanisation is a leading process on the Globe causing a massive loss of natural habitats. In parallel variety of habitats were created in urban environments, which may also support species diversity. Our aim was to identify urban green areas and their connections with the Regional Ecological Network surrounding the city of Debrecen (East-Hungary), and to explore the biodiversity potential of the network of these parks. We found that whilst industrial areas, airport and mixed land covered a relatively large area, parks and other functional green spaces had a relatively small extent. However the green space system of the city is well connected to the Regional Ecological Network. We also surveyed the functional and potential green spaces in the city and in the studied patches of the Regional Ecological Network in and around the city. We found that 65% of the functional green spaces are potentially connected thus there is a possibility for species typical to semi-natural open habitats to disperse between the green spaces of the city. Based on the survey of the spontaneous flora and planted ornamentals we found that the ratio of native species was high in the studied urban parks. We found that native species were the most typical (>50%) in the spontaneous flora of the studied urban parks, although the ratio of archaeophytes and neophytes were also high. Among ornamental plants, both the proportion of native species and neophytes were considerable in each park, and the proportion of archaeophytes was low. Our results suggest that the studied urban habitats have some biodiversity conservation potential; they mostly harbour species which can cope with the local environmental conditions of the city parks, such as increased temperature, drought and nutrient enrichment.

AB  - Because of their scarcity, protected areas alone cannot maintain biodiversity. Therefore, it is necessary to create conditions appropriate for plants and wildlife in managed landscapes. We compared the effects of different intensities of forest management on functional responses of vascular understory plants using the fourth-corner method. We analysed functional community composition along a management gradient that spanned semi-natural forests to extensively managed forests (naturally regenerated cuts) to intensively managed forests (planted forests) in Canada. Results showed trait filtering along the gradient of forest management intensity. In natural and extensively managed forests, where forest retention was high in time and space, persistence traits (e. g. perennial geophytes or chamaephytes, non-leafy stem foliage structure) were maintained. At the opposite end of the gradient, in intensively managed plantations where forest retention elements (e. g. amount of dead wood) were reduced, trait filtering led to species associated with colonization, such as tall species with limited lateral extension. These results suggest that intensive forestry conducted over a large extent may change the functional composition of understory plants.

AB  - Territorial ecological networks (in US and some other countries known as greenways) are coherent assemblages of areas representing the natural and semi-natural landscape elements that need to be conserved, managed or, where appropriate, enriched or restored in order to ensure the favourable conservation status of the ecosystems, habitats, species and landscapes across their traditional range. An ecologically compensating areas network is a hierarchical system with the following levels: (1) core areas, (2) buffer zones of core areas, (3) corridors and stepping stones, and (4) nature development and/or restoration areas that support resources, habitats and species. Rivers form natural ecological networks and riparian buffer zones of rivers are typical elements of ecological networks. We studied the distribution of Clouded Apollo (Parnassius mnemosyne) and its habitat requirements in Estonia. Seventy-eight percent of all Clouded Apollo observations were recorded in riparian meadows along the banks of rivers with riparian strips consisting of bushes and trees. Detailed study showed that the butterfly is in most cases associated with meadows with a riparian strip of alder. This is the habitat of the food plant (fumeworth-Corydalis solida) of the larvae, the feeding and mating place of adults, and the migration and hiding site for the Clouded Apollo. The population area and number of individuals have been increasing during the last years, and a new growing South-Estonian sub-population of Clouded Apollo has also been discovered in Estonia.

AB  - Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) pose a serious socio-economic and traffic safety issue. We investigated factors affecting the location and number of WVC on the expressway "Tri-City Bypass" in a suburban area in N Poland. We analysed WVC with large-sized (LSM; ungulates; 54% of roadkills) and small-sized mammals (SSM; mainly carnivores; 46% of roadkills) and both groups combined (AM). We identified WVC hotspots and analysed factors affecting their spatial distribution with Poisson regression based on four sets of landscape and road-related features (area, patchiness, presence and other features). The most frequent mammal victims of WVCs were wild boar Sus scrofa (31%), roe deer Capreolus capreolus (21%) and European badger Meles meles (13%), among LSM, and red fox Vulpes vulpes (27%) among SSM. In general, our results indicated that most WVCs occurred in areas with a higher number of forest patches and a higher total length of forest edge (AM, LSM), in curvy sections of the road (LSM). The number of WVCs was lower in locations covered by urbanized areas and grassland (LSM), in the sections with fences, exits and overpasses (LSM, AM). The road sections where there is a higher risk of severe collisions (involving large species) are situated in areas where the Tri-City Bypass bisects a highly forested area, which serve as movement corridors for LSM between fragmented forest complexes. We conclude that the number of WVCs can be reduced by preventing animals from accessing the road and ensuring a safe road crossing. This could be achieved by extending fencing and retrofitting some existing underpasses.

AB  - The use of biodiversity surrogates has been discussed in the context of designing habitat linkages to support the migration of species affected by climate change. Topography has been proposed as a useful surrogate in the coarse-filter approach, as the hydrological process caused by topography such as erosion and accumulation is the basis of ecological processes. However, some studies that have designed topographic linkages as habitat linkages, so far have focused much on the shape of the topography (morphometric topographic classification) with little emphasis on the hydrological processes (generic topographic classification) to find such topographic linkages. We aimed to understand whether generic classification was valid for designing these linkages. First, we evaluated whether topographic classification is more appropriate for describing actual (coniferous and deciduous) and potential (mammals and amphibians) habitat distributions. Second, we analyzed the difference in the linkages between the morphometric and generic topographic classifications. The results showed that the generic classification represented the actual distribution of the trees, but neither the morphometric nor the generic classification could represent the potential animal distributions adequately. Our study demonstrated that the topographic classes, according to the generic classification, were arranged successively according to the flow of water, nutrients, and sediment; therefore, it would be advantageous to secure linkages with a width of 1 km or more. In addition, the edge effect would be smaller than with the morphometric classification. Accordingly, we suggest that topographic characteristics, based on the hydrological process, are required to design topographic linkages for climate change.

AB  - Land use change and invasive species are two of the leading causes of native biodiversity loss, yet our understanding of how these interact in urban centers is limited. In South Florida (USA), urbanization and increased anthropogenic pressure has led to massive land conversion and species introductions. South Florida has the largest number of established non-native reptile and amphibian species in the world, while detection of many native species has decreased. Native species may be adapted to the unique and rare habitats of South Florida such as the pine rocklands, which have been reduced to 2% of their original extent. We conducted surveys for reptiles and amphibians in 15 pairs of native/non-native parks to examine the interaction between habitat modification and herpetofaunal invasion. Less than 10% of the individuals recorded were native, and we found no difference in the relative abundance or richness of native species between native and non-native parks. Community analyses indicate that only 9% of the total variance in herpetofaunal community composition is between native and non-native parks, and that even this difference is driven by non-native species. The brahminy blind snake (Ramphotyphlops braminus), the most widely introduced snake species in the world, is the best indicator of native habitat patches, and two invasive lizards from the Caribbean (Anolis sagrei and A. equestris) are the best indicators of non-native habitat. These results demonstrate that non-native reptiles and amphibians dominate both non-native and native habitat patches in Miami-Dade County.

AB  - Urban wetlands often have prolonged hydroperiods relative to non-urban ones, so they may play an outsized, positive role for wildlife. Ecological studies of urban wetlands have typically focused on large metropolitan areas, but non-traditional urbanizing areas such as the towns of the Great Plains of North America are projected to experience land-use and climate changes that will alter connectivity among the freshwater wetlands along a continental-scale migratory wildlife corridor. We used seven graph theory metrics to quantify connectivity among 89,798 of these wetlands under landscape-change forecasts from two models built for three climate change and development scenarios, projected to the year 2050. We compared outcomes from models that differed in focal variable (impervious surface or developed land use). Overall, models with impervious surface projections resulted in the most wetlands affected, whereas models featuring developed land use projections resulted in the largest spatial distribution of effect. There were differences in how many and which wetlands were forecast to become urbanized by model and scenario, resulting in different wetland network topologies and differences in the connectivity roles of individual wetlands. A consensus network was therefore developed based on the wetlands that were projected to increase in impervious surface and exist within developed land use by 2050. These 126 wetlands can be prioritized for urban ecological studies or management because they are highly likely to be affected regardless of model or scenario. Lastly, our study highlights the utility of considering a range of developmental futures when planning urban wetland management in non-traditional urbanizing areas.

AB  - Throughout eastern Australia, fragmentation and modification of eucalypt woodlands are causing declines in populations of woodland-dependent small passerines. Although agriculture is a major factor in these land use changes, development of peri-urban areas is also driving the simplification of habitat structure through removal of both native and weedy understorey species and the subdivision of remnant habitat. This study investigated the influence of habitat modification and fragmentation on birds in an urbanizing area of south east Queensland, Australia. The influence of spatial factors, such as surrounding vegetation cover, was considered alongside that of site-level habitat factors (vegetation structure) including interspecific competition from the noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala). Spatial factors did not influence the abundance and species richness of small passerines, a group of conservation concern. However, site-level factors, specifically shrub density and interspecific competition from the noisy miner, had a substantial influence on small passerine species richness and abundance. The density of shrubs (which consisted mainly of the introduced weed Lantana camara) had a strong positive relationship with small passerines while the abundance of noisy miners had a strong negative influence. Consequently, protection of vegetation with an intact shrub layer in this developing area is essential for many small birds of conservation significance. Removal of weedy understorey plants should be accompanied by replacement with native shrubs. The results of the study emphasize that factors other than the spatial distribution of vegetation in the landscape need to be considered in order to develop appropriate conservation strategies.

AB  - The design of conservation plans for the improvement of habitats of threatened species constitutes one of the most plausible possibilities of intervention in the structure and composition of the landscape of a large territory. In this work we focus on the Iberian lynx in order to establish potential ecological corridors using ecoinformatic tools from the GIS environment to improve connectivity between the existing natural spaces within the scope of its historical distribution. We processed 669 records of the presence of the lynx and six predictor variables linked to the habitat of the species. With this, corridors have been generated between natural areas. The determination of possible bottlenecks or dangerous areas (e.g., hitches on highways) allows for focusing efforts on their conservation. This type of approach seeks to improve efficiency in the design of measures aimed at expanding the territory's capacity to host its populations, improving both its viability and that of all the other species that are linked to it. The proposals for action on the specific areas defined by the models elaborated in this work would imply interventions on the land uses and existing vegetation types in order to improve connectivity throughout the territory and increase the resilience of its ecosystems.

AB  - In this study we investigate the relationships of emergy storage or flow to biodiversity using three different models a dynamic simulation model, a static scenario model, and a modified ecological network model. These models attempt to explain how disturbance regime, latitude, and trophic complexity are related to observed patterns of renewable emergy flows and storages and biodiversity. A prior hypothesis, which this work seeks to examine, suggests that as renewable emergy flow increases biodiversity will increase. In this regard, we simulate how H.T. Odum's original CLIMAX model, which tracks forest biomass and diversity over 100 years of succession, responds to a periodic disturbance. The static scenario model compares emergy flow, storage and diversity in five forest eco-regions along the east coast of the United States. An emergy flow matrix ecological network model was used to simulate biodiversity in a mature forest ecosystem and in a typical suburban forest system to investigate how the complexity of a forest system will affect emergy throughput. Comparisons were made for the Shannon diversity index and transformity at the individual trophic level. These comparisons seek to further our understanding of the relationship of emergy and biodiversity and to validate the use of renewable emergy flow to explain ecological phenomena (e.g., biodiversity increasing as latitude decreases, biodiversity increasing through the stages of forest succession).

AB  - Obtaining accurate tree cover maps within cities is a first step toward managing for equitable access to their ecosystem services. For example, by removing air pollutants trees contribute to fewer health impacts, and tree cover expansion could extend these benefits by targeting the most polluted areas and vulnerable populations. To support strategic tree expansion, this research created urban tree cover maps using the 2017 NASA MOD44B satellite 250m pixel product for 35 megacities, areas with large levels of pollution and vulnerable populations. Estimates of tree cover from photo-interpretation (PI) were used to characterize map error, city-wide, and from low to high tree cover, using 21 bins from 0 to 100% tree cover. Map accuracy was highest when MOD44B percent tree cover was combined with its tree cover standard deviation product, with average difference of 1.8% compared with PI estimates of 19.9% city-wide tree cover. MOD44B estimates of tree cover spatial patterns had strong explanatory value. Themaps explained the PI estimates of low to high tree cover at 5% tree cover intervals with an R-2 = 0.97. The Getis Ord Gi* statistic determined a non-random spatial distribution of tree cover within the megacities, with significant clustering into hot spots of relatively high tree cover and cold spots of relatively low tree cover. Tree cover hot spots were most often furthest from downtown, at the rural-urban interface or within higher elevation terrain. Tree cover cold spots were most often in areas of concentrated development and along traffic corridors known for high levels of particulate matter and other air pollutants that could be reduced by trees. Given small increases in exposure to particulate matter are associated with significant increases in death rates from viruses, and that climate change and associated heat waves are forecast to exacerbate health risks to air pollution, we need to improve global urban tree cover. These map products can be used to expand tree cover that strategically contributes to pollutant abatement, human well-being, and sustainable cities.

AB  - In this study, we propose a new method for planning ecological networks in Gangdong-gu, Seoul, Korea. The basic idea of this method is that, in urban areas where the price of land is high, it is most cost-effective to protect linear green areas that act as ecological corridors for potential movement paths (PMPs) of wild animals. PMPs were identified by a path-finding algorithm (PFA) that selected the optimum routes with minimum travel costs between pairs of locations where individuals of the indicator species-great tits (Parus major)-were found during field surveys. The PFA created an imaginary line segment network that connects nodes separated by 30 m across the entire study area, and estimated the total travel cost of a route from one P. major location to another by summing the travel costs associated with all of the segments comprising that route. We assumed that the travel cost of each segment is the average of the inverses of the bird densities at the two end nodes. For each node, the bird density was estimated from the linear relationship between percentage vegetation cover and bird density, as observed during field surveys. The predicted PMPs showed a pattern that was highly concentrated on patches with relatively high vegetation cover. The preference of P. major for a few specific routes allowed us to easily identify ecological corridors in the study area. An ecological network plan that protects and/or restores areas along ecological corridors would greatly improve the ecological connectivity of fragmented habitats in highly urbanized areas.

AB  - In this study, one lab-scale EGSB reactor (1.47 L volume) was designed to treat the antibiotic wastewater under different environmental factors, including the addition of cephalexin (CFX), Temperature (T) and Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT). The microbial community structure in EGSB reactor was analyzed with high-throughput sequencing technology to investigate their response to environmental factors changes, and then the random-matrix-theory (RMT)-based network analysis was used to investigate the microbial community's molecular ecological network in EGSB systems treating antibiotics wastewater. Moreover, the explanatory value of each environmental factor on the change of microbial community structure was obtained through the result of redundancy analysis (RDA). The results showed that the addition of cephalexin (CFX), decline of T and decline of HRT (8 h) would decrease the removal efficiency of COD decreasing. And the removal efficiency of CFX would not be affected by decline of T and HRT, except the producing and degrading process of CFX by-products was changed obviously. The result of RDA analysis suggested the environmental factors mainly affected bacterial and fungal microbial community structure but not archaeal ones. The result of high-throughput sequencing showed the relative abundance (RA) of Firmicutes had been obviously affected by T and HRT, which might be main reason leading to the decrease of COD removal efficiency. In addition, molecular ecological network analysis showed the growth of Bacteroidetes occupied the niche of functional microorganism and led to the unstable operation of EGSB when T declined. What's more, the molecular ecological network analysis revealed that Exophiala which belonged to fungi Ascomycota phylum was the hub genus to degrade complex refractory organic pollutants, and Aceticlastic methanogens Methanosaeta was the core functional archaea genus.

AB  - Riparian zones are important for the many ecosystem services they supply. In settled areas, the vegetation of such zones is shaped by human land-use; this often creates conditions under which alien plant species thrive. Alien plants have been shown to induce large-scale changes in riparian habitats, and they pose a major threat to the continued provision of key ecosystem services. We used direct gradient analysis to assess correlations between land-use and the composition of vegetation along a riparian river corridor in the highly transformed landscape surrounding Stellenbosch in South Africa's Western Cape Province. Vegetation plots were sampled along the entire length of the river from headwaters to estuary (ca. 40 km). Plant community composition was analyzed in relation to land-use data collected in the field, and additional land-use variables computed from digital land-cover data. Patterns of plant community structure were found to be directly related to land-use, with measures of cover, richness, and diversity differing significantly among land-use types. Portions of the riparian zone adjacent to agricultural land had the greatest level of alien plant cover, while areas bordered by urban land maintained the highest alien species richness. Areas adjacent to grazing and natural lands showed intermediate and low levels of invasion, respectively. Several native species were found to persist in areas with high abundance and diversity of invasive alien plants, suggesting that they will be valuable focal species for future restoration attempts. Due to the level of human-mediated change in many areas of the riparian zone, restoration to historic conditions over most of the river is not considered feasible. These areas should be recognized as examples of novel ecosystems, and management efforts should focus on restoring or creating desirable ecosystem functions, rather than on achieving assemblages comprising only native species.

AB  - Vegetation cover pattern is one of the factors controlling hydrological processes. Spatially distributed models are the primary tools previously applied to document the effect of vegetation cover patterns on runoff and soil erosion. Models provide precise estimations of runoff and sediment yields for a given vegetation cover pattern. However, difficulties in parameterization and the problematic explanation of the causes of runoff and sedimentation rates variation weaken prediction capability of these models. Landscape pattern analysis employing pattern indices based on runoff and soil erosion mechanism provides new tools for finding a solution. In this study, the vegetation cover pattern was linked with runoff and soil erosion by two previously developed pattern indices, which were modified in this study, the Directional Leakiness Index (DLI) and Flowlength. Although they use different formats, both indices involve connectivity of sources areas (interpatch bare areas). The indices were revised by bringing in the functional heterogeneity of the plant cover types and the landscape position. Using both artificial and field verified vegetation cover maps, observed runoff and sediment production on experiment plots, we tested the indices' efficiency and compared the indices with their antecedents. The results illustrate that the modified indices are more effective in indicating runoff at the plot/hillslope scale than their antecedents. However, sediment export levels are not provided by the modified indices. This can be attributed to multi-factor interaction on the hydrological process, the feedback mechanism between the hydrological function of cover patterns and threshold phenomena in hydrological processes.

AB  - Urban expansion occurs in horizontal and vertical directions, but the construction process of a traditional planar ecological network (EN) ignores the ecological protection of the vertical space. Birds, as representative species in urbanized areas, are important for expanding the vertical analysis dimension of ENs. In this study, urban parks with good habitat quality were extracted as ecological sources from the perspective of birds. Then, 2D and 3D ecological resistance surfaces were constructed on the basis of the perspective of influencing bird migration, and planar and 3D ecological corridors were extracted and compared for analysis. Finally, accessibility analysis was performed to identify the parks in the study area that need priority protection. Results show that building height is an important factor affecting bird migration, and the introduction of 3D resistance surfaces into EN construction is important for adapting to the trend of vertical urban expansion. The combination of accessibility and EN analyses can help identify ecological spaces having the dual role of "species conservation" and "human well-being enhancement." This study can provide a reference for refining the service species of ENs, exploring the vertical dimension of ENs, and improving the health of urban ecosystems and the rationality of urban planning.

AB  - A nurse-protege relationship is a frequent facilitation interaction in deserts that allows the recruitment of new individuals of many species. Our aim was to evaluate the relationship of Echinocereus enneacanthus during its life cycle and its nurse plants in the brousse tigree (tiger bush) vegetation of the Chihuahuan Desert. The population structure of the cactus is skewed toward adult stages, which are commonly found in the bare areas of the brousse tigree, whereas juveniles are located in the vegetated bands. The vegetation structure and the nurse-protege relationship were determined using censuses of 19 permanent plots monitored between 2008 and 2019. The differential association of E. enneacanthus with potential nurse plants was evaluated using an interaction network, under the hypothesis of strict association of the seedlings and juveniles with nurse species. In addition, chi(2) tests and standardized residuals were fitted among likely nurse species, weighted by the cover of the nurse and of the areas without vegetation. The study species, as well as the nurse plants, had an aggregated distribution pattern. The interaction network showed that the frequency of the association with nurse plants decreased as the size of the protege individuals increased. At the same time, there were differences in the establishment of E. enneacanthus under particular nurse plants; Prosopis glandulosa and Hilaria mutica were the most important. The nurse-protege relationship for seeds and seedlings is integral to the vegetation bands of the brousse tigree.

AB  - Ecosystem services are strongly influenced by the landscape configuration of natural and human systems. So they are heterogeneous across landscapes. However lack of the knowledge of spatial variations of ecosystem services constrains the effective management and conservation of ecosystems. We presented a spatially explicit and quantitative assessment of the geographic variations in ecosystem services for the Fuzhou City in 2009 using exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and semivariance analysis. Results confirmed a significant and positive spatial autocorrelation, and revealed several hot-spots and cold-spots for the spatial distribution of ecosystem service intensity (ESI) in the study area Also the trend surface analysis indicated that the level of ESI tended to be reduced gradually from north to south and from west to east, with a trough in the urban central area, which was quite in accordance with land-use structure. A more precise cluster map was then developed using the range of lag distance, deriving from semivariance analysis, as neighborhood size instead of default value in the software of ESRI ArcGIS 10.0, and geographical clusters where population growth and land-use pressure varied significantly and positively with ESI across the city were also created by geographically weighted regression (GWR). This study has good policy implications applicable to prioritize areas for conservation or construction, and design ecological corridor to improve ecosystem service delivery to benefiting areas.

AB  - Graph-theoretic approaches are commonly used to map landscape connectivity networks to inform environmental management priorities. We developed the new General Landscape Connectivity Model (GLCM), as a operationally practical way of evaluating and mapping habitat networks to inform conservation priorities and plans. GLCM is built on two complementary metapopulation ecology-based measures: Neighbourhood habitat area (Ni) and habitat link value (Li). Ni is a measure of the amount of connected habitat to each location considering its cross-scale connectivity to neighbouring habitat. The remaining Ni across a region can be reported as an indicator of Ecological Carrying Capacity for wildlife (plants and animals). Li at any location is its contribution to the landscape connectivity of the study region (i.e. which is reported as summed Ni across a region) by virtue of providing the 'least-cost' linkages between concentrations of habitat. Mapped Li provides valuable insights into the pattern of a region's habitat network, highlighting functioning habitat corridors and stepping-stones, and candidate areas for conservation and restoration. Due to its foundations in ecological theory and its parsimonious design, GLCM addresses a number of criteria we list as important, while addressing criticisms often levelled at graph-theoretical approaches. We present results for three south-east Australian case studies using continuous-value ecological condition surfaces as input. However, a simple habitat/non-habitat binary surface approximating a threshold ecological condition can also be used. GLCM has been designed to specifically address the need for generic landscape connectivity assessment at regional scales, and broader. It incorporates connectivity analyses across a range of spatial scales and granularities relevant to broad ranges of taxa and movement processes (foraging, dispersal and migration). Successively finer spatial scales are more intensively sampled based on a simple scaling-law. This approach allows analysis resolutions to be determined by data-driven ecological relevance rather than by processing limitations. The operational advantages of GLCM means that landscape connectivity assessments can be readily updated with refined or changed inputs including time-series remote sensing of land cover, or applied to alternative scenarios of land use, ecological restoration, climate projections or combinations of these.

AB  - The Neovolcanic Belt is a physical and ecologic barrier that has affected plant distribution patterns in central Mexico. It has been proposed that the barrier effect is incomplete due to openings that connect valleys across the Belt and permit floristic interchange. To substantiate the presence of floristic corridors, moss collections were made in the Chalco and Toluca areas and in the valleys of the state of Morelos. About 3594 samples representing 330 species and varieties from 2700 m or below were studied. The tropical species were selected and used as markers to determine possible floristic interchanges. Although the number of species shared between valleys on either side of the Belt indicates that its topographic discontinuities may have permitted it, the time of the interchange of tropical taxa cannot be established. The alpine species may have reached the corridors in the Pleistocene along with species from other elevations.

AB  - Organisms that depend on rare and endangered microhabitats, such as old, hollow trees, have a high conservation value. To conserve these species, it is necessary to apply methods that identify habitats suitable for their survival. Until now, a comprehensive method has not been developed for predicting the occurrence of species associated with old, hollow trees. Here, we developed criteria to identify habitats for organisms associated with old, hollow trees, using Osmoderma barnabita as a model species. We used hexagonal tessellation to identify suitable habitats for hermit beetle. Criteria for predicting the occurrence of a hermit beetle were applied in practise, and as result 47.56% of the known hermit beetle localities coincided with the hexagons where the probability of occurrence of the species was the highest. Based on these results, an ecological network was created for species dependency on old, hollow trees, using the hermit beetle as a model species. The proposed approach makes it possible to plan and implement environmental protection measures for species living in territories spanning several countries. In this work, we propose a method to identify species occurrence in core areas and to determine ecological corridors and gaps. This method could tailor conservation planning efforts.

AB  - Understanding the spatio-temporal characteristics of air pollutants is essential to improving air quality. One aspect is the question of whether green spaces can reduce air pollutant concentrations. However, previous studies on this issue have reported mixed results. This study analyzed the spatio-temporal characteristics of NO2, PM2.5 and O(3 )in Fujian Province, Southeast China in 2015. In order to reduce uncertainties in the conclusions drawn, the effects landscape metrics describing green spaces have on air pollutants have been analyzed using Pearson correlation analysis at six different spatial scales for the four seasons, considering the influence of meteorological conditions. The results show that PM2.5 and O(3 )are major pollutants whose relative importance varies with the seasons. Significant differences in pollutant concentrations were observed in suburban and urban areas, highlighting the importance of ensuring a reasonable spatial distribution of monitoring stations. Moreover, significant correlations between air pollutants and green space landscape patterns during the four seasons were found, revealing increased air pollutant concentrations with increasing landscape fragmentation and reduced connectivity and aggregation. This probably indicates that interconnected green spaces have the potential to improve air quality. Utilizing green space function regulations can alleviate NO2 and PM(2.5 )pollution effectively, but it is still difficult to reduce O-3 concentrations because green spaces are likely to not only serve as sinks for O-3,O- but can also promote O-3 formation.

AB  - 1. Mountain pine beetles (MPB, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) are aggressive insects attacking Pinus host trees. Pines use defensive resin to overwhelm attackers, creating an Allee effect requiring beetles to attack en masse to successfully reproduce. MPB kill hosts, leaving observable, dying trees with red needles. Landscape patterns of infestation depend on MPB dispersal, which decreases with host density. Away from contiguously impacted patches (low beetle densities), infestations are characterized by apparently random spots (of 1-10 trees).
   2. It remains unclear whether the new spots are spatially random eruptions of a locally endemic population or a mode of MPB spread, with spatial distribution determined by beetle motility and the need to overcome the Allee effect.
   3. To discriminate between the hypothesis of population spread versus independent eruption, a model of spot formation by dispersing beetles facing a local Allee effect is derived. The model gives rise to an inverse power distribution of travel times from existing outbreaks. Using landscape-level host density maps in three study areas, an independently calibrated model of landscape resistance depending on host density, and aerial detection surveys, we calculated yearly maps of travel time to previous beetle impact. Isolated beetle spots were sorted by travel time and compared with predictions. Random eruption of locally endemic populations was tested using artificially seeded spots. We also evaluated the relationship between number of new spots and length of the perimeter of previously infested areas.
   4. Spot distributions conformed strongly to predicted power-law behaviour. The spatially random eruption hypothesis was found to be highly improbable. Spot numbers grew consistently with perimeter of previously infested area, suggesting that MPB spread long distances from infestation boundaries via spots following an inverse power distribution.
   5. The Allee effect in MPB therefore accelerates, rather than limits, invasion rates, contributing to recent widespread landscape-scale mortality in western North America.

AB  - Well-functioning ecological corridors are critical for conserving biodiversity in areas undergoing increasing habitat losses and ecosystem fragmentation. Although it is essential to rebuild broken corridors by land use adjustments, related discussions of spatially explicit delineations of to-be-adjusted lands and quantitative adjustment costs are rare. Based on a widely adopted minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model, we simulated the potential ecological processes and identified ecological corridors in a rapidly urbanized city, namely, Nanjing, in eastern China. We then analysed the corresponding land use and cover changes (LUCCs) from 2000 to 2015 and quantitatively calculated the costs of rebuilding the indicated corridors based on the indication of the amount/spatial distribution of to-be-adjusted lands and their different standards of related adjustment. The results indicated that most obtained corridors were along continuous waters, but LUCCs still occurred within them; the spatial expansion of urban lands dominated, especially in the suburban areas and outer buffers of the ecological corridors. The rebuilding costs increased significantly, and urban land adjustments dominated these increases. Spatially, most costs were associated with suburban areas, and the costs increased obviously as the corridor width increased. Based on the comprehensive consideration of ecological suitability and economic rationality, we found that 200 m was the most appropriate width for rebuilding ecological corridors, as it can both meet the demands of local species and balance the local public budget. We explored methodologies used to identify potential ecological corridors and quantitatively evaluate the costs of rebuilding them, thus providing a basis for implementing practical and feasible land use adjustments addressing ecological suitability and economic rationality.

AB  - The biodiversity within tropical dry forests (TDFs) is astounding and yet poorly catalogued due to inadequate sampling and the presence of cryptic species. In the Mexican TDF, endemic species are common, and the landscape has been continually altered by geological and anthropogenic changes. To understand how landscape and environmental variables have shaped the population structure of endemic species, we studied the recently described species of leaf-toed gecko, Phyllodactylus benedettii, in coastal western Mexico. Using double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing data, we first explore population structure and estimate the number of ancestral populations. The results indicate a high degree of genetic structure with little admixture, and patterns corresponding to both latitudinal and altitudinal gradients. We find that genetic structure cannot be explained purely by geographical distance, and that ecological corridors may facilitate dispersal and gene flow. We then model the spatial distribution of P. benedettii in the TDF through time and find that the coastline has been climatically suitable for the species since the Last Glacial Maximum. Landscape genetic analyses suggest that the combination of isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by resistance (IBR; forest cover) has influenced the spatial genetic structure of the species. Overall, our genomic data demonstrate fine-scale population structure in TDF habitat, a complex colonization history, and spatial patterns consistent with both IBD and other ecological factors. These results further highlight the Mexican TDF as a diversity hotspot and suggest that continued anthropogenic changes are likely to affect native fauna.

AB  - Green roofs provide many ecosystem services, but little is known about the way they contribute to urban functional connectivity. This paper has the following four objectives: (1) to compare the potential green roofs' role to connectivity in relation to other urban green spaces, (2) to specify the green roofs contribution's type, (3) to explore the influence of building height integration method and finally (4) to assess the impact on connectivity of simulated greening new roofs. Using a landscape graph approach, we modeled ecological networks of three species groups with different dispersion capacities in the Paris region (France). Then, we computed several connectivity metrics to assess the potential contribution of green roofs to functional connectivity. At a large scale (metropole scale), our results show that green roofs can slightly improve the global connectivity largely through the connections rather than the addition of habitat area. More than a stepping stone function, green roofs would have a dispersion flux function at a local scale. Furthermore, when the difficulty of crossing movement is exponential to the height of buildings, green roofs over 20 m high are mostly disconnected from the ecological networks. In addition to the green roof's height, our analysis highlights the very strong role played by buildings' configuration. This study raises promising directions for the integration of building height into the analysis of urban connectivity. Detailed research and long-term biological data from green roofs and green spaces are needed to confirm our results.

AB  - 1. Despite high levels of disturbance and habitat modification, urban ecosystems still host substantial levels of biodiversity. The processes that maintain existing levels of diversity, however, remain understudied. Identifying the links between urban ecological processes and patterns has, therefore, become a fundamental research goal to support urban biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
   2. We conducted a study to determine how the diversity and composition of urban plant communities is affected by spatially and temporally variable land use legacies. We constructed a chronosequence of vacant lot properties covering a range of 3-22 years since demolition, in an urban neighbourhood in Baltimore, Maryland (USA). Surveys of herbaceous plant species abundance were conducted during the summers of 2012 and 2013 in sections of each vacant lot where the building previously stood (the "building footprint") and sections of the lot that was previously a backyard or garden (the "remnant garden").
   3. We found divergent patterns in plant community composition between areas of vacant lots with varying land use histories. This includes significant shifts in the functional composition of biotically vectored seed dispersal strategies, as well as an increase in seed mass and terminal velocity trait values of plant communities in building footprints over time. In addition, we found that plant communities in different sections of the same vacant lot tended to become more functionally dissimilar in seed dispersal strategies over time. In contrast, we found no significant changes in taxonomic diversity over time for any of our measures.
   4. Policy implications. Our study suggests that regional-scale patterns of seed dispersal interact with diverse land use legacies to structure the plant communities of urban vacant lots. Although it has been suggested that highly altered local environmental conditions and competition from introduced species limit native plant diversity in urban environments, we find seed dispersal to be a more significant driver of urban plant community assembly patterns. Implementing management strategies that focus on habitat connectivity and enhancing species pools via seeding may present an effective strategy for promoting more successful establishment of diverse plant communities in urban environments.

AB  - In the Pacific Northwest, AInus rubra Bong. (red alder) is a common deciduous tree species especially prevalent in riparian corridors and disturbed sites, including metropolitan areas undergoing land use changes and development. Importantly, red alder is also considered a bioindicator for ozone pollution and, like all plants, harbors a diverse endophyte community that may interact with aerial pollutants. In this study, we surveyed foliar fungal endophyte communities (microfungi) in red alder leaves from the metropolitan area of Portland, Oregon, USA, using culture-based techniques, and found that communities differed significantly by site. Our results suggest that the fungal endophyte community composition in red alder leaves may be influenced in part by local air pollution sources, likely in conjunction with other site characteristics. As urban areas expand, more studies should focus on how the urban environment affects plant-microbe community ecology and endophyte-host interactions, as well as on the long-term consequences for other ecosystem processes such as leaf litter decomposition.

AB  - Urban nature, including residential gardens, can promote biodiversity and increase human wellbeing. Understanding factors that encourage the spread of gardening within cities may help planners facilitate healthier and more biodiverse urban communities. This study characterizes the spatial distribution and attributes of gardens found in easement areas of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Spatial analyses of these privately managed public spaces provide evidence of clustering for both presence of gardens and their esthetic quality. Data collected on the location and attributes of easements from 22,562 properties during summer of 2009, show that 11% of these properties held an easement garden. Results of multiple spatial analyses, each targeting a different aspect of garden distribution, show that (a) the most intense easement garden clustering occurs among neighbors with direct visual access to nearest neighbors' easement areas; (b) it is 2.4 times as likely that a property holds an easement garden if a property within 30 m holds one; (c) although clustering is measureable for all neighborhood sizes up to 610 m from home, peak clustering happens within 91 m of home; and (d) clustering of easement gardens are clustered in terms of quality (appeal), and greatest clustering occurs between pairs of adjacent neighbors. While larger scale factors may play a role in where a garden cluster is initiated, the dominant occurrence of relatively small cluster sizes indicates that social contagion is in play. The potential value of social contagion is discussed as a mechanism for spread sustainable behaviors that support ecological resilience in urban areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, archaeologists have studied how ancient humans have shaped, and been shaped by, their surrounding environments in an effort to provide valuable insight into the patterns of human-environment interaction during prehistoric and historical periods. Along the Heihe River in Hexi Corridor of northwest China, archaeologists have found many ancient cities that are good places to explore changes in human settlement patterns in relation to environment change in historical periods. In this paper, we present our investigation of seven ancient cities to clarify the chronology of these cities and their strategy for wood use in the area through the application of radiocarbon dating and charcoal identification. Our results suggest that the ages of many cities are younger than previous estimates, and humans mainly used Tamarix and mixed Tamarix and broad leaf trees in the lower and middle reaches of the Heihe River basin between similar to AD 240-1380 respectively, and roughly matches the modern spatial distribution of natural woody vegetation in the area. In comparison to the results of archaeological, paleoclimatic and historical studies in Hexi Corridor, we propose that ancient human strategies for wood use and their impact on environment of the Heihe Basin are primarily relevant to human lifestyles rather than climate change.

AB  - Rapid urbanization results in changes in land use, biogeochemical cycles, climate, hydrosystems, and biodiversity. Policy-makers have formulated ecological protection measures to facilitate sustainable development. However, traditional conservation planning mainly focuses on protecting specific green spaces, with limited consideration of the connectivity among green spaces from a habitat network perspective. Using citizen science data and occupancy modelling, we predicted habitat suitability, built habitat networks and identified key habitat patches based on their contribution to the functional connectivity of the habitat network for three focal water, forest, and open-habitat bird species. Based on the habitat requirement, small waterbodies and intermediate forest and open-habitat cover facilitate preserving water, forest and open-habitat birds. In regards to the network analysis, we found that key habitat patches with a high conservation priority were generally characterized by a relatively large patch size and/or located at critical positions in the habitat network (at central positions in the habitat network, or near large patches). We suggest that key habitat patches in restricted built-up areas are converted to protected areas or are kept as cropland under future urban planning. We emphasize the usefulness of the focal species concept in urban biodiversity conservation. Our study offers conservation recommendations from a habitat network perspective for urban planners to safeguard urban biodiversity and ecosystem health.

AB  - While for most of a landscape, urbanization leads to a significant habitat loss, rivers in urban areas are usually maintained or developed for their drainage function. Rivers are often the most important biophysical and ecological connection of cities with their surrounding ecosystems, although usually heavily altered due to urban impacts. For the conservation of urban rivers as ecological corridors, it is important to assess the impact of typical urban threats on habitat quality. In this study, we used the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Trade-offs) habitat quality model to assess the individual and combined impacts of built-up areas, first- and second-order road and water pollution from urban drainage, and wastewater discharge on habitat quality within a 200 m wide river corridor. The Pochote River in Leon, Nicaragua, was used as a case study. Our results show the spatial distribution and magnitude of the individual threat impacts, as well as the respective contribution of each threat to the overall impact of urbanization on the habitat quality within the river corridor. While close to the city center, all threats almost equally contributed to severe habitat degradation, while further downstream, an individual threat influence became more distinct with only water pollution having a consistent negative impact. We concluded that the InVEST habitat quality model can be used to assess the impact of typical urban threats on habitat quality in river corridors at a high spatial resolution. The results can help to improve urban planning and development to improve habitat conservation along urban rivers.

AB  - The intensification of agricultural practices has induced the local, national and regional extinction of many species and also affected ecosystem services provided by biodiversity such as biological control of agricultural pests. We model the population dynamics of Pterostichus melanarius (Coleoptera: Carabidae), a carabid beetle often used as indicator species of habitat changes, by a joint model that combined a matrix model of population dynamics including local dispersal with an explicit model of the patchy landscape of the polders of the Bay of Mont St. Michel (Brittany, France). We used this model to evaluate the effects of landscape composition and configuration on the spatial population dynamics of this carabid beetle, and also investigated the consequences that different management strategies of the structure and composition of an agricultural landscape can have on its abundance and spatial distribution. The results of this study highlight that semi-habitats (field edges, dykes, hedgerows) usually considered as shelters for wintering play a key role as well for summer recruitment. We find that there is an optimal cluster size of patches for population viability that is induced by the seasonal movement of P melanarius. However, the effect of increasing the amount of semi-natural habitats patches on the viability of this population critically depend on the spatial arrangement, connectivity and spatial alternation of the network of semi-natural habitats, a feature that should be considered in the conservation and management actions in the landscape context.

AB  - Spatially distributed populations often rely on large-scale processes for long-term population stability. These processes are driven by individuals moving across the landscape through long-distance dispersal movements. However, as landscapes are continually altered by anthropogenic development, increased fragmentation and avoidance behavior can affect landscape permeability and limit dispersal. Lesser prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) are a species of concern that have lost significant portions (>90%) of their historic distribution in the Southern Great Plains of the United States and are currently being impacted by continued anthropogenic development. Using GPS telemetry locations of 346 lesser prairie-chickens across their entire geographic distribution, we identified 184 different long-distance movements that drive population connectivity. We used empirical cumulative distribution functions to create a selection-avoidance-neutral curve and estimated the spatial scale of response to anthropogenic features (i.e., towers and windmills, large transmission and smaller distribution powerlines, oil wells, roads, and fences) during these movements. In addition, we tested for behavioral differences between movement types (e.g., exploratory loops vs. long-distance movements between home ranges) and for regional differences in response among study areas. We found that during long-distance movements, lesser prairie-chickens generally avoided all anthropogenic feature types we tested despite some variation in the reported response distance among study areas. However, they avoided the tallest features (i.e., towers and windmills and transmission powerlines) at much greater distances in comparison with the shorter features in our analysis. Our results show that long-distance movements are likely affected by responses to functional landscape fragmentation through increased development of anthropogenic features in important connectivity zones. As our estimated response distances during long-distance movements varied in comparison with previously reported response distances during other behavioral states (e.g., breeding or nesting), using long-distance or dispersal specific movement data may be more appropriate when asking questions related to connectivity across the landscape.

AB  - Habitat loss is the leading cause of biodiversity reduction in the world today, with wetlands having experienced especially large losses in the United States and elsewhere. Using remote sensing and GIS techniques, this study quantified cumulative habitat loss in two Southern California watersheds associated with Clean Water Act Section 404 permits, primarily for developments, issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from 1984 to 2002. While the majority of habitat loss occurred outside of explicitly 404-authorized developments, non-explicitly authorized development represented a substantial fraction of observed habitat loss. The spatial distribution of habitat loss and 404 permits were analyzed statistically. In almost all cases, percent habitat loss was significantly correlated with variables representing 404 authorizations. These correlations may indicate the presence of incidental authorizations, suggesting that 404 authorizations within the study area may have indirectly facilitated nearby development (i.e., growth-inducing impacts). This study expanded the use of remote sensing, GIs, and spatial statistics for the purpose of regulatory-driven cumulative impact assessment. Until resource agencies quantify cumulative impacts in a spatially explicit manner and analyze those data statistically, there can be little rigorous scientific basis for formulating regulatory or policy decisions regarding cumulative impacts.

AB  - We explore bird communities in different types of small urban greenspaces (<2 ha) in order to understand which birds occupy these structures, and the habitat and landscape features that affect them. In particular we analyzed how greenspace characteristics (size and vegetation structure), those of the adjacent landscape (area covered by urban structures and vegetation), and human disturbance variables (traffic of pedestrians, vehicles and noise levels) affected bird species richness, abundance and community composition (during summer and winter) in the city of Pachuca, Mexico. We selected 19 small greenspaces (ranging from 0.1 to 2 ha), including public parks, gardens and road strip corridors. We registered 39 species of birds of which 15 were migratory. In general bird species richness was higher in parks and gardens, and lower in road strip corridors, where more noise and traffic was registered. Greenspace area was the most important variable that positively influenced bird species richness, for both the summer and the winter communities. Summer bird species richness was lower in places that had a greater percentage of area covered by buildings in the adjacent landscape. Generalist and opportunistic species were favored by urbanization. Insectivorous species in winter were more abundant in larger greenspaces that had taller trees and more tree and shrub species, and in sites with more vegetative cover in the adjacent landscape. We suggest some management and urban planning actions that would benefit birds within many Latin American cities, where small greenspaces are often the only available refuges for birds.

AB  - Decreasing landscape connectivity, due to habitat loss and agricultural expansion, is a threat for species movement and other flux-dependent ecological processes. Tree cover within the agricultural matrix provides perching sites, dispersal routes, and extra habitat for animals. Isolated trees and living fences in tropical pastures add structural complexity to actual matrices, but their role in landscape connectivity is undervalued. Our main objective was to assess the potential value of small (<= 1ha) woody patches for maintaining landscape connectivity in highly fragmented landscapes using birds as focal species. We used high-resolution images and LIDAR data to classify different tree cover types. We assess the probability of connectivity for different hypothetical dispersal distances between woody patches, using a graph-theoretic approach and simulating scenarios that differed in tree cover composition. We estimated the impacts and contribution of tree cover class removals on landscape connectivity. The connectivity index increased widely among scenarios with increasing tree cover composition. The highest connectivity value was obtained in the scenario that included all arboreal elements currently present in the matrix. Small wooded patches and isolated trees contributed from 26% to 59% to overall connectivity. The presence of small (<= 1ha) patches of tree cover greatly enhance landscape connectivity for animals with low vagility and behavioral limitations on crossing gaps. Isolated trees and living fences play a crucial role in increasing habitat reachability within rural landscapes and ensuring and enhancing connectivity for animals that perform daily-movements at short-distances. The spatial distribution of arboreal elements within landscapes could be optimized to increase connectivity and must be considered in conservation planning.

AB  - Urban forests affect the filtration and absorption of airborne particulate matter, which can minimize the harmful effects to human health caused by airborne particulate pollution. Evergreen plants in urban forests play a major role in absorbing dust and purifying the air, especially in winter. Studying the spatial distribution of leaf dust and exploring the dust retention effect of evergreen shrubs are important for scientifically guiding urban forest construction and improving the living environment of cities in winter. The purpose of this study was to establish a dust inversion model by correlation analysis of spectral reflectance and the amount of dust absorption (ADA) of vegetation, using Sentinel-2 satellite remote-sensing images to obtain the dust distribution of the evergreen vegetation (mainly Euonymus japonicus Thunb.) in the Beijing urban area, and to determine the effect of the spatial pattern of E. japonicus woodland on ADA intensity. The result showed that the red band and near-infrared band are most sensitive to dust. The normalized difference phenology index (NDPI) is more suitable for building an inversion model, where the determination coefficient (R-2) of the inversion model constructed by the ratio of the NDPI (R-NDPI) was 0.879. The inversion results show that the mean ADA in the enclosed area is smaller than that in semi-enclosed and open areas, and the regional distribution of high ADA in the urban area of Beijing was higher in the south with a tendency of the ADA to decrease from city center to the surrounding area. The size, shape, and percentage of landscape (PLAND) of E. japonicus woodland have a significant effect on ADA intensity. We found that, in the study area, when the PLAND of E. japonicus woodland is higher than 40%, its ADA intensity remains basically unchanged. When the vegetation coverage is fixed, the landscape shape index is negatively correlated with ADA intensity, and reduction of the overall shape complexity of forestland can enhance its dust retention effect and improve the air environment of the surrounding areas. The results of this study can be used as a reference for urban planners and landscape architects when building urban forests, providing a scientific basis for controlling and reducing air particulate pollution in Beijing's winter and improving the living environment.

AB  - Anthropogenic land use has led to the loss and fragmentation of native habitats and disruption to ecosystem processes, resulting in a decline in landscape connectivity and biodiversity. Here, in order to find the potentials of improvements in ecological connectivity, we provide a spatial analysis to present differences in ecological connectivity based on land cover maps and urban habitat maps in Suwon city, Republic of Korea. We generated two permeability maps for use in a network analysis, one being land cover and the other urban habitat, including a 5-km buffer area from the city boundary. We then determined the current-flow betweenness centrality (CFBC) for each map. Our results indicate that forests are typically the most highly connected areas in both maps. However, in the land cover map results, nearly all high-priority areas were in the mountainous region (CFBC value: 0.0100 +/- 0.0028), but the urban habitat indicated that grasslands and rivers within the city also significantly contribute to connectivity (CFBC value: 0.0071 +/- 0.0022). The CFBC maps developed here could be used as a reference when introducing green infrastructure in cities. Before establishing ecological networks for urban areas, future work should integrate the land use and ecological data of different administrative districts with continuous ecological connection.

AB  - Food production and biodiversity conservation are commonly seen as separate pursuits with contradicting implications. This view is based on a conception of agriculture as a necessarily destructive activity for the ecosystems, failing to recognize the qualitative differences among diverse types of agricultural management. We built a dynamical and spatially explicit model to test the way in which virtual ecological networks decrease in diversity as the type of agricultural activities that surround them become less and less permeable to wild species. We find that biodiversity exhibits a robust pattern of slow decrease as the agricultural activities diminish in permeability or quality.

AB  - Urbanization is a growing threat to ecological communities and has become a leading cause of population extirpations in a wide range of taxa. Because the effects of urbanization are often multifaceted, identifying the pathways through which changes in communities occur has remained a persistent challenge. We draw upon metacommunity theory to evaluate competing explanations for the effects of urbanization, focusing on the relative importance of processes at local (e.g. abiotic and biotic characteristics) and regional (e.g. habitat connectivity and dispersal) scales. Over 4years, we sampled 201 wetlands in the Front Range region of Colorado, which is one of the most rapidly developing areas in the USA. Wetlands embedded within urban areas exhibited significantly lower taxonomic richness and diversity compared to those in agricultural or grassland areas. Relative to grassland wetlands, urban wetlands supported a 60% lower richness of amphibians and aquatic reptiles and a 33% lower richness of aquatic insects, molluscs and crayfish. These patterns were associated with changes in biotic factors (introduced fishes and bullfrogs), abiotic factors (nutrients, conductivity and vegetation) and landscape characteristics (road density and surrounding wetland area). The use of an information-theoretic approach and structural equation modelling suggested that the effects of urbanization on richness were mainly driven by changes in road density. Analyses of community composition indicated that discrete communities formed along the urban systems gradient, such that actively dispersing predators associated more negatively with urban system relative to herbivores with passive dispersal. Synthesis and applications. These results highlight the importance of considering both local and regional factors in addressing conservation-related challenges and underscore the benefits of linking conceptual work on metacommunity theory with applied efforts to mitigate the effects of urbanization.

AB  - Could past land uses, and the land cover changes carried out, affect the current landscape capacity to maintain biodiversity? If so, knowledge of historical landscapes and their socio-ecological transitions would be useful for sustainable land use planning. We constructed a GIS dataset in 10 x 10 km UTM cells of the province of Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain) for 1956 and 2009 with the changing levels of farming disturbance exerted through the human appropriation of photosynthetic net primary production (HANPP), and a set of landscape ecology metrics to assess the impacts of the corresponding land-use changes. Then, we correlated them with the spatial distribution of total species richness (including vascular plants, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals). The results allow us to characterize the main trends in changing landscape patterns and processes, and explore whether a land-use legacy of many complex agroforest mosaics maintained by the intermediate farming disturbance managed in 1956 could still exist, despite the decrease or disappearance of those mosaics before 2009 due to the combined impacts of agroindustrial intensification (meaning higher HANPP levels), forest transition (meaning lower HANPP levels) and urban sprawl. Statistical analysis reveals a positive impact of the number of larger, less disturbed forest patches, where many protected natural sites have been created in 1956-2009. However, it also confirms that this result has not only been driven by conservation policies and that the distribution of species richness is currently correlated with the maintenance of intermediate levels of HANPP. This suggests that both land-sharing and land-sparing approaches to biodiversity conservation may have played a synergistic role owing to the legacy of complex land cover mosaics of former agricultural landscapes that are now under a serious threat.

AB  - Environmental policies have highlighted the importance of preserving ecological networks to limit the fragmentation of natural habitats and biodiversity loss. A crucial issue for landscape managers is how to reconcile conservation measures that benefit all species and the maintenance of human activities. This study aimed to promote landscape multifunctionality, i.e., improving connectivity for several species without significantly modifying human activities. The objectives were to identify the most strategic natural landscape types to prioritize for preservation and to propose landscape management actions in highly anthropized areas that would benefit a majority of species. The analysis combined landscape types and bird species observation data to model landscape suitability for six species profiles defined by their affinity for wetlands, agricultural areas, urban areas and three types of forested landscapes. By graph modelling, we analysed the functional connectivity of the ecological networks of these species profiles. The results revealed that only ten landscape types out of 72 were core habitats for three species profiles simultaneously. These were primarily forested landscape types - either strict or associated with open areas (wasteland, forest clearing). Conversely, some anthropogenic landscapes dominated by built areas and sometimes shared with agriculture were completely unfavourable for all species profiles. The graph modelling analysis showed that the transformation of some landscape types could potentially improve connectivity for four species profiles presenting different ecological requirements. This coupling approach thus provided guidance to propose some landscape management actions that benefit the majority of species while preserving land uses.

AB  - The dramatic rise of human population growth and urban development, especially in developing countries, has led to a decline in the quality, fragmentation and isolation of habitats which support rare or endangered fauna species. New areas designed to protect such species and form corridors and networks to support populations are needed. Two rare species of Chinkara and Blanford's fox habitats in Isfahan Province are used to evaluate the optimal method to determine suitable habitat. Eight statistical methods, including four widely-used methods (SVM, Random Forest, GBM and MARS) and five new methods (XGBtree, XGBLinear, Treebag and SVMRadial) are evaluated in this study; to do so two Modis products and 19 worldclim parameters are applied. In addition, the ensemble of these methods was applied using gap analysis and areas with potential for protection were prioritized. Finally, minimum cost analysis was utilized to identify possible corridors between new areas and current protected areas. Results demonstrate that the eastern parts of Isfahan province have the highest potential for these two species, and because of the diverse habitats demands for these two species, the regions are able to support a large number of fauna and flora species.

AB  - Urbanization adversely impacts biodiversity by reducing the quantity and quality of natural habitat areas. Additionally, the quality of natural habitat depends on its bio-physical characteristics (e.g., natural cover, impervious surfaces, urban tree canopy) as well as the functional traits of species inhabiting them (e.g., breeding/foraging habitat requirements). To better plan conservation of regional biodiversity in urbanized landscapes, it is therefore critical to assess the relationship between the landscape and the response of key Functional Trait Groups (FTGs) of species. To identify different FTGs of 116 avian species in the urbanized landscape of the Toronto region (Canada), we conducted a Functional Trait Analysis (FTA) using RLQ-fourth corner analysis. We focused on four species traits (diet, foraging, nesting, and territoriality) to identify the FTGs and their association with natural cover and landscape characteristics (landcover types, patch quality, habitat connectivity). Then, to predict FTG presence in relation to the landscape characteristics, we performed a Habitat Suitability Analysis (HSA). From this analysis, we found 21 avian FTGs with different habitat suitability values that correspond to forested patches and wetlands. The HSA for tree canopy, forest insectivore, and ground-nesting birds (or FTGs) have higher suitability values within forest patches, while aerial insectivores have higher suitability values in older residential neighborhoods indicating the value of the urban tree canopy. This methodological approach shows that by mapping habitat suitability by FTG one can identify strategic conservation areas that target multiple species, shifting efforts from a single species to a community-based functional focus. Our study highlights the conservation value of remnant and/or restored habitat patches in near urban and urban landscapes that help to maximize the persistence of regional avian biodiversity.

AB  - Natural habitats in rural and urban areas are increasingly fragmented and altered by human impacts that are limiting the animal and plant dispersal process. Fragmentation and isolation can be reversed by restoring landscape connectivity through effective Ecological Network (EN) planning. However, most of the studies analyzing the influence of connectivity and landscape structure on biodiversity are focused on animals, while the understanding of their interplaying role on plant diversity remains limited. .We studied the relationships between alpha and 13 diversity pattern and landscape structure and connectivity in the nodes of an EN developed in agricultural landscapes, as a part of regional landscape planning framework in Friuli Venezia Giulia region (North-East of Italy). As an innovation, the study aims at parsing the interacting effect of landscape structure, surrounding habitats and nodes, and structural connectivity on EN plant diversity at two specific scales of investigation i.e., the habitat and the node scale. The habitat was the basic ecological unit, while the node was the basic cartographical unit for the EN mapping (multi-habitat or mono-habitat nodes).A total of 443 plant species were collected across 219 sample plots, in 14 different habitats and 87 nodes of the EN. We found that high node connectivity leads to higher species richness (alpha-diversity) but also increases plant community similarity (i.e., low 13-diversity) at both scales. The effect of landscape structure showed differing trends depending on the habitat. In general, landscape composition of semi-natural land cover (i.e., hedgerows, watercourses) showed a positive effect on species diversity as opposed to that of the configuration of anthropogenic elements on both scales. Our results provided crucial information on the landscape processes useful to improving biodiversity conservation by EN. Our findings suggest that i) improving connectivity within ENs favors alpha plant diversity ii) different habitats have different sensibility to landscape structure iii) semi-natural land cover around nodes improve plant diversity; iv) planning both mono-habitat and multi-habitats nodes, increases the biodiversity conserved therein; v) nodes with more compact shapes are to be preferred.

AB  - The sensitivity of biogenic emission estimates and air quality model predictions to the characterization of land use/land cover (LULC) in southeastern Texas was examined using the Global Biosphere Emissions and Interactions System (GloBEIS) and the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with extensions (CAMx). A LULC database was recently developed for the region based on source imagery collected by the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper-Plus sensor between 1999 and 2003, and field data for land cover classification, species identification and quantification of biomass densities. Biogenic emissions estimated from the new LULC data set showed good general agreement in their spatial distribution, but were approximately 40% lower than emissions from the LULC data set currently used by the State of Texas, primarily because of differences in the biomass estimates of key species such as Quercus. Predicted ozone mixing ratios using the biogenic emissions produced from the new LULC data set were as much as 26 ppb lower in some areas on some days, depending on meteorological conditions. Satellite data and image classification techniques provide useful tools for mapping and monitoring changes in LULC. However, field validation is necessary to link species and biomass densities to the classification system used for accurate biogenic emissions estimates, especially in areas such as riparian corridors that contain dense spatial coverage of key species.

AB  - The Asian longhorned beetle (ALB, Anoplophora glabripennis) is an invasive pest species currently infesting major port cities in North America and Europe. There is limited knowledge regarding the pathways of movement across heterogeneous landscapes at local scales. This study models dispersal pathways using circuit theory in Worcester, Massachusetts, which has the largest ongoing ALB infestation in North America. Circuit theory-based dispersal modeling provides a means of predicting the movement of random walkers across a landscape comprising differential resistance to movement. Calibration of landscape resistance to ALB movement used a combined expert opinion and empirical approach, with 820 ALB presence points for calibration and validation. Results indicate that ALB typically uses nonhabitat land-cover types to connect suitable habitat patches. Circuit modeling was a better predictor of spatial patterns of dispersal than least-cost dispersal modeling, especially by predicting narrow corridors that connect large habitat patches. ALB dispersal modeling is difficult due to limited data availability and ongoing ALB habitat modification. This article contributes to knowledge of ALB dispersal patterns at local and regional scales, using empirically driven methods to provide spatially explicit predictions of high dispersal probability and habitat suitability for ALB, using the best data sets available.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflicts in cities are becoming increasingly common worldwide and are a challenge to urban biodiversity management and landscape planning. In comparison to compensatory management, which often focuses on addressing emergency conflicts, precautionary management allows decision-makers to better allocate limited resources on prioritized areas and initiate long-term actions in advance. However, precautionary approaches have rarely been developed or applied in biodiversity conservation. Since 2020, human-raccoon dog conflicts in Shanghai, one of the largest cities in the world, have tripled in reported number due to the rapid spread of the species in the city from 70 residential districts in 2020 to 249 residential districts in 2022. Here, we use ensemble and circuit modeling to predict suitable raccoon dog habitat and identify their potential dispersal pathways to aid the development of precautionary management strategies. We find that raccoon dog distribution is positively associated with several anthropogenic factors, including residential buildings and nighttime light, which could be signs that the species' foraging behavior has adapted to the urban environment. We find that raccoon dogs only occupy 10.1% of its suitable habitat, and thus there is a high potential for the expansion of the raccoon dog population and more frequent human-raccoon dog conflicts in the near future. We predict 60 potential dispersal pathways across Shanghai, seven of which cross densely human populated areas and are likely to trigger excessive conflicts. Based on our findings, we propose priority areas where precautionary management strategies, such as constraining stray animal feeding and wildlife-vehicle collision prevention, would potentially alleviate human-raccoon dog conflicts. We present the first study on the precautionary approach of human-wildlife conflict in China's major cities, and provide a practical example of how comprehensive modeling approaches can be used as the foundation of precautionary management in urban landscapes.

AB  - With continuous urbanization and the fragmentation of green areas that affect human well-being, the establishment of a green infrastructure (GI) network is important in future urban planning. As a National Central City, Zhengzhou has a large population and is undergoing rapid economic development, resulting in an urgent demand for green space within the city in recent years. We selected the main urban area of Zhengzhou as the study area based on the two phases of Landsat 8 satellite remote sensing image data, for 2016 and 2021, and used the patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model to predict the spatial distribution of GI in the future; compared with traditional methods, this method identified green spaces from a future perspective. A GI network-consisting of an open space with vegetation as the main body-was designed for the main urban area of Zhengzhou using the traditional landscape ecological pattern theory, integrating morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA), the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model, circuit theory, and other methods. Evidently, the area of green space in Zhengzhou City in 2021 was 36 231.6 hm(2). GI prediction results indicate that continuous expansion of the main urban area did not result in significant changes in the size of GI in the city. The GI within the urban area was relatively fragmented, forming 15 GI hubs, most of which were densely distributed along the edges of the main urban area. This study proposed the construction of a GI network with a target corridor and target points based on the existing corridor. This included the identification of seven target corridors and 15 target hubs; the total length of the corridor was 77.032 km, with a total of 31 target points. In summary, the GI network pattern of "one protection barrier, two lines, three loops and more points " was proposed. With new urban problems constantly emerging, this research could provide a theoretical reference basis for the planning of GI in the main urban area of the National Central City. The study provides concrete evidence on the optimum pattern for the construction of GI networks in cities with large populations.

AB  - Human modification of the landscape, including urbanization and road construction, has facilitated the spread and establishment of non-native plant species. The effects of urbanization and roads are expected to be species-specific due to differences in species habitat requirements. We examined the influence of urbanization and roads on the occurrences of 16 non-native plant species in over 2000 wetlands within the Chicago metropolitan region in northeastern Illinois, USA. We found that species, or groups of species, responded differently to the effects of urbanization, roads, and proximity to conspecific populations. Occurrences of halophyte species were best predicted by road variables; halophytes were more commonly associated with major roads such as interstates and federal highways, road types that are likely to receive greater applications of de-icing salts. Several species were associated with proximity to Chicago. Proximity to Chicago may serve as a proxy for the degree of urbanization; or alternatively, may reflect a pattern of outward dispersal from an initial establishment point in the urban center. All study species were positively associated with distance to the nearest occupied wetland, implying that for each species, wetlands were more likely to be occupied if closer to other occupied sites. Our results support the need for species-specific understanding of responses to urbanization and roads to facilitate management of non-native species.

AB  - We aimed to assess the impact of land-use structure on AFIS occurrence and evaluation of these bioindicators in urban conditions. We compiled data about forest continuity based on archival maps and forest management plans; floristic records of 79 AFIS occurrences were collected within a 1 x 1 km grid and land-use form structure in Poznan (W Poland). We tested fidelity of AFIS using chi(2) tests and effects of land-use structure using random forest models. We also checked spatial autocorrelation and its impact on AFIS distribution patterns within old and recent forests, using spatially explicit generalized linear models. We found a strong relationship between AFIS number per grid square and fraction of forests and waters in land-use structure. Relationships between AFIS distribution and land-use shows that AFIS are a good proxy describing human impact or an urbanity gradient. AFIS number per grid square shows small, but significant positive spatial autocorrelation, which suggests possibilities of migration into new forests. AFIS, treated as a bioindicative group of species, may be a useful indicator of landscape and land-use structure transformation in urban environments. Occurrence of many AFIS that are endangered at the city scale indicates the need for conservation of old forests in urban areas, to preserve biodiversity in urban environments. Thus, AFIS may act as indicators of old forests with high conservation value in cities, which need special protection.

AB  - Disturbance frequently is implicated in the spread of invasive exotic plants. Disturbances may be broadly categorized as endogenous (e.g., digging by fossorial animals) or exogenous ( e. g., construction and maintenance of roads and trails), just as weedy species may be native or exotic in origin. The objective of this study was to characterize and compare exotic and native weedy plant occurrence in and near three classes of disturbance digging by prairie dogs ( an endogenous disturbance to which native plants have had the opportunity to adapt), paved or gravel roads ( an exogenous disturbance without natural precedent), and constructed trails ( an exogenous disturbance with a natural precedent in trails created by movement of large mammals) - in three geographically separate national park units. I used plant survey data from the North and South Units of Theodore Roosevelt National Park and Wind Cave National Park in the northern mixed-grass prairie of western North and South Dakota, USA, to characterize the distribution of weedy native and exotic plants with respect to the three disturbance classes as well as areas adjacent to them. There were differences both in the susceptibility of the disturbance classes to invasion and in the distributions of native weeds and exotic species among the disturbance classes. Both exotic and native weedy species richness were greatest in prairie dog towns and community composition there differed most from undisturbed areas. Exotic species were more likely to thrive near roadways, where native weedy species were infrequently encountered. Exotic species were more likely to have spread beyond the disturbed areas into native prairie than were weedy native species. The response of individual exotic plant species to the three types of disturbance was less consistent than that of native weedy species across the three park units.

AB  - Migratory species interact with different ecosystems in different regions during migration, making them more environmentally sensitive and therefore more vulnerable to extinction. Long migration routes and limited con-servation resources desire clear identification of conservation priorities to improve the allocation efficiency of conservation resources. Clarifying the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of the utilization intensity during migration is an effective way to guide the conservation areas and priority. 12 Oriental White Storks (Ciconia boyciana), listed as an "endangered" species by the IUCN, were equipped with satellite-tracking loggers to record their hourly location throughout the year. Then, combined with remote sensing and dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Model (dBBMM), characteristics and differences between spring and autumn migration were iden-tified and compared. Our findings revealed that: (1) the Bohai Rim has always been the core stopover area for the Storks' spring and autumn migration, but the utilization intensity has spatial differences; (2) differences in habitat selection resulted in differences in the Storks' spatial distribution, thus affecting the efficiency of existing conservation systems; (3) the shift of habitat from natural wetlands to artificial surfaces calls for the development of eco-friendly land use mode; (4) the development of satellite tracking, remote sensing, and advanced data analysis methods have greatly facilitated movement ecology, even though they are still under development.

AB  - Microclimatic condition is a fundamental indicator for evaluating outdoor space livability and vitality. Research has shown that poorly designed building layouts can lead to discomfort; however, the mechanisms influencing outdoor microclimate based on residential building layout are unclear for high temperature and high humidity regions. This study explores the relationship between residential building layouts and the outdoor wind and thermal environment at the pedestrian level in Wuhan, a city renowned for high temperatures and high humidity. Six typical residential building layouts were simulated, using the ENVI-met numerical model, to determine the spatial distribution of wind speed and air temperature. The Universal Thermal Climate Index was adopted as a comprehensive index with which to assess spatial and diurnal variations in microclimates surrounding each building layout. Results showed that parallel building layouts formed a ventilation corridor that increased wind speeds by approximately 0.3 m/s. A staggered building layout, in line with the prevailing wind direction, facilitated airflow in the ventilation corridor and further increased wind speeds. Windward buildings blocked high-temperature airflows and reduced air temperatures by approximately 1 degrees C in parallel layouts, and 1.4 degrees C in enclosed layouts. However, the cooling effect of windward buildings on high-temperature airflow was weaker than the warming effect caused by the wind shadow effect and direct sunlight. Additionally, the performance of the thermal comfort of the enclosed type layout was significantly better, for most of the day, than the parallel type layout.

AB  - Appropriately designed, greenways may provide habitat for neotropical migrants, insectivores, and forest-interior specialist birds that decrease in diversity and abundance as a result of suburban development. We investigated the effects of width of the forested corridor containing a greenway, adjacent land use and cover, and the composition and vegetation structure within the greenway on breeding bird abundance and community composition in suburban greenways in Raleigh and Cary, North Carolina, USA. Using 50 m fixed-radius point counts, we surveyed breeding bird communities for 2 years at 34 study sites, located at the center of 300-m-long greenway segments.
   Percent coverage of managed area within the greenway, such as trail and other mowed or maintained surfaces, was a predictor for all development-sensitive bird groupings. Abundance and richness of development-sensitive species were lowest in greenway segments containing more managed area. Richness and abundance of development-sensitive species also decreased as percent cover of pavement and bare earth adjacent to greenways increased. Urban adaptors and edge-dwelling birds, such as Mourning Dove, House Wren, House Finch, and European Starling, were most common in greenways less than 100 m wide. Conversely, forest-interior species were not recorded in greenways narrower than 50 m. Some forest-interior species, such as Acadian Flycatcher, Hairy Woodpecker, and Wood Thrush, were recorded primarily in greenways wider than 100 m. Others, including ground nesters such as Black-and-white Warbler, Louisiana Waterthrush, and Ovenbird, were recorded only in greenways wider than 300 m.
   Landscape and urban planners can facilitate conservation of development-sensitive birds in greenways by minimizing the width of the trail and associated mowed and landscaped surfaces adjacent to the trail, locating trails near the edge of greenway forest corridors, and giving priority to the protection of greenway corridors at least 100 m wide with low levels of impervious surface (pavement, buildings) and bare earth in the adjacent landscape.

AB  - The algal groups present in periphyton communities form an important base of autochthonous food webs in freshwater streams. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are key macronutrients in aquatic systems. Excess nutrients benefit some algal groups over others. We paired a nutrient-diffusing substrata limitation experiment with high performance liquid chromatography to (a) identify which nutrient(s) limit periphyton production, and (b) how the periphyton biomass and community structure changes between isolated pools of differing hydrological characteristics along an intermittent dryland stream. Unique peaks for 21 pigments were identified and matched with published values. We then produced a PERMANOVA model using pigment ratios and CHEMTAX analysis to explore changes in community structure resulting from nutrient addition. Periphyton communities in these pools were co-limited by N and P. Nitrogen additions caused the periphyton to shift from diatom- to chlorophyte-dominated community structure and benefited cyanophyta growth. Phosphorus additions reduced the relative proportion of diatoms and also resulted in an increase in pheophoribide-a, a pigment indicative of cell lysis, demonstrating a detrimental impact of P additions. Outcomes of this study show that when adding nutrient to a system there may be subtle shifts in community composition which can be telescoped up the food web regardless of the system's nutrient status.

AB  - Urban expansion is a major threat to diversity, especially in rapidly developing tropical countries where urban areas are growing at great pace and protection is limited. We conducted a systematic review of published research on the ecology of lentic habitats in tropical urban areas. The review focused on understanding: (1) how much is currently known about the biodiversity of these habitats; (2) whether this knowledge is biased towards certain taxonomic groups and/or geographic areas; (3) what is known about the factors influencing their diversity; and (4) which ecosystem services urban lentic habitats provide. The review aimed to establish whether existing knowledge is sufficient to help guide conservation and provide evidence to policy makers of the importance of conserving tropical urban wetlands. We found 64 papers that addressed questions about the diversity and/or distribution of lentic ecosystems within tropical urban areas. Papers came from 15 countries, although almost half (45%) were from India; relatively few countries from Southeast Asia, tropical Africa, or South America were represented in the literature. Publication patterns revealed a growing interest in urban wetlands, but several biases and gaps were evident from the review. Firstly, papers generally focused on larger natural or semi-natural wetlands, with other types and sizes of lentic habitat under-represented in published work. Secondly, most papers focused on a single site, with a limited number of multi-site, city-wide, or landscape-scale diversity assessments. Thirdly, studies tended to focus on understanding the influence of water quality on diversity, with work assessing the influence of physical habitat or factors related to dispersal and connectivity very limited. Finally, work assessing the ecosystem services provided by wetlands in tropical urban areas remains narrow in focus, with few quantitative assessments of the relationship between ecological characteristics and ecosystem functions and services. We suggest a number of research focal points and approaches to help address these biases. Research is needed to improve understanding of the distribution patterns tropical freshwater species in urban areas and of the relationships between species diversity and a wider set of environmental and spatial conditions. Overall, there is a need for diversity assessments of tropical urban wetlands of all types and sizes, especially new and novel habitats, and scope for much greater adoption of ecosystem service concepts and evaluation tools to help emphasise the importance of these habitats.

AB  - Rivers with a natural flow regime strongly influence the dynamics of riparian plant communities through hydrological and geomorphological processes. In this study, associations between fluvial landforms and vegetation are investigated on three near-natural rivers in the Czech Republic a decade after a 500-year return period flood in July 1997. This extreme disturbance destroyed the anthropogenically modified river channels and created suitable conditions for a range of ecosystems with high diversity and ecological stability. Field surveys were conducted on fluvial landforms (bars, islands, banks, floodplains and terraces) along three renaturalized rivers, where no technical modifications had subsequently been made to their channels outside urban areas and the floodplains had been left in a post-flood state. Vegetation species abundance and 13 environmental variables (topographical, hydrological and soil) were investigated in summer 2007, 10 years after the extreme flood disturbance. The results suggest that the recently created fluvial geomorphic forms are key environmental determinants of riparian vegetation distribution patterns. A range of statistical analyses illustrate that some plant species show predictable patterns of occurrence that correspond with the fluvial forms, supporting a fourfold grouping of herbaceous and woody species and the identification of typical plant communities associated with gravel bars, islands, banks, floodplains and terraces. An investigation of the species richness found on different fluvial landforms showed that the highest number of species occurred on the floodplain and decreased gradually towards the channel bed and towards terraces. Investigation of existing conditions in reaches of rivers with natural dynamics of fluvial processes provides valuable information that can be used as an effective tool for planning restoration strategies and precise management. However, the most important finding of this study is the remarkable establishment of complex river corridor vegetationlandform associations within 10 years of a 500-year flood that removed the heavily cultivated landscape that had existed before the event.

AB  - Rapid urbanization in some cities has led to the emergence of numerous subsidiary settlements around their primary cities. Due to this rapid urbanization and growth, there is a great demand for urban land, mostly for commercial, industrial, and residential uses. Urban green spaces and vegetation are at risk due to a large amount of urban land, as seen by a decline in connectivity and increased fragmentation, especially due to land conversion. However, the identification of the spatial and momentary variability in the clustering and fragmentation of vegetation patterns in urban settings has not made full use of local indicators of spatial distribution measurements, such as Baqubah, a city in Iraq. Since it is essential to measure the degree of fragmentation and evaluate urban expansion trajectories consistently, this study proposes a new approach to assessing the anticipated direction of urban extension, using the fragmentation indicator of built-up patterns in urban areas. Sentinel-2 data was used to map the fragmented urban centres and their future extent in the city at a single time point. The proposed method employs indices to capture the initial distribution of spatial patterns of vegetation cover and built-up areas. The main extracted land cover classes, landscape fragmentation performance, and surface density analysis were accomplished in ArcGIS. The results indicate that the entire built-up area in Baqubah has a high degree of fragmentation at 75%, and about 23% of the open space within the urban extent of the city. Two predicted trajectories of urban expansion were also revealed: one may follow the external road direction, while the other is multi-directional, commencing from the edges of the built-up area. The study concludes that the new method is useful for comprehending and assessing urban landscape fragmentation, as well as anticipating its path. This integrated approach to remote sensing and GIS can sufficiently and effectively determine priority urban regions for successful planning and management. In addition, our study's findings highlight the potential of the suggested strategy as a useful spatially explicit method for determining the spatial clustering and fragmentation of urban landscape patterns.

AB  - This research presents the connecting method for the ecological network among the selected areas through the evaluation of the connectivity of the classified urban green space in Seoul. The study was divided into two; 1st stage of the classification of the types of greens and 2nd stage of the evaluation of connectivity. In the stage of classification of the type of the greens, the research evaluated the diversity of the vegetation and the value of the possibility of inhabitation of wild birds and then, classified the greens into a core green, which is a patch, base green, and connecting or stepping stone-type green, which is a corridor, in aspect of the landscape ecology. In the evaluation of connectivity, the research also selected and classified the areas for ecological network and suggested the connecting method by conducting the evaluation based on a gravity model with indexes such as area index, conference index, and fractal index, in order to find the relationship between the greens.

AB  - Anthropogenic mortality of wildlife is typically inferred from measures of the absolute decline in population numbers. However, increasing evidence suggests that indirect demographic effects including changes to the age, sex, and social structure of populations, as well as the behavior of survivors, can profoundly impact population health and viability. Specifically, anthropogenic mortality of wildlife (especially when unsustainable) and fragmentation of the spatial distribution of individuals (home-ranges) could disrupt natal dispersal mechanisms, with long-term consequences to genetic structure, by compromising outbreeding behavior and gene flow. We investigate this threat in African leopards (Panthera pardus pardus), a polygynous felid with male-biased natal dispersal. Using a combination of spatial (home-range) and genetic (21 polymorphic microsatellites) data from 142 adult leopards, we contrast the structure of two South African populations with markedly different histories of anthropogenically linked mortality. Home-range overlap, parentage assignment, and spatio-genetic autocorrelation together show that historical exploitation of leopards in a recovering protected area has disrupted and reduced subadult male dispersal, thereby facilitating opportunistic male natal philopatry, with sons establishing territories closer to their mothers and sisters. The resultant kin-clustering in males of this historically exploited population is comparable to that of females in a well-protected reserve and has ultimately led to localized inbreeding. Our findings demonstrate novel evidence directly linking unsustainable anthropogenic mortality to inbreeding through disrupted dispersal in a large, solitary felid and expose the genetic consequences underlying this behavioral change. We therefore emphasize the importance of managing and mitigating the effects of unsustainable exploitation on local populations and increasing habitat fragmentation between contiguous protected areas by promoting in situ recovery and providing corridors of suitable habitat that maintain genetic connectivity.

AB  - The ecological impacts of landscape modification and urbanisation have transformed the composition of plant and animal assemblages, and altered the condition of ecosystems globally. Landscape transformation influences the spatial distribution of species and ecological functions by selecting for generalist species with wide ecological niches, which can adapt to opportunities in highly-modified environments. These effects of landscape modification can shape functional diversity on land, but it is not clear whether they have similar functional consequences in the sea. We used estuaries as a model system to test how landscape transformation alters functional diversity in coastal seascapes, and measured how variation in level of urbanisation, catchment modification and habitat loss influenced fish diversity across thirty-nine estuaries in eastern Australia. Fish were surveyed with baited remote underwater video stations and functional diversity was indexed with three metrics that describe variation in the functional traits and niche space of assemblages. The extent of landscape transformation in the catchment of each estuary was associated with variation in the functional diversity of estuarine fish assemblages. These effects were, however, not what we expected as functional diversity was highest in modified estuaries that supported a large area of both urban and grazing land in their catchments, were bordered by a small area of natural terrestrial vegetation and that contained a moderate area of mangroves. Zoobenthivores and omnivores dominated assemblages in highly-modified estuaries, and piscivorous fishes were common in natural waterways. Our results demonstrate, that the modification and urbanisation of ecosystems on land can alter functional diversity in the sea. Intense landscape transformation appears to select for abundant generalists with wide trophic niches, and against species with specialised diets, and we suggest that these changes might have fundamental consequences for ecosystem functioning in estuaries, and other highly modified seascapes.

AB  - In karst multi-mountainous areas, there are a large number of urban remnant mountains (URMs) in urban builtup areas, which are an important part of urban green space system and have important and unique ecosystem service functions. However, the densifying development inside the city has been leading to the reduction of the number and area of the URMs and the decrease of the connectivity of the urban green space system, resulting in the fragile urban ecological environment. The construction and optimization of ecological network (EN) is an effective way to protect important urban ecological patches and improve the stability of urban green space ecosystem. Taking the central area of Anshun, a typical multi-mountainous city, as the study area, based on the land use data of 2007, 2012 and 2017, the ecological sources were identified by morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and the potential ecological corridors were extracted by the minimum cumulative resistance model (MCR), and the ENs of the three periods were identified. 18 ecological sources were selected for each of the three periods, with a total area of 833.67 hm2, 713.25 hm2 and 806.85 hm2, respectively and the intersection area of ecological sources reached 650.58 hm2. The ecological corridors and ecological sources dwindled with time. The Gravity model was used to extract the important EN corridor, the InVEST model was used to quantify the comprehensive habitat quality. The EN was optimized by adding extra ecological sources, mending ecological breakpoints and extracting habitat quality map patches. It is suggested to add 6 ecological sources and 34 ecological corridors, protect ecological nodes and build stepping stone patches. The results of this study could not only provide a scientific and reasonable basis for the ecological protection and the development of ecological protection strategies in the urban central area of Anshun, but also enrich the theoretical research of urban biodiversity conservation planning and ecological restoration practice in multi-mountainous cities.

AB  - In the Burwash area of north-central Ontario, Canada, expansion of the Trans-Canada highway from 2 to 4 lanes was accompanied by installation of a range of wildlife collision-mitigation infrastructure (e.g., exclusion fencing, underpasses). To assess the overall effectiveness of these measures, we monitored the spatial distribution and mortality rates of elk (Cervus canadensis) prior to and following highway expansion, distinguished by season (winter, snowfree) and corridor-type (highway, railway). We measured herd-level risk by the proportion of positions falling within 200-m railway and highway buffer zones using Bayesian methods. Spatial analysis confirmed that there was a distinct northward shift in the winter distribution of elk following construction, situating the elk past the north end of the exclusion fence. This increased the herd's exposure to highway traffic by 3.6 times (proportion of points before = 0.0041 +/- 0.002 [SE], after = 0.0147 +/- 0.003, P = 0.005), and resulted in a more than 2-fold increase in elk road mortality from 0.6 elk/yr/20 km during 8 years prior to implementation to 1.5 elk/yr/20 km during 8 years after implementation. Exposure to railways remained unchanged and consistently higher than highway exposure regardless of season (e.g., post-mitigation, winter proportion of points = 0.0453 +/- 0.005), matched by consistently high mortality counts (proportion of points before = 6.4 elk/yr/20 km, after = 6.6 elk/yr/20 km). Our results demonstrate that while wildlife-vehicle collision mitigation is generally beneficial to wildlife and humans, failure to account for the local characteristics of wildlife populations can lead to suboptimal mitigation designs that reduce their effectiveness and lead to unintended wildlife impacts.

AB  - Many organisms are threatened by global climate change, but as sessile organisms, plants are particularly vulnerable. Unable to individually move to areas with more suitable conditions as the climate changes, plants must instead rely on their seeds dispersing far and often in order to migrate fast enough to keep pace with the changing climate. The fragmentation of natural landscapes by clearing for agricultural or urban development, or a species' requirement for particular soil types or topography, makes this migration even more problematic. The likelihood of a plant species persisting will thus depend on factors such as the rate of climate change, the degree of landscape fragmentation, and also the plant species' lifecycle, seed production, dispersal, and establishment. This paper presents a dynamic model, called PPunCC (Plant Persistence under Climate Change), that represents the important factors and processes likely to affect a plant species' capacity to migrate across a landscape fast enough to avoid extinction. We use the model to show that creating large-scale corridors that increase the connectivity of fragmented landscapes through targeted restoration could help species migrate naturally and find suitable environments in new climates. We also examine the effect of varying the key point of vulnerability within its lifecycle between juvenile establishment, adult mortality or seed production and conclude that this has a relatively minor effect on the prognosis for the plant and does not affect the predicted benefits of restoration.

AB  - Conservation actions frequently need to be scheduled because both funding and implementation capacity are limited. Two approaches to scheduling are possible. Maximizing gain (MaxGain) which attempts to maximize representation with protected areas, or minimizing loss (MinLoss) which attempts to minimize total loss both inside and outside protected areas. Conservation planners also choose between setting priorities based solely on biodiversity pattern and considering surrogates for biodiversity processes such as connectivity. We address both biodiversity processes and habitat loss in a scheduling framework by comparing four different prioritization strategies defined by MaxGain and MinLoss applied to biodiversity patterns and processes to solve the dynamic area selection problem with variable area cost. We compared each strategy by estimating predicted species' occurrences within a landscape after 20 years of incremental reservation and loss of habitat. By incorporating species-specific responses to fragmentation, we found that you could improve the performance of conservation strategies. MinLoss was the best approach for conserving both biodiversity pattern and process. However, due to the spatial autocorrelation of habitat loss, reserves selected with this approach tended to become more isolated through time; losing up to 40% of occurrences of edge-sensitive species. Additionally, because of the positive correlation between threats and land cost, reserve networks designed with this approach contained smaller and fewer reserves compared with networks designed with a MaxGain approach. We suggest a possible way to account for the negative effect of fragmentation by considering both local and neighbourhood vulnerability to habitat loss. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Electric powerline corridors are informal green spaces that encompass large areas of land and have the potential to support biodiversity in urban and suburban landscapes. However, the extent to which these corridors provide novel habitats compared to the surrounding landscape is unclear. Biodiversity in corridors is often compared to that of "natural" habitats despite the fact that the corridors are subject to frequent vegetation management. In urban and suburban landscapes, residential yards may provide a more appropriate comparison because they are a dominant type of green space and are also characterized by frequent vegetation management. We conducted a study of the biodiversity in suburban powerline corridors in northern Illinois, USA, and compared it to the biodiversity found in nearby residential yards. Our goal was to determine whether powerline corridors added ecological value to these suburban landscapes. We included three different management styles of powerline corridors: (1) frequently mowed and kept as lawn, (2) brush mowed on a five-year cycle ("old-field"), and (3) restored and/or maintained as native prairie. We measured the species richness and composition of plants, birds, and insect pollinators in corridors and yards. The corridor management types and comparison yards differed significantly in the richness of all three taxa, with old-field and/or prairie sites having greater species richness than mown corridors and/or comparison yards. Community composition also differed by management category. While the species richness of old-field sites tended to be high, prairie sites generally had more species of conservation interest. Our study shows that both old-field- and prairie-managed powerline corridors add habitat value to Midwestern U.S. suburban landscapes by providing alternative habitat types that support many species. Nonetheless, we suggest that managers looking to specifically support native and/or grassland specialist species in this region should manage sites as prairies when possible.

AB  - To understand the potential financial cost of acquiring lands within a proposed reserve network for the Sierra Nevada, CA, USA, we used an assessors GIS database to estimate the acquisition cost in one county within the network to be US$ 2.5 billion. When only larger parcels were selected for the reserve network, the cost of the network decreased exponentially as the size-threshold for parcel selection increased, while the total area of the network decreased only linearly. Although acquiring only larger parcels may make sense financially, it does not result in adequate habitat representation because the spatial distribution of parcels is such that the lower elevation oak woodland and mid-elevation conifer forests tend to be on smaller parcels, which fall below the larger size thresholds and the resulting potential reserve areas are fragmented. Then, for the area surrounding the two major highways that cross the Sierra Nevada, we identified seventeen road barrier areas and six urban conflict areas that pose major, but possibly mitigable barriers to wildlife movement at different time scales. We propose that (1) wildlife conflicts with highway traffic could be feasibly mitigated by installing wildlife overcrossings at the identified locations and (2) constraints on development rather than land acquisition are necessary to protect biodiversity. Finally, we suggest that a combination of highway crossings and restrictions on land-use may be the cheapest way to protect biodiversity in the Sierra Nevada. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

KW  - VEGETATION
KW  - DISTURBANCE
AB  - Natural vegetation in urban environments is greatly impacted by human activities and it is in constant threat of degradation and destruction as a result of urbanisation. This vegetation, although fragmented, serves an important ecological function and needs to be properly managed and conserved. Studies on urban vegetation are lacking in South Africa, with only a handful having been carried out since the end of the last century. This study was initiated to identify, classify and describe the grassland communities of the urban open spaces in Bloemfontein. Releves were compiled in 61 sample plots, where species present and habitat information were recorded. Care was taken to restrict sample plots to vegetation in pristine condition, wherever possible, and severely degraded stands were avoided. A two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures, revealed two distinct major communities, seven communities and four sub-communities. Both detrended and canonical correspondence analyses indicated the vegetation units to be associated with soil texture and pH, although biotic factors such as overgrazing, burning and mowing also influence the composition of the vegetation. The proper management and conservation of urban open spaces requires in-depth knowledge of the spatial distribution, floristic, structural and functional compositions within the major vegetation types in this environment. The present study further contributed towards formulating ways for the proper management, utilisation and functioning of the open spaces within the Bloemfontein area.
   Conservation implications: The Grassland Biome of South Africa is poorly conserved, mainly because of its status as an agricultural hub of the country. The preservation of natural and semi-natural forms of urban vegetation is important because such vegetation, although often disturbed and degraded, could form dispersal corridors between peri-urban and rural vegetation.

AB  - Because ecosystem approaches to management adhere to ecological systems rather than human-defined boundaries, collaboration across jurisdiction, agencies, and land ownership is often necessary to achieve effective management of transboundary resources. Local natural resource and land use planners increasingly recognize that while ecosystem management requires looking beyond specific jurisdictions and focusing on broad spatial scales, the approach will partly be implemented at the local level with the coordination of local policies across larger landscapes. This article evaluates the collective capabilities of local jurisdictions to manage large transboundary ecological systems in Florida. Specifically, it combines plan evaluation with geographic information systems (GIS) techniques to map, measure, and analyze the existing mosaic of management across selected ecosystems in the southern portion of the State. Visual and statistical results indicate significant gaps in the management framework of southern Florida that, if filled, could achieve a greater level of consistency and more complete coverage of ecosystem management policies. Based on the spatial distribution of 58 ecosystem management indicators, notable gaps persist in the southwest coast, southeast coast, and central Everglades ecosystems, particularly for wildlife corridors and collaboration with neighboring jurisdictions. We also test for spatial autocorrelation of ecosystem planning scores and find that local jurisdictions with strong ecosystem management capabilities tend to cluster within specific ecosystems. Based on the findings, we make recommendations on how and where local plans can be strengthened to more effectively attain the objectives of ecosystem approaches to management.

AB  - Deforestation is one of the processes that most impact the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. In Mexico and Guatemala, deforestation continues to increase at alarming rates, but there are still regions where extended areas of conserved vegetation persist, such as the Usumacinta River basin. Throughout history, various protected areas (PA) have been designated in this basin; however, anthropogenic activities put its natural heritage at risk. This research aimed to analyze the current status and process of forest cover loss in the region and compare it within and outside PA, as well as among different PA administrations. In 2000, 75% of the basin's area was covered by some type of tree-dominated plant community. Over the following 18 years, this area was reduced by 27%. Most of this forest loss occurred in Guatemalan territory. Although the net forest loss was higher in unprotected areas than in protected areas in Guatemala, the opposite pattern was observed in terms of the annual rate of forest loss. In the case of Mexico, forest loss was higher in unprotected areas in terms of both net forest loss and annual rates. Additionally, in both countries, PA under the administration of municipal authorities showed the lowest forest loss rates. This study showed that deforestation is an ongoing process in the Usumacinta basin with a heterogeneous spatial distribution, where PA have had different capabilities in helping conserve its forest cover. This information will be essential for binational conservation strategies aimed at preserving forest connectivity in the region.

AB  - Little is known about manta ray population size, structure and connectivity in the Philippines. In collaboration with dive operators, non-governmental organizations and authorities, sightings of manta rays were collated into a single national database. Using in-water photographs and videos gathered through citizen science and dedicated research efforts, this study compiled sightings between 2004 and 2020, showing 22 separate sites throughout the archipelago with manta rays present. A total of 392 individual reef manta rays (Mobula alfredi) and 107 oceanic manta rays (Mobula birostris) were identified from the collected footage. Four specific sites in the provinces of Masbate and Palawan together hosted 89% of all identified individuals and accounted for 95% of sightings, highlighting these areas are key aggregation sites. This study also reports the movements of M. birostris within the Philippines, based on photo-identification of three individuals moving 150 km between Cebu and Masbate. Despite the growing number of recreational divers in Daanbantayan and San Jacinto, an 80% decline in M. birostris sightings was observed at these sites. To ensure effective future conservation, it is recommended that efforts focus on the identification and protection of manta ray hotspots and migratory corridors, the creation of a sustainable tourism framework and, most important, the implementation of mitigation strategies to reduce fisheries interactions.

AB  - While urban ecology is an expanding field of study, some natural areas within the urban environment remain under-examined. These include naturally regenerating forest communities adjacent to urban interstates. In addition, the status of interstate soils and their relationships with the community composition of forested interstate verges has received little ecological study. The purpose of this study was to examine variation in soil conditions along forested interstate corridors in Louisville, KY and to explore the extent to which soil characteristics (e.g., bulk density, pH) and heavy metals (e.g., Pb, Zn) vary with respect to three factors: interstate (e.g., traffic density), surrounding urban environment (e.g., industrial land use), and interstate construction legacies. Additionally, we explored the relationships between several edaphic factors and woody vegetation structure in these forested verges. We found that the degree and direction of the slope of land towards the interstate and the distance to the interstate pavement were strong determinants of soil characteristics and heavy metal concentrations, suggesting that the movement of de-icing salts, heavy metals, and other pollutants from the interstate was important in determining forest soil conditions along urban interstates. Since within our study area these highways did not extend into rural lands, variation in urban land uses and cover within 26 km of the city center was not large enough to explain variation in soil characteristics or heavy metals, except for a positive correlation between chromium and surrounding industrial land use. We did find that past physical soil disturbance caused by interstate construction (e.g., imported fill) left an important legacy on soil characteristics, heavy metal retention, and woody plant growth patterns in forests adjacent to urban interstates. The legacy of interstate construction on the current forest community structure (e.g., lower species richness) and the future forest (e.g., reduced tree regeneration) may further alter ecosystem productivity and ecosystem services provided by these forests and their soils.

AB  - The ecological quality of urban is a key standard to evaluate a modern urban. So far many methods have been used to understand environment quality of urban. Some ground information can he obtained directly with the help of the Remote Sensing (RS). The ground thermal radiant is the immediate embodiment of the energy transition of the urban system, then the ground situation could be seen clearly with RS inspecting the ground thermal radiant. Employing Remote Sensing data ETM+ of Guiyang in China on Nov 1(st) 2000, we set up the index of thermal radiant to study the thermal codition and used interpreting mothed to obtain the information of land cover such as the vegetation status, the urban construction volume ratio and water percentage. After analyzing these data, the following results can be acquired: Firstly, ground thermal radiant reflects the character of the urban ground cover. In the urban ecological environment, ground thermal radiant mainly reflects the density of the building the percentage of greenland and water in urban, which indicate the urban ecological environment. The thermal radiant indexes of water, Greenland, road and building are 1.19; 1.20,1.24 and 1.27. So the 1.24 is reasonably regarded as a critical point of the thermal radiant change and can be used as a standard to distinguish the grade of ecological quality in Guiyang. Secondly according to the analysis of the ground thermal radiant and urban greenland spatial distribution, there are two urban greenland ecological corridor discovered in Guiyang Urban. Besides, in order to improve the urban ecological environment and reduce the ground thermal radiant, the Greenland in eight regions in GuiYang should be advised to be built up.

AB  - The evolution of land surface temperatures (LSTs) within the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) is examined with respect to patterns of urbanization from 2000 to 2019. Change detection as well as examinations of five periods within the 20 years yield insights into the spatial patterning of surface urban heat (SUH) within the BMR. Results suggest that the LSTs in portions of the BMR have increased more than 5 degrees C during the 20-year period. The spatial distribution of SUH exhibits a pattern where high LSTs occur outward and primarily westward from the urban core along highways serving as development corridors and related regions of rapid urbanization. Nighttime LSTs have not increased as markedly as daytime; however, several noted "hotspots" have intensified over time and are located in districts along the southern seaboard. The greatest LST increase through the 20-year period is located in the northwest of the Bangkok urban core in Bang Kruai and Mueang Nonthaburi. A close investigation of this area indicates that the LST hotspots are co-located with rapid urban expansion into the area that has been facilitated by the destruction of orchards and other agriculture lands from a flood that occurred in 2011. The significant changes in land cover from orchards and agriculture to urban and built-up have led to the large increases in LSTs within the region.

AB  - Land allocation for urban growth is central to sustainable development strategy because urban growth can impact space available for food production, ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. Urbanization is a growing stressor due the 2.5 billion additional people projected to live in urban areas by 2050. Potential climate change impacts to natural systems increase the need for sustainable urbanization, which should integrate land use needs for urban growth with climate adaptation objectives such as maintaining biodiversity, food production and ecosystem services. Here we compare climate-neutral and climate-adaptive urbanization scenarios to see which produces the most sustainable urbanization, defined as being the most effective at meeting development, conservation, and two climate adaptation objectives. We modeled five urban growth scenarios portraying an increase of 25.8 million people by 2050 for California, USA comprising three climate-neutral scenarios: business-as-usual, compact-new-growth and infill (redevelopment); and two climate-adaptive scenarios: preservation of agricultural climate refugia or future plant dispersal corridors. Infill was the least impacting for the multiple objectives tested; preserving 46-57% more land for other uses. Each climate-adaptive scenario reduced land consumption for its respective target, but increased impacts to the opposite climate-adaptive scenario target. Infill has the potential to contribute towards sustainable urbanization, particularly if combined with other climate adaptation targets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecological network studies are providing important advances about the organization, stability and dynamics of ecological systems. However, the ecological networks approach is being integrated very slowly in plant community ecology, even though the first studies on plant facilitation networks (FNs) were published more than a decade ago. The study of interaction networks between established plants and plants recruiting beneath them, which we call Recruitment Networks (RNs), can provide new insights on mechanisms driving plant community structure and dynamics. RNs basically describe which plants recruit under which others, so they can be seen as a generalisation of the classic FNs since they do not imply any particular effect (positive, negative or neutral) of the established plants on recruiting ones. RNs summarise information on the structure of sapling banks. More importantly, the information included in RNs can be incorporated into models of replacement dynamics to evaluate how different aspects of network structure, or different mechanisms of network assembly, may affect plant community stability and species coexistence. To allow an efficient development of the study of FNs and RNs, here we unify concepts, synthesise current knowledge, clarify some conceptual issues, and propose basic methodological guidelines to standardise sampling methods that could make future studies of these networks directly comparable.

AB  - Insects are key components of urban ecological networks and are greatly impacted by anthropogenic activities. Yet, few studies have examined how insect functional groups respond to changes to urban vegetation associated with different management actions. We investigated the response of herbivorous and predatory heteropteran bugs to differences in vegetation structure and diversity in golf courses, gardens and parks. We assessed how the species richness of these groups varied amongst green space types, and the effect of vegetation volume and plant diversity on trophic-and species-specific occupancy. We found that golf courses sustain higher species richness of herbivores and predators than parks and gardens. At the trophic-and species-specific levels, herbivores and predators show strong positive responses to vegetation volume. The effect of plant diversity, however, is distinctly species-specific, with species showing both positive and negative responses. Our findings further suggest that high occupancy of bugs is obtained in green spaces with specific combinations of vegetation structure and diversity. The challenge for managers is to boost green space conservation value through actions promoting synergistic combinations of vegetation structure and diversity. Tackling this conservation challenge could provide enormous benefits for other elements of urban ecological networks and people that live in cities.

AB  - With the advancement of urbanization, the stress on the green infrastructure around the urban agglomeration has intensified, which causes severe ecological problems. The uncertainty of urban growth makes it difficult to achieve effective protection only by setting protection red lines and other rigid measures. It is of practical significance to optimize the resilience of the stressed green infrastructure. To this end, we explore a scenario simulation analysis method for the resilience management of green infrastructure under stress. This research applies artificial neural network cellular automata to simulate the impacts of the Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomeration expansion on the green infrastructure in 2030 in three scenarios: no planning control, urban planning control, and ecological protection planning control. Based on the analysis, we identify four green infrastructure areas under stress and formulate resilience management measures, respectively. The results show that: (1) The distribution pattern of green infrastructure under stress is different in three scenarios. Even in the scenario of ecological protection planning and control, urban growth can easily break through the ecological protection boundary; (2) Residential, industrial, and traffic facility land are the main types of urban land causing green infrastructure stress, while forest, shrub, and wetland are the main types of the stressed green infrastructure; (3) Efficient protection of green infrastructure and the management of the urban growth boundary should be promoted by resilient management measures such as urban planning adjustment, regulatory detailed planning, development strength control and setting up the ecological protection facilities for the stressed green infrastructure areas of the planning scenarios and the no-planning control scenarios, for the areas to be occupied by urban land, and for the important ecological corridors. The results of this study provide an empirical foundation for formulating policies and the methods of this study can be applied to urban ecological planning and green infrastructure management practice in other areas as well.

AB  - Global biodiversity and land conservation initiatives rely on an accurate understanding of the spatial distribution of species populations and communities. Identifying the spatial habitat use of wildlife communities across land uses and levels of human modification provides the opportunity to produce more efficient and effectual conservation plans. Our goal was to model breeding bird community occupancy across a complete spectrum of human land use modification to determine the habitat characteristics that best maximized the conservation of bird diversity. We used repeatvisit point counts on private and public lands to record the detection/non-detection of breeding bird species across the land use gradient. We modeled multiple proportional land cover and landscape structure covariates and employed a hierarchical multi-species occupancy model to analyze the habitat use of each species and to estimate guild-level species richness dynamics across the study area. We detected a total of 70 breeding bird species and our model estimated a total of 78 species within the total metacommunity. We found that insectivorous species richness was lowest in urban and suburban areas (x = 7), but highest on multiple use working lands with low to moderate levels of human modification (x = 22), not in the fully preserved protected areas (x = 16). In contrast, the richness of the predominately human commensal omnivorous species was highest in urban and suburban areas (x = 10) and across much of the more human modified landscape and lowest in the preserved lands (x = 3). Moderately disturbed working lands, which primarily consisted of a mixture of rotating silvicultural tracts, agriculture, low density housing, and riparian corridors, supported the most species (x = 36) and were especially important for the occupancy of breeding neotropical insectivores. These findings highlight the potential conservation benefits for incorporating private working lands with multiple land uses and land covers into future conservation planning scenarios, both for their wildlife conservation potential and as buffers around traditional protected areas.

AB  - Indonesia has recently been faced with a number of great problems: poverty, natural disasters such as tsunami, earthquakes, flooding and typhoons, volcanic eruptions, loss of biodiversity, decreasing water quality and quantity, increased pollution, and aesthetic degradation of the landscape. These disturbances have been caused by rapid changes in land use and land cover, deforestation, the application of monoculture farming systems in commercial agriculture, urbanization, industrialization, and other types of infrastructure development. The government, urban communities and companies have promoted some programs to ameliorate the problem of environmental degradation. The government has ratified law no. 26/2007 as a commitment to sustainability; this law ensures that cities are obliged to provide green open spaces covering a minimum of 30% of urbanized areas. Many metropolitan cities have feverishly enacted policies to promote greening programs, such as those applied in Jakarta. However, a new town-Sentul City-has engaged in policies that aim to create a well-designed eco-city with urban greenery and ecological networks. This new policy is supposed to herald a better future for urban quality. It is expected that green spaces will provide environmental services: water resource management, biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, and landscape beauty.

AB  - Small parks in cities are important to support overall urban biodiversity and ecological network. The aim of this paper is to introduce a method of identifying and assessing the ecological characteristics and anthropogenic factors of small urban parks. We developed a framework that combined structured observation and field measurement. The method suggests an integrative assessment that is practical and understandable to the park planners and managers to enhance small parks to support overall urban biodiversity and ecosystem services. High biodiversity can provide opportunities for humans to experience nature and wildlife in cities, thus contributing to the quality of life of urban dwellers. (C) 2016. The Authors.

AB  - The effect of repetitive sub-concussive head impact exposure in contact sports like American football on brain health is poorly understood, especially in the understudied populations of youth and high school players. These players, aged 9-18 years old may be particularly susceptible to impact exposure as their brains are undergoing rapid maturation. This study helps fill the void by quantifying the association between head impact exposure and functional connectivity, an important aspect of brain health measurable via resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). The contributions of this paper are three fold. First, the data from two separate studies (youth and high school) are combined to form a high-powered analysis with 60 players. These players experience head acceleration within overlapping impact exposure making their combination particularly appropriate. Second, multiple features are extracted from rs-fMRI and tested for their association with impact exposure. One type of feature is the power spectral density decomposition of intrinsic, spatially distributed networks extracted via independent components analysis (ICA). Another feature type is the functional connectivity between brain regions known often associated with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Third, multiple supervised machine learning algorithms are evaluated for their stability and predictive accuracy in a low bias, nested cross-validation modeling framework. Each classifier predicts whether a player sustained low or high levels of head impact exposure. The nested cross validation reveals similarly high classification performance across the feature types, and the Support Vector, Extremely randomized trees, and Gradboost classifiers achieve F1-score up to 75%.

AB  - Even though information on global biodiversity trends becomes increasingly available, large taxonomic and spatial data gaps persist at the scale relevant to planning conservation interventions. This is because data collectors are hesitant to share data with global repositories due to workload, lack of incentives, and perceived risk of losing intellectual property rights. In contrast, due to greater conceptual and methodological proximity, taxon-specific database initiatives can provide more direct benefits to data collectors through research collaborations and shared authorship. The IUCNSSC Ape Populations, Environments and Surveys (A.P.E.S.) database was created in 2005 as a repository for data on great apes and other primate taxa. It aims to acquire field survey data and make different types of data accessible, and provide up-to-date species status information. To support the current update of the conservation action plan for western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) we compiled field surveys for this taxon from IUCN SSC A.P.E.S., 75% of which were unpublished. We used spatial modeling to infer total population size, range-wide density distribution, population connectivity and landscape-scale metrics. We estimated a total abundance of 52 800 (95% CI 17 577-96 564) western chimpanzees, of which only 17% occurred in national parks. We also found that 10% of chimpanzees live within 25 km of four multi-national 'development corridors' currently planned for West Africa. These large infrastructure projects aim to promote economic integration and agriculture expansion, but are likely to cause further habitat loss and reduce population connectivity. We close by demonstrating the wealth of conservation-relevant information derivable from a taxon-specific database like IUCN SSC A.P.E.S. and propose that a network of many more such databases could be created to provide the essential information to conservation that can neither be supplied by one-off projects nor by global repositories, and thus are highly complementary to existing initiatives.

AB  - For several decades, the sprawling of urbanisation has resulted in the loss of natural habitats and in landscape fragmentation and thus represents one of the main causes of the erosion of biodiversity. Green spaces in urban areas help maintain ecological connectivity and provide ecosystem services to citizens. The impact of urban green spaces on the conservation of biodiversity and their contribution to ecological networks in urban areas have been studied. However, little is known about the area occupied by green spaces at business sites (GSBS) or about their organisation within the urban matrix and their possible contribution to the maintenance of functional connectivity at local and regional scales.
   This study analysed the evolution in the dynamics and locations of business sites over the past 30 years in the Ile-de-France region. Cartographic data allowed us to identify GSBS which spanned 8700 ha and represented 8% of the urban green spaces forming the herbaceous network. Using a graph theoretic modelling approach, we quantified the potential contribution of GSBS to regional connectivity. We demonstrated that GSBS did not add to connectivity in terms of total area but rather through the density of the links that these sites shared with other green spaces or via their strategic position in the network, i.e., their capacity to serve as stepping stones. The contribution of GSBS was greatest in suburban and pericentral sectors, where most business activities have been developed in the past 30 years and land resources remain available for green space development.

AB  - As the human activity footprint grows, land-use decisions play an increasing role in determining the future of plant and animal species. Studies have shown that urban and agricultural development cannot only harm species populations directly through habitat destruction, but also by destroying the corridors that connect habitat patches and populations within a metapopulation. Without these pathways, populations can encounter inbreeding depression and degeneration, which can increase death rates and lower rates of reproduction. This article describes the development and application of the FRAGGLE model, a spatial system dynamics model designed to calculate connectivity indices among populations. FRAGGLE can help planners and managers identify the relative contribution of populations associated with habitat patches to future populations in those patches, taking into account the importance of interstitial land to migration success. The model is applied to the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus), a threatened species whose southeastern U.S. distribution has diminished significantly within its native range due to agricultural and urban development over the last several decades. This model is parameterized with life history and movement traits of the gopher tortoise in order to simulate population demographics and spatial distribution within an area in west-central Georgia that supports a significant tortoise population. The implications of this simulation modeling effort are demonstrated using simple landscape representations and a hypothetical on land-use management scenario. Our findings show that development resulting in even limited habitat losses (10%) may lead to significant increases in fragmentation as measured by a loss in the rate of dispersions (31%) among area subpopulations.

AB  - Urban ecological networks are defined differently in ecology, urban planning and landscape ecology, but they all have linearity and linkage in common. Early urban representations evolved from the constraints of deep ecological structure in the landscape to built elements that must work around natural linear obstacles-rivers, coastlines, dunes, cliffs, hills and valley swamps. Village commons were linked by roads. The Industrial Revolution led to accelerating urban growth, where the role of open space focussed on public health and transport. The Renaissance, Baroque and Picturesque movements accentuated networks in wooded parks, boulevards and sweeping riverine vistas. These provided a new aesthetic and sense of grandeur in the urban centres of European empires and later their colonies. Grafted onto this visual connectivity has been an awakened ecological understanding of spatial dynamics. The emergent notion of ecological corridor functionality provided support for green linear features, although initially this was based on untested theory. The idea of organisms moving along green highways seemed logical, but only recently has unequivocal empirical evidence emerged that demonstrates this functionality. Nevertheless, the main role of corridors may be to provide habitat rather than to act as connectors of nodal habitats. Most organisms can utilise stepping stones, and these may accommodate desired meta-populations while deterring pest movement. Swale drains and treatment wetlands provide riparian services and serve as biodiversity corridors. However, to most people the obvious function is visual-providing green fingers through what would otherwise be urban grey. The health benefits of these are have been demonstrated to be psychological as much as biophysical.

AB  - China has rapidly expanded economically and spatially in recent years; the booming construction industry necessary to support this growth has significantly impacted the country's ecological future. This study was conducted to determine the ecological stress of construction lands in terms of quantity and spatial locations under the landscape ecology concepts of "Quantity-Oriented Ecological Stress" (QOES) and "Location-Oriented Ecological Stress" (LOES). We first provide a brief introduction of the study area (Southern Jiangsu, Eastern China) followed by a discussion of the methodology and data processing techniques applied. We next examine the spatial heterogeneity of ecological suitability (ES) from the perspective of ecological process analysis and divide Southern Jiangsu into five ecological zones with different ES levels. We then classify construction lands based on their spatial distribution in different ecological zones. We calculated county-level LOES and compared it against QOES; we also discuss our research contributions and policy implications in regard to the spatial allocation of construction lands. The locations of construction lands are of significance to ecological safety, and location effects correspond to the spatial heterogeneity of regional ecosystems. A location-oriented evaluation more objectively reflects the ecological stress of construction lands expansion than a quantity-oriented evaluation. Optimizing land development practices serves not only to control the quantity of construction lands but also the construction lands concession and ecological restoration in areas with high ES.

AB  - The maintenance and enhancement of connectivity for multispecies is a challenging issue for biodiversity conservation and landscape planning. It is well-known that different elements of the landscape matrix provide different levels of permeability to species moving across the landscape, but such effects may be species-specific. Whilst the spatial articulation of connectivity corridors is highly dependent on how we define them, and which species group we intended to provide connectivity for, it is also important to understand the optimal land cover mix to promote the maximum number of species. We demonstrate an approach to (1) identifying multispecies networks and examine how it compares to previous network approaches for a case study city of Sheffield, UK and (2) developing specific proposals for how green networks in Sheffield could be improved. We modelled least-cost corridors for four bird, three mammal and three reptile species. After validating the derived corridors, we created a union of least-cost corridors that identified the multispecies connectivity zones and compared the derived multispecies networks with the pre-existing networks (Sheffield City Council - the Green Network and the Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust- the Living Don ecological network). We found that a particular mix of land covers (particularly, woodlands, mixed vegetation and unimproved grassland) have a high potential to provide corridors for the maximum number of species around the edges of the city centre or the suburbs. A significant proportion of the Green Network and the Living Don ecological network coincide spatially with these land covers. Based on the comparisons of the derived and existing corridors, we discuss specific proposals for how Sheffield green networks could be improved and which areas to prioritise. Utilising species relevant connectivity models which incorporate a group of species with complementary and contrasting habitat requirements will enable a much more complete picture of potential landscape connectivity across the landscape and more informed decisions for biodiversity conservation and landscape planning.

AB  - Increasing urbanization degrades quantity, quality, and the functionality of spatial cohesion of natural areas essential to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning worldwide. The uncontrolled pace of building activity and the erosion of blue (i.e., aquatic) and green (i.e., terrestrial) landscape elements threaten existing habitat ranges and movability of wildlife. Local scale measures, such as nature-inspired engineered Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) are emerging mitigation solutions. Originally planned to promote sustainable stormwater management, adaptation to climate change and improved human livability in cities, such instruments offer interesting syn-ergies for biodiversity in support of existing ecological infrastructure. BGI are especially appealing for globally declining amphibians, a rich and diverse vertebrate assemblage sensitive to urbanization. We integrated bio-logical and highly resolved urban-rural land-cover data, ensemble models of habitat suitability, and connectivity models based on circuit theory to improve multi-scale and multi-species protection of core habitats and ecological corridors in the Swiss lowlands. Considering a broad spectrum of amphibian biodiversity, we iden-tified distributions of amphibian biodiversity hotspots and four landscape elements essential to amphibian movability at the regional scale, namely i) forest edges, ii) wet-forest habitats, iii) soils with variable moisture and iv) riparian zones. Our work shows that cities can make a substantial contribution (e.g., up to 15% of urban space in the study area) to wider landscape habitat connectivity. We highlight the importance of planning BGI locally in strategic locations across urban and peri-urban areas to promote the permeability and availability of 'stepping stone' habitats in densely populated landscapes, essential to the maintenance of regional habitat connectivity and thereby enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Groundwater, accessed using wells and municipal springs, represents the major source of potable water for the human population outside of major urban areas in northwestern Romania, a region with a long history of metal mining and metallurgy. The magnitude and spatial distribution of metal contamination in private-supply groundwater was investigated in four mining-affected river catchments in MaramureAY and Satu Mare Counties through the collection of 144 groundwater samples. Bedrock geology, pH and Eh were found to be important controls on the solubility of metals in groundwater. Peak metal concentrations were found to occur in the LapuAY catchment, where metal levels exceed Dutch target and intervention values in up to 49% and 14% of samples, respectively. A 700 m wide corridor in the LapuAY catchment on either side of the main river channel was identified in which peak Cd (31 mu g l(-1)), Cu (50 mu g l(-1)), Pb (50 mu g l(-1)) and Zn (3,000 mu g l(-1)) concentrations were found to occur. Given the generally similar bedrock geologies, lower metal levels in other catchments are believed to reflect differences in the magnitude of metal loading to the local environment from both metal mining and other industrial and municipal sources. Sampling of groundwater in northwestern Romania has indicated areas of potential concern for human health, where heavy metal concentrations exceed accepted environmental quality guidelines. The presence of elevated metal levels in groundwater also has implications for the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) and achieving 'good' status for groundwater in this part of the Danube River Basin District (RBD).

AB  - Grassland biomass is the embodiment of grassland productivity, and the material basis for the maintenance of the grassland ecosystem. Grassland is the main vegetation type in the Mongolian Plateau. Grassland changes in the core region of the China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor of the Belt and Road Initiative have an important impact on regional ecology, environmental conservation, and sustainable development. This study established three types of models for estimating grassland production through statistical analysis methods using NDVI, EVI, MSAVI, and PsnNet remote sensing indices retrieved from a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) dataset. This was combined with ground-measured grassland data and meteorological data. Based on model evaluation, the spatial and temporal distribution and variation characteristics of grassland along the Mongolia part of the China-Mongolia Railway were obtained through inversion for the period from 2006 to 2015. The results showed that all the models had good simulation effects. The optimal model was an exponential model based on MSAVIwith its simulation accuracy reaching 78%. Grassland production in the study area has increased slightly in the past ten years, with little change in the first five years and a fluctuating increase in the next five years. The average grassland production (per unit production) in the past ten years was 3400.39 kg/ha and the average total production was 9707.88 x 10(4) t. Grassland production increased slightly in most areas along the railway, and in some areas it continued to decline. The regional spatial distribution of increased and decreased grassland production was significantly different. With better grassland resources in the northeastern part of the study areathe area around Chinggis City and the capital of Hentiy Provincehad the most significant growth. However, the southern Gobi areawith its trend towards land degradation in the area where the southern Gobi and desert steppe transitions to steppe and dry steppehad a significant decrease. This meant that the risk of grassland degradation still existed. There were also quantitative and spatial differences in the areas where grassland production decreased on both sides of the railway. The decrease in grassland production on the western side of the railway was more obvious than on the eastern side, and the reduction area was dispersed on the western side and relatively concentrated on the eastern side. In future research, the identification of key areas of grassland degradation along the China-Mongolia Railway as well as its driving forces should be investigated further.

AB  - Land-use transformations altering the ecosystem function have impacted the sustenance of natural resources. Implementation of unplanned developmental activities in the ecologically fragile regions has contributed to frequent landslides, conversion of perennial rivers to intermittent or seasonal rivers, reduced water retention capability, etc. Addressing these challenges entails understanding the drivers of land-use change and also their role in altering land uses. Large-scale linear projects such as roads and railways, though contribute to better infrastructure and enhance employment opportunities but severely change the landscape structure affecting peoples' livelihood due to the reduction of ecosystem goods and services. Planned interventions are essential for adopting appropriate land-use trends and shift the trajectory of ecosystem service provision through prior visualization of land-use dynamics with likely impacts. The current study analyses the possible land-use changes in the ecologically fragile central Western Ghats with the proposed railway networks, namely (i) Mysore-Kushalnagar and (ii) Mysore-Thalassery (limited to Karnataka state), using an agent-based model (Fuzzy-AHP-CA-Markov) considering the linear project regions with a buffer of 5 km. The analyses reveal a reduction of forests by 2 and 5%, respectively, during 2010 and 2019. This trend would continue with a significant forest decline by 2026. Areas under built-up have increased over 5% during 2010-2019, which would increase by 7% (2019 and 2026) at the expense of cultivation lands. Major cities such as Mysore and Kushalnagara would witness concentrated urban growth with sprawl in the peripheries, while other towns have undergone leapfrog developments. The spatial distribution of fauna and flora indicates that most parts of the buffer region endow endemic species and serve as foraging grounds. Prediction of likely land uses in 2026 suggests that these regions would undergo large-scale alterations threatening fauna and flora. Implementing linear projects in the ecologically fragile Western Ghats would further destabilize the region, posing a threat with the increased hazard frequencies and the sustenance of natural resources.

AB  - Stream networks are vulnerable to fragmentation. Anthropogenic structures, such as dams and culverts, can isolate stream branches, potentially interrupting longitudinal gradients of fish distribution. The effect of single barriers is well documented, but the effect of multiple barriers in small streams is not as well characterized. We used a landscape approach and spatially continuous sampling across 2 y to examine the influence of anthropogenic structures on fish distributions in an urban stream network. After accounting for spatial autocorrelation, we found higher Coastal Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarki clarki) and lower Prickly Sculpin (Cottus asper) densities at locations up-than downstream of multiple culverts. Culverts had species-and year-specific stepwise effects that overrode fish distribution patterns attributable to environmental gradients. Prickly Sculpin exhibited strong spatial autocorrelation in both years, whereas Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) had negligible spatial autocorrelation in one year, a result indicating that spatial structure depends on species and year. Reaches did not have consistent fish densities across years and showed high temporal variability of fish or their habitats. Spatially continuous sampling captured gradients and heterogeneity in fish distributions and highlighted how anthropogenic structures alter these gradients. Our study also revealed which culverts had the strongest influences on fish densities throughout the stream network. The study design used can inform riverscape-management approaches, which are needed to conserve stream biodiversity effectively.

AB  - Biodiversity in urban green areas has been widely explored in several bird studies because birds are known to be important bio-indicators. Many studies have investigated the different responses of bird communities to ur-banization and land use changes in urban environments. However, there are still important knowledge gaps related to the impacts of the heterogeneity, spatial structure, and connectivity of green areas on avian diversity. Such information is needed for sustainable urban planning. In this study, we focused on the comparison of bird communities between urban parks in the heritage city of Olomouc and hardwood floodplain forests in the vi-cinity of the city. The results of the study indicate the high importance of urban parks for the maintenance of bird diversity even though urban parks are man-made habitats. The results highlight the importance of some native vegetation structures in urban parks (old trees, bush ecotones) for maintaining urban bird biodiversity. Some implications of the results can be widely used as a decision support tool for the management of urban green areas and for the planning of ecological networks in urban landscapes.

AB  - This paper aims to characterize and analyze the urban greenness change in the Baltimore-Washington corridor area. The general objectives for this study are: (1) to identify and analyze the urban greenness pattern and its changes, (2) to interpret and associate the change in urban greenness structure within its zoning area, (3) to characterize and discuss the influence of urbanization on the spatial distribution and temporal dynamic of urban green spaces. The linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA) was adopted to extract the fraction maps of four endmembers (imperviousness, grassland, woodland, and soil) using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM). The research results indicate that LSMA offers a better classified map than the traditional Maximum Likelihood Classification with an improved overall accuracy from 78.99% to 86.20%. The greenness dynamics within each census tract as well as planning zone were derived based on the each two successive fraction maps and fuzzy set concepts. The significant decrease of grassland in the business-based landscape (average green density decreased from 30% to 17%) with a slight decrease of woodland (from 63% to 60%) indicate the urbanization in the Baltimore-Washington corridor area impact its spatial morphology, structure, and ecological environment under the special socioeconomic development and reserve policies. The combination of remote sensing data and GIS zoning data provides us a comprehensive track on the pattern and process of urban greenness to deliver significant information for city planners and policy makers, as well as the unique dataset for other researcher to further evaluate the socioeconomic function of urban greenness.

AB  - Urban forests play a critical role in mitigating heat island effects and in modifying local microclimates by intercepting solar radiation and shading heat-absorbing structural materials. Solar radiation is the prime determinant of how much energy urban surfaces absorb and of temperature distribution patterns in urban areas. Understanding the impacts of urban trees on solar radiation received by buildings is an important way to assess tree shading and potential energy conservation. In this study two remote sensing technologies have been integrated, to estimate solar radiation on building roofs along two major infrastructure routes in Sydney. In particular, the relationship between the radiation received by the roofs and the surrounding tree features has been investigated. The two chosen sources of remotely sensed data are light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and airborne hyperspectral imaging. Integrating these data sets provides a means to build digital surface models (DSMs) which only include trees and permits a distinction between evergreen and deciduous species. Global solar radiation profiles of both corridors have been estimated. Then, the direct and diffuse radiation received by building roofs are modelled by incorporating the LiDAR DSM, at hourly intervals on spring/autumn equinox and summer/winter solstice dates. The very high summer radiation in comparison with winter levels is demonstrated and, by correlating reductions in solar radiation with different tree and building dimensions, this paper shows that tree canopy height is most strongly correlated to solar radiation across the whole study area. The results also demonstrate benefits of more extensive use of deciduous species in industrialised or commercial areas. For landscape planners in Sydney, the importance of having and conserving taller trees for solar radiation reduction is clear. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - The importance of large reserves has been long maintained in the scientific literature, often leading to dismissal of the conservation potential of small reserves. However, over half the global protected-area inventory is composed of protected areas that are <100 ha, and the median size of added protected area is decreasing. Studies of the conservation value of small reserves and fragments of natural area are relatively uncommon in the literature. We reviewed SCOPUS and WOK for studies on small reserve and fragment contributions to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, and fifty-eight taxon-specific studies were included in the review. Small reserves harbored substantial portions (upward of 50%) of regional species diversity for many taxa (birds, plants, amphibians, and small mammals) and even some endemic, specialist bird species. Unfortunately, small reserves and fragments almost always harbored more generalist and exotic species than large reserves. Community composition depended on habitat quality, surrounding land use (agricultural vs. urban), and reserve and fragment size, which presents opportunities for management and improvement. Small reserves also provided ecosystem services, such as pollination and biological pest control, and cultural services, such as recreation and improved human health. Limitations associated with small reserves, such as extinction debt and support of area-sensitive species, necessitate a complement of larger reserves. However, we argue that small reserves can make viable and significant contributions to conservation goals directly as habitat and indirectly by increasing landscape connectivity and quality to the benefit of large reserves. To effectively conserve biodiversity for future generations in landscapes fragmented by human development, small reserves and fragments must be included in conservation planning.

Here, we discuss how ecological networks can enhance current understanding of aquatic-terrestrial linkages by describing and quantifying the complexity of aquatic-terrestrial food webs. Aquatic-terrestrial networks demonstrate links across biological levels of organization, integrate both direct and indirect interactions, and can be used to predict ecosystem responses to perturbations. We provide 2 examples of river-riparian ecological networks across urban-rural land-use gradients to show how network approaches can be used for conservation, management, and monitoring. For instance, when we simulated the removal of sensitive emerging insect taxa, we observed the greatest change in compartmentalization, or in this case, the degree to which the network contained discrete aquatic and terrestrial sub-webs, in forested and agricultural stream reaches compared with urban reaches. Similarly, we illustrate how shifts in diets of insectivorous fishes (i.e., node behavior) from both terrestrial and aquatic prey to either terrestrial or aquatic insect prey can result in reduced frequency of trophic interactions (complexity) and fewer interacting taxa (compartmentalization). Both examples point to potential signs of destabilizing ecosystems or regimes shifts (i.e., persistent changes in the structure of function of river-riparian ecosystems). Thus, these network approaches can help identify environmental problems and inform their management solutions. However, constructing aquatic-terrestrial networks and simulations requires high-resolution monitoring data from both aquatic and terrestrial habitats.

AB  - Hydrological connectivity is an important characteristic of wetlands that maintains the stability and functions of an ecosystem. This study investigates the temporal variations of hydrological connectivity and their driving mechanism in Baiyangdian Lake, a large shallow wetland in North China, using a time series of open water surface area data derived from 36 Landsat 8 multispectral images from 2013-2019 and in situ measured water level data. Water area classification was implemented using the Google Earth Engine. Six commonly used indexes for extracting water surface data from satellite images were compared and the best performing index was selected for the water classification. A composite hydrological connectivity index computed from open water area data derived from Landsat 8 images was developed based on several landscape pattern indices and applied to Baiyangdian Lake. The results show that, reflectance in the near-infrared band is the most accurate index for water classification with >98% overall accuracy because of its sensitivity to different land cover types. The slopes of the best-fit linear relationships between the computed hydrological connectivity and observed water level show high variability between years. In most years, hydrological connectivity generally increases when water levels increase, with an average R-2 of 0.88. The spatial distribution of emergent plants also varies year to year owing to interannual variations of the climate and hydrological regime. This presents a possible explanation for the variations in the annual relationship between hydrological connectivity and water level. For a given water level, the hydrological connectivity is generally higher in spring than summer and autumn. This can be explained by the fact that the drag force exerted by emergent plants, which reduces water flow, is smaller than that for summer and autumn owing to seasonal variations in the phenological characteristics of emergent plants. Our study reveals that both interannual and seasonal variations in the hydrological connectivity of Baiyangdian Lake are related to the growth of emergent plants, which occupy a large portion of the lake area. Proper vegetation management may therefore improve hydrological connectivity in this wetland.

AB  - During 1997-2012 we conducted a nationwide camera-trapping survey and assessed the availability of prey and habitat for the clouded leopard Neofelis nebulosa in Taiwan. We surveyed 1,249 camera-trap sites over 113,636 camera-trap days, from the seashore to an altitude of 3,796 m and covering various types of vegetation. No clouded leopards were photographed during 128,394 camera-trap days, including at 209 sites in other studies, confirming the presumed extinction of clouded leopards in Taiwan. Assessment of the prey base revealed altitudinal distribution patterns of prey species and prey biomass. Areas at lower altitudes and with less human encroachment and hunting supported a higher prey biomass and more of the typical prey species of clouded leopards. Habitat analysis revealed 8,523 km(2) of suitable habitat but this was reduced to 6,734 km(2) when adjacent areas of human encroachment were subtracted. In the absence of hunting and large mammalian carnivores the major prey of clouded leopards in Taiwan, such as Formosan macaques Macaca cyclopis, Reeves's muntjacs Muntiacus reevesi, Formosan serow Capricornis swinhoei and sambar Rusa unicolor, could become over-abundant. Thus, it is important to address the cascading effect of the disappearance of top-down predator control. Our assessment indicated that, with proper regulation of hunting, habitat restoration and corridor improvement, it may be possible to reintroduce the clouded leopard.

AB  - The relationship between landscape pattern and the distribution and spread of exotic species is an important determinant of where and when management actions are best applied. We have developed an interdisciplinary approach for prioritizing treatment of harmful, nonnative, invasive plants in National Park landscapes of the Mid-Atlantic USA. The approach relies upon a detailed model of reinvasion risk that combines information on: (1) global factors representing park-level infestation from seed and sprout, (2) landscape factors including disturbance-based spread vectors and neighborhood seed density, and (3) local factors determining establishment probability based on habitat suitability. Global seed rain estimates are derived empirically from park inventory data and modified by information on species reproductive strategies. Landscape-level propagule pressure is modeled spatially using species life history characteristics including dispersal attributes, connectivity to nearby plant populations, and increased propagule pressure through disturbance. The local-scale habitat suitability model uses a Mahalanobis distance approach, parameterized from plant inventory plot data and GIS-based data on plot wetness, land cover, slope, radiation, and soil characteristics. We illustrate the model for Ailanthus altissima (tree-of-heaven) in Antietam National Battlefield Park. The results of the A. altissima modeling highlight regions of the park where eradication would be most prudent and feasible based on current infestation patterns and landscape heterogeneity. Although the success of different treatment modalities is often considered in invasive species management, a spatially explicit assessment of likely treatment success is rarely undertaken. Our approach provides a valuable tool to assist natural resource practitioners to prioritize management options in confronting biological invasions.

AB  - Several hypotheses have been used to explain diversification in the Neotropics. Integrating evolution with ecology extends the scope of testing the frameworks of these hypotheses. We test diversification hypotheses by integrating phylogeography and ecological niche models (ENMs) using the rodent Hylaeamys megacephalus (Azara's broad-headed oryzomys or large headed rice rat) of the Amazon and dry forests, as a model. We estimated divergence times, ancestral areas, diversification events, historical demography, haplotype sharing, and genetic distances based on the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. We generated ENMs and tested for niche divergence between lineages; integrated genetic data to predict gene flow corridors; and projected paleodistributions for comparison with historical demography. We found high structuring in northern Amazonia on the left bank of the Amazon River, and less structure but secondary contact in southern Amazonia and dry forests. The Northern Amazonian lineage diverged from the other lineages through dispersal followed by vicariance due to the Amazon River about 1.35Mya, while the Southern Amazonian and Cerrado lineages diverged through dispersal about 0.78 Mya. Paleodistribution models revealed expansions of dry forest lineages consistent with the Refugia Hypothesis, but not retraction for the humid forest lineage, which were not congruent with historical demography data. Niche divergence was not supported for the Northern Amazonian lineage, whereas habitat corridors linking current lineages suggest environmental continuity to their distributions that is concordant with a riverine barrier. In contrast, niche divergence was supported between the Southern Amazonian and Cerrado lineages, indicating that isolation followed by ecological divergence likely acted on this diversification. The recent Amazon River barrier and ecological differentiation observed here will surely provide insight for future studies and hypotheses of biodiversity diversification in the Neotropics. Studies that integrate evolution and ecology promise to disentangle alternative hypotheses and shed light on the biogeography of this megadiverse region.

AB  - Our ability to predict the outcome of invasion declines rapidly as non-native species progress through intertwined ecological barriers to establish and spread in recipient ecosystems. This is largely due to the lack of systemic knowledge on key processes at play as species establish self-sustaining populations within the invaded range. To address this knowledge gap, we present a mathematical model that captures the eco-evolutionary dynamics of native and non-native species interacting within an ecological network. The model is derived from continuous-trait evolutionary game theory (i.e., Adaptive Dynamics) and its associated concept of invasion fitness which depicts dynamic demographic performance that is both trait mediated and density dependent. Our approach allows us to explore how multiple resident and non-native species coevolve to reshape invasion performance, or more precisely invasiveness, over trait space. The model clarifies the role of specific traits in enabling non-native species to occupy realised opportunistic niches. It also elucidates the direction and speed of both ecological and evolutionary dynamics of residing species (natives or non-natives) in the recipient network under different levels of propagule pressure. The versatility of the model is demonstrated using four examples that correspond to the invasion of (i) a horizontal competitive community; (ii) a bipartite mutualistic network; (iii) a bipartite antagonistic network; and (iv) a multi-trophic food web. We identified a cohesive trait strategy that enables the success and establishment of non-native species to possess high invasiveness. Specifically, we find that a non-native species can achieve high levels of invasiveness by possessing traits that overlap with those of its facilitators (and mutualists), which enhances the benefits accrued from positive interactions, and by possessing traits outside the range of those of antagonists, which mitigates the costs accrued from negative interactions. This 'central-to-reap, edge-to-elude' trait strategy therefore describes the strategic trait positions of non-native species to invade an ecological network. This model provides a theoretical platform for exploring invasion strategies in complex adaptive ecological networks.

AB  - Non-spatial ecological networks provide insight into the organization and interaction between biological entities. More recently, biological dispersal is modelled using spatial networks, static sets of georeferenced habitat patches that connect based on a species' maximum dispersal distance. However, dispersal is complex, where spatial patterns at the landscape scale emerge from interactions between ecological entities and landscape features at much finer individual scales. Agent-based modelling (ABM) is a computational representation of complex systems capable of capturing this complexity. Therefore, this study develops a network-ABM (N-ABM) that combines network and complex systems theory to simulate complex evolving spatial networks. The developed N-ABM approach is implemented on the case study of the emerald ash borer (EAB) bark beetle using geospatial datasets in Ontario, Canada. The N-ABM generates dynamic spatial network structures that emerge from interactions between the EAB and tree agents at the individual scale. The resulting networks are analyzed using graph theory measures. Analysis of the results indicates a relationship between preferential attachment in insect host selection and the emergent scale-free network structure. The N-ABM approach can be used to represent dynamic ecological networks and provides insight into how network structure emerges from EAB dispersal dynamics, useful for forest management.

AB  - The riparian vegetation belt is one of the few remaining structures that provide coverage for wildlife in many anthropogenic landscapes. It provides shelter for many species and functions as corridors for dispersal. However, this landscape is increasingly utilised by humans for leisure activities. The loss of riparian vegetation with a concurrent increase of human disturbance in these habitats can pose a serious threat to wildlife.
   One of the species potentially affected is the Eurasian otter Lutra lutra. In the Alps, otters are nocturnal and rest during the day when human activity is high. To study the impact of human presence on resting site selection in otters, we radio-tracked nine otters for up to 30 months in the eastern Central Alps of Austria. We analysed resting site selection in relation to human disturbance.
   Altogether, we identified 285 resting sites scattered throughout the territories of the individual otters at an average distance of 144 m between sites. Almost all the resting sites (95%) were located in the natural riparian vegetation, making this the most important habitat for resting otters. We found evidence that human disturbance within these riparian habitats shapes resting site selection. Otters preferred narrow riparian strips when there was no human presence, but selected areas with a wider vegetation belt when the disturbance level increased. Outside the vegetation period, animals rested below ground more often than above, which suggests that vegetation also functions as visual cover.
   Our study highlights the importance of the restoration of the natural riparian vegetation belt for the protection of wildlife, particularly where human activities are intense. We provide information for the effective conservation management of otters considering the combination of spatial distribution of resting sites and specific habitat requirements in the presence of human disturbance. Areas of conservation importance chosen in this way are likely to benefit other wildlife that utilise the riparian vegetation belt. (C) 2019 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde.

AB  - Under the background of urban expansion, ecological protection cannot be delayed. The construction of ecological networks is of considerable significance to ecosystem services. However, in the process of constructing a corridor network, there is no uniform standard for the selection of ecological sources and the determination of cost factors. The InVEST model is an effective complement to ecosystem service assessment for sensitively measuring external threats and their threat intensity. Therefore, taking Wuhan as an example, we combined InVEST and the least cost path model (LCP) to construct a multi-target corridor network with comprehensive cost factors for birds and small terrestrial mammals. The results showed that: (1) The InVEST model provided a reliable basis for ecological source screening by demonstrating the distribution of habitat quality. (2) The corridor with a length of 12-25 km presented a "U" shape, and the impact of urbanization on small terrestrial mammals was more significant than that of birds. (3) The integrated network pattern proposed by the "point-line-plane" principle would provide a reference for urban ecological construction and sustainable development.

AB  - Management strategies for the regional conservation of forest birds sometimes do not consider explicitly their applicability to areas with different degrees of urbanization. I studied the spatial and temporal distribution of forest passerines in wooded parks in the city of Madrid during two consecutive breeding seasons to identify factors relevant to local conservation, and compared these results to previous studies in rural-fragmented forests in central Spain to derive recommendations for local and regional management guidelines. Five independent factors were considered: park size, isolation, density of potential corridors, vegetation structure, and pedestrian rate as an indicator of human disturbance within parks. Species richness and species temporal persistence was positively influenced by park size, shrub and tree cover, number of shrub and tree species, number of thick tree trunks, and negatively by the number of thin tree trunks. Species turnover was negatively affected by park size, such that the temporal persistence of species was enhanced in large parks. The pattern of guild assembly was not random but nested (parks with few species were subsets of progressively richer parks); the accumulation of species being affected mainly by park size and human disturbance, and to a lesser degree by isolation and vegetation structure. With regard to the spatial distribution of individual species, park size and vegetation structure positively influenced five species each, whereas isolation and human disturbance negatively influenced two and one species, respectively. Fragment size and habitat structure were the most relevant factors affecting species richness of forest specialists in both rural and urban fragmented landscapes; therefore, regional conservation strategies to protect these species may also be applicable to urbanized areas in central Spain. However, some specific recommendations should be considered in urban and suburban landscapes: (1) habitat quality ought to be enhanced to meet specific habitat requirements, particularly in large parks; (2) the mechanisms and rates of dispersal of forest birds through the urban matrix should be further studied to improve the movements between regional and local populations; and (3) species-specific variations in tolerance to pedestrians and thresholds levels of human visitation within parks should be determined to minimize human disturbance effects.

AB  - Wood dynamics affects riparian ecosystem functioning and river morphology. The spatial and temporal dynamics of wood pieces in river corridors, in particular of deposited rejuvenated wood logs, depend on their biomechanical properties and resistance to uprooting. The ability of stranded wood logs to withstand drag forces depends on how efficiently their roots have sprouted and on the interarrival time, magnitude, and duration of the moderate floods to which they are subjected. We performed static pullout tests on small-scale wood logs (Salix species) of four different sizes, growth stages, and sediment moisture content. Statistics of root biomass growth rate and related spatial distribution along the trunk reveal important insights for upscaling dynamics. Similarly, force-displacement curves indicate the maximum resistance and related energy for uprooting. Autocorrelation analysis of the sequence of force drops in the force-displacement signal reveals the statistical nature of the mechanism of load redistribution among roots. These results are then used to advance a physically based mathematical model of the resistance of wood log roots to flow-induced drag forces. Given that the magnitude, duration, and return period of hydrologic events are typically correlated, our model implies the existence of windows of opportunity for wood logs to either survive or remobilize.

AB  - The colonisation of a linear sequence of nine young hedge plantations (each 400 m2) within an intensely cultivated landscape about 30 km to the west of Bonn has been studied to compare spatial and temporal distribution patterns of epigeic arthropods in order to consider differences obtained concerning an assessment of colonisation characteristics and dispersal trends.  The investigation was started in 1982, the year in which the new hedges were planted and continued until 1991.  Pitfall traps-usually six as a standard set-were installed in young hedges and in old wooded habitats of an adjacent semi-natural habitat complex, as well as in surrounding arable fields and in meadow strips connecting the hedge plantations.  But only in 1990 nearly all the habitats were sampled at the same time.  Between 1982 and 1989 catches were continuously performed only in two habitats, since 1986 in four young habitats.
   Results on species of the taxonomial groups of Carabidae, Opilionida and Araneida show that the analysis of spatial only or temporal only patterns can lead to different interpretations and sometimes wrong conclusions about the colonisation of new hedge habitats.  Both types of data, comprehensive spatial and long-term temporal, are complementary and a combination of both is recommended for properly assessing dispersal of species and other dynamic processes in the landscape.  As far as the colonisation of new hedges is concerned it is shown that despite high temporal dynamics in species abundances and remarkable differences between the three taxa considered, the development towards a typical hedge fauna progresses very slowly.  Small, 9-year-old hedges do not function well as stepping stones for the dispersal of epigeic forest and forest-edge arthropods, and only a small corridor effect could be established for the linear plantation strip.  Remarkable differences in colonisation trends between beetle and spider species of similar ecological preferences are discussed.

AB  - Habitat connectivity influences the distribution dynamics of animals. Connectivity can therefore shape trophic interactions, but little empirical evidence is available, especially for large mammals. In forest ecosystems, logging alters functional connectivity among habitat patches, and such activities can affect the spatial game between large herbivores and their predators. We used graph theory to evaluate how harvesting-induced changes in habitat connectivity influence patch choice and residency time of GPS-collared caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) and moose (Alces alces) in winter in the boreal forest. We then investigated the predator-prey game by assessing how GPS-collared wolves (Canis lupus) adjusted their movements to changes in landscape properties and in the networks of their prey species. We built prey habitat networks using minimum planar graphs organized around species-specific, highly selected habitat patches (i.e., network nodes). We found that spatial dynamics of large herbivores were influenced not only by the intrinsic quality of habitat patches, but also by the connectivity of those network nodes. Caribou and moose selected nodes that were connected by a high number of links, and moose also spent relatively more time in those nodes. By limiting node accessibility, human disturbances influenced travel decisions. Caribou and moose avoided nodes that were surrounded by a high proportion of cuts and roads, but once within these nodes, moose stayed longer than in other nodes. Caribou selectively moved among nodes with low distance costs, and their residency time increased with distance costs required to reach the nodes. Wolves selected their prey's nodes, where vegetation consumed by caribou and moose was highly abundant. Furthermore, wolves discriminated among those nodes by selecting the most connected ones. In fact, selection by wolves was stronger for their prey's nodes than for the prey's utilization distribution per se, a difference that increased with the level of human disturbance. Considering the difficulty of keeping track of highly mobile prey, predators may benefit by targeting not only their prey's resource patches, but also the most highly connected patches. Matrix quality and connectivity are therefore key elements shaping the predator-prey spatial game in human-altered landscapes because of their impact on the spatial dynamics of the interacting species.

AB  - Green roofs and walls have recently emerged as conservation tools, and they offer promising additional opportunities to enhance biodiversity in cities. However, their ecological conditions remain poorly considered when planning wildlife corridors. To discuss the role of vegetated buildings in landscape connectivity, we reviewed the ecological and technical specificities of green walls and green roofs in light of the key factors concerning urban wildlife (patch size, quality, abundance, and isolation). Green roofs and walls show limited patch sizes, distinct habitat quality at the building scale, and limited redundancy of patch quality within the landscape. We also highlight that the abundance of roof and wall patches is often low. Future research is needed to establish if walls can be vertical corridors for wildlife, thereby reducing the isolation of green roofs. We argue that creating 3D ecological connectivity within the city requires substantial modifications of the design and maintenance of existing green building systems. We suggest that research is needed to integrate the biotic and abiotic characteristics of green buildings to make them more closely resemble those of open green spaces.

AB  - Many studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of different urban structures on landscape connectivity, andmost of themrely on the comparison approach or ex-ante scenario analysis. However, we still lack an ex-post method to capture the consequences of accomplished urban structure shift (from monocentric to polycentric), which is guided by the land use planning. To fill this gap, we develop an ex-post evaluation approach which integrates counterfactual analysis and landscape graphs. Counterfactual analysis is combined with cellular automata simulation model, to uncover what the city might look like, if it had continued to expand in a monocentric structure; and the landscape graphs enable us to reveal the possible landscape connectivity in actual and counterfactual scenarios. We select Nanjing city as the study area and 4 target species, to delve into the varying impacts of the urban structure shift on different taxonomic groups. Our case study demonstrates that: (1) the impact of urban structure shift is more relevant to the long disperser; (2) the actual landscape (polycentric) would facilitate the bird's dispersal, while (3) forestmammals have higher connectivity in the counterfactual scenario (monocentric), and the possible reasons are discussed. Finally, we demonstrate that the urban structure shiftmight not necessarily cause the connectivity decline, on condition that the key connectivity providers are identified by integrating ecological network analysis into the land use planning, and well preserved in the shift.

AB  - The effects of riparian land uses on water quality and macroinvertebrate communities were examined in three headwater streams of the Taizi River in northeastern China. Land uses of forest, grassland, farmland, and villages were evaluated within different widths of riparian corridors (length = 3km upstream; width = 25, 50, 100, 200, and 500m). Overall, the results revealed a significant trend for each stream linking a relatively low proportion of farmland in the riparian corridor with better water quality and healthier macroinvertebrate community. Cluster analysis confirmed significant variation in the macroinvertebrate communities found among the three streams. Correlation analysis identified significant positive correlations between the proportion of farmland and metrics of water quality (conductivity, dissolved solids, and total nitrogen) at small (25-50m) to medium (100-200m) widths of riparian corridors. The sensitive taxa of stoneflies and functional feeding groups of scrapers and predators were good predictors of anthropogenic disturbance associated with the proportional extent of farmland and village land use across most of all riparian widths. In contrast, correlations between biodiversity indices and proportion of villages and between bioassessment indices and proportion of farmland were only significant at relatively small widths (25-50m) of riparian corridors. The canonical correspondence analysis revealed that the proportions of forest (25m), farmland (200m), grassland (200m), and village (100m) showed independent effects on the spatial distribution of macroinvertebrates in the Taizi River. The first two axes contributed 34.6% of the cumulative percent variance of species-environment relations. This research indicates that management of riparian corridor land uses at relatively small to medium widths (25-200m) could be effective in restoring water quality and macroinvertebrate communities in headwater stream regions.

AB  - Genders differ in traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) about plants, but how gender influences TEK sharing is still poorly understood. Here, we examined how gender is associated with the diversity, transmission, and structure of TEK. We tested whether women and men differ in terms of plant knowledge (species richness, alpha-diversity), knowledge heterogeneity (beta-diversity), and in the structure of social-ecological networks they form. The study was carried out in a suburban community in the city of Ouro Preto, Southeastern, Brazil. Using the snow-ball technique, semi-structured interviews, guided tours, and participant observation, we gathered information from 33 women and 33 men in the community. We collected information about their culture, social-economic profiles, and plant knowledge from which we identified 291 plant species in 10 use categories. Overall, our results indicated that the cognition and sharing of ethnobotanical knowledge are structured by gender. Women rated better in their plant knowledge repertory (greater alpha-diversity), while plant knowledge among men was more heterogeneous (greater beta-diversity), suggesting less information sharing among them. We observed that the network among women is more connected, exhibited greater information sharing, with a greater number of central individuals, who likely provide the cohesion and maintenance of TEK in the community. Our findings indicate how social-ecological networks can provide insights and information to unveil social patterns of knowledge transmission. Understanding how TEK is fostered and shared among community members will favor better planning of ethnobotanical studies, as well as inform decision-makers about strategies for the conservation of plant TEK.

AB  - To achieve a sustainable development, impacts on biodiversity of urbanisation, new infrastructure projects and other land use changes must be considered on landscape and regional scales. This requires that important decisions are made after a systematic evaluation of environmental impacts. Landscape ecology can provide a conceptual framework for the assessment of consequences of long-term development processes like urbanisation on biodiversity components, and for evaluating and visualising the impacts of alternative planning scenarios. The aim of this paper was to develop methods for integrating biodiversity issues in planning and strategic environmental assessment in an urbanising environment, on landscape and regional levels.
   In order to test developed methods, a case study was conducted in the region of Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, and the study area embraced the city centre, suburbs and peri-urban areas. Focal species were tested as indicators of habitat quality, quantity and connectivity in the landscape. Predictive modelling of habitat distribution in geographic information systems involved the modelling of focal species occurrences based on empirical data, incorporated in a landscape ecological decision support system. When habitat models were retrieved, they were applied on future planning scenarios in order to predict and assess the impacts on focal species. The scenario involving a diffuse exploitation pattern had the greatest negative impacts on the habitat networks of focal species. The scenarios with concentrated exploitation also had negative impacts, although they were possible to mitigate quite easily. The predictions of the impacts on habitats networks of focal species made it possible to quantify, integrate and visualise the effects of urbanisation scenarios on aspects of biodiversity on a landscape level.

AB  - BackgroundIncreased Attalea butyracea palm propagation, notable for its role as key habitat for the primary Chagas disease vector in Panama, has been linked to landscape disturbance in single-palm observations in this region. Close proximity of these palms to human dwellings is proposed to increase risk of Chagas disease transmission from sylvatic transmission cycles to domestic transmission involving human populations. This study examines the relationship between landscape disturbance and mature A. butyracea spatial distribution, density, and proximity to human populations and vector and reservoir species' movement corridors at a regional scale in a 300 km(2) heterogeneous tropical landscape in central Panama.MethodsWe remotely identified the locations of over 50,000 mature A. butyracea palms using high-resolution WorldView2 satellite imagery. A local Getis-Ord Gi* spatial analysis identified significant clusters of aggregated palms. Associations between palm and cluster abundance and a landscape disturbance gradient, derived from official Panama land cover data, were tested using Chi-square tests for Homogeneity and Z-test for proportions. Kruskall-Wallis non-parametric analysis of variance tests were run to assess whether palm cluster area varied by disturbance level, or whether disturbance was associated with proximity of palms and palm clusters to susceptible populations or vector movement corridors.ResultsOur findings indicate a regional relationship between landscape disturbance and A. butyracea occurrence. We observe a significant increase in both individual and clustered A. butyracea in secondary forest, but a reduction of palms in agricultural settings. We do not detect evidence of any reduction in abundance of palms in residential settings. The majority of residential and commercial buildings in our study area are within vector flight distance of potential vector habitat in palm crowns.ConclusionsWe observe probable anthropogenic elimination of A. butyracea palms in agricultural, but not residential, settings. Even in heavily deforested regions, significant concentrations of mature palms remain in close proximity to human establishments.

AB  - Aim An understanding of how biotic communities are spatially organized is necessary to identify and prioritize habitats within landscape-scale biodiversity conservation. Local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD) identifies individual habitats that make a significant contribution to beta diversity and may have important practical implications, particularly for conservation of habitat networks. In this study, we develop and apply a conservation prioritization approach based on LCBD in aquatic invertebrate communities from 132 ponds.
   Location Five urban settlements in the UK: Halton, Loughborough, Stockport, Birmingham and Huddersfield.
   Methods We partition LCBD into richness difference (nestedness: RichDiffLCBD) and species replacement (turnover: ReplLCBD) and identify key environmental variables driving LCBD. We examine LCBD at two scales relevant to conservation planning: within urban settlements and nationally across the UK.
   Results Significant differences in LCBD values were recorded among the five settlements. In four of the five urban settlements studied, pond sites with the greatest LCBD values typically showed high replacement values. Significant LCBD sites and sites with high taxonomic diversity together supported more of the regional species pool (70%-97%) than sites with high taxonomic diversity alone (54%-94%) or what could be protected by the random selection of sites. LCBD was significantly associated with vegetation shading, surface area, altitude and macrophyte cover.
   Main conclusions Conservation prioritization that incorporates LCBD and sites with high taxonomic diversity improves the effectiveness of conservation actions within pond habitat networks, ensures sites supporting high biodiversity are protected and provides a method to define a spatial network of protected sites. Identifying new, effective conservation approaches, particularly in urban areas where resources may be scarce and conflicts regarding land use exist, is essential to ensure biodiversity is fully supported, and detrimental anthropogenic effects are reduced.

AB  - Surface runoff can be routed to both pervious areas (PAs) and drainage systems during an overland flow. Excessive runoff from an impervious area (IA) flowing into a drainage system causes an overload, which can be relieved by diverting runoff to PAs. However, the hydrological link between IAs and PAs, especially the runoff response to variation in overland flow areas (OFAs), has not well been considered in runoff simulations due to the complexity of routing. To understand how the OFA within an IA contributes to runoff generation, a novel classification approach was applied to categorize the IA in a study area in Nanjing University, Xianlin campus, China into directly connected impervious area (DCIA) and indirectly connected impervious area (ICIA) by flow routes using high-resolution ground-based images (0.5 m) from an unmanned aerial vehicle. The OFAs then include DCIA and the total impervious area (TIA), which is the sum of DCIA and ICIA. The runoff simulations were supported by Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) calibrated with observed rainfall and runoff data. The resulting proportions of DCIA and ICIA of the study area were 34.13% and 10.99%, respectively. The spatial distributions of DCIA and ICIA are characterized by the subcatchment landscape heterogeneity resulting from vegetation, imperviousness, and slope. The observed runoff coefficients and peak flows were positively correlated with the percentages of DCIA and TIA. The runoff coefficient was significantly correlated with the DCIA in a light rainfall event of 18.4 mm (R-2 =0.82) and with the TIA in a heavy rainfall event of 119 mm (R-2 =0.92). Runoff generation is affected by both the characteristics of the rainfall event and the accompaning variations in OFAs. Results indicate that increasing of the flow connectivity from IAs to PAs and increasing the water retention capacity of PAs may be effective strategies for optimizing landscape patterns for stormwater management.

AB  - Ponds and lakes may be common in urban landscapes and frequently have high biodiversity and conservation value. The importance of landscape-scale conservation of lentic habitat networks has recently been recognised, yet little research has been conducted at this scale. Approaches to inventorying lentic habitats at the landscape-scale are needed to support science and conservation. This paper uses remote sensing to inventory lentic habitats across Greater Kuala Lumpur (GKL), Malaysia, characterising their distribution, abundance and type. Remote sensing images were employed to automatically identify and map the distribution of lentic habitats, capturing 1,013 individual ponds and lakes, which represent 74.3 % of the likely total. Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), a multivariate hierarchical clustering method, was used to develop a typology using physical characteristics extracted from the imagery, yielding six distinct types. The diversity of habitat types was greater in peri-urban and suburban areas (Shannon's H = 1.68) than in the urban core (Shannon's H = 1.48), suggesting that urban structure influences the spatial pattern of lentic habitat diversity. Physicochemical and vegetation field data were collected from a sample of each type (n = 60). Comparisons of group membership in the typology produced from remote sensing and field data indicated demonstrable heterogeneity in local conditions within each type, and a lack of consistency between local and broader scale characteristics. Our work shows how inventories produced from remote sensing can provide insights into landscape-scale biodiversity drivers, and contribute to larger-scale conservation of lentic habitat networks. This approach can complement local studies to improve understanding of factors operating at different scales.

AB  - P>1. Urbanization represents a major threat to biodiversity world-wide because it causes permanent degradation and fragmentation of biologically rich natural communities. This is particularly acute in coastal plains and river valleys, where cities are typically located. Although movement is essential to the persistence of populations in fragmented landscapes, little is known about how development and transportation corridors affect the movements of wildlife in the urban context.
   2. We conducted a series of translocation experiments within the urban landscape of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to assess the permeability of selected landscape elements for two species of forest songbirds with contrasting adaptabilities to urban development and migratory behaviours: the black-capped chickadee Poecile atricapillus, an urban-adaptable year-round resident, and the yellow warbler Dendroica petechia, an urban-sensitive Neotropical migrant.
   3. Birds were caught in riparian habitats and translocated either within the riparian corridor of origin or across the urban matrix. Riparian treatments included continuous forest, one or several transportation bridges and a major river. In the urban matrix, birds were translocated across a single major road, well- or poorly-treed developed areas, or multiple gaps.
   4. Using Cox regression we found that the presence of gaps in forest cover explained more variation in return time than the amount of forest cover for both species. Multiple gaps, in particular, resulted in significantly longer return times compared with continuous forest. Chickadees exhibited longer return times when translocated across linear gaps associated with bridges or roads. In contrast, yellow warbler movements appeared to be more constrained by urban development.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that improving the permeability of urban landscapes for songbirds can be achieved by preserving connectivity along riparian corridors and other major swaths of natural vegetation while minimizing gaps in vegetation throughout the urban matrix. Our study also demonstrated a cumulative effect of multiple barriers, species-specific response thresholds to canopy cover and gap width, and an important effect of distance-to-territory on movement behaviour. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of 'most forested route' as a new, animal-based approach for quantifying the permeability of heterogeneous landscapes.

AB  - Roads function as prime habitats and corridors for invasive plant species. Yet despite the diversity of road types, there is little research on the influence of these types on the spread of invaders. Common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), a plant producing large amounts of allergenic pollen, was selected as a species model for examining the impact of road type on the spread of invasive plants. We examined this relationship in an agricultural region of Quebec, Canada. We mapped plant distribution along different road types, and constructed a model of species presence. Common ragweed was found in almost all sampling sites located along regional (97%) and local paved (81%) roads. However, verges of unpaved local roads were rarely (13%) colonized by the plant. A model (53% of variance explained), constructed with only four variables (paved regional roads, paved local roads, recently mown road verges, forest cover), correctly predicted (success rate: 89%) the spatial distribution of common ragweed. Results support the hypothesis that attributes associated with paved roads strongly favour the spread of an opportunistic invasive plant species. Specifically, larger verges and greater disturbance associated with higher traffic volume create propitious conditions for common ragweed. To date, emphasis has been placed on controlling the plant in agricultural fields, even though roadsides are probably a much larger seed source. Strategies for controlling the weed along roads have only focused on major highways, even though the considerable populations along local roads also contribute to the production of pollen. Management prioritizations developed to control common ragweed are thus questionable.

AB  - The concept of "ecological network" comes from landscape ecology. It refers to reservoirs of biodiversity connected through corridors. The "Trame verte et bleue" (greenway) is an application of this ecological continuity concept in the French public policies. The "Trame verte et bleue" conveys different representations than those of the farmers. For them, more than corridors, hedges are viewed as barriers to the wind, prevent people and animals from moving, and require trees to be pruned. But hedges, as natural resources, are also come under intimate experience, and involve past generations and actors of the territory. Even though management approaches of farmers, city-dwellers and nature managers converge in mapping and categorizing natural resources, we advocate for a relational approach. This approach allows to recognize the diversity of forms those resources are qualified and managed.

AB  - Wastewater and storm water management are incorporated into ecological design by open water channel, storage pond, and constructed wetlands to form green water-ways or ecological corridors, which connect remnant patches into an ecological network within the urban area and lead to an integrated water and ecological management. The integrated management philosophy of water and ecology is introduced into the planning of the reconstruction of Beizai Community of Laoshan District in Qingdao City, Shandong Province, which is located at the Zhangcunhe Creek watershed in China. Five residential areas were planned in Beizhai Community. Wastewater in each residential area will be collected and treated separately according to the principle of decentralized water management, and effluent from wastewater treatment plants will be discharged into the landscaping water-body combined with polishing ponds and wetlands for further treatment and storage. From this point the purified water flows with storm runoff into nearby open water courses or ecological trenches, which transport the mixed water to creeks nearby. For the prevention of eutrophication and algae bloom from nutrients, constructed wetlands and riparian aquatic plants are employed to form buffer zones. The five residential ecological patches, one open water system, and greenways along Zhuangcunhe Creek will form an ecological network and will improve the livelihood, recreation, and biological diversity of the reconstruction area.

AB  - Urban growth accompanied by sharp environmental changes has degraded ecosystem services (ESs). Green infrastructure (GI) is premised on the various social and ecological benefits of high-quality ESs that humans acquire from natural ecosystems; hence, the conservation of GI can be considered an effective way to safeguard ecological security and contain rapid urban sprawl and outward expansion. Taking Hangzhou, a typical ecologically sensitive but rapidly urbanizing area, as the case study, a GI network was established according to the quantification and mapping of diverse ES values. The equivalent ES value in China based on Xie?s table was adjusted by calculating the priority index and the spatial difference index, and then the adjusted value was applied to obtain the spatial distribution of the comprehensive ES value in Hangzhou. On this basis, the high-level spatial agglomeration area with the highest comprehensive ES value was extracted as a hub using Getis-Ord Gi* hotspot analysis, while the accumulated channel with the lowest cost of comprehensive ES value was generated as a corridor through the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model. Both the established GI network and its buffer were delineated as the GI conservation area, which further supported the revision of the construction area in the Hangzhou Urban Master Plan (2020e2040), which was formulated by urban development policy to coordinate the conflicts between rapid urbanization and ecological protection. This study provides a characteristic example of how to establish GI networks based on ES evaluations and provides a strong reference for land-use and environmental planning in other developing countries and regions that are exposed to severe ecological deterioration. It also proves that GI network identification is not only applicable to ecological security safeguards but can also be regarded as a useful tool for containing rapid urban sprawl and outward expansion to shape and promote a sustainable urban growth pattern. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Identifying how natural (i.e., unaltered by human activity) and anthropogenic landscape variables influence contemporary functional connectivity in terrestrial organisms can elucidate the genetic consequences of environmental change. We examine population genetic structure and functional connectivity among populations of a declining species, the Blainville's horned lizard (Phrynosoma blainvillii), in the urbanized landscape of the Greater Los Angeles Area in Southern California, USA. Using single nucleotide polymorphism data, we assessed genetic structure among populations occurring at the interface of two abutting evolutionary lineages, and at a fine scale among habitat fragments within the heavily urbanized area. Based on the ecology of P. blainvillii, we predicted which environmental variables influence population structure and gene flow and used gravity models to distinguish among hypotheses to best explain population connectivity. Our results show evidence of admixture between two evolutionary lineages and strong population genetic structure across small habitat fragments. We also show that topography, microclimate, and soil and vegetation types are important predictors of functional connectivity, and that anthropogenic disturbance, including recent fire history and urban development, are key factors impacting contemporary population dynamics. Examining how natural and anthropogenic sources of landscape variation affect contemporary population genetics is critical to understanding how to best manage sensitive species in a rapidly changing landscape.

AB  - Riparian fluvial systems are used for the irrigation of rice. This practice has led to an increasing need to conserve biodiversity of these riparian systems against intensification of riceirrigation systems. This study examined the underlying processes that structure fish community assemblages in a traditional rice irrigation system and how these processes might inform conservation programmes.
   Sampling was conducted at 26 reaches of a permanent irrigation channel in September and December 2007 and May 2008. The relative roles of niche versus dispersal processes were determined by examining species richness across the local environment, such as habitat complexity (diversity of depth and velocity) and size (volume of water) or proximity from the river as potential source of species, and deterministic versus stochastic processes. Non-random or random patterns of species co-occurrence were also compared across the sites.
   Each site's species richness was mainly associated with habitat complexity and size, but not proximity to the river. Also, species co-occurred non-randomly in segregated patterns. Therefore, the fish community was deterministically structured by niche processes and local extinction, but not by stochastic and external immigration processes. In addition, the observed relative abundance distributions primarily fitted a log-normal distribution, indicating a low stress' condition for the fish community.
   To enhance co-existence of fish species, high conservation priority should be given to local factors such as hydraulic complexity and volume of water at reach scale in the rice irrigation system. Fish species preferring slow and shallow environments co-occurred less frequently among reaches, demonstrating the need to conserving hydraulic variability. The effectiveness of local factors and deterministic patterns is thought to derive from stable water flow and high internal and external connectivity, which in turn would safeguard the processes that structure fish community assemblages. Such hydrological connectivity might be the key for conservation in intensified rice-farming landscapes. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - An Environmental Assessment (EA) is one of the steps within the Environmental Impact Assessment process. Birds are often used in EA to help decision makers evaluate potential human impacts from proposed development activities. A "sensitivity to human disturbance" index, created by Parker III et al. (1996) for all Neotropical species, is commonly considered an ecological indicator. However, this parameter was created subjectively and, for most species, there have been no rigorous field test to validate its effectiveness as such. Therefore, in this study, we aim to: (1) evaluate if, at the local scale, birds from forest patches in a human-modified landscape (HML) may differ in sensitivity from Parker's sensitivity classification; (2) evaluate the effectiveness of the species richness value at each sensitivity level as an ecological indicator; (3) gather information on how often and in which manner Parker's classification has been used in EA. To do so, bird sampling was performed in eight forest patches in a HML over one year. Then, we created a local sensitivity to disturbance using information about threat, endemism, spatial distribution and relative abundance of all species in the study area. We found that 37% of the forest birds showed different local sensitivity levels when compared with Parker's classification. Our results show that only the richness of high-sensitivity species from our local classification fitted the ecological indicator assumptions helping the environmental conditions evaluation of the studied patches. We conclude that species richness of each Parker's bird sensitivity levels do not necessarily perform as an ecological indicator at the local scale, and particularly in HML. Nevertheless, Parker's Neotropical bird sensitivity classification was used in 50% of EA we reviewed. In these, 76% assumed that it was an accurate ecological indicator of the local forest conditions for birds. The lack of clear criteria used in Parker's classification allows diverse interpretations by ornithologists, and there is no agreement about the ecological meaning of each sensitivity level and what environmental conditions each level may indicate of. Therefore, the use of Parker's classification in EA may jeopardize accurate interpretations of proposed anthropogenic impacts. Furthermore, because a bird species' sensitivity often varies between locations, we argue that Parker's generalized classification of bird sensitivity should not be used as an indicator of forest environmental conditions in EA throughout HMLs in Neotropics. Rather, local bird ecological indices should be explored, otherwise, erroneous predictions of the anthropogenic impacts will continue to be common. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecosystem services are vital for humans in urban regions. However, urban development poses a great risk for the ability of ecosystems to provide these services. In this paper we first address the most important ecosystem services in functional urban regions in Finland. Well accessible and good quality recreational ecosystem services, for example, provided by urban nature, are an important part of a high-quality living environment and important for public health. Vegetation of urban regions can have a role in carbon dioxide sequestration and thus in climate change mitigation. For instance, estimates of carbon sinks can be compared to total CO2 emissions of an urban region, and the municipality can aim at both increasing carbon sinks and decreasing CO2 emissions with proper land-use planning. Large and contiguous core nature areas, smaller green areas and ecological connections between them are the essence of regional ecological networks and are essential for maintaining interconnected habitats for species and thus biological diversity. Thus, both local and regional level ecological networks are vital for maintaining ecosystem services in urban regions. The impacts of climate change coupled with land-use and land cover change will bring serious challenges for maintaining ecosystem services in urban areas. Although not yet widely used in planning practices, the ecosystem services approach can provide an opportunity for land-use planning to develop ecologically sustainable urban regions. Currently, information on ecosystem services of urban regions is lacking and there is a need to improve the knowledge base for land-use planning.

AB  - Many Mediterranean ecosystems are human-dominated landscapes comprising a mosaic of agricultural, natural and semi-natural habitats alongside urban areas. The size, spatial pattern and connectivity of these "mosaic landscapes" promote changes in wildlife behavior, movement patterns and habitat use.
   Study how spatiotemporal landscape changes impact the spatial dynamics of a mammalian carnivore guild.
   We quantified multi-season activity rates/density from camera trap encounters using N-mixture models. One hundred cameras were located at 25 sites, divided into five categories: nature reserve; large natural area; vineyards within natural area; vineyards near settlements; vineyards within the core agricultural matrix.
   Golden jackals (Canis aureus) were active in anthropogenic modified landscapes. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) avoided the core activity areas of jackal during summer and restricted their activity to their peripheries. European badgers (Meles meles) were active in natural patches during winter, but shifted their activity during summer to agricultural fields embedded within natural patches. Feral and wilds cats (Felis silvestris) were highly active in the natural patches during winter and shifted their activity to the agricultural matrix during summer.
   Intra-guild spatio-temporal activity patterns of carnivores in mosaic landscapes are distinct and unique to each species. The patterns were affected by season, land-use, and jackal activity rates, reflecting inter-specific resource-dependent competitive interactions. The findings highlight the complexity of intra-guild space-use patterns, and shed doubt on the effectiveness of simple solutions to landscape conservation problems.

AB  - Urbanization negatively impacts the diversity of aquatic insect assemblages in headwater streams and can lead to the homogenization of insect communities at the regional level. However, less is known about the impact of urbanization on insects in headwater streams within smaller cities that have significant upstream portions outside of urban land use. We collected insects monthly from April to September in 2014 and 2015 from five streams that flowed from rural upstream through urban downstream land use, plus two rural reference streams, in Greater Binghamton, New York, in the northeast USA. While urbanization was associated with lower insect taxonomic richness (<mml:mo stretchy="false"><overbar></mml:mover>) and elevated stream water conductivity, the regional diversity () was similar among urban and rural land use. This corresponded to higher dissimilarity among urban sites () than among rural sites. To our knowledge, this is the first report of higher urban stream insect community -diversity. Our results suggest that urbanization in this medium-sized city negatively impacts stream insect richness, but the change of community assemblages is not homogenous across the urban landscape. Connectivity between upstream rural sites and downstream urban sites may provide some relief from the impacts of urbanization in smaller cities.

AB  - Soil bacteria are diverse and form complicated ecological networks through various microbial interactions, which play important roles in soil multi-functionality. However, the seasonal effects on the bacterial network, especially the relationship between bacterial network topological features and soil resistomes remains underexplored, which impedes our ability to unveil the mechanisms of the temporal-dynamics of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Here, a field investigation was conducted across four seasons at the watershed scale. We observed significant seasonal variation in bacterial networks, with lower complexity and stability in autumn, and a wider bacterial community niche in summer. Similar to bacterial communities, the co-occurrence networks among ARGs also shift with seasonal change, particularly with respect to the topological features of the node degree, which on average was higher in summer than in the other seasons. Furthermore, the nodes with higher betweenness, stress, degree, and closeness centrality in the bacterial network showed strong relationships with the 10 major classes of ARGs. These findings highlighted the changes in the topological properties of bacterial networks that could further alter antibiotic resistance in soil. Together, our results reveal the temporal dynamics of bacterial ecological networks at the watershed scale, and provide new insights into antibiotic resistance management under environmental changes.

AB  - Ponds are important elements of green areas in cities that help counteract the negative consequences of urbanization, by providing important habitats for biodiversity in cities and being essential nodes in the overall landscape-scale habitat network. However, there is relatively little knowledge about the impacts of pond management intensity, function and environmental variables on urban pond biodiversity. In this study we addressed this gap by investigating which factors were correlated with the level of biodiversity in urban ponds, indicated by species richness of aquatic insects, in Stockholm, Sweden. Our study did not confirm any direct link between the perceived intensity of management or function of ponds and overall biodiversity. However, it seems that management can influence particular groups of species indirectly, since we found that Trichoptera richness (Caddisflies) was highest at intermediate management intensity. We suggest that this is caused by management of vegetation, as the amount of floating and emergent vegetation was significantly correlated with both the overall species richness and the richness of Trichoptera (Caddisflies). This relationship was non-linear, since ponds with an intermediate coverage of vegetation had the highest richness. Interestingly, the amount of vegetation in the pond was significantly affected by pond function and pond management. The overall species richness and richness of Trichoptera were also positively correlated with pond size. Since we found that the pattern of relations between species richness and environmental variables differed between the insect groups we suggest that it will be difficult to provide overall design and management recommendations for ponds in urban green areas. Therefore, it is recommended that to provide high aquatic diversity of species in urban areas one should aim at promoting high diversity of different types of ponds with differing management and environmental factors that shape them.

AB  - Landscape connectivity is vital to the ecological health of many landscapes, and identification of linkages in working landscapes that are somewhat, but not irreversibly, degraded is needed. Assessment of the current ecological condition of habitat linkages can be used to determine appropriate management activities, including restoration. Forecasting the future ecological condition of identified linkages under multiple human-use scenarios can identify future patterns of vulnerability and degradation, and thus aid in prioritization of conservation and restoration actions. We forecast the ecological condition of a modeled conservation network of cores and habitat linkages in the San Joaquin Valley, California, a highly developed agricultural area. We assessed current and projected future impacts from modeled urban growth representing seven regional urban growth policy scenarios to determine conservation and restoration priorities. We characterized current ecological condition of the linkages using a clustering algorithm that compared vegetation type, length, and major road and canal crossings. The modeled urban growth forecasts were overlaid on the ecological network to identify expected impacts. A threat index was calculated for individual network components and for component clusters, and revealed significant impact differences between the various urban growth scenarios. The linkages most threatened by urban conversion were those that are currently the most ecologically degraded, suggesting that a significant future conservation issue in this working landscape will be the loss of restoration opportunities rather than loss of intact wildlife linkages. This study presents an approach for incorporating regional conservation design with urban growth policy analysis for working landscapes.

AB  - Interest is growing in designing resilient and ecologically rich urban environments that provide social and ecological benefits. Regenerative and biocentric designs fostering urban ecological habitats including food webs that provide ecosystem services for people and wildlife increasingly are being sought. However, the intentional design of urban landscapes for food webs remains in an early stage with few precedents and many challenges. In this paper, we explore the potential to design (for) urban food webs through collaborations between designers and ecologists. We start by examining the ecology and management of Jamaica Bay in New York City as a case study of an anthropogenic landscape where ecosystems are degraded and the integrity of extant food webs are intertwined with human agency. A subsequent design competition focusing on ecological design and management of this large-scale landscape for animal habitat and ecosystem services for people illustrates how designers approach this anthropogenic landscape. This case study reveals that both designing urban landscapes for food webs and directly designing and manipulating urban food webs are complicated and challenging to achieve and maintain, but they have the potential to increase ecological health of, and enhance ecosystem services in, urban environments. We identify opportunities to capitalize on species interactions across trophic structures and to introduce managed niches in biologically engineered urban systems. The design competition reveals an opportunity to approach urban landscapes and ecological systems creatively through a proactive design process that includes a carefully crafted collaborative approach to constructing ecologically functioning landscapes that can integrate societal demands. As designers increasingly seek to build, adapt, and manage urban environments effectively, it will be critical to resolve the contradictions and challenges associated with human needs, ecosystem dynamics, and interacting assemblages of species. Ecologists and designers are still discovering and experimenting with designing (for) urban food webs and fostering species interactions within them. We recommend generating prototypes of urban food webs through a learning-by-doing approach in urban development projects. Design and implementation of urban food webs also can lead to research opportunities involving monitoring and experiments that identify and solve challenges of food-web construction while supporting and encouraging ongoing management.

AB  - High-intensity coal mining has resulted in numerous ecological and environmental problems, and seriously threatens ecological security in China. The identification and optimization of the ecological security pattern (ESP) can facilitate sustainable development while preserving the integrity and stability of ecosystems, which is important for improving ecological security in fragile ecosystems and areas of intensive coal mining. This paper presents an integrated framework for identifying, analyzing, and optimizing ESP in consideration of the core area extracted based on morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA), ecosystem services importance, and ecological risk index. The innovative method combines the model of linking different ecological source grades to multi-process minimum cumulative resistance (multi-process MCRE model) and kernel density analysis and includes the following steps: (1) ecological patches are delimited by assessing ecosystem services importance based on the contributions of water resources supply, soil conservation, gas regulation, and habitat maintenance; (2) ecological sources are identified by considering landscape connectivity along with the number and area of important ecological patches; (3) ecological resistance coefficient is determined based on the ecological risk index, which is constructed by coupling the surface drought index, landscape ecological risk index, and mine disaster risk index; (4) ecological corridors are extracted using the multi-process MCRE model, which is based on minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) theory, and the ecological potentials of ecological sources; and (5) the ESP is optimized via kernel density analysis, and regulation zones are defined based on the optimized ESP. Results demonstrate that the optimized ESP in study area included 3326 km(2) of ecological sources that primarily dominated by grassland, 58 ecological nodes, 827.92 km of group corridors and 308.21 km of landscape corridors; which distribution pattern was "three horizontal, two vertical, and two circles" to ensure continuity of ecological process within study area. The restrictive, protective and key development areas accounted for 17.36%, 59.81%, and 22.83%, respectively; and corresponding planning recommendations were raised. This study not only provides an effective framework to identify, construct, and optimize ESPs in ecologically fragile coal-mining areas, but also purposes the multi-process MCRE model and ecological sources quantification that suitable for global region to achieve the sustainability between resource exploitation, urban development, and ecological protection.

AB  - Urbanization is provoking habitat loss and fragmentation, driving rapid landscape transformation worldwide. Remnant habitats in urban areas can be especially prone to degradation by human activities at short time scales, and poor planning during urban expansion can erode their structural and functional connectivity. Foredunes in particular are threatened significantly by human activities, including coastal urban infrastructure expansion, by bulldozing them and/or by interrupting their continuity across the shoreline, and also by associated light pollution. However, there is still scarce quantification about how urban processes determine changes in remnant habitat extent and modify the configuration of structural connectivity in coastal urban settings. Using an expanding conurbation located in north-central Chile (similar to 29 degrees S) as model system, we investigated the rate of coastal foredune loss and spatial fragmentation due to urban expansion, and the change in the type of structural connectivity, i.e. with other natural habitats vs with urban infrastructure. Based on map analyses of structural connectivity among habitats and with urban infrastructure through time, we estimated foredune habitat extent and fragmentation and their shared border with other habitats and built infrastructure during two time intervals, 2010-2015 and 2015-2020. Distribution and intensity of light pollution on present foredunes were also quantified in situ through field sampling. We found 36 % decline in foredune area and increase in their connection with urban infrastructure. Urban wetlands and parallel dunes also experienced persistent area loss and increase in connection with urban infrastructure. Light pollution was intense in the foredune-beach ecotone. Given the rapid erosion of functional and structural connectivity of natural habitats, it becomes imperious to halt the reduction of remnant habitats and ecotones, and improve natural corridors in urban settings.

AB  - 1. Roads provide suitable conditions for the establishment and growth of exotic species. Most roads are bordered by drainage ditches forming a network of linear wetlands. Drainage ditches may serve as habitats and corridors facilitating the spread of aquatic invaders into the intersected ecosystems. The common reed Phragmites australis is one of these aquatic invaders frequently found in marshes and drainage ditches along roads. We hypothesized that highways have acted as corridors for the dispersal of the common reed and have contributed to the invasion of North American wetlands by this species.
   2. We mapped the spatial distribution of the common reed along the highway network of the province of Quebec, Canada, where a large-scale invasion of this plant species has been reported since the 1960s. We also identified the genotype of common reed colonies using molecular tools and the main characteristics that favour the presence of the common reed in road ditches.
   3. Approximately 67% of the 1359 1-km highway sections surveyed during summer 2003 in Quebec had at least one common reed colony. End to end, common reed colonies totalled 324 km, i.e. 24% of the 1359 km surveyed.
   4. Common reed colonies located along the highways were largely (99%) dominated by the exotic (Eurasian) genotype (haplotype M).
   5. The common reed was more abundant along highways located in warm regions, with a sum of growing degree-days (> 5 degrees C, 12-month period) >= 1885, along highways built before the 1970s and in agricultural regions dominated by corn and soybean crops. Common reed colonies were larger when located along highways that were wide, built before the 1970s or in warm regions. This was particularly apparent if the roadside was bordered by a wetland. On the other hand, common reed colonies were more likely to be narrow when located near a woodland.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Several disturbances (de-icing salts, ditch digging and agricultural nitrogen input) favour the development of large common reed colonies along roads, some of them expanding out of roadsides, particularly in wetlands. Reducing disturbances, leaving (or planting) a narrow (a few metres) hedge of trees or shrubs along highways or planting salt-resistant shrubs in roadside ditches could be efficient ways to slow the expansion of common reed or to confine the species to roadsides.

AB  - Early detection of the spatial expansion pattern of alien plants and the associated environmental factors are essential for their management. In this study, we applied regression kriging and geographically weighted regression, which can incorporate spatial autocorrelation into the model, to estimate the critical environmental factors related to the invasion of Hypochaeris radicata into new habitats. We spatially interpolated the occurrence probabilities of H. radicata based on field survey data from 2000-2001 and 2018-2020 to compare the distri-bution pattern of this species over 20 years. Further, we evaluated the relative importance of environmental variables for the invasion of H. radicata using geographically weighted regression. Based on the results of our model, the expansion of H. radicata was found to be significantly associated with anthropogenic activities, such as human footprinting (HFP) and residential area, and the transportation system area. These results suggest that the primary dispersal forces of H. radicata are human activities, and that roads may be the main corridor of its expansion. Additionally, H. radicata did not invade the forest area over the 20 years. We can predict that this plant may flourish better around big cities because of human activities. Furthermore, deforestation and sporadic mowing can accelerate the expansion of H. radicata because of its preference for sunny spots.

AB  - Larger geographical areas contain more species-an observation raised to a law in ecology. Less explored is whether biodiversity changes are accompanied by a modification of interaction networks. We use data from 32 spatial interaction networks from different ecosystems to analyse how network structure changes with area. We find that basic community structure descriptors (number of species, links and links per species) increase with area following a power law. Yet, the distribution of links per species varies little with area, indicating that the fundamental organization of interactions within networks is conserved. Our null model analyses suggest that the spatial scaling of network structure is determined by factors beyond species richness and the number of links. We demonstrate that biodiversity-area relationships can be extended from species counts to higher levels of network complexity. Therefore, the consequences of anthropogenic habitat destruction may extend from species loss to wider simplification of natural communities.
   Using 32 ecological networks (host-parasite, plant-pollinator, plant-herbivore and other food webs), the authors show that several network properties scale with the size of the sampling area, suggesting a new type of biodiversity-area relationship.

AB  - Aim To reconstruct the spread of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.; Asteraceae) using herbarium specimens to document whether the habitat preferences of this plant have shifted through time.
   Location Southern Quebec.
   Methods Herbarium specimens stored in the main herbaria of southern Quebec were used to reconstruct the spread of common ragweed. All data (sampling location, year of sampling, habitat characteristics, etc.) were incorporated into a geographical information system. Maps indicating the spatial distribution of common ragweed were produced for four time periods. The cumulative number of locations was plotted against time to construct invasion curves. The sequence of habitats where herbarium specimens were collected was also reconstructed.
   Results A data base incorporating 707 common ragweed herbarium specimens was constructed for this study. The spread of common ragweed in most regions of southern Quebec was initiated at the beginning of the 20th century. Herbarium specimens suggest that common ragweed first spread along river corridors. Specimens of common ragweed were not collected in agricultural fields before the mid-1920s, nor along roads and railways before the mid-1930s. The colonization of a large number of agricultural fields by common ragweed probably began with seed-contaminated crops, but was certainly accelerated by the dispersal of seeds from populations growing along nearby roads.
   Main conclusions Herbarium specimens suggest that common ragweed has been present in southern Quebec for at least 200 years, but the species was probably restricted to the Montreal area during the 19th century. It is likely that the development of the road network in Quebec since the mid-1930s significantly contributed to the spread of common ragweed. Controlling common ragweed solely in agricultural fields would not prevent the re-infestation of crops, because roadsides would act as refuges for the weed.

AB  - Microbial taxa within complex ecological networks can be classified by their universal roles based on their level of connectivity with other taxa. Highly connected taxa within an ecological network (kinless hubs) are theoretically expected to support higher levels of ecosystem functions than less connected taxa (peripherals). Empirical evidence of the role of kinless hubs in regulating the functional potential of soil microbial communities, however, is largely unexplored and poorly understood in agricultural ecosystems. Here, we built a correlation network of fungal and bacterial taxa using a large-scale survey consisting of 243 soil samples across functionally and economically important agricultural ecosystems (wheat and maize); and found that the relative abundance of taxa classified as kinless hubs within the ecological network are positively and significantly correlated with the abundance of functional genes including genes for C fixation, C degradation, C methanol, N cycling, P cycling and S cycling. Structural equation modeling of multiple soil properties further indicated that kinless hubs, but not provincial, connector or peripheral taxa, had direct significant and positive relationships with the abundance of multiple functional genes. Our findings provide novel evidence that the relative abundance of soil taxa classified as kinless hubs within microbial networks are associated with high functional potential, with implications for understanding and managing (through manipulating microbial key species) agricultural ecosystems at a large spatial scale.

AB  - The Green and Blue Infrastructure (GBI) is a new approach for dealing with biodiversity conservation based on maintaining the ecological networks by ensuring the survival of animal and plant species. GBI is considered a new public policy to avoid the loss of biodiversity by preserving landscape connectivity and protecting natural habitats from fragmentation. Countries including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Italy, Portugal, Japan, China, Brazil, and Turkey are seeking to integrate this concept into their environmental policies. This study proposed a methodology to design a GBI at a regional scale applied to the Sousse region in Tunisia. Two main approaches were used. The first was based on identifying three reference species marked by different dispersal distances. The second applied GIS spatial analysis using the buffer model to help assess the ecological connectivity. The methodology developed comprises five steps. In the first step, a forest habitat sub-frame, a semi-open habitat sub-frame, and a wetland sub-frame were determined from a detailed land-use map. Then, different biodiversity reservoirs were identified. In the third step, buffers varying between 200, 250, and 300 m depending on the dispersal distance of the reference species (Cape hare, North African Hedgehog, and Marbled Teal) were applied around the reservoirs to identify zones of potential connections between them. Next, buffers were also applied to detect fragmentation zones along road networks and built-up areas. Finally, the ecological corridors were mapped from the overlay between zones of potential connections and the fragmentation map. The result was the creation of a GBI of the Sousse region with reservoirs of biodiversity and ecological corridors connecting them.

AB  - The richness and abundance of ground-dwelling arthropods were investigated by a space-for-time substitution approach from spring to autumn of 2012 in the Hexi Corridor region, Gansu Province, to understand the effects of grassland salinization on the temporal distribution of the ground-dwelling arthropod community. The results showed that: 1) grassland salinization had a serious damage to the ground-dwelling arthropod community. The magnitude of the decrease was spring > summer > autumn, resulting in obvious change on seasonal distribution pattern of the grourid-dwelling arthropod community; 2) the abundance of predators, herbivores and decomposers decreased significantly in all three seasons with salinization development, with greater effects in spring than in summer and autumn; 3) with salinization development, the most abundant taxon was Formicidae. However, the second dominant family changed over the time of the study. For example, in the lightly salinized grassland, the second dominant families were Lycosidae in spring and autumn, they were gradually replaced by Tenebrionidae in spring and Gnaphosidae in autumn in the severely salinized grassland; and 4) changes in the ground-dwelling arthropod community were largely related to changes in the physical environment and resource availability during the process of grassland salinization. Our results suggest that plant density, vegetation cover and fine particles content played important roles in structuring the ground-dwelling arthropods during the process of grassland salinization.

AB  - The movements of backyard poultry and wild bird populations are known to pose a disease risk to the commercial poultry industry. However, it is often difficult to estimate this risk due to the lack of accurate data on the numbers, locations, and movement patterns of these populations. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the use of three different data sources when investigating disease transmission risk between poultry populations in New Zealand including (1) cross-sectional survey data looking at the movement of goods and services within the commercial poultry industry, (2) backyard poultry sales data from the online auction site TradeMe?, and (3) citizen science data from the wild bird monitoring project eBird.
   The cross-sectional survey data and backyard poultry sales data were transformed into network graphs showing the connectivity of commercial and backyard poultry producers across different geographical regions. The backyard poultry network was also used to parameterise a Susceptible-Infectious (SI) simulation model to explore the behaviour of potential disease outbreaks. The citizen science data was used to create an additional map showing the spatial distribution of wild bird observations across New Zealand. To explore the potential for diseases to spread between each population, maps were combined into bivariate choropleth maps showing the overlap between movements within the commercial poultry industry, backyard poultry trades and, wild bird observations.
   Network analysis revealed that the commercial poultry network was highly connected with geographical clustering around the urban centres of Auckland, New Plymouth and Christchurch. The backyard poultry network was also a highly active trade network and displayed similar geographic clustering to the commercial network. In the disease simulation models, the high connectivity resulted in all suburbs becoming infected in 96.4 % of the SI simulations. Analysis of the eBird data included reports of over 80 species; the majority of which were identified as coastal seabirds or wading birds that showed little overlap with either backyard or commercial poultry.
   Overall, our study findings highlight how the spatial patterns of trading activity within the commercial poultry industry, alongside the movement of backyard poultry and wild birds, have the potential to contribute significantly to the spread of diseases between these populations. However, it is clear that in order to fully understand this risk landscape, further data integration is needed; including the use of additional datasets that have further information on critical variables such as environmental factors.

AB  - Most non-native weeds and other naturalised plants are in the early stages of invasion into New Zealand landscapes. For this invasion to be controlled, even partially, it is important to understand the dominant routes, mechanisms, and rates of weed spread across landscapes. With their linear corridors of disturbed habitats, roadsides are thought to play a large role in the spread of some weeds. We used both new surveys and existing data to assess which of the 328 environmental weeds listed by the Department of Conservation are most frequently found on roadsides, where, and whether distribution patterns are consistent with linear dispersal. We also analysed historical survey data for relationships between reserve weediness and proximity to roads. We surveyed 340 plots of 100-m-long stretches of roadside across four regions and found between 2 and 19 environmental weeds per plot; 128 species in total (Chao estimate 148). Especially abundant were agricultural species (weeds and cultivated), species that have been naturalised for well over 50 years, and species that disperse externally attached to vertebrates. While we purposefully sampled within 10 km of town limits, we found no strong effect of distance from town on roadside weed richness, including richness of just ornamentally sourced weeds. Instead, number of houses within 250 m and presence of an adjacent house or other residential structure were both important, as was presence of woody vegetation on and adjacent to roadsides. Reserves adjacent to roads had significantly higher weed richness than reserves further from roads, although the causal mechanisms are unclear. Our results suggest that while roadsides include suitable habitats for most environmental weeds, distributions are patchy and roads show little sign of acting as linear dispersal corridors, instead largely reflecting neighbouring land uses. As such, roadside weeds should best be managed as part of the wider landscape.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation is challenging in urbanizing landscapes where recurring habitat degradation occurs and space is limited for subsequent restoration. Conservation efforts based on natural reserves may not be able to maintain certain ecological processes that extend beyond the reserves. There is an urgent need to conserve or restore critical habitats outside of protected areas to maintain the functional connectivity of habitat networks. In this study, we developed a connectivity modelling approach associated with varying conservation scenarios to establish habitat conservation priorities in a rapidly urbanizing area of Shenzhen, China. We incorporated unprotected habitat patches into the reserve network via four scenarios and prioritized the contributions of these patches to habitat connectivity. We also investigated the responses of species with different dispersal abilities to habitat changes under each conservation scenario. The results showed that the spatial pattern of unprotected habitats played an important role in enhancing the connectivity of the entire network within the study area. The habitat patches around protected areas could create greater connectivity gains and should be prioritized for conservation. The key patches that substantially enhance connectivity were identified as special conservation concerns. The connectivity benefits from different scenarios were closely linked with species dispersal abilities. This study promotes the understanding of the importance of habitats outside of protected areas in urbanizing landscapes and provides the species-specific and spatially explicit conservation schemes for making informed decisions in urban planning and management.

AB  - Background and aims - Understanding how to ensure connectivity by gene flow between insect-pollinated plant populations is essential for designing functional ecological networks in a human-dominated matrix such as in urban settings. Linear landscape elements (LLEs) might contribute to such connectivity by increasing pollen transfer.
   Methods - Pollen dispersal was investigated for the insect-pollinated herb Primula elatior in urban forest remnants, using fluorescent dye as a pollen analogue, in three study sites comprising population pairs located in fragments connected or not by a wooded LLE. We examined whether the presence of a small patch of plants of P elatior placed within the LLE (stepping-stone population) might increase pollen dispersal compared to an LLE where P. elatior is absent.
   Key results - Dye dispersal showed a leptokurtic decay distribution, with most dye transfer events at short distances (80% at less than 15.4-114.8 m) and a maximal distance of 647.5 m. Populations not connected by an LLE, separated by distances of 249 m or more, did not exchange dye, whereas populations that were connected by LLEs (up to 602 m) did show interpopulation dye transfer, suggesting that LLEs function as biological corridors facilitating dye dispersal. The presence of a stepping-stone population of P. elatior within the LLE increased between-population dye transfers (between 1.8 and 3.3 times the proportion of visited individuals) and deposition distances, compared to an LLE with no stepping stone, at least when pollen flow already existed.
   Conclusions - These results provide evidence that LLEs may be more effective for pollen dispersal when serving as both movement conduit and habitat. In urban settings, developing a network of core populations connected by LLEs comprising small, even temporary, stepping-stone populations should be encouraged.

AB  - The construction of ecological security pattern is one of the important ways to alleviate the contradiction between economic development and ecological protection, as well as the important contents of ecological civilization construction. How to scientifically construct the ecological security pattern of small-scale counties, and achieve sustainable economic development based on ecological environment protection, it has become an important proposition in regulating the ecological process effectively. Taking Fengxian County of China as an example, this paper selected the importance of ecosystem service functions and ecological sensitivity to evaluate the ecological importance and identify ecological sources. Furthermore, we constructed the ecological resistance surface by various landscape assignments and nighttime lighting modifications. Through a minimum cumulative resistance model, we obtained ecological corridors and finally constructed the ecological security pattern comprehensively combining with ecological resistance surface construction. Accordingly, we further clarified the specific control measures for ecological security barriers and regional functional zoning. This case study shows that the ecological security pattern is composed of ecological sources and corridors, where the former plays an important security role, and the latter ensures the continuity of ecological functions. In terms of the spatial layout, the ecological security barriers built based on ecological security pattern and regional zoning functions are away from the urban core development area. As for the spatial distribution, ecological sources of Fengxian County are mainly located in the central and southwestern areas, which is highly coincident with the main rivers and underground drinking water source area. Moreover, key corridors and main corridors with length of approximately 115.71 km and 26.22 km, respectively, formed ecological corridors of Fengxian County. They are concentrated in the western and southwestern regions of the county which is far away from the built-up areas with strong human disturbance. The results will provide scientific evidence for important ecological land protection and ecological space control at a small scale in underdeveloped and plain counties. In addition, it will enrich the theoretical framework and methodological system of ecological security pattern construction. To some extent, it also makes a reference for improving the regional ecological environment carrying capacities and optimizing the ecological spatial structure in such kinds of underdeveloped small-scale counties.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the most intensive threats to biodiversity worldwide. The rapid sprawl of urban settings often comprises a drastic landscape transformation due to the replacement of natural vegetation by impervious surfaces. However, cities can serve as critical refuges for some native fauna, particularly for pollinators. Here we used citizen data to contrast the structure of hummingbird-plant meta-networks across different greenspaces (natural protected areas, urban parks, urban gardens and street trees areas) in a tropical megacity. We compiled hummingbird-plant visitation records in Mexico City available in two citizen science resources: iNaturalist and eBird. We first determined whether the retrieved dataset was representative to estimate network metrics by calculating sample coverage and estimating species richness in different greenspaces. Then, we characterized network structure and plant importance for network organization according to plant origin, life form and pollination syndrome. We recorded 17 hummingbirds visiting 84 plant species, encompassing a total of 742 interactions. Natural protected areas and urban parks showed a higher richness of hummingbirds and plants. All networks had low levels of connectance, specialization, and nestedness. Modularity was significant across all networks with higher values in natural protected areas and urban gardens. Native and introduced plant species showed a similar contribution to network organization. Non-ornithophilous plants were most important in natural protected areas, while tree species were most important in street trees greenspaces. Our results provide evidence of generalization of hummingbird-plant networks in urban areas. Introduced species and nonornithophilous plants were equally important for hummingbirds, suggesting an integration of alien plants with no specialized bird pollination traits into ecological networks in urban scenarios. Promoting conservation initiatives as pollinator gardens with key native species for hummingbirds across the city could contribute to the functional connectivity and restoration of ecological interactions in cities.

AB  - Conservation research has historically been aimed at preserving high value natural habitats, but urbanization and its associated impacts have prompted broader mandates that include the preservation and promotion of biodiversity in cities. Current efforts within urban landscapes aim to support biodiversity and diverse ecosystem services such as storm water management, sustainable food production, and toxin remediation. Arthropod natural enemies provide biocontrol services important for the ecosystem management of urban greenspaces. Establishing habitat for these and other beneficial arthropods is a growing area of urban conservation. Habitat design, resource inputs, management, and abiotic conditions shape the value of greenspace habitats for arthropods. In general, larger patches with diverse plant communities support a greater abundance and diversity of natural enemies and biocontrol services, yet opposing patterns or no effects have also been documented. The surrounding landscape is likely a contributor to this variation in natural enemy response to patch-scale habitat design and management. Looking across rural-urban landscape gradients, natural enemy communities shift toward dominance by habitat generalists and disturbance tolerant species in urban areas compared to rural or natural communities. These changes have been linked to variation in habitat fragmentation, plant productivity and management intensity. In landscape-scale studies focusing solely within cities, variables such as impervious surface area and greenspace connectivity affect the community assembly of natural enemies within a patch. Given these findings, a greater mechanistic understanding of how both the composition and spatial context of urban greenspaces influence natural enemy biodiversity-biocontrol relationships is needed to advance conservation planning and implementation.

AB  - Earthquakes not only cause the destruction of surface buildings and a large number of casualties, but also have an important impact on regional land-use change. Timely understanding of land cover and its changes before and after earthquakes is of great scientific significance for studying the restoration and reconstruction of the natural ecosystem and the sustainable development of the social economy in disaster areas. At present, there are few studies on land cover changes before and after earthquakes in the earthquake-stricken areas, especially the quantitative assessment of land cover changes before and after earthquakes at the micro scale of landscape spatial distribution. Therefore, this article is based on remote sensing data and uses an earthquake in Jiuzhaigou, Sichuan, as an example. By calculating the land-use degree comprehensive index and its rate of change, the transfer matrix of land-use, quantitative expression methods of the landscape via the landscape pattern index are analyzed from the points of view of the spatial-temporal evolution law of the landscape pattern of land cover before and after the earthquake. The experimental results showed that the area of forest, cropland, shrub. and grassland types in the study area changed greatly, and the area of grassland types in Shuanghe Township changed most obviously, as they increased from 6.57 km(2) in 2015 to 7.43 km(2), and then decreased to 6.21 km(2) in 2020. During the earthquake recovery period, the comprehensive index of land-use degree for most towns in the study area showed an upward trend, and the land cover types were improved. After 2017, the PD and LSI of the study area showed a downward trend, among which the bare land type changed greatly, with the PD value decreasing from 0.38 in 2017 to 0.21 in 2020, and the LSI value decreasing from 58.29 in 2017 to 40.69 in 2020. This indicates that the degree of landscape fragmentation and the spatial heterogeneity of the land surface in the study area are reduced in the later stage of earthquake recovery. After 2017, the AI value of the study area showed an upward trend, and the AI value of the bare land type increased from 63.97 in 2017 to 78.25 in 2020, indicating that the connectivity between landscape patches in the study area was enhanced in the later stage of the earthquake. This also reflects that the ecological environment of the study area gradually showed a good trend in the later stage of the earthquake. The results of this paper not only reveal the spatial-temporal evolution of land cover in Jiuzhaigou County before and after the earthquake, but also help the relevant national decision-making departments to formulate corresponding policies and measures.

AB  - By the mid-century, urban areas are expected to house two-thirds of the world's population of approximately 10 billion people. The key challenge will be to provide food for all with fewer farmers in rural areas and limited options for expanding cultivated fields in urban areas, with sustainable soil management being a fundamental criterion for achieving sustainability goals. Understanding how nature works in a fast changing world and fostering nature-based agriculture (such as low-input farming) are crucial for sustaining food systems in the face of worsening urban heat island (UHI) effects and other climatic variables. The best fit for the context is transformative agroecology, which connects ecological networks, sustainable farming approaches, and social movements through change-oriented research and action. Even though agroecology has been practiced for over a century, its potential to address the socioeconomic impact of the food system remained largely unexplored until recently. Agroecological approaches, which involve effective interactions between researchers, policy makers, farmers, and consumers, can improve social cohesion and socioeconomic synergies while reducing the use of various agricultural inputs. This review presents a timeline of agroecology transformation from the past to the present and discusses the possibilities, prospects, and challenges of agroecological urbanism toward a resilient urban future.

AB  - Urbanization affects key aspects of wildlife ecology. Dispersal in urban wildlife species may be impacted by geographical barriers but also by a species' inherent behavioural variability. There are no functional connectivity analyses using continuous individual-based sampling across an urban-rural continuum that would allow a thorough assessment of the relative importance of physical and behavioural dispersal barriers. We used 16 microsatellite loci to genotype 374 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) from the city of Berlin and surrounding rural regions in Brandenburg in order to study genetic structure and dispersal behaviour of a mobile carnivore across the urban-rural landscape. We assessed functional connectivity by applying an individual-based landscape genetic optimization procedure. Three commonly used genetic distance measures yielded different model selection results, with only the results of an eigenvector-based multivariate analysis reasonably explaining genetic differentiation patterns. Genetic clustering methods and landscape resistance modelling supported the presence of an urban population with reduced dispersal across the city border. Artificial structures (railways, motorways) served as main dispersal corridors within the cityscape, yet urban foxes avoided densely built-up areas. We show that despite their ubiquitous presence in urban areas, their mobility and behavioural plasticity, foxes were affected in their dispersal by anthropogenic presence. Distinguishing between man-made structures and sites of human activity, rather than between natural and artificial structures, is thus essential for better understanding urban fox dispersal. This differentiation may also help to understand dispersal of other urban wildlife and to predict how behaviour can shape population genetic structure beyond physical barriers.

AB  - Protecting riparian corridors is a commonly applied environmental policy in urban landscapes. However, empirical data demonstrating their efficacy for biodiversity conservation outcomes is scarce. In this study we investigated whether riparian corridor width influences the diversity and community structure of ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and vascular plant assemblages therein. Eighteen corridors of differing widths were selected from within the Ku-ring-gai Local Government Area, Sydney Australia. Ants were sampled using pitfall traps positioned within rectangular vegetation transects (30x10 m). Both ant and plant species richness, when standardised for sampling effort, were unrelated to riparian corridor width. However, significant compositional differences between sites were evident with increased width up to similar to 50 m. Narrow corridors contained greater abundances of opportunistic ant species and higher proportions of exotic plants. We interpret this to be the result of the greater disturbance/edge influence derived from adjacent upland urban environments. Site beta diversity did not increase with corridor width, suggesting that the exclusion of novel upslope habitats in narrow riparian corridors is not a significant cause of community assemblage modification at these sites. To minimise the impact of deleterious edge effects on ant fauna, environmental managers should seek to retain riparian corridors wider than similar to 50 m. However, we observed substantial between-site variability of biotic assemblages, irrespective of corridor width. Therefore we recommend that environmental management practice needs to take a catchment-wide approach and consider other parameters that may contribute to riparian health so as to optimise the protection of riparian biodiversity.

AB  - Land use and landcover change alter the ability of habitat networks to maintain viable species populations. While their effects on the quality, amount and patterns of landcover patches are commonly studied, how they affect ecological processes, such as predation on focal species remains neglected. This macroecological study tests the hypothesis that predator assemblages are affected by land use intensity linked to different socio-economic contexts. We measured the distribution and abundance of two avian predator groups (generalist corvid birds and specialist raptors), and proxy variables that mirror their food resources, at three spatial scales in northern Europe's West and East. In total, we made 900 survey counts for avian predators and their resources in six landcover strata throughout five landscapes and analyzed their relationships. The abundance of omnivorous corvid birds was associated with the number of anthropogenic food resources. Thus, corvid birds were most common in the urban and agricultural landcovers, and where forest cover was low. Corvid bird abundance, and availability of their resources, increased with increasing land use intensity. Raptors were less abundant than corvid birds and most common in semi-natural grasslands. The number of raptor species increased with decreasing land use intensity. This study shows that the abundance and composition of avian predator species must be understood to maintain functional habitat networks.

AB  - Maintaining connectivity among remaining natural areas has become increasingly important to ameliorate the negative effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on wildlife populations. Early corridor networks were based on structural connectivity (i.e. habitat structure) and designed to connect protected areas. In recent decades, many methods have been developed to increase the ecological realism of such corridor design to avoid misguided management. However, the multitude and complexity of methods can be a hurdle for conservation planners. Here, we combine a limited set of multiple methods to present a connectivity analysis framework that produces repeatable, intuitive, and ecologically relevant connectivity estimates. We use a modified habitat suitability analysis, accounting for protected area effectiveness, as a starting point for least-cost corridor estimates, and evaluate the network using graph theory. We apply the framework to an existing corridor network in Belize, Central America, by estimating potential functional connectivity for white-lipped peccaries Tayassu pecari between systematically identified core patches. We found that forest productivity and protected area effectiveness were important predictors of habitat suitability for white-lipped peccaries. The graph-theoretic network analyses identified particularly important core areas for overall landscape connectivity and indicated potentially weak links in the existing network, while the least-cost corridor outlines indicated general areas where the implementation of connectivity-enhancing measures could strengthen such weak links. With this study, we provide a framework to improve the scientific rigour, ecological meaningfulness, and conservation relevance of applied corridor network design.

AB  - Grazing is a major driver of the composition of microbial communities, which play important roles in soil functioning. Mechanisms whereby grazing might regulate the spatial heterogeneity of microbial communities within ecological networks remain largely untested. We used network analysis to identify the impacts of increasing grazing intensity by livestock (cattle, sheep, goats), and native (kangaroos) and wild (rabbits) animals, on the spatial heterogeneity of the relative abundance of eight ecological clusters of co-occurring soil microbial taxa: four from Grasslands and four from Forests. Grazing effects on microbial spatial heterogeneity were strongly nuanced and depended on (1) plant community type, (2) herbivore type and (3) microbial identity. Microbial within-site spatial heterogeneity was greater in Grasslands than in Forests, and most effects of grazing on microbial spatial heterogeneity were in Forests, effecting three of the four Forest clusters, but only one Grassland cluster. The associations between grazing intensity and microbial heterogeneity were driven indirectly by changes in the spatial heterogeneity of litter cover and soil pH. For Grasslands, we also detected a direct effect of grazing intensity on the heterogeneity of particular microbial groups. Our results indicate that increased grazing intensity will advantage some microbial clusters but disadvantage others. Together, our study provides evidence that grazing intensity regulates the abundance and spatial heterogeneity of microbial communities within ecological networks. Knowing the potential effects of herbivores on different microbial clusters can help us predict the likely effects of grazing on soil function. This has important implications for future sustainable management and conservation policies.

AB  - Recent reports of drastic declines in insect populations have raised global concerns about their conservation. Light pollution is a near inseparable feature of human-altered landscapes and is a potential contributing factor to insect declines. However, despite the wide recognition of the deleterious effects of lights on insects, whether these effects scale up to impact insect populations remains unclear. Here, we relied on a combination of ecological niche modeling, geographical information systems, and interviews on local ecological knowledge to assess the synergistic effects of landscape light pollution and habitat loss and fragmentation on populations of the Choc ' o golden scarab Chrysina argenteola. Sightings of C. argenteola by locals revealed individuals are scarcer in areas with reduced forest cover and rely on inter-patch dispersal to cope with habitat fragmentation, where they were constantly attracted to urban lights. Increasingly lit landscapes had more individuals attracted to lights, but the opposite was true in areas with less than 4 km2 of remaining forest cover. We suggest this pattern arises as landscape light pollution intercepts individuals during inter-patch dispersal. This hinders habitat connectivity, potentially disrupting metapopulation dynamics, being populations inhabiting areas with scarce fragmented habitat more vulnerable to this process. We show light pollution acts in combination with habitat loss and fragmentation in detriment of insect populations at the landscape scale.

AB  - Understanding species-environment relationships at large spatial scales is required for the prioritization of conservation areas and the preservation of landscape connectivity for large carnivores. This endeavour is challenging for jaguars (Panthera onca), given their elusiveness, and the local nature of most jaguar studies, precluding extrapolation to larger areas. We developed an occupancy model using occurrence data of jaguars across five countries of Central America, collected from camera-trap studies of 2-12 months' duration, deployed over an area of 14 112 km(2) from 2005 to 2018. Our occupancy model showed that habitat use of jaguars increased with primary net productivity and distance to human settlements, and decreased with distance to rivers. Detection of the species was related to survey effort and research team identity. Within the jaguar extent of occurrence, 73% was deemed suitable for the species, with 47% of it lying within Jaguar Conservation Units (JCU) and 59% of JCU land being legally protected. Suitable areas were divided into four distinct clusters of continuous habitat shared across country borders. However, large areas of predicted low habitat suitability may constrict connectivity in the region. The reliability of these spatial predictions is indicated by the model validation using an independent dataset (AUC = 0.82; sensitivity = 0.766, specificity = 0.761), and concordance of our results with other studies conducted in the region. Across Central America, we found that human influence has the strongest impact on jaguar habitat use and JCUs are the main reservoirs of habitat. Therefore, conservation actions must focus on preventing habitat loss and mitigating human pressure, particularly within the clusters of continuous areas of high suitability, and on restoring habitat to foster connectivity. The long-term persistence of jaguars in the region will depend on strong international cooperation that secures jaguar populations and their habitat across Central American borders.

AB  - Carbon neutrality, achieved by increasing carbon sinks, is an effective strategy for solving the increasingly serious global climate change problem. The continuous exploitation of resources has damaged, the original ecosystem of mining cities leading to poor vegetation growth environment and decreased regional carbon sink capacity. Therefore, it is crucial to restore and enhance the ecological environment of the region and strengthen the carbon sink capacity of vegetation. However, studies on ecological spatial network optimization for mining cities are few. Here, we constructed the ecological spatial network of Xuzhou City, a mining city in China, using a modified minimal cumulative resistance model (MCR). Subsequently, we calculated the topological properties of ecological nodes and ecological spatial network in Xuzhou City by combining complex network theory with ecological network theory and proposed a scheme to optimize the landscape space based on ecological condi-tions. The functionality of ecological sources was determined by coupling the results of the Functional description of ecological sources by Remote Sensing Index (RSEI) and integral index of connectivity (dIIC). Carbon sinks were estimated by land use and the topological indicators were correlated with carbon sinks. Carbon sinks showed a significant positive correlation with betweenness centricity. We proposed an optimization strategy in accordance with the functionality and carbon sink capacity of ecological sources. Finally, we determined the effect of optimization by the change in robustness and carbon sink. The stability of the optimized ecological spatial network and ecological restoration capacity of Xuzhou City significantly improved, while the carbon sink was simultaneously enhanced. Through national ecological construction projects, restoration and renewal of ecological space can effectively enhance the carbon sink of mining cities, and thus achieve the goal of carbon neutrality. This study provides a theoretical and measure reference for future ecological engineering of mining cities. Additionally, it can also be applied in remote sensing to promote urban development and sustainability.

AB  - Context Conservation for the Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis), a federally endangered species in the United States of America, is typically focused on local maternity sites; however, the species is a regional migrant, interacting with the environment at multiple spatial scales. Hierarchical levels of management may be necessary, but we have limited knowledge of landscape-level ecology, distribution, and connectivity of suitable areas in complex landscapes. Objectives We sought to (1) identify factors influencingM. sodalismaternity colony distribution in a mosaic landscape, (2) map suitable maternity habitat, and (3) quantify connectivity importance of patches to direct conservation action. Methods Using 3 decades of occurrence data, we testeda priori, hypothesis-driven habitat suitability models. We mapped suitable areas and quantified connectivity importance of habitat patches with probabilistic habitat availability metrics. Results Factors improving landscape-scale suitability included limited agriculture, more forest cover, forest edge, proximity to medium-sized water bodies, lower elevations, and limited urban development. Areas closer to hibernacula and rivers were suitable. Binary maps showed that 30% of the study area was suitable forM. sodalisand 29% was important for connectivity. Most suitable patches were important for intra-patch connectivity and far fewer contributed to inter-patch connectivity. Conclusions While simple models may be effective for small, homogenous landscapes, complex models are needed to explain habitat suitability in large, mixed landscapes. Suitability modeling identified factors that made sites attractive as maternity areas. Connectivity analysis improved our understanding of important areas for bats and prioritized areas to target for restoration.

AB  - A framework is constructed for how to relate ecosystem services to environmental justice. The benefits humans and society can derive from biophysical processes cannot be viewed as objectively existing "out there", but as entangled in social and political processes. This is unpacked through the analytical moments of generation, distribution and articulation of ecosystem services. Social practice moderates the generation of benefits from biophysical processes (through urban development patterns and day-to-day management of urban ecosystems), but also who in society that benefits from them, i.e. the distribution of ecosystem services (viewed here as the temporal and spatial scales at which it is possible for humans to benefit from biophysical processes). Moreover, for biophysical processes to attain value in decision-making, a social practice of value articulation is needed. The framework then moves between two levels of analysis. At the city-wide level, an ecological network translates how urban 'green' areas, viewed as nodes, are interconnected by ecological flows (water, species movement, etc.) where nodes have different protective and management capacities. The network captures spatial complexity-what happens in one location, can have effects elsewhere. At the local level, urban struggles over land-use are studied to trace how actors utilize artifacts and social arenas to articulate how certain biophysical processes are of value. Competing networks of value articulation strive to influence land-use, and multiple local studies bring understanding of how power operates locally, informing city-wide analyses. Empirical studies from Stockholm, Cape Town and other cities inform the framework. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is a current lack of mechanistic understanding on the relationships between a soil microbial community, crop production, and nutrient fertilization. Here, we combined ecological network theory with ecological resistance index to evaluate the responses of microbial community to additions of multiple inorganic and organic fertilizers, and their associations with wheat production in a 35-year field experiment. We found that microbial phylotypes were grouped into four major ecological clusters, which contained a certain proportions of fast-growers, copiotrophic groups, and potential plant pathogens. The application of combined inorganic fertilizers and cow manure led to the most resistant (less responsive) microbial community, which was associated with the highest levels of plant production, nutrient availability, and the lowest relative abundance of potential fungal plant pathogens after 35 years of nutrient fertilization. In contrast, microbial community was highly responsive (low resistance) to inorganic fertilization alone or plus wheat straw, which was associated with lower crop production, nutrient availability, and higher abundance of potential fungal plant pathogens. Our work demonstrates that the response of microbial community to long-term nutrient fertilizations largely regulates plant production in agricultural ecosystems, and suggests that manipulating these microbial phylotypes may offer a sustainable solution to the maintenance of field productivity under long-term nutrient fertilization scenarios.

AB  - Arboreal mice of the genus Habromys (Cricetidae, Neotominae) comprise a Glade of seven monotypic and endangered species that inhabit Mesoamerican cloud forests, one of the most threatened of the world's ecosystems. Previous genetic analyses have suggested that closely related lineages are poorly differentiated, which is probably an evolutionary consequence of distributional shifts driven by Quaternary climate oscillations through a complex topography. Here, we assess the potential role of distributional shifts through time on current patterns of genetic differentiation in Habromys. Following recent bestpractices recommendations for estimating ecological niches and paleodistributions for montane species, we estimated the potential distribution of the genus across the last glacial-interglacial cycle under three alternative Global Circulation Models to explore the more recent evolutionary history of this genus. Distributional shifts and population connectivity among populations of Habromys were greatly affected by past climate change coupled with topographic habitat heterogeneity. The effectiveness of some barriers to dispersal has changed over time as result of the climatic oscillations. Poorly differentiated genetic lineages might be an evolutionary consequence of intermittent connections and corridors for montane species motivated by glaciations. Some valleys and lowland habitats probably served as previously unrecognized barriers to dispersal during warmer periods. This study emphasizes the dynamic nature of species' geographic distributions and potential barriers to create current patterns of genetic variation in Mesoamerican rodents.

AB  - Purpose Elevated CO2 concentration (eCO(2)) may stimulate plant growth and influence the soil microbial community, but questions remain for whether microbial responses to elevated CO2 would vary by different CO2-responsive plants. We thus attempted to elaborate the changes of soil microbiome to different rice cultivars under the eCO(2) condition.
   Materials and methods Two rice cultivars, i.e., the CO2-tolerant cultivar, Wuyunjing23 (WYJ23), and the CO2-sensitive one, Yandao 6 (YD6), were grown under eCO(2) and ambient CO2 (aCO(2)) conditions. The contents of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) in soil were measured. Real-time qualitative PCR (qPCR) and high-throughput sequencing techniques were employed to characterize the bacterial community. Furthermore, co-occurrence network analysis was applied to reveal the ecological interactions among bacterial taxa.
   Results and discussion No significant differences were found among all treatments in terms of bacterial population, alpha-diversity indices, and bacterial community structure. However, the topological parameters of ecological networks highlighted the distinct co-occurrence patterns among treatments. YD6 under eCO(2) led to more links, lower modularity, and greater centralization degree compared to that under aCO(2). Opposite trends of those parameters were observed for WYJ23 under eCO(2) compared to that under aCO(2). Besides, more Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria served as keystone taxa in the CO2-sensitive cultivar treatments, compared to those in WYJ23, implying the different influences of rice cultivars on the microbial ecological network.
   Conclusions Different rice cultivars under eCO(2) did not influence the alpha- and beta-diversity of the soil bacterial community, but changed the co-occurrence network of the community. More attention should be paid to the assembly mechanisms of the soil microbial microbiome when evaluating the impacts of productive crops on the soil-plant ecosystem under the eCO(2) condition(..)

AB  - Regional planning is bound to play an increasing role in nature conservation policies because much biodiversity is located outside natural parks and other protected areas. Differences in landscape structure between natural parks and surrounding areas may affect their respective species richness and may provide seasonal habitats that enhance total biodiversity. To test these ideas, we analyzed patterns of bird species richness, and its associated conservation value in a largely forested rural area that lies between the natural parks of Sant Llorenc del Munt and Montseny (Catalonia, NE Spain). Relationships of species richness with spatial gradients (X and Y Universal Transversal of Mercator (UTM) coordinates) and with altitude and landscape variables were tested by stepwise multiple regression analysis. Regressions were performed separately for both breeding and wintering species, and considering both all species and only several dominant ecological groups (forest, forest-cropland and cropland species). Bird species richness and its associated conservation value were higher in the study area than in the surrounding borders of natural parks. Cropland and forest-cropland species concentrated outside the natural parks, whereas forest species were uniformly distributed. Total bird species richness was mainly related to landscape diversity and to abundance of open habitats like croplands and shrublands. Cropland species were the most dependent on the abundance of crops and on landscape diversity, whereas forest and forest-cropland species exhibited weak correlations with landscape variables. Most forest species were year-round residents,whereas forest-cropland and cropland species exhibited seasonal shifts in the number of species, mainly because of interchanges with other areas. Results indicate that rural areas play a role complementary to the surrounding natural protected areas in the conservation of bird species richness at different scales. Implications for the design and optimization of ecological networks in the perimetropolitan area of Barcelona are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Terrestrial long-distance migrations are declining globally: in North America, nearly 75% have been lost. Yet there has been limited research comparing habitat suitability and connectivity models to identify migration corridors across increasingly fragmented landscapes. Here we use pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) migrations in prairie habitat to compare two types of models that identify habitat suitability: maximum entropy (Maxent) and expert-based (Analytic Hierarchy Process). We used distance to wells, distance to water, NDVI, land cover, distance to roads, terrain shape and fence presence to parameterize the models. We then used the output of these models as cost surfaces to compare two common connectivity models, least-cost modeling (LCM) and circuit theory. Using pronghorn movement data from spring and fall migrations, we identified potential migration corridors by combining each habitat suitability model with each connectivity model. The best performing model combination was Maxent with LCM corridors across both seasons. Maxent out-performed expert-based habitat suitability models for both spring and fall migrations. However, expert-based corridors can perform relatively well and are a cost-effective alternative if species location data are unavailable. Corridors created using LCM out-performed circuit theory, as measured by the number of pronghorn GPS locations present within the corridors. We suggest the use of a tiered approach using different corridor widths for prioritizing conservation and mitigation actions, such as fence removal or conservation easements.

AB  - Habitat loss, together with less obvious land-use changes such as intensified farming practice, can have significant adverse impacts on biodiversity. An important factor in determining the ability of species to cope with such changes is their potential to sustain a populations network by dispersal across the landscape. Habitat quality and structure are particularly important for surface-dwelling species with low dispersal abilities, such as amphibians. To assess this ecological function, ponds in a coastal and typically rural area of northern France were surveyed for amphibians in 1974, 1992 and 2011. These repeated surveys yielded different outcomes for different species groups. Three rare species persisted in more or less specialized habitat types. Two moderately common species declined, but kept strongholds in coastal dunes and associated marshes. Five common species with broad ecological niches remained equally widespread. The Northern crested newt declined markedly and the Midwife toad declined dramatically, as did their breeding habitats in vegetated ponds and cattle drinking troughs. One species, the Moor frog, may have gone locally extinct. A model of relative resistance to amphibian dispersal was created for different landscape types, on a scale from 0 (low resistance) to 1 (high resistance). This generated values of 0.23 for pasture, 0.72 for arable and 0.98 for urban and transport. As pasture declined in the study area, while arable and urban/transport infrastructure increased, amphibian dispersal became more difficult. However, dispersal paths proved difficult to evaluate in a patchy landscape like the one surveyed, due to a paucity of spatial signal. Pond loss is a more tractable reason for the observed amphibian species decline than is the quality of intervening terrestrial habitat matrix. In 2011, 22 newly created ponds had species richness in line with pre-existing ponds and this will have counteracted a dwindling metapopulation structure, indicating that habitat creation/restoration can play a valuable role in conservation. The colonization of new ponds may also prove more informative for gauging the potential for amphibian dispersal in the landscape than the preceding decline.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation affects landscape connectivity, the extent of which is influenced by the movement capacity of the vectors of seed and pollen dispersal for plants. Negative impacts of reduced connectivity can include reduced fecundity, increased inbreeding, genetic erosion and decreased long-term viability. These are issues for not only old (remnant) populations, but also new (restored) populations. We assessed reproductive and connective functionality within and among remnant and restored populations of a common tree, Banksia menziesii R.Br. (Proteaceae), in a fragmented urban landscape, utilising a genetic and graph theoretical approach. Adult trees and seed cohorts from five remnants and two restored populations were genotyped using microsatellite markers. Genetic variation and pollen dispersal were assessed using direct (paternity assignment) and indirect (pollination graphs and mating system characterisation) methods. Restored populations had greater allelic diversity (Ar=8.08; 8.34) than remnant populations (Ar range=6.49-7.41). Genetic differentiation was greater between restored and adjacent remnants (F-ST=0.03 and 0.10) than all other pairwise comparisons of remnant populations (mean F-ST=0.01 +/- 0.01; n=16 P=0.001). All populations displayed low correlated paternity (r(p)=0.06-0.16) with wide-ranging realised pollen dispersal distances (<1.7km) and well-connected pollen networks. Here, we demonstrate reproductive and connective functionality of old and new populations of B. menziesii within a fragmented landscape. Due to long-distance pollination events, the physical size of these sites underestimates their effective population size. Thus, they are functionally equivalent to large populations, integrated into a larger landscape matrix.

AB  - Although large and medium-sized herbivorous mammals avoid urbanized areas, they have recently begun to colonize towns and cities. In general, ungulates continue to avoid the centres of urban areas, and utilize mainly their thinly built-up outskirts. While extension of urban development is preventing ungulates from penetrating the urban landscape, the influence of noise and light pollution on the occurrence of mammalian herbivores is still poorly understood. Hence, we investigated the hypothesis that habitat availability shapes the distribution of roe deer Capreolus capreolus and artificial lightening discourages them from penetrating the urban landscape. Roe deer was recorded on 37% of randomly selected sample plots (N=60) located within the city of Krakow (S Poland). The occupied plots contained significantly more open habitats, woodland patches were larger in them, but proximity to rivers, and noise and light pollution were significantly lower. The logistic regression model revealed that an increasing area of open habitats was positively correlated with the probability of roe deer occurring. However, the artificial lighting at night was negatively correlated with the probability of the species occurring: the negative effect of light pollution was mitigated by the greater area of open habitats. Our study highlights the very considerable potential of light pollution as a predictor of the occurrence of large mammals in the urban landscape. We argue that urbanization and the related artificial lighting at night may be a factor preventing ungulates from penetrating potentially suitable habitats in urban areas.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation threatens tropical rainforests, which can significantly hinder dispersal in species such as arboreal primates. For conservation actions to be effective there must be an understanding of how landscape structure and biological traits shape dispersal. We assessed the effects of landscape, sex and population management (reintroduction and translocations) on gene flow of Leontopithecus rosalia, an endangered arboreal primate living in highly fragmented forests of Brazil. We genotyped 201 individuals using 14 microsatellite loci to answer three questions: (1) How far does L. rosalia disperse? (2) Is dispersal sex-biased? (3) What are the relative contributions of population management, distance, roads and landscape resistance to genetic kinship? We hypothesized that (1) gene flow decrease between more distant sites; (2) males disperse more than females; and (3) management and land-cover resistance (i.e. landscape resistance) are the variables that most influence genetic kinship. We found positive spatial population-structure up to 8 km. The spatial structure was similar between females and males suggesting that they equally contribute to gene flow. Management and landscape resistance best explained genetic kinship, showing that different land-cover types affect the dispersal at different degrees of landscape permeability. We advocate that maintaining more permeable landscapes is essential to ensure dispersal and gene flow of arboreal mammals. Conservation measures in tropical rainforests must take into account not only the habitat amount, but also the degree at which each land use roads, urban areas, agriculture, pasture, isolated trees, and stepping stones - facilitates or impedes the species dispersal.

AB  - Aim. To identify land and water areas for inclusion in the regional ecological framework of Sevastopol City and to define the core areas for ensuring the representative character of the nature protection network and the ecological stability of the region.Material and Methods. Based on field surveys, archival and published data, the structure of the ecological framework of Sevastopol was specified as a part of the Crimean ecological network, developed in 2008. A schematic map of the protected areas and ecological framework elements was developed and calculation of their area carried out using the QGIS-3.10.10. The index of environmental significance was calculated according to Guryevskikh and a scale for its gradation was suggested. For ecological centres and corridors, the ratio of key areas of the first and second order was analyzed.Results. The creation of 34 protected areas was proposed and their conservation value was shown. The boundaries of the core areas and 11 structural elements of the ecological framework were specified, its representativeness was characterized and problems of its implementation were discussed. As a result of optimization of the nature protection network of Sevastopol, the share of the protected areas and ecological framework of the total area of the city will be increased to 37.1 and 66%, respectively. A complex of conservational measures has been proposed for the protection of populations and biotopes of rare species included in the Red Data Book of Sevastopol.Conclusions. The creation of new core areas and the optimisation of the nature conservation network will ensure the maintenance of the sustainability of the ecological framework and the ecological stability of the region but will not make significant changes to the previously formed disproportion due to the impossibility of creating large objects with a high category of protection. The implementation of the ecological framework project will help to reduce the risk of losing the biological and landscape diversity of the region.

AB  - In order to improve the urban ecological environment and human settlement environment. and enhance the effect of urban landscape planning, in this paper, an urban landscape planning resoui-ce evaluation and optimization method based on the theory of compound ecosystem is proposed. This method comprehensively considers environmental, social, and economic benefits, and selects urban landscape as the evaluation sample, and then an urban landscape planning resource evaluation index system was built. The analytic hierarchy process is used to establish a judgment matrix and obtain weights, and a multi-objective linear weighting function method is used to construct an evaluation model to evaluate the resources of urban landscape planning. Finally, combined with the theory of compound ecosystems, a landscape planning optimization method is given from three aspects: ecological network construction, diversified space construction and sustainable development. The results show that the effect of urban waterfront reconstruction using this evaluation method is good. It can accurately assess the landscape level of each survey point in the study area, optimize control of urban pollution sources, treat polluted garbage, increase vegetation, and improve the diversity of the urban ecological environment and realize the optimization of urban landscape planning.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation threat animal populations worldwide. Agriculture has changed the Cerrado's landscape, in central Brazil, where native vegetation remnants are embedded in a non-natural matrix that can be resistant to animal movement. Felines, as carnivores, play an important ecosystem role as predators and are sensitive to habitat fragmentation. The long-term sustainability of small cat populations depends on the connectivity among natural remnants. The Emas National Park (ENP) is an important protected area located in the southwestern of the state of Goias, a region highly modified by agriculture. We evaluated the landscape connectivity in the surrounding landscape of the ENP for small wildcats of the Cerrado; the margay, southern tiger cat, pampas cat, ocelot and the jaguarundi, based on their dispersal ability and habitat preferences. The habitat availability varied according to each species, the jaguarundi being the species with more habitat available and the margay with less. The ENP is important for the pampas cat and jaguarundi, and the Taquari River Sources State Park (TRSSP) is important for the ocelot, jaguarundi and for the southern tiger cat. The region is of great biological relevance and the lack of remnants around the ENP evidence failure in land management. The method used is a tool to identify priority fragments for conservation and management of the landscape for biodiversity.

AB  - Cropping systems have fertilized soils for decades with undetermined consequences for the productivity and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. One of the critical unknowns is the role of soil biodiversity in controlling crop production after decades of fertilization. This knowledge gap limits our capacity to assess how changes in soil biodiversity could alter crop production and soil health in changing environments. Here, we used multitrophic ecological networks to investigate the importance of soil biodiversity, in particular, the biodiversity of key-stone taxa in controlling soil functioning and wheat production in a 35-year field fertilization experiment. We found strong and positive associations between soil functional genes, crop production and the biodiversity of key-stone phylotypes; soils supporting a larger number of key-stone nematode, bacteria and fungi phylotypes yielded the highest wheat production. These key-stone phylotypes were also positively associated with plant growth (phototrophic bacteria, nitrogen fixers) and multiple functional genes related to nutrient cycling. The retrieved information on the genomes clustered with key-stone bacterial phylotypes indicated that the key-stone taxa had higher gene copies of oxidoreductases (participating most biogeochemical cycles of ecosystems and linking to microbial energetics) and 71 essential functional genes associated with carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur cycling. Altogether, our work highlights the fundamental role of the biodiversity of key-stone phylotypes in maintaining soil functioning and crop production after several decades of fertilization, and provides a list of key-stone phylotypes linking to crop production and soil nutrient cycling, which could give science-based guidance for sustainable food production.

AB  - Question How is the abundance of exotic plants within urban forest remnants influenced by distance to the edges of forest boundaries and recreational trails? Location Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Methods Gradients in the cover of exotic plants, as well as the richness of exotic and native vascular species, were examined as a function of distance from anthropogenic forest boundaries and recreational trails. Plants were sampled in 2 m x 10 m and 10 m x 10 m plots distributed among 11 urban forest remnants. Randomization tests were used to quantify the distance of edge influence from both forest boundaries and trails, and to determine if there was an interaction between them. Results The cover and richness of exotic plants and richness of native species decreased with increasing distance from forest boundaries and trails. Edge influences extended to distances of ca. 50 and 3 m for forest boundaries and trails, respectively, and were stronger for measures of understorey than of overstorey vegetation. Vegetation was simultaneously influenced by both edge types such that exotic cover and richness were higher when in close proximity to two edges than when subject to either edge alone (i.e. a positive interaction). Conclusions It is important to consider the influence of edges in the design and management of forest remnants to improve the ability to conserve native biodiversity within cities. Results from this study may be used to guide the design of such systems, particularly by suggesting appropriately sized patches and trail densities.

AB  - Cities are new and expanding ecosystems that harbor a variety of habitats with different degrees of permeability to the local fauna. However, the assessment of urban landscape permeability usually considers biotic and abiotic conditions, with sociopolitical dimensions (e.g., zoning regulations) - also important in shaping urban biodiversity - being underrepresented in the formulation of resistance surfaces. Our main goal was to compare urban landscape permeability for birds between two scenarios: one that considers only species' responses to land cover for the formulation of resistance surfaces (LandC), and another that incorporates how birds would respond to different levels of occupation (i.e., amount of permeable area and maximum building height per individual lot) given the urban zoning regulations defined by the city's master plan (LandC + UrbZ). We used the software LSCorridors to simulate Multiple Least Cost Corridors (MLCC) for five forest bird species. We hypothesized that incorporating master plan regulations would better describe the variation on landscape resistance through the urban landscape. The simulations resulted in different MLCC among species and between scenarios, highlighted by differences in landscape permeability. As expected, simulations for scenario LandC resulted in more options for straighter paths than simulations for scenario LandC + UrbZ. Our results demonstrate the potential influences of sociopolitical aspects on landscape permeability modelling. Within cities, species movements are influenced not only by behavioral and environmental characteristics, but also by the urban landscape that was shaped by planning and management decisions throughout a city's history. Therefore, we emphasize that sociopolitical dimensions must be considered when assessing urban landscape permeability.

AB  - Strategic approaches to biodiversity conservation increasingly emphasise the restoration of ecological connectivity at landscape scales. However, understanding where these connecting elements should be placed in the landscape is critical if they are to provide both value for money and for biodiversity. For such planning to be effective, it is necessary to have information of the distributions of multiple taxa, however, this is of poor quality for many taxa. We show that sparse, non-systematically collected biological records can be modelled using readily available environmental variables to meaningfully predict potential biodiversity richness, including rare and threatened species, across a landscape. Using a large database of ad-hoc biological records (50 501 records of 502 species) we modelled the richness of wetland biodiversity across the Fens, a formerly extensive wetland, now agricultural landscape in eastern England. We used these models to predict those parts of the agricultural ditch network of greatest potential conservation value and compared this to current strategic network planning. Odonata distribution differed to that of other groups, indicating that single taxon groups may not be effective proxies for other priority biodiversity. Our results challenged previous assumptions that river channels should comprise the main connecting elements in the Fens region. Rather, areas of high ditch density close to a main river are likely to be of greater value and should be targeted for enhancement. This approach can be adopted elsewhere in order to improve the evidence-base for strategic networks plans, increasing their value for money. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mutualistic interactions are currently mapped by bipartite networks with particular architecture and properties. The mycorrhizae connect the trees and permit them to share resources, therefore relaxing the competition. Ectomycorrhizal macrofungi associated with woody species (Quercus robur, Q. cerris, Q. petraea, Tilia tomentosa, Carpinus betulus, Corylus avellana, and Q. pubescens) growing in a temperate, broadleaved mixed forest, from a hilly area near the city of Cluj-Napoca, central Romania were included in a bipartite mutualistic network. Community structure was investigated using several network metrics, modularity and nestedness algorithms in conjunction with C-score index cluster analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (the Kulczynski similarity was index used as most appropriate metric selected by minimal stress criterion). The results indicate that the network presents high asymmetry (hosts are outnumbered by mycobionts at a great extent), high connectance, low modularity, and high nestedness, competition playing a secondary role in community assemblage (non significant difference between simulated and observed C-score). The nestedness pattern is non-random and is comparable to previously published results for other similar interactions containing plants. In the proposed network, woody species function exclusively as generalists. Modularity analysis is a finer tool were identifying species roles than centrality measures, however, the two types of algorithms permit the separation of species according to their roles as for example connectors (generalist species) and ultraperipheral species (specialists). Supergeneralist woody species function as hubs for the diverse ectomycorrhizal community while supergeneralist ectomycorrhizal fungi glue the hubs into a coherent aggregate.

AB  - Phylogenetic diversity (PD) describes the total amount of phylogenetic distance among species in a community. Although there has been substantial research on the factors that determine community PD, exploration of the consequences of PD for ecosystem functioning is just beginning. We argue that PD may be useful in predicting ecosystem functions in a range of communities, from single-trophic to complex networks. Many traits show a phylogenetic signal, suggesting that PD can estimate the functional trait space of a community, and thus ecosystem functioning. Phylogeny also determines interactions among species, and so could help predict how extinctions cascade through ecological networks and thus impact ecosystem functions. Although the initial evidence available suggests patterns consistent with these predictions, we caution that the utility of PD depends critically on the strength of phylogenetic signals to both traits and interactions. We advocate for a synthetic approach that incorporates a deeper understanding of how traits and interactions are shaped by evolution, and outline key areas for future research. If these complexities can be incorporated into future studies, relationships between PD and ecosystem function bear promise in conceptually unifying evolutionary biology with ecosystem ecology.

AB  - Often used as a mitigation tool to landscape fragmentation, urban riparian corridors also suffered from the effects of the urban expansion. This study explored the relationships between plant riparian communities and two major environmental variables (land cover, soil characteristics) and analyzed the floristic change along an urbanization gradient. Fifteen sites were surveyed on both riverbanks of two riparian corridors characterized by contrasting water regimes in Strasbourg, North Eastern France. Data of spontaneous species abundance was collected from 180 quadrats using (i) all plant species, (ii) herbaceous stratum and (iii) ligneous stratum (bush and tree). The diversity and compositional patterns of riparian plant species were analyzed within each corridor according to three levels of urbanization (urban, suburban, peri-urban). Relationships between riparian communities, land cover and soil chemical properties (pH, nitrogen and carbon content, moisture) were established by between-class co-inertia analyses. Land cover emerged as the main factor explaining changes in riparian communities along the rural-urban gradient while soil chemical properties discriminate water stress and fluvial dynamics of the two corridors. Similar compositional patterns were found within the most urbanized sites with the establishment of ubiquitous species. The herbaceous stratum is best linked to the level of urbanization, whereas the tree stratum is primarily correlated with corridor attributes (hydrological regime, soil properties). Although riparian species and communities are mainly determined by land cover, urban riparian corridors maintain native biodiversity up to the urban center.

AB  - Green roofs, especially productive ones (e.g. of edible biomass), are urban ecosystems developed in response to the scarcity of arable areas in urban environments. Their installation is also perceived as a possible way to preserve biodiversity in cities. However, the effectiveness of green roofs in supporting biodiversity, especially soil biodiversity, has rarely been studied. In order to orient the ecological engineering of green roofs, it is crucial to understand the resulting biodiversity patterns. We hypothesised that a functional trait-based approach could be used to investigate different ways of colonisation. We investigated collembolan communities in both extensive and productive green roofs. Surprisingly, no difference was observed in either taxonomic or functional structures of collembolan diversity between extensive and productive green roofs. Conversely, according to the functional composition, two ways of colonisation are suggested: a passive wind dispersal - the "flying" collembolans - and a settlement through compost inputs. We conclude that stakeholders should take into account the spatial connections of green roofs with other green spaces in order to support soil biodiversity. Further studies are needed to more accurately elucidate the importance of green roof types for collembolan communities and associated ecological networks.

AB  - Measuring landscape connectivity in ways that reflect an animal's propensity or reluctance to move across a given landscape is key for planning effective conservation strategies. Resistance distance, based on circuit theory, is one such measure relevant for modeling how broad-scale animal movements over long time periods may lead to gene flow across the landscape. Despite the success of circuit theory in landscape genetic studies, its applicability to model finer-scale processes such as the movement patterns of individual animals within their breeding grounds (e.g., while prospecting for territories) has yet to be tested. Here, we applied both circuit models and least-cost models to understand the relationship between landscape connectivity and return time of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) that had been translocated at least 20 km from their home territory near Qu,bec City, Canada. Using an iterative optimization process, we derived resistance values for three cover types (forest, edge, and open) that resulted in resistance distance values that best explained Ovenbird return times. We also identified the cover-type resistance values that yielded length of least-cost path estimates that best explained return times of the translocated birds. The circuit theory and least-cost path methods were equally supported by the data despite being based on different sets of resistance values. The optimal resistance values for calculating resistance distance indicated that for Ovenbirds, traversing a given distance of edge habitat presented a substantially greater resistance than that of open areas. On the other hand, optimized resistances of edge and open were very similar for calculating length of least-cost path. The circuit theory approach suggested that for an Ovenbird moving through fragmented habitat, the number of forest-open transitions (i.e., edge-crossings) that an individual must make is critical to understanding return times after translocation. The least-cost path approach, on the other hand, suggested that the birds strongly avoid all open areas, regardless of size. Circuit theory offers an important new approach for understanding landscapes from the perspective of individuals moving within their breeding range, at finer spatial scales and shorter time scales than have been previously considered.

AB  - To ensure viable species populations in fragmented landscapes, individuals must be able to move between suitable habitat patches. Despite the increased interest in biodiversity assessment in urban environments, the ecological relevance of habitat connectivity in highly fragmented landscapes remains largely unknown. The first step to understanding the role of habitat connectivity in urban ecology is the challenging task of assessing connectivity in the complex patchwork of contrasting habitats that is found in cities.
   We developed a data-based framework, minimizing the use of subjective assumptions, to assess habitat connectivity that consists of the following sequential steps: (1) identification of habitat preference based on empirical habitat-use data; (2) derivation of habitat resistance surfaces evaluating various transformation functions; (3) modeling of different connectivity maps with electrical circuit theory (Circuitscape), a method considering all possible pathways across the landscape simultaneously; and (4) identification of the best connectivity map with information-theoretic model selection. We applied this analytical framework to assess habitat connectivity for the European hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus, a model species for ground-dwelling animals, in the city of Zurich, Switzerland, using GPS track points from 40 individuals.
   The best model revealed spatially explicit connectivity "pinch points," as well as multiple habitat connections. Cross-validation indicated the general validity of the selected connectivity model. The results show that both habitat connectivity and habitat quality affect the movement of urban hedgehogs (relative importance of the two variables was 19.2% and 80.8%, respectively), and are thus both relevant for predicting urban animal movements.
   Our study demonstrates that even in the complex habitat patchwork of cities, habitat connectivity plays a major role for ground-dwelling animal moverrient. Data-based habitat connectivity maps can thus serve as an important tool for city planners to identify habitat corridors and plan appropriate management and conservation measures for urban animals. The analytical framework we describe to model such connectivity maps is generally applicable to different types of habitat-use data and can be adapted to the movement scale of the focal species. It also allows evaluation of the impact of future landscape changes or management scenarios on habitat connectivity in urban landscapes.

AB  - The structure of the real ecological networks is determined by multiple factors including neutral processes, the relative abundances of species, and the phylogenetic relationships of the interacting species. Previous efforts directed to analyze the relative contribution of these factors to network structure have not been able to fully incorporate the phylogenetic relationships between the interacting species. This limitation stems from the difficulty of predicting interaction probabilities based on the independent phylogenies of interacting species (e. g. plants and animals). This is not the case for plant facilitation networks, where nurse and facilitated species evolve in a common phylogeny (e. g. spermatophyte phylogeny). Facilitation networks are characterized by both high nestedness and interactions tending to occur between distantly related nurse and facilitated species. We evaluate the relative contribution of phylogeny and species abundance to explain both the frequency of observed interactions as well as the network structure in a real plant facilitation network at Tehuacan Valley (central Mexico). Our results show that the combined effects of phylogeny and species abundance were, by far, the best predictors of both the frequency of the interactions observed in this community and the parameters (nestedness and connectance) defining the network structure. This finding indicates that species interact proportionally to both their phylogenetic distances and abundances simultaneously. In short, the phylogenetic history of species, acting together with other ecological factors, has a pervasive influence in the structure of ecological networks.

AB  - Urban parks can provide a resource for maintaining and increasing bird biodiversity. However, little research has been conducted to show the differences in bird community diversity between parks adjacent to mountains and rivers in the city center of highly urbanized areas. This study analysed whether the bird composition and species diversity differed between parks adjacent to Baiyun Mountain (hillside parks) and Pearl River (riverside parks) in Guangzhou, South China. From January 2018 to December 2020, 137927 birds representing 206 species were recorded. The results indicated that the number of species and individuals of birds were higher in hillside parks than in riverside parks in each season. The number of species and individuals was also higher in hillside parks than in riverside parks in different functional groups according to bird food type, residential type, and ecological type. The number of species shared by the two types of parks was 120. The unique birds' species number in hillside and riverside parks were 67 and 19, respectively. Bird diversity in terms of richness and Shannon index was higher significantly in hillside parks than in riverside parks in summer. Principal component analysis of environmental traits of 18 parks showed that plant traits in parks have relatively high and positive contribution. Correlation analysis indicated that bird diversity was positively affected by water area, the highest altitude, habitats diversity and tree evenness in park, while negatively regulated by building coverage around each park. The top 20 most abundant bird species accounted for 87.5% of the total birds in the study period. Nycticorax nycticorax, Urocissa erythroryncha and Podiceps ruficollis were observed more frequently in hillside parks, while Pycnonotus aurigaster, Passer montanus, Acridotheres cristatellus were observed more frequently in riverside parks. Principal coordinates analysis also indicated that bird communities significantly differed between hillside parks and riverside parks. In conclusion, our findings highlight the importance of conserving mountains and rivers as buffer zones for serious anthropogenic disturbance in the city center. We propose that the conservation of hillside parks is a priority strategy for enhancing urban birds biodiversity.

AB  - The Cape Dwarf Chameleon, Bradypodion pumilum, is threatened by extensive habitat loss and transformation in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. As a result, the species exists as a collection of populations inhabiting an increasingly fragmented landscape within a critically endangered ecosystem. In this study we monitored microsatellite genetic variation in one of these populations of B. pumilum across a three-year period. From the results of a temporary site-vacancy of adult chameleons during the study, we anticipated a significant shift in microsatellite allele frequencies. Using data from eight highly polymorphic loci we detected differences in the allelic composition of chameleons inhabiting the study site between pre- and post-site-vacancy periods (AMOVA R-ST = 0.017; P = 0.019). Results suggest that recolonisation by immigrant chameleons, from an adjacent vegetation fragment connected to the study site by corridors, caused the recorded shifts in allelic frequencies. Pairwise tests of year by year comparisons revealed significant shifts in allelic frequencies between years one and two and between one and three, but not between years two and three. Our findings highlight the susceptibility of small vertebrates to stochastic changes in the allelic composition of populations in a fragmented landscape, and can be useful for the development of biodiversity management in an increasingly fragmented habitat mosaic.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities such as eutrophication and fishing have prominent effects on freshwater ecosystems. However, the ways in which ecosystem function and biodiversity respond to multiple drivers from eutrophication and top-down predation remains inconclusive. We studied zooplankton communities in 102 subtropical shallow lakes in the eastern plain of China and further examined the joint effects of nutrient enrichment and predation on biodiversity and ecological networks. We found that alpha diversity was negatively influenced by nutrient conditions (such as total phosphorus and total nitrogen [TN]), whereas beta diversity (beta-diversity) was positively related to nutrients and was also structured by omnivorous fish showing a unimodal pattern. Furthermore, the network skewness of zooplankton increased with nutrient enrichment, especially TN, and was negatively related to omnivorous fish. This skewness is more sensitive than beta-diversity, whereas negative skew is primarily caused by omnivorous fish. Our results demonstrated that top-down effects were dominant for zooplankton communities and resulted in structural adjustment of zooplankton communities, mainly with an increase in fish predation. A negative skewed network indicates the presence of more generalist species and stronger connections among the zooplankton assemblages, as well as decreased beta-diversity.

AB  - Urban parks are isolated fragmentary areas within the urban environment, providing both recreational spaces for its citizens and habitat for birds. This study focuses on analyzing factors, which affect the richness of breeding bird communities in 26 urban parks within Beijing city. A bird census and a survey of biological factors were carried out from April to November, 2012. Simultaneously, non-biological factors were examined. A path analysis based on a structural equation model was carried out to explore biological and non-biological environmental variables affecting bird communities breeding in wooded habitats. In total, 38 species of wild breeding birds were observed in the 26 parks. Based on the results, we conclude that the size of green space in parks is the most significant variable affecting bird occurrence. Green spaces surrounding a park are positive and significant factors for breeding bird communities. Wild grasses/herbs are also crucial because they maintain a high level of insects. Omnivorous bird species and birds nesting in trees did benefit by an increasing area covered by coniferous trees, by increasing richness of grass/herb species and increasing richness of woody plant species. The richness of insect communities (phytophagous and pollinating insects) has a significant effect on the richness of breeding bird communities. This study confirmed the importance of connectivity that the parks are connected to surrounding green spaces, thus forming an integrated green system avoids impervious surfaces. Proper management of coniferous woody plants, promoting wild grasses/herbs, reducing the area of planted monocultures and minimizing the use of pesticides in urban vegetation management will contribute effectively to improve the quality of breeding bird habitats in urban parks.

AB  - Context Connectivity is fundamental to understanding how landscape form influences ecological function. However, uncertainties persist due to the difficulty and expense of gathering empirical data to drive or to validate connectivity models, especially in urban areas, where relationships are multifaceted and the habitat matrix cannot be considered to be binary.
   Objectives This research used circuit theory to model urban bird flows (i.e. 'current'), and compared results to observed abundance. The aims were to explore the ability of this approach to predict wildlife flows and to test relationships between modelled connectivity and variation in abundance.
   Methods Circuitscape was used to model functional connectivity in Bedford, Luton/Dunstable, and Milton Keynes, UK, for great tits (Parus major) and blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), drawing parameters from published studies of woodland bird flows in urban environments. Model performance was then tested against observed abundance data.
   Results Modelled current showed a weak yet positive agreement with combined abundance for P. major and C. caeruleus. Weaker correlations were found for other woodland species, suggesting the approach may be expandable if re-parameterised.
   Conclusions Trees provide suitable habitat for urban woodland bird species, but their location in large, contiguous patches and corridors along barriers also facilitates connectivity networks throughout the urban matrix. Urban connectivity studies are well-served by the advantages of circuit theory approaches, and benefit from the empirical study of wildlife flows in these landscapes to parameterise this type of modelling more explicitly. Such results can prove informative and beneficial in designing urban green space and new developments.

AB  - Green roofs (GRs) are a sustainable alternative to conventional roofs that provide multiple ecosystem services. Integrating GRs into urban areas is highly relevant considering the rapidly increasing built-up in cities. Therefore, this paper systematically and comprehensively reviews the recent literature from 2011 to 2019 on GRs to identify the challenges and perspectives related to the urban integration of GRs. The review suggests that the effectiveness of GRs in delivering ecosystem services is largely dependent on context-specific parameters such as weather conditions and existing construction or design-related parameters. Integrating GRs into urban areas can be challenging given the diversity of actors, functions, and conditions characterizing these areas. Although significant research has already been conducted on GRs, research covering more geographical locations and contexts is needed. The review points out the need to include future urbanization scenarios, such as tall buildings while analyzing the impact of GRs on ecological networks. Additionally, the review emphasizes the inclusion of urban morphological parameters alongside an analysis of the impact of GRs on microclimate regulation and air quality. In terms of social acceptance, this review points out the need to consider the temporal cycles of vegetation for noting users' perspectives. Additionally, further research is required on the social impact of GRs, considering their influence on property prices. Lastly, the review stresses the need for more city-scale studies on the impact of GRs on ecosystem services.

AB  - Urbanisation is a growing global phenomenon having multiple ecological consequences. However, the effects of urbanisation on biodiversity remain ambiguous, and some evidence exists that cities provide valuable secondary habitats for many species, possibly mitigating regional biodiversity loss. Therefore, the value of urban sites for biodiversity depends on local habitat conditions and the configuration of the surrounding landscape. We aimed to disentangle the effects of local habitatparameters (management, plant diversity) and urban matrix variables (urbanisation, isolation) on carabid beetle and spider diversity and traits in informal urban green spaces in Berlin, Germany. Habitat management and isolation were the most important influences on carabid beetle and spider species and trait compositions. Spider communities of irregular managed sites contained 2.5 times more species of conservation concern than extensive (regular) managed sites. Moreover, irregular managed sites contained larger species (both for carabid beetles and spiders) and affected the hunting mode of spiders. Isolated sites tended to have lower spider species richness and number of spider species of conservation concern. Moreover, isolated sites were characterised by small, mobile and herbivorous carabid beetles. In contrast, urbanisation and local plant diversity had no effect on carabid beetles and spiders. We conclude that urban grasslands within residential areas - even if not targeted for conservation plans - can provide important habitats for conserving biodiversity, including species of conservation concern. Reducing the intensity of habitat management and increasing the connectivity of urban grassland sites can promote diverse arthropod communities and should therefore be considered in urban planning.

AB  - Aim: To develop a robust phylogeny for the iconic Australian water skinks (Eulamprus) and to explore the influence of landscape evolution of eastern Australia on phylogeographic patterns.
   Location: Eastern and south-eastern Australia.
   Methods: We used Sanger methods to sequence a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) locus for 386 individuals across the five Eulamprus species to elucidate phylogeographic structure. We also sequenced a second mtDNA locus and four nuclear DNA (nDNA) loci for a subset of individuals to help inform our sampling strategy for next-generation sequencing. Finally, we generated an anchored hybrid enrichment (AHE) approach to sequence 378 loci for 25 individuals representing the major lineages identified in our Sanger dataset. These data were used to resolve the phylogenetic relationships among the species using coalescent-based species tree inference in *BEAST and ASTRAL.
   Results: The relationships between Eulamprus species were resolved with a high level of confidence using our AHE dataset. In addition, our extensive mtDNA sampling revealed substantial phylogeographic structure in all species, with the exception of the geographically highly restricted E.leuraensis. Ratios of patristic distances (mtDNA/nDNA) indicate on average a 30-fold greater distance as estimated using the mtDNA locus ND4.
   Main conclusions: The major divergences between lineages strongly support previously identified biogeographic barriers in eastern Australia based on studies of other taxa. These breaks appear to correlate with regions where the Great Escarpment is absent or obscure, suggesting topographic lowlands and the accompanying dry woodlands are a major barrier to dispersal for water skinks. While some river corridors, such as the Hunter Valley, were likely historically dry enough to inhibit the movement of Eulamprus populations, our data indicate that others, such as the Murray and Darling Rivers, are able to facilitate extensive gene flow through the vast arid and semi-arid lowlands of New South Wales and South Australia. Comparing the patristic distances between the mitochondrial and AHE datasets highlights the continued value in analysing both types of data.

AB  - Invertebrates comprise the most diversified animal group on Earth. Due to their long evolutionary history and small size, invertebrates occupy a remarkable range of ecological niches, and play an important role as "ecosystem engineers" by structuring networks of mutualistic and antagonistic ecological interactions in almost all terrestrial ecosystems. Urban forests provide critical ecosystem services to humans, and, as in other systems, invertebrates are central to structuring and maintaining the functioning of urban forests. Identifying the role of invertebrates in urban forests can help elucidate their importance to practitioners and the public, not only to preserve biodiversity in urban environments, but also to make the public aware of their functional importance in maintaining healthy greenspaces. In this review, we examine the multiple functional roles that invertebrates play in urban forests that contribute to ecosystem service provisioning, including pollination, predation, herbivory, seed and microorganism dispersal and organic matter decomposition, but also those that lead to disservices, primarily from a public health perspective, e.g., transmission of invertebrate-borne diseases. We then identify a number of ecological filters that structure urban forest invertebrate communities, such as changes in habitat structure, increased landscape imperviousness, microclimatic changes and pollution. We also discuss the complexity of ways that forest invertebrates respond to urbanisation, including acclimation, local extinction and evolution. Finally, we present management recommendations to support and conserve viable and diverse urban forest invertebrate populations into the future.

AB  - Human disturbances contribute significantly to the decrease in the quantity and connectivity of the natural habitats. Taking Lincang City in Lancang River Valley as a case study, we focused on the forest fragmentation and habitat connectivity loss associated with its road network and expansion in the past 15 years. Our findings show that, from 1991 to 2006, its forest habitat (>25 ha) decreased to 18.3% of the total area due to fragmentation. Landscape fragmentation indices (NP, PLAND, and LPI) changed more than the landscape shapes and the aggregation indices (SHAPE, FRAC, and DIVISION). Habitat loss occurred more often in the lower elevations and in areas near the city and road network. Landscape connectivity loss was 91.3%, which showed a more significant decrease than did the landscape pattern changes. With sensitivity analysis of different animals' dispersal abilities and landscape resistance consideration, our study reveals that landscape connectivity could be more effective in showing the potential ecological effects caused by city and road network extension.

AB  - Body size is intrinsically linked to metabolic rate and life-history traits, and is a crucial determinant of food webs and community dynamics(1,2). The increased temperatures associated with the urban-heat-island effect result in increased metabolic costs and are expected to drive shifts to smaller body sizes'. Urban environments are, however, also characterized by substantial habitat fragmentation', which favours mobile species. Here, using a replicated, spatially nested sampling design across ten animal taxonomic groups, we show that urban communities generally consist of smaller species. In addition, although we show urban warming for three habitat types and associated reduced community-weighted mean body sizes for four taxa, three taxa display a shift to larger species along the urbanization gradients. Our results show that the general trend towards smaller-sized species is overruled by filtering for larger species when there is positive covariation between size and dispersal, a process that can mitigate the low connectivity of ecological resources in urban settings(5). We thus demonstrate that the urban-heat-island effect and urban habitat fragmentation are associated with contrasting community-level shifts in body size that critically depend on the association between body size and dispersal. Because body size determines the structure and dynamics of ecological networks(1), such shifts may affect urban ecosystem function.

AB  - Genetic connectivity lies at the heart of evolutionary theory, and landscape genetics has rapidly advanced to understand how gene flow can be impacted by the environment. Isolation by landscape resistance, often inferred through the use of circuit theory, is increasingly identified as being critical for predicting genetic connectivity across complex landscapes. Yet landscape impediments to migration can arise from fundamentally different processes, such as landscape gradients causing directional migration and mortality during migration, which can be challenging to address. Spatial absorbing Markov chains (SAMC) have been introduced to understand and predict these (and other) processes affecting connectivity in ecological settings, but the relationship of this framework to landscape genetics remains unclear. Here, we relate the SAMC to population genetics theory, provide simulations to interpret the extent to which the SAMC can predict genetic metrics and demonstrate how the SAMC can be applied to genomic data using an example with an endangered species, the Panama City crayfish Procambarus econfinae, where directional migration is hypothesized to occur. The use of the SAMC for landscape genetics can be justified based on similar grounds to using circuit theory, as we show how circuit theory is a special case of this framework. The SAMC can extend circuit-theoretic connectivity modelling by quantifying both directional resistance to migration and acknowledging the difference between migration mortality and resistance to migration. Our empirical example highlights that the SAMC better predicts population structure than circuit theory and least-cost analysis by acknowledging asymmetric environmental gradients (i.e. slope) and migration mortality in this species. These results provide a foundation for applying the SAMC to landscape genetics. This framework extends isolation-by-resistance modelling to account for some common processes that can impact gene flow, which can improve predicting genetic connectivity across complex landscapes.

AB  - Increased urbanisation is placing respite areas for wildlife under stress, with the impact of anthropogenic disturbances such as noise, artificial light and infrastructure compounding as urban areas expand and become more populated. One essential, and sometimes overlooked behavioural activity is where urban wildlife sleep or rest. This is especially important for urban predators that are wide-ranging and exhibit specific ecological requirements. The powerful owl (Ninox strenua) is one such species. To ensure the future survival of urban powerful owls it is critical that we understand where they choose to roost/sleep and why. To determine these roosting characteristics, we used roosting data collected from GPS tagged powerful owls across Melbourne, Australia and examined these data at different spatial scales to provide a holistic understanding of habitat selection. At the landscape scale, potentially suitable roosting habitat was restricted heavily by urban and agricultural land use. Population-wide, roosts were located within dense tree cover with some flexibility between individuals in distance to river systems and tolerance of road density. At the microhabitat-scale, individual owls displayed flexibility by roosting in a variety of indigenous, non-indigenous native and exotic tree species. These considerations will assist urban planners to conserve suitable roosting habitat, while restoration efforts should be prioritised on private land and along river systems where roosting habitat can be enhanced and expanded, increasing landscape connectivity for other wildlife.

AB  - In urban areas, the requirements of social, economic, and ecological sustainable development are usually intertwined with the problems of land-use intransigence, fragmentation, and deterioration of quality of natural systems. This study aims at the application of ecological principles to develop an integrated urban land-use planning for Panyu case that could optimize the urban ecosystem. Panyu is classified into four functional zones: (1) ecological protection areas, which are important to maintain regional ecological process; (2) restricted construction areas, which can be changed and adjusted over time without losing the conservation potential; (3) suitable construction areas, which are set aside for future development; and (4) built-up areas. Different land-use management measures with emphases either on ecological aims or on construction are proposed. Ecological patches are connected by corridors to form an ecological network, which is spatially flexible and has the potential to integrate development and conservation and make conservation of species diversity adaptive. The writers predict that ecosystem service will increase by 16.91% after the implementation of their plan. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000074. (C) 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - In this study, I examine the influence of urban canopy cover on gene flow between 15 white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) populations in New York City parklands. Parks in the urban core are often highly fragmented, leading to rapid genetic differentiation of relatively nonvagile species. However, a diverse array of green spaces may provide dispersal corridors through grey urban infrastructure. I identify urban landscape features that promote genetic connectivity in an urban environment and compare the success of two different landscape connectivity approaches at explaining gene flow. Gene flow was associated with effective distances between populations that were calculated based on per cent tree canopy cover using two different approaches: (i) isolation by effective distance (IED) that calculates the single best pathway to minimize passage through high-resistance (i.e. low canopy cover) areas, and (ii) isolation by resistance (IBR), an implementation of circuit theory that identifies all low-resistance paths through the landscape. IBR, but not IED, models were significantly associated with three measures of gene flow (Nm from FST, BayesAss+ and Migrate-n) after factoring out the influence of isolation by distance using partial Mantel tests. Predicted corridors for gene flow between city parks were largely narrow, linear parklands or vegetated spaces that are not managed for wildlife, such as cemeteries and roadway medians. These results have implications for understanding the impacts of urbanization trends on native wildlife, as well as for urban reforestation efforts that aim to improve urban ecosystem processes.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation in economic areas like ports has recently become more important in the European Union due to a stricter interpretation of nature protection laws. In this study we develop a planning and design strategy-the 'habitat backbone'aEuro"with which to support the long-term survival of pioneer species that occur in ports and have low dispersal abilities. For those species, long-term survival in port areas is uncertain because supply of their habitats (on vacant lots) is capricious and depends on land use dynamics. By gaining knowledge about spatial and temporal characteristics of these dynamics we were able to develop a solution to conserve such species. Our solution is based on the creation of permanent habitat-defined as a 'backbone'aEuro"on (semi-) public land with an overall carrying capacity sufficient to support persistent populations. This best ensures long-term survival, and the backbone may also act as refugium. Satellite populations that emerge on adjacent vacant lots will thereby add to the persistence of the overall metapopulation. Management of permanent habitat is focused on retaining early-successional stages of vegetation. Implementing this strategy in the case of the natterjack toad in the Port of Antwerp taught us that realization of a habitat backbone is possible only if landowners, local governments and environmental NGOs cooperate. In the case at hand, such cooperation resulted in a plan that should ensure a coherent and persistent habitat network in which a chorus of some 1,400 natterjack toads could be accommodated-more than the number of toads currently observed.

AB  - The increase in artificial light at night (ALAN) is a global concern, while the pattern of ALAN pollution inside urban areas has not yet been fully explored. To fill this gap, we developed a novel method to map fine-scale ALAN pollution patterns in urban bird habitats using high spatial resolution ALAN satellite data. First, an ALAN pollution map was derived from JL1-3B satellite images. Then, the core habitat nodes (CHNs) representing the main habitats for urban birds to inhabit were identified from the land cover map, which was produced using Gaofen2 (GF2) data, and the high probability corridors (HPCs), indicating high connectivity paths, were derived from Circuitscape software. Finally, the ALAN patterns in the CHNs and HPCs were analysed, and the mismatch index was proposed to evaluate the trade-off between human activity ALAN demands and ALAN supply for the protection of urban birds. The results demonstrated that 115 woodland patches covering 4149.0 ha were selected as CHNs, and most of the CHNs were large urban parks or scenic spots located in the urban fringe. The 2923 modelled HPCs occupying 1179.2 ha were small remaining vegetation patches and vegetated corridors along the major transport arteries. The differences in the ALAN pollution patterns between CHNs and HPCs were mainly determined by the characteristics of the green space patches and the light source types. The polluted regions in the CHNs were clustered in a few regions that suffered from concentrated and intensive ALAN, while most of the CHNs remained unaffected. In contrast, the 727 HPCs were mainly polluted by street lighting was scattered and widely distributed, resulting a more varying influence to birds than that in the CHNs. Relating patterns of the ALAN to bird habitats and connectivity provides meaningful information for comprehensive planning to alleviate the disruptive effects of ALAN pollution.

AB  - Purpose - Urbanization is characterized mainly by changes in land use and conversion of natural areas into built environments, as well as by a series of impacts, such as loss of biodiversity, which interfere with the proper functioning of ecological networks.
   Design/methodology/approach - Thus, the authors apply a bibliometric analysis using the term "Urban Trees" in the "Web of Science" database, between 2009 and 2019, as a keyword to include all urban green structures and identify the main aspects of urban ecological relationships. They found 8,367 published articles.
   Findings - This review identified the main countries and research institutions that operate in urban afforestation. In general, developing countries seek to understand the environmental benefits that urban afforestation can provide, demonstrating the importance of maintaining existing green areas in urban centers to promote the balance of the ecosystem. It depends directly on the flow of ecosystem services provided by green infrastructures in the city, contributing significantly to carbon sequestration, retention of particulate matter, mitigation of heat islands and reduction of surface runoff, directly favoring the health and well-being of the population. The authors conclude that the actions currently implemented in urban afforestation, especially to increase the richness and abundance of species, will be decisive for the future of urban centers and the construction of more sustainable and egalitarian cities.
   Originality/value - This work sought to develop a bibliographic research based on information obtained by bibliometric analysis that has the ability to identify trends and volumes of scientific production in a given area of knowledge.

AB  - Correlative ecological niche models (ENMs) estimate species niches using occurrence records and environmental data. These tools are valuable to the field of biogeography, where they are commonly used to infer potential connectivity among populations. However, a recent study showed that when locally relevant environmental data are not available, records from patches of suitable habitat protruding into otherwise unsuitable regions (e.g., gallery forests within dry areas) can lead to overestimations of species niches and their potential distributions. Here, we test whether this issue obfuscates detection of an obvious environmental barrier existing in northern Venezuela - that of the hot and xeric lowlands separating the Peninsula de Paraguana from mainland South America. These conditions most likely promote isolation between mainland and peninsular populations of three rodent lineages occurring in mesic habitat in this region. For each lineage, we calibrated optimally parameterized ENMs using mainland records only, and leveraged existing habitat descriptions to assess whether those assigned low suitability values corresponded to instances where the species was collected within locally mesic conditions amidst otherwise hot dry areas. When this was the case, we built an additional model excluding these records. We projected both models onto the peninsula and assessed whether they differed in their ability to detect the environmental barrier. For the two lineages in which we detected such problematic records, only the models built excluding them detected the barrier, while providing additional insights regarding peninsular populations. Overall, the study reveals how a simple procedure like the one applied here can deal with records problematic for ENMs, leading to better predictions regarding the potential effects of the environment on lineage divergence.

AB  - Quantitative securing of green space in already developed cities has many practical limitations due to socio-economic limitations. Currently, South Korea is planning a green network to secure and inject effective green space, but it is difficult to reflect it in the actual space plan due to the abstract plan. This study utilizes circuit theory and least-cost path methods for presenting a green network that is objectified and applicable to spatial planning. First, an analysis of the Least-cost Path revealed 69 least-cost paths between 43 core green areas of the study site. Most least-cost paths have been identified as passing through small green areas and streams in the city. Using the circuit theory, it was also possible to distinguish areas other than least-cost paths from areas with high potential for development, areas where target species are concentrated within corridors. In particular, areas with relatively high green network improvement effects were derived within and around corridors. This study is most significant in establishing and evaluating existing urban green networks, overcoming the limitations discussed at the linear level and expanding to the area level. To increase the utilization of this study in the future, field surveys and monitoring studies on target species need to be supplemented.

AB  - Negative effects of urban sprawl on biodiversity are widely recognised, but information on how to counteract such effects are still scarce, especially for urban ecosystems in mountain regions.
   We evaluated the effect of land-use and topography on the occurrence of eight passerine species in five urbanized study areas in the Italian Alps, which have undergone recent urban sprawl. Our aim was to identify the best planning and management practices to favour these indicator species in mountain periurban areas.
   We surveyed the species' presence/absence at 142 point counts during the 2013 breeding season and evaluated the effects of environmental variables on occurrence using binomial multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). Species occurrence was mostly affected by meadows (positively) and woodland (negative effect, except in contexts with high meadow cover or high habitat diversity).
   In Alpine valleys affected by recent sprawl, the conservation or restoration of grassland patches and the maintenance of heterogeneous landscapes can contribute to the conservation of some species of conservation concern found in suburban habitats. Afforestation, a common mitigation practice in and around urban centres, could be counter-indicated when urbanization occurs at the expense of open and semi-open habitats.

AB  - The scarcity of green areas in urban landscapes hinders connectivity among sites reducing the flux of organisms and seed dispersal. Ramphastos toco is an effective plant disperser in tropical landscapes, playing an important role in conserving plant connectivity. In this study we combined two methods of landscape connectivity analysis, in a way not yet explored, to assess the potential contribution of Ramphastos toco to enhancing connectivity among urban vegetation patches. We used spatial modeling techniques to evaluate least cost routes, or those that facilitate bird movement through green urban areas, in Belo Horizonte, a city in Southeast Brazil. We also assessed the relative importance of forest patches for conserving both bird and seed dispersal fluxes using the integral index of connectivity. The resulting least cost route of greater accessibility for the species included in its course an important forest patch under environmental licensing for the construction of a residential condominium. The number of green urban areas covered by forest, of highest habitat quality for the species, summed to 155 patches. Of this total only 5.2% were relevant for regional connectivity, while the four most important patches are targeted by the city's expansion plans. Ramphastos toco is an effective connector for tropical green urban areas given its adaptability, wide range of movement and seed dispersal effectiveness. We emphasize the need for incorporating ecological knowledge and the prioritization of green areas into city planning, since current expansion projects jeopardize forest patches that are crucial to the functional connectivity of the urban landscape.

AB  - Planning for safe passage of wildlife involves understanding the complexities of natural and human landscapes and incorporating connectivity assessments in local and regional planning. The present study describes a novel landscape analysis approach that was used in the context of municipal open space planning and regional land use and transportation planning. The project approach focused on two principles: (1) wildlife movement is not limited to formally managed reserves and corridors, but occurs across a gradient of land uses in the human landscape, and (2) that local and regional planners should be included in the process of identifying habitat connectivity needs and in turn incorporate connectivity in their own planning processes. In the first case, a species-specific combination of landscape disturbance and least-cost modeling was based on the concept that wildlife originate their movement from anywhere within suitable habitat and move in a least-costly direction. This results in a "least cost surface" of possible wildlife movement based on habitat preference and barriers to safe passage. In the second case, planners at two geographic scales - municipal and regional - were informed of landscape connectivity principles and their needs incorporated into the assessment itself. The least cost surface approach allows for the integration of modeled connectivity and disturbance with site-specific municipal planning activities. However, the potential for this type of local planning to be folded into local decision-making processes can be dependent on the interests of individual planners rather than being systematic in nature.

AB  - Life history adaptations and spatial configuration of metapopulation networks allow certain species to persist in extreme fluctuating environments, yet long-term stability within these systems relies on the maintenance of linkage habitat. Degradation of such linkages in urban riverscapes can disrupt this dynamic in aquatic species, leading to increased extinction debt in local populations experiencing environment-related demographic flux. We used microsatellites and mtDNA to examine the effects of collapsed network structure in the endemic Santa Ana sucker Catostomus santaanae of southern California, a threatened species affected by natural flood-drought cycles, "boom-and-bust" demography, hybridization and presumed artificial transplantation. Our results show a predominance of drift-mediated processes in shaping population structure and that reverse mechanisms for counterbalancing the genetic effects of these phenomena have dissipated with the collapse of dendritic connectivity. We use approximate Bayesian models to support two cases of artificial transplantation and provide evidence that one of the invaded systems better represents the historic processes that maintained genetic variation within watersheds than any remaining drainages where C.santaanae is considered native. We further show that a stable dry gap in the northern range is preventing genetic dilution of pure C.santaanae persisting upstream of a hybrid assemblage involving a non-native sucker and that local accumulation of genetic variation in the same drainage is influenced by position within the network. This work has important implications for declining species that have historically relied on dendritic metapopulation networks to maintain source-sink dynamics in phasic environments, but no longer possess this capacity in urban-converted landscapes.

AB  - The relationship between diversity and resilience is relatively well-established for ecological systems, but remains much less explored for socio-economic systems. Institutional diversity can have particular relevance for protected areas, whose managerial responses to environmental change depend on their legal basis, ability to make and enforce rules and socio-political acceptance and endorsement. Protected area expansion strategies are increasingly turning to private land conservation to increase the configuration and connectivity of national protected area networks. Yet, we know little about the relative role of privately owned protected areas in protecting threatened and poorly protected (under-represented) habitats, and in the overall connectivity of the national protected area network. We present an empirical assessment of protected area tenure diversity across South Africa. Privately owned protected areas comprise 25.58% (2,878,422.26 ha) of the area of the total protected area estate. Private nature reserves emerged as the dominant protected area type in under-represented and threatened habitats, protecting, on average, 32%, 38% and 41%, respectively, of poorly protected, threatened and endangered vegetation classes. Private nature reserves had the largest overall effect, compared to other protected area types, on connectivity within the national network. A spatially randomized comparison showed that privately owned protected areas are overdispersed and more strategically positioned to connect other types of protected areas than would be expected by chance from their extent and abundance. Our results suggest that privately owned protected areas enhance the resilience of the national protected area network, making it more extensive and better-connected, with greater levels of habitat redundancy. More generally, our analysis highlights the potentially valuable role of institutional diversity in building resilient habitat networks for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Circulation network design, widely mentioned as road network design, is one of the main topics in urban planning, urban transportation planning, traffic engineering and urban design. In the literature on road network design, problems and principles are examined through quantitative and qualitative researches (Magnanti and Wong, 1984; Hillier, 1987; Ran and Boyce, 1996; Hillier, 1999; Southworth and Ben-Joseph, 2003; Drezner and Wesolowsky, 2003, Marshall, 2005). The former one implies analysis and simulation of demographic and economic variables in order to apply appropriate circulation schemes, while the latter one deals with various factors of design and aims to create urban spaces regarding 'space quality'. This paper examines the role of urban patterns in the formation of road networks; thereby depicting relative performance and handicaps of road networks under stated travel distribution among specified units.
   Road network design requires knowledge of circulation concepts and methodology of assessment. This study provides a topological analysis method and assessment criteria in order to understand performances of various types of road networks. In order to constitute road networks, circulation systems are adapted on three basic types of urban pattern: the grid, the hexagon and the radio-centric. Finally, two certain travel demand matrices are assigned to the specified road networks in order to assess relative advantages of various patterns and circulation networks. At the first stage, travel distribution among units (zones) is assumed to be uniform while second stage is performed with a matrix representing a centre-oriented travel distribution pattern. Here, circulation systems connote to the conceptual representation of movement of vehicles on specific routes, while circulation network (road network) is the concrete form of any specificied circulation system.
   There are numerous studies on advanced traffic management systems, which mainly focus on the issue of uninterrupted traffic flow (Ran and Boyce, 1996; Levinson, 2003). In the last decade, intelligent transportation systems and traveler route guidance stystems are extensively adapted to urban transportation systems. On the other hand, there are limited studies measuring the the performances of such systems, which are highly dependent to the characteristics of road network (Emmerink et al., 2003; Levinson, 2003). Marshall (2005) argues that street pattern is significantly influenced by the "geometry of movement" and "the topology of route connectivity". Geometry of movement is the representation of individuals' travel patterns while connectivity refers to the structural (topological) characteristics of road network; such as hierarchy and composition of links (road sections) and nodes (junctions).
   This study deals with the role of urban patterns on the formation of road networks and relative performances of circulation systems. Conceptual forms of circulation systems, described by Wright et al.(1989) are adapted to basic types of urban patterns (the grid, the hexagonal and the radiocentric) in order to obtain road networks. Those networks are compared in terms of network efficiency, measured by average travel distance, traffic volume/capacity ratio, standard deviation among travel volumes, and average travel time. Proposed measures are applied to 33 test networks, which are derived from three base patterns: the grid, the hexagon, and the radio-centric. Traffic assignment procedure is carried out in order to observe performances of road networks.
   Results showed that when uniform travel distribution is considered, connected networks, such as convex polygons and concentric corridors, perform better than less connected circulation networks. Those networks perform with uniform volume capacity ratios; therefore, hierarchial capacity design is not necessary for such systems. Convex systems have high efficiency when adapted to grid patterns rather than hexagonal and radio-centric. Average traffic volumes and standard deviation on convex networks are much less than semi-connected or tree networks. Hence, connected road networks perform with less average travel distance and average travel time. Results showed that grid patterns are more advantageous when convex circulation systems are adapted, while hexagonal patterns perform better when tree or star shaped systems are adapted.
   Compared to two-way systems, one-way circulation systems prove to be inefficient in terms of travel distance and time, however, conflicts at intersections are much less. When centre-oriented trips are assigned to road networks, star-shaped and tree-shaped networks perform better, however, total travel time and total travel distance is more than others. Those networks perform with moderate volume capacity ratios.

AB  - A functional ecological understanding of urban wild bee communities is of growing importance especially in regard to biodiversity conservation, ecosystem service maintenance and effective conservation programmes. In this paper, we review and summarize the published literature aiming to inform future research investigations in the growing field of wild bee functional ecology. Specifically, we: (1) review which functional trait-based analyses have been carried out on wild bees in cities thus far; (2) summarize which wild bee species traits have been considered; (3) evaluate any consistent wild bee trait-environment relationships (i.e. urbanization) across studies; and (4) synthesize findings and limitations to inform future research recommendations. We reviewed 48 studies based on a systematic Web of Knowledge search. We found consistent trait characteristics for 'nesting type', 'diet', 'body size', 'sociality' and 'phenology' across studies. More than one third of the studies were descriptive and the majority of studies were located in urban gardens in temperate Europe and North America, calling for more research from underrepresented geographic regions and from the entire spectrum of urban habitat types. Of these studies, only five analyzed functional diversity indices and three studies applied statistics to relate urban wild bee traits to urbanization factors. Future studies should consider trait-based statistics, and could incorporate functional trait-based ecological networks to examine network shifts across urbanization gradients. Our review suggests that we lack generalizable information about wild bee trait and urbanization relationships yet, making conservation recommendations challenging. Therefore, we propose more research that considers methodological recommendations to develop a comparable and comprehensive understanding of how urbanization affects the functional ecology of urban wild bees to link with specific urban conservation measures.

AB  - Determining ecological corridors is crucial for widely applicable to gain more in-depth information on conservation efforts in fragmented habitats. Commonly potential dispersal barriers for large carnivores. employed least cost path (LCP) analysis relies on the underlying cost matrix. By using Ecological Niche Factor Analysis, we minimized the problems connected with subjective cost assessment or the use of presence/absence data. We used data on the wolf presence/absence in Poland to identify LCPs connecting patches of suitable wolf habitat, factors that influence patch occupancy, and compare LCPs between different genetic subpopulations. We found that a lower proportion of cities and roads surrounds the most densely populated patches. Least cost paths between areas where little dispersal takes place (i.e., leading to unpopulated patches or between different genetic subpopulations) ran through a higher proportion of roads and human settlements. They also crossed larger maximal distances over deforested areas. We propose that, apart from supplying the basis for direct conservation efforts, LCPs can be used to determine what factors might facilitate or hinder dispersal by comparing different subsets of LCPs. The methods employed can be widely applicable to gain more in-depth information on potential dispersal barriers for large carnivores.

AB  - Bipartite networks of flowering plants and their visitors (potential pollinators) are increasingly being used in studies of the structure and function of these ecological interactions. Whilst they hold much promise in understanding the ecology of plant-pollinator networks and how this may be altered by environmental perturbations, like land-use change and invasive species, there is no consensus about the scale at which such networks should be constructed and analysed. Ecologists, however, have emphasised that many processes are scale dependent. Here, we compare network- and species-level properties of ecological networks analysed at the level of a site, pooling across sites within a given habitat for each month of surveys, and pooling across all sites and months to create a single network per habitat type. We additionally considered how these three scales of resolution influenced conclusions regarding differences between networks according to two contrasting habitat types (urban bushland remnants and residential gardens) and the influence of honey bee abundance on network properties. We found that most network properties varied markedly depending on the scale of analysis, as did the significance, or lack thereof, of habitat type and honey bee abundance on network properties. We caution against pooling across sites and months as this can create unrealistic links, invalidating conclusions on network structure. In conclusion, consideration of scale of analysis is also important when conducting and interpreting plant-pollinator networks.

AB  - Population structure, connectivity, and dispersal success of individuals can be challenging to demonstrate for solitary carnivores with low population densities. Though the cougar (Puma concolor) is widely distributed throughout North America and is capable of dispersing long distances, populations can be geographically structured and genetic isolation has been documented in some small populations. We described genetic structure and explored the relationship between landscape resistance and genetic variation in cougars in Washington and southern British Columbia using allele frequencies of 17 microsatellite loci for felids. We evaluated population structure of cougars using the Geneland clustering algorithm and spatial principal components analysis. We then used Circuitscape to estimate the landscape resistance between pairs of individuals based on rescaled GIS layers for forest canopy cover, elevation, human population density and highways. We quantified the effect of landscape resistance on genetic distance using multiple regression on distance matrices and boosted regression tree analysis. Cluster analysis identified four populations in the study area. Multiple regression on distance matrices and boosted regression tree models indicated that only forest canopy cover and geographic distance between individuals had an effect on genetic distance. The boundaries between genetic clusters largely corresponded with breaks in forest cover, showing agreement between population structure and genetic gradient analyses. Our data indicate that forest cover promotes gene flow for cougars in the Pacific Northwest, which provides insight managers can use to preserve or enhance genetic connectivity.

AB  - Urban areas can contain rich flora that contribute significantly to biodiversity, but loss and isolation of habitats due to urban sprawl threaten biodiversity and warrant limits on development. The connectivity provided by urban green spaces offers habitats and corridors that help conserve biodiversity. Researchers and planners have begun using landscape ecology principles to develop green space networks and increase connectivity to preserve and restore biodiversity. In this paper, potential corridors were identified in Jinan City, China, using the least-cost path method, and green space networks were developed and improved based on graph theory and the gravity model. Spatial analysis revealed that the proposed plan decreased fragmentation and increased connectivity. Plaza and roadside green spaces were the main types of green space that increased, but they only weakly improved networks and biodiversity. Identifying potential corridors using least-cost path analysis made the results better approximate the real landscape by including impedance along links. The potential networks revealed problems in the current greening plan. The green space network developed based on graph theory and the gravity model simplified and systematized the complex landscape, helping to identify the significance of each green space and guiding urban planning for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Small forest patches embedded in agricultural (and peri-urban) landscapes in Western Europe play a key role for biodiversity conservation with a recognized capacity of delivering a wide suite of ecosystem services. Measures aimed to preserve these patches should be both socially desirable and ecologically effective. This study presents a joint ecologic and economic assessment conducted on small forest patches in Flanders (Belgium) and Picardie (N France). In each study region, two contrasted types of agricultural landscapes were selected. Open field (OF) and Bocage (B) landscapes are distinguished by the intensity of their usage and higher connectivity in the B landscapes. The social demand for enhancing biodiversity and forest structure diversity as well as for increasing the forest area at the expenses of agricultural land is estimated through an economic valuation survey. These results are compared with the outcomes of an ecological survey where the influence of structural features of the forest patches on the associated herbaceous diversity is assessed. The ecological and economic surveys show contrasting results; increasing tree species richness is ecologically more important for herbaceous diversity in the patch, but both tree species richness and herbaceous diversity obtain insignificant willingness to pay estimates. Furthermore, although respondents prefer the proposed changes to take place in the region where they live, we find out that social preferences and ecological effectiveness do differ between landscapes that represent different intensities of land use. Dwellers where the landscape is perceived as more "degraded" attach more value to diversity enhancement, suggesting a prioritization of initiatives in these area. In contrast, the ecological analyses show that prioritizing the protection and enhancement of the relatively better-off areas is more ecologically effective. Our study calls for a balance between ecological effectiveness and welfare benefits, suggesting that cost effectiveness studies should consider these approaches jointly. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In horticulture, stringent market requirements regarding the visual quality of products have led to the intensive use of pesticides worldwide. The immediate need for environmentally-friendly pest control, already embodied in the development of IPM, is exacerbated by pressing social demands and policy contexts. At the same time, the scientific community is increasingly interested in new disciplinary branches and concepts such as agroecology, ecosystem services and ecological intensification that create an opportunity to develop new approaches to pest control research. A conceptual framework is presented that addresses the issue of the ecological control of pests in horticulture. It is based on key ecological concepts- trophic network, biotic interactions, niche and dispersal. This framework stresses the trophic and nontrophic interactions that occur between the components of three trophic levels plants, pests and natural enemies. It highlights the effect of agroecosystem management on these components, namely on the niche dimensions and dispersal of pests and enemies, and its consequences on pest control. This management includes the addition of plant or animal biodiversity, as well as practices to control the functioning of this planned biodiversity. Examples taken from greenhouse and orchard studies illustrate the salient points of the conceptual framework. This approach has a high potential in horticultural systems where there is the possibility to combine various sources of biodiversity and various technical levers. However, more knowledge about the functioning of target ecological networks is required to improve its robustness. In addition, a major current challenge that makes this approach more difficult is the necessity to consider the ecological control of pests within a set of multiple agroecosystem services to be managed.

AB  - We investigated whether signals of known dispersal processes and habitat patch turnover could be detected in a snapshot of the distribution of the tansy leaf beetle Chrysolina graminis among patches of its host plant tansy Tanacetum vulgare. Beetle occupancy in 1305 patches was analysed using autologistic generalised additive models (GAMs). These model spatial autocorrelation with an autocovariate calculated as the distance-weighted rate of occupancy among neighbouring patches. The autocovariate that best explained beetle occupancy was one which represented the active search for patches during beetle dispersal, included a distance weight that closely matched a previously fitted dispersal kernel and had neighbourhood sizes encompassing similar to 95% of known dispersal distances. Autocovariates distinguishing between neighbours on the same and opposite riverbanks outperformed those that did not, revealing the river as a barrier to dispersal. Differentiating between up and downstream autocorrelation did not improve model fit, as is consistent with the beetle's lack of directional bias in dispersal. Habitat connectivity (the extent to which it was surrounded by other patches) did not appear to affect beetle occupancy in the field, while positive effects were found for distributions simulated from the GAM. We argue that this reflects a non-equilibrium distribution driven by slow responses to high rates of habitat patch turnover due to limited dispersal ability. Our findings suggest that presence/absence snapshots can reveal patterns of dispersal and be used to test whether species' ranges are at equilibrium. Such information is important for effective conservation so the possibility of inferring these patterns from distribution data is an appealing one.

AB  - The Incidence Function Model (IFM) has been put forward as a tool for assessing conservation plans. A key benefit of the IFM is low data requirements: widely available species occurrence data and information about land cover. Citizen science is a promising source of such data; however, to use these data in the IFM there are typically two problems. First, the spatial resolution is too coarse, but existing approaches to downscaling species data tend not to extend to patch level (as required by the IFM). Second, widely available citizen science data typically report species' presences only. We devise ten different downscaling methods based on theoretical ecological relationships (the species-area relationship and the distance decay of similarity), and test them against each other. The better performing downscaling methods were based on patch area, rather than distance from other occupied patches. These methods allow data at a coarse resolution to be used in the IFM for comparing conservation management and development plans. Further field testing is required to establish the degree to which results of these new methods can be treated as definitive spatially-explicit predictions. To address the issue of false absences, we present a method to estimate the probability that all species have been listed (and thus that a species' absence from the list represents a true absence), using the species-accumulation curve. This measure of confidence in absence helps both to objectively identify a habitat network for fitting the IFM, and to target areas for further species recording. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Connectivity, the degree to which the landscape structure allows movement between resource and habitat patches, is vital for facilitating a wide range of ecological processes across transformed and anthropogenic landscapes. Connectivity is critical for dispersal of individuals from natal sites, colonisation of patches across a landscape by populations, the structuring of populations, and their persistence across metacommunities. Here, we present a replicable methodology for conservation and land-management practitioners to promote maximal functional connectivity for multiple taxa across a mixed land-use mosaic containing natural habitat patches. We used the maximal functional diversity present in three key taxa (trees, birds, and mammals) responsible for the persistence of forests and the provisioning of ecosystem function and services, in a mosaic landscape of natural, agricultural, and urban land-use practices to map probabilistic connectivity corridors. We used a hybrid of Circuit Theory, least-cost resistance pathways and pinch-points based on the traits and ecological parameters of a surrogate taxon to map functional connectivity across an anthropogenically-fragmented and critically endangered forest biome, the Indian Ocean Coastal Belt Forest of South Africa. By using functional diversity measures, rather than taxonomic species richness, we ensured that maximal ecosystem services were safeguarded, concurrently achieving high-priority conservation goals of protecting specialist, endangered, and range-restricted species and traits that may otherwise be lost through high turnover of generalists at the expense of specialist species. Mapping circuit/least-cost corridors and critical pinch-points in remnant natural, yet unprotected forested patches, highlighted priority habitat to be conserved for promoting maximal functional connectivity, cognisant of the restricted budgets available for conservation planning and landscape-level protection. Our approach simultaneously protects ecosystem services, threatened specialist species and traits, and range-restricted and endangered habitats, linking current Protected Areas while prioritising landscape features of connectivity importance to be conserved for land-management practitioners with limited budgets.

AB  - The metapopulation framework considers that the spatiotemporal distribution of organisms results from a balance between the colonization and extinction of populations in a suitable and discrete habitat network. Recent spatially realistic metapopulation models have allowed patch dynamics to be investigated in natural populations but such models have rarely been applied to plants. Using a simple urban fragmented population system in which favourable habitat can be easily mapped, we studied patch dynamics in the annual plant Crepis sancta (Asteraceae). Using stochastic patch occupancy models (SPOMs) and multi-year occupancy data we dissected extinction and colonization patterns in our system. Overall, our data were consistent with two distinct metapopulation scenarios. A metapopulation (sensu stricto) dynamic in which colonization occurs over a short distance and extinction is lowered by nearby occupied patches (rescue effect) was found in a set of patches close to the city centre, while a propagule rain model in which colonization occurs from a large external population was most consistent with data from other networks. Overall, the study highlights the importance of external seed sources in urban patch dynamics. Our analysis emphasizes the fact that plant distributions are governed not only by habitat properties but also by the intrinsic properties of colonization and dispersal of species. The metapopulation approach provides a valuable tool for understanding how colonization and extinction shape occupancy patterns in highly fragmented plant populations. Finally, this study points to the potential utility of more complex plant metapopulation models than traditionally used for analysing ecological and evolutionary processes in natural metapopulations.

AB  - We describe for the first time the immature stages of the Ecuadorian endemic urban butterfly, Catasticta flisa duna Eitschberger & Racheli, from Quito, Ecuador. A mistletoe species, Phoradendron nervosum Oliv. (Viscaceae), is identified as the host plant. Phoradendron nervosum is an aerial-stem hemiparasite in the order Santalales that is parasitic on Prunus serotina (Ehrh), a common tree species in the gardens and parks of Quito. We report Podisus sp. (Pentatomidae), a predatory stink bug, as a predator of C. f. duna pupa. Additionally, parasitoid flies (Tachinidae) were obtained from some larvae. We compare the immature stages of C. f. duna and the subspecies C. flisa flisandra Reissinger from Costa Rica, providing for the first-time head chaetotaxy and setal maps for this diverse genus. Finally, we emphasize the importance of urban green spaces which provide habitat for many native species. Such urban oases should be considered as important resources for conservation, whose development and management benefit urban biodiversity and ecological networks, as well as enhancing the quality of life for the city's human inhabitants.

AB  - In the context of increasing urbanization, preserving urban biodiversity has become a priority because biodiversity appears to be a key element when evaluating the well-being of urban residents. Recently, urban management has relied on a 'renaturing' strategy to improve biodiversity, but the benefits of these policies remain debated. In this study, we evaluated the effects of urban land use and green corridors on (1) urban avian biodiversity, and (2) the presence of the most common (top 70%) and least common (bottom 30%) bird species. We surveyed bird diversity at 102 sites during the Spring in a small French city, and performed a PCA on several habitat structures (e.g. roads, houses, grassy areas) to determine the level of urbanization of each site. Then, we tested with GLMMs the effects of land use (PC1), distance to the edge of the city, and distance to the corridor on bird diversity. We found a positive effect of green infrastructures on bird species richness, and this effect was reinforced by the proximity to the green corridor. Thus, bird species richness and the presence of common species were positively impacted by the presence of green areas, the proximity to the city edge and the proximity to the green corridor. The presence of the green corridor contributed significantly to the presence of rare species, which emphasizes its role in promoting avian biodiversity. Green corridors are a key element of the urban landscape because they allow less common species to colonize cities, and thus enhance urban biodiversity.

AB  - 1. The successful movement of individuals is fundamental to life. Facilitating these movements by promoting ecological connectivity has become a central theme in ecology and conservation. Urban areas contain more than half of the world's human population, and their potential to support biodiversity and to connect their citizens to nature is increasingly recognized. Promoting ecological connectivity within these areas is essential to reaching this potential. However, our current understanding of ecological connectivity within urban areas appears limited.
   2. We reviewed the published scientific literature to assess the state-of-the-art of ecological connectivity research in urban areas, summarized trends in study attributes and highlighted knowledge gaps.
   3. We found 174 papers that investigated ecological connectivity within urban areas. These papers addressed either structural (48) or functional connectivity (111), and some addressed both (15), but contained substantial geographic and taxonomic biases. These papers rarely defined the aspect of connectivity they were investigating and objective descriptions of the local urban context were uncommon. Formulated hypotheses or a priori predictions were typically unstated and many papers used suboptimal study designs and methods.
   4. We suggest future studies explicitly consider and quantify the landscape within their analyses and make greater use of available and rapidly developing tools and methods for measuring functional connectivity (e.g. biotelemetry or landscape genetics). We also highlight the need for studies to clearly define how the terms 'urban' and 'connectivity' have been applied.
   5. Knowledge gaps in ecological connectivity in urban areas remain, partly because the field is still in its infancy and partly because we must better capitalize on the state-of-the-art technological and analytical techniques that are increasingly available. Well-designed studies that employed high-resolution data and powerful analytical techniques highlight our abilities to quantify ecological connectivity in urban areas. These studies are exemplary, setting the standards for future research to facilitate data-driven and evidence-based biodiversity-friendly infrastructure planning in urban areas.

AB  - The unusually high floral and faunal similarity between the different regions of the Afromontane archipelago has been noted by biogeographers since the late 1800s. A possible explanation for this similarity is the spread of montane habitat into the intervening lowlands during the glacial periods of the Pleistocene, allowing biotic exchange between mountain ranges. In this study, we sought to infer the existence and most likely positions of these potential habitat corridors. We focused on sixteen Afromontane endemic tree, shrub, and bird species in the Cameroon Volcanic Line, East African Rift and Great Escarpment. Species were chosen based on distribution above 1200-1500 m in at least two of the major Afromontane regions. Ecological niche models were developed for each species in the present and projected to the mid-Holocene and the last glacial maximum (LGM). Models were thresholded to create binary maps of presence/absence and then summed across taxa to estimate potential LGM and mid-Holocene distributions. We found widespread climatic suitability for our montane taxa throughout the lowlands of Central Africa during the LGM, connecting all regions of the Afromontane archipelago except the Ethiopian Highlands and the Dahomey Gap. During the mid-Holocene, we noted more limited climatic suitability for fewer species in lowland areas. Although we set out to test predictions derived from alternatively hypothesized corridors, we instead found widespread climatic suitability connecting Afromontane regions across the entire Congo Basin for all species.

AB  - Miombo is the most extensive ecosystem in southern Africa, being strongly driven by fire, climate, herbivory, and human activity. Soils are major regulating and supporting services, sequestering nearly 50% of the overall carbon and comprising a set of yet unexploited functions. In this study, we used next-generation Illumina sequencing to assess the patterns of bacterial soil diversity in two pioneer Miombo species, Brachystegia boehmii and Brachystegia spiciformis, along a fire gradient, in ferric lixisol and cambic arenosol soils. In total, 21 phyla, 51 classes, 98 orders, 193 families, and 520 genera were found, revealing a considerably high and multifunctional diversity with a strong potential for the production of bioactive compounds and nutrient mobilization. Four abundant genera characterized the core microbiome among plant species, type of soils, or fire regime: Streptomyces, Gaiella, Chthoniobacter, and Bacillus. Nevertheless, bacterial networks revealed a higher potential for mutualistic interactions and transmission of chemical signals among phylotypes from low fire frequency sites than those from high fire frequency sites. Ecological networks also revealed the negative effects of frequent fires on the complexity of microbial communities. Functional predictions revealed the core "house-keeping" metabolisms contributing to the high bacterial diversity found, suggesting its importance to the functionality of this ecosystem.

AB  - Species habitat preferences can be obscured when individuals have been recorded in non-core habitats because of dispersal, spillover effects or spatial errors in observation locations. Disentangling the direct effects of the habitats species are observed in from the effects of proximity to other nearby habitats is especially challenging in fragmented landscapes, as many fragmentation metrics are correlated and it is difficult to prove independent effects. In this paper we addressed this issue by comparing a number of models based on predefined ecological theories. We compared models based on quantity of core habitat surrounding observations, proximity to core habitat, or a combination of the two to explain the observed distribution of the saltmarsh inhabiting white-fronted chat (Epthianura albifrons) in coastal New South Wales, Australia. Proximity to core habitat was considered as either Euclidean distance or cost distance, and models were assessed using Akaike's information criterion and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve on 10 random subsets of the data. We found that all models performed similarly, with the combination of cost distance and the quantity of saltmarsh performing better, but not significantly so. We compared the advantages and disadvantages of different models and also present a model averaged result. Our models suggested that the majority of saltmarshes in New South Wales were too small to have a large effect on probability of occurrence. As climate change is expected to further reduce the amount of available saltmarsh through continued mangrove incursion, coastal populations of the white-fronted chat are expected to come under increasing threat. The conversion of grasslands to urban areas may also increase the effective distance between different populations of the species and reduce gene flow and rescue effects.

AB  - One of the most vital and urgent global conservation challenges is to deal with the loss and fragmentation of wildlife habitats, particularly for large-bodied and wide-ranging terrestrial megafauna. The Central Forest Spine Master Plan for Ecological Linkages (CFS) was developed by the Malaysian Federal Government in 2010 to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services by securing landscape connectivity between Peninsular Malaysia's main forest blocks. Here we present an evaluation of the effectiveness of the CFS master plan to promote functional connectivity for Asian elephants, one of its focal species. The specific objectives of our study were to identify the most critical forest patches to maintain connectivity for elephants in Peninsular Malaysia, assess functional connectivity within the CFS ecological linkages, and identify alternative corridors where appropriate to enhance CFS effectiveness. We used the largest animal movement dataset in Peninsular Malaysia (220,000 GPS locations from 53 elephants) to develop models of elephant movement probability and to estimate landscape resistance using step selection functions based on landscape characteristics. According to our evaluation of 28 linkages, 57% of them provided high functional connectivity, 28% provided acceptable connectivity, and 14% provided low to no connectivity. A very important and positive finding is that the CFS linkages with the highest centrality values (i.e., the most important to maintain overall connectivity in Peninsular Malaysia) also score highly in functional connectivity (i.e., they are actually effective corridors for elephant movement). This means that an adequate CFS implementation can lead to high levels of functional connectivity among Peninsular Malaysia's main forest blocks. Based on our assessment, we recommend to conduct some revisions on the CFS plan to ensure its effectiveness.

AB  - Background: Mato Grosso do Sul has been undergoing a process of urbanization which results in loss of native vegetation. This withdrawal makes vectors of man and domestic animals closer, causing changes in the epidemiology of diseases such as American Visceral Leishmaniasis. The aim of the study was to evaluate the phlebotomine fauna and environmental issues related to the transmission of AVL in Ponta Pora, Mato Grosso do Sul, between 2009 and 2010.
   Methods: Vegetation of the urban area was evaluated by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI).
   Results: The results showed that the phlebotomine fauna of the city consists of five species, especially Lutzomyia longipalpis (Lutz and Neiva, 1912), the vector of Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum. Predominance of males was observed. The insects were captured in greater quantity in the intradomicile. Lu. longipalpis was the most frequent and abundant species, present throughout the year, with a peak population after the rainy season. Vectors can be found in high amounts in forest and disturbed environments.
   Conclusions: The finding of Lu. longipalpis in regions with little vegetation and humidity suggests that the species is adapted to different sorts of environmental conditions, demonstrating its close association with man and the environment it inhabits. The tourist feature of Ponta Pora reinforces its epidemiological importance as a vulnerable city. The geographical location, bordering Paraguay through dry border, makes possible the existence of a corridor of vectors and infected dogs between the two countries.

AB  - Deep vertical rotary tillage (DVRT) is a novel technique; however, its influence on soil bacterial diversity and community structure remains unclear. Herein, it was hypothesized that this tillage method significantly improves the bacterial diversity and alters the bacterial community structure and therefore it supports enhanced soil ecosystem functions in cultivated land. We investigated the soil bacterial communities and performed molecular ecological network analysis of cultivated land soils under different tillage regimes using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene Illumina sequencing. Soil samples were collected from the experimental field under 2 treatments: DVRT and conventional rotary tillage (CT) in Shizuishan City, Ningxia, China, in a 2-year field experiment. The alpha-diversity indices showed that DVRT resulted in higher bacterial diversity. In addition, the principal coordinate analysis results revealed a clear separation among the groups of cultivated land soils under the 2 treatment regimes. The key physicochemical factors that significantly influenced bacterial diversity and community structure were pH and total potassium concentration. The network analysis indicated that the bacterial network of DVRT soils consisted of more functionally interrelated bacterial modules than that of soils under CT, and the topological roles of characteristic bacteria and key bacteria were also different. In relation to CT, the relative abundances of organisms belonging to the functional groups of "Xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism", "Signal transduction", and "Metabolism of cofactors and vitamins" were significantly increased in cultivated land soils under DVRT. It was concluded that DVRT treatment could improve bacterial diversity, alter the bacterial network structure, and enhance potential ecosystem functions in soils of cultivated land.

AB  - The conservation of habitats and habitat complexes in diverse landscapes is increasingly recognized as a crucial factor in sustaining biodiversity and ecosystems. For the successful management of landscapes, habitat monitoring is necessary, but often small biotopes, e.g. scattered trees, copses, tree rows, hedges, and the transition zones between ecosystems, are ignored. This is important as such small biotopes are recognized as keystone elements in landscape structure for habitat networks. Furthermore, the transition zones between different habitats, often called ecotones, are dynamic and play several functional roles in landscape ecology. This article presents an approach for the extraction of small biotopes and ecotones combining object-based and pixel-based image analysis. Both high-resolution digital elevation data from airborne laser scanning and multi-temporal RapidEye remote-sensing data were used to automatically detect landscape elements and landscape patterns. First, multi-temporal RapidEye images were used to classify the main land-use classes using object-based image analysis. In the second step, a high-resolution digital surface model was integrated with the main classes, and small biotopes and ecotones were delineated by means of pixel-based image analysis. Classification accuracy for main land-use classes is above 92%, and a visual assessment using aerial image and onsite investigation show that the identification results for small biotopes well match reality. The results show the effectiveness of the classification strategy developed and the potential for incorporating the detailed surface mapping in heterogeneous vegetated areas.

AB  - Vegetation plays a fundamental role in conserving the biological diversity of urban areas. From isolated trees to multi-hectare patches, green spaces are critical to species conservation in urban landscapes. The abundance of green spaces can regulate the availability of habitat and resources for species' survival. In many urban areas, the lack of vegetation inventories and ecological information at fine spatial resolutions limits conservation efforts. To evaluate the potential of very high-resolution imagery (WorldView-2, 30-cm resolution) to fill this gap, we sought to a) map contrasting urban vegetation cover types (grass, shrubs and woody vegetation) at the meter scale and with high accuracy, b) quantify the structural and functional connectivity of urban vegetation, and c) estimate the status of productive vegetation. We focused our analysis on land use and cover in the city of Xalapa in Veracruz, Mexico, and employed multiscale satellite imagery to estimate vegetation cover, connectivity, and health. We identified 38,579 patches of woody vegetation, of which 93 % corresponded to isolated trees contributing to 27 % of vegetation connectivity. Without woody vegetation, the connectivity index decrease up to 97 %; removing grass or shrubs would reduce connectivity by 38 % or 32 %, respectively. We identified 10 patches disproportionately important to connectivity, of which seven had some type of legal protection. Across vegetation types, 38 % of the vegetated area was unhealthy. Wooded element connectivity assessment at a fine spatial resolution is crucial to conserve and restore these key resources for biodiversity and human well-being in urban environments.

AB  - Although fungi are regarded as the important degraders of aromatic hydrocarbons (AHs) in various environments, the dynamic succession and interaction of their community under aromatic hydrocarbon stress has been rarely reported. In this study, we systematically investigated the responses of the fungal community and the associations among fungal species when facing the continuous stress of two typical AHs, benzene and naphthalene. Using high-throughput sequencing technology, we demonstrated that fungal diversity displayed a significant downward trend during six weeks of continuous aromatic hydrocarbon treatment. Community succession was observed during the operational period, and the relative abundance of some typical degraders, such as Exophiala sp. and Candida sp., increased during the later period of operation. Meanwhile, by predicting the functions of the fungal community through PICRUSt2, we found that some relevant enzymes, such as peroxidase, dioxygenase, and monooxygenase, may play an important role in the degradation process and maintaining overall community multifunctionality. Furthermore, the measurement of modified normalized stochasticity ratio (MST) indicated that continuous aromatic hydrocarbon stress resulted in a stronger deterministic process in community assembly over time, suggesting environmental selection dominated succession of the fungal community in activated sludge. Finally, molecular ecological network analysis (MENA) demonstrated that, the cooperative behaviors among members, the network keystone genera related to biodegradation, such as Exophiala sp. and Haglerozyma sp., and a well-organized topological structure, together, maintained the structural stability of the fungal community under AH stress. Our study provides new insights for understanding the stability of fungal communities during the degradation of contaminants in activated sludge.

AB  - For a given species, reducing the extent, connectivity and health status of source populations will diminish the probability of colonizing suitable habitats. In this study, we evaluated if metapopulation size helped predict species presence in suitable habitats, by using boreal understory plants and epiphytic lichens as case studies. We sampled a network of 792 vegetation plots located across a 240,000-km(2) section of pristine boreal forests. Landscape-level species abundance (LISA), a proxy for metapopulation size, was quantified in a 50 km radius surrounding each plot. The effects of local environmental factors and LISA on species presence were modelled with general linear models (GLMs). Forty-eight vascular plant species and 8 pendulous epiphytic lichens were abundant enough to be considered in the statistical analyses. Habitat variables explained the presence of 30 vascular plants and 4 lichen species to a relatively strong degree (Tjur's R-2>0.15). Among these species, 16 vascular plants and 4 lichens were significantly influenced by LISA, independently of local habitat characteristics. Vascular plant species whose presence was significantly affected by LISA did not exhibit particular morphological traits or habitat preferences compared with those that were not affected. By contrast, the 4 epiphytic lichen species that were affected by LISA were all associated with older forests. No species exhibited obvious metapopulation size thresholds below which the probability of species presence in suitable habitats dropped drastically. In terms of conservation, these results suggest that coarse-filter approaches are probably more robust and easy to implement than species-specific threshold approaches in this kind of ecosystem.

AB  - Context Prioritising is likely to differ depending on the species considered for connectivity assessments, leading to a lack of consensual decisions for territorial planning. Objectives The objective was to assess the relevance of identifying priority areas for connectivity for groups of species based on common dispersal abilities. We aimed to assess the impact of target groups choices on predicted priority areas. Method The study was located at the Thau Lagoon territory to demonstrate the methodological approach. Ecological niche modelling was used to quantify species resistance and to identify suitable habitat patches. We coupled the least-cost path methodology with circuit theory to assess species connectivity. We classified connectivity from high to low levels and averaged the results by dispersal groups. Results We found important differences in identified priority areas between groups with dissimilar dispersal abilities, with little overlap between highly connected areas. We identified a gap between the level of protection of low dispersal species and highly connected areas. We found mismatches between existing corridors and connectivity in low dispersal species, and a greater impact in areas of expected urban sprawl projects on favourably connected areas for species with high dispersal capabilities. Conclusion We have demonstrated that a diversity of dispersal capacity ranges must be accounted for in order to identify ecological corridors in programmes that aim to restore habitat connectivity at territorial levels. Our findings are oriented to support the decisions of planning initiatives, at both local and regional scale.

AB  - Land degradation by salinization and sodification changes soil function, destroys soil health, and promotes bioaccumulation of heavy metals in plants, but little is known about their fundamental mechanisms in shaping microbial communities and regulating microbial interactions. In this study, we explored the impact of saline-alkaline (SA) stress on soil bacterial and fungal community structures in different Cd-contaminated soils of Dezhou, Baoding, Xinxiang, Beijing and Shenyang cities from the North China Plain, China. Increased soil salinity and alkalinity enhanced Cd availability, indicated by significant increases in available Cd2+ in soil solution of 34.1%-49.7%, soil extractable Cd of 32.0-51.6% and wheat root Cd concentration of 24.5%-40.2%, as well as decreased activities of antioxidative enzymes of wheat root when compared with CK (no extra neutral or alkaline salts added). Soil bacteria were more active in response to the SA stress than fungi, as the significant structural reorganization of soil bacterial microbiota rather than fungal microbiota between SA and CK treatments was illustrated by principal component analysis. Adding neutral and alkaline salts enriched oligotrophic and haloalkaliphilic taxa in the Sphingobacteriaceae, Cellvibrionaceae, and Caulobacteraceae bacterial families, but decreased some Acidobacteria such as subgroup 6_norank, which was a sensitive biomarker that responded only to Cd contamination in CK-treated soils. Conversely, fungi were more sensitive to soil differences than bacteria: the composition of the fungal community was significantly different among different soil types. Phylogenetic molecular ecological network (pMEN) analysis further indicated that the microbial community structure and network interactions were altered to strengthen the adaptability of microorganisms to SA stress; the changes in structure and network interactions were proposed to contribute to competitive interactions. Most of the keystone genera identified in SA-treated soils, such as Blastococcus, Gemmatimonas, RB41, or Candida, had relatively low abundances (<1%), indicating their disproportionate ecological roles in triggering resistance or tolerance to SA stress and Cd toxicity.

AB  - Urban green spaces (UGS) enhance the quality of life in urban environments and serve as habitat corridors or refuge for organisms, including beetles and spiders. The attributes of UGS allow them to harbour species that offer essential ecosystem services. However, the ability of UGS to provide services is limited by the extent to which they have been altered anthropogenically. We described the taxonomic richness and functional composition of arthropods in a mountainous urban ecosystem of Ghana by focussing on the activity of both beetles and spiders at the family level. Two main land-use types (woodlands and built-up areas) were identified and characterised based on the presence or absence of certain vegetation attributes. Sixteen plots in each land-use type with sizes 20 x 20 m were demarcated and fitted with four pitfall traps in each plot to sample continuously for eight weeks, the activity density of both beetles and spiders. Samples were sorted into families and functional groups (detritivores, fungivores, herbivory and predators). The taxonomic richness and activity density were both significantly higher in the woodlands than in the built-up areas. Similarly, all functional groups showed a higher affinity to the woodlands than the built-up areas. Habitat attributes defined by plant diversity and structural complexity were the underlying drivers explaining the differences in arthropod communities between the land-use types. Though the built-up areas seem degraded and open, the remaining small vegetation patches still support the activities of some taxa that should merit the protection of such remnant vegetation in urban ecosystems.

AB  - Aim The woodland ecosystems of south-eastern Australia have been extensively disturbed by agriculture and urbanization. Herein, the occurrence of birds in woodland remnants in three distinct landscapes was analysed to examine the effects of different types of landscape matrices on species richness vs. area and species richness vs. isolation relationships and individual species responses to woodland fragmentation.
   Location The study system comprised three distinct woodland landscapes of the northern Australian Capital Territory and bordering areas of New South Wales. These landscapes (termed agricultural, peri-urban and urban) are located within 50 km of each other, have remnant fragments of similar age, size, isolation, woodland cover, elevation and climates. The major distinguishing feature of the three landscapes was the properties of the habitats surrounding the numerous woodland remnants.
   Methods Bird surveys, using an area-search methodology, were conducted in 1999 and 2000 in 127 remnants in the three landscapes to determine bird species presence/absence. Each remnant was characterized by measures of remnant area, isolation and habitat complexity. To characterize differences between each landscape, we conducted an analysis of the amount of tree cover and human disturbance in each landscape using SPOT imagery and aerial photographs. Linear regressions of woodland-dependent species richness vs. remnant area and remnant isolation for the three different landscapes were calculated to see if there were any apparent differences. Binomial logistic regressions were used to determine the relationships between the occurrence of each species and the size and isolation of woodland habitat, in each landscape.
   Results All the landscapes displayed a significant (P < 0.01) species vs. area relationship, but the slope of the urban relationship was significantly greater than those of the other landscapes. In contrast, only the agricultural landscape displayed a significant (P < 0.01) species richness vs. isolation relationship. When individual species were investigated, we found species that were: (1) apparently insensitive to reduction in remnant area and increase in isolation across all landscapes, (2) absent in small remnants in all landscapes, (3) absent in small remnants in all landscapes and also absent in isolated remnants in the agricultural landscape, (4) absent in isolated remnants in the agricultural landscape, and (5) absent in small remnants in the urban landscape. Threshold values (50% probability of occurrence) for area and isolation for individual species were highly variable across the three landscapes.
   Main conclusions These results indicate that woodland bird communities have a varying response to habitat fragmentation in different landscapes. Whilst we cannot be sure how representative our chosen landscapes are of other similarly composed landscapes, these results suggest that the type of landscape matrix may have a considerable influence on how bird species are affected by woodland fragmentation in the region. For instance, the properties of a matrix may influence both the resources available in the landscape as a whole for different bird species, and the connectivity (dispersal of birds), between woodland remnants. We encourage further research that examines these hypotheses and argue that the management of the matrix should be included in conservation strategies for fragmented landscapes.

AB  - Species that specialize in disturbed habitats may have considerably different dispersal strategies than those adapted to more stable environments. However, little is known of the dispersal patterns and population structure of such species. This information is important for conservation because many postfire specialists are at risk from anthropogenic changes to natural disturbance regimes. We used microsatellite markers to assess the effect of landscape variation and recent disturbance history on dispersal by a small mammal species that occupies the early seral stage of vegetation regeneration in burnt environments. We predicted that a postfire specialist would be able to disperse over multiple habitat types (generalist) and not exhibit sex-biased dispersal, as such strategies should enable effective colonization of spatially and temporally variable habitat. We found significant differentiation between sites that fitted an isolation-by-distance pattern and spatial autocorrelation of multilocus genotypes to a distance of 23km. There was no consistent genetic evidence for sex-biased dispersal. We tested the influence of different habitat- and fire-specific landscape resistance scenarios on genetic distance between individuals and found a significant effect of fire. Our genetic data supported recently burned vegetation having greater conductance for gene flow than unburnt habitat, but variation in habitat quality between vegetation types and occupied patches had no effect on gene flow. Postfire specialists must evolve an effective dispersal ability to move over distances that would ensure access to early successional stage vegetation. Natural disturbance and natural heterogeneity may therefore not influence population genetic structure as negatively as expected.

AB  - Landscape connectivity promotes dispersal and other types of movement, including foraging activity; consequently, the inclusion of connectivity concept is a priority in conservation and landscape planning in response to fragmentation. Urban planners expect the scientific community to provide them with an easy, but scientifically rigorous, method to identify highly connecting contexts in landscapes. The least-cost paths (LCP) method is one of the simplest resistance-based models that could be a good candidate to spatially identify areas where movement is potentially favored in a given landscape. We tested the efficiency of LCP predictions to detect highly connecting landscape contexts facilitating individual movements compared to those performed in un-connecting landscape contexts. We used a landscape-level behavioral experiment based on a translocation protocol and individual repeated measures. In the city of Rennes (France), 30 male hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) were translocated and radio-tracked in both highly connecting and un-connecting contexts, respectively, which were determined by the presence and absence of modelled LCPs. Individual movement patterns were compared between the two predicted contexts. Individuals travelled longer distances, moved faster, and were more active in the highly connecting contexts compared to the un-connecting contexts. Moreover, in highly connecting contexts, hedgehog movement followed LCP orientation, with individuals using more wooded habitats than other land cover class. By using a rigorous experimental design, this study validated the ecological relevance of LCP analysis to identify highly connecting areas, and could be easily implemented by urban landscape planners.

AB  - As urbanization accelerates, urban biodiversity conservation is becoming a great concern for the maintenance of urban ecosystem functions. In particular, forest bird communities in urban areas have been recognized as a conservation target because of their functions in food webs and ecosystem services. But our understanding of which local- and landscape-scale factors influence native bird communities within urban green spaces is still insufficient to provide managers with information for effectively planning biodiversity management programs. Here we examine how local habitat characteristics, human disturbance, and habitat connectivity influence the diversity of forest bird communities in 44 small forest patches (0.5-20.0 ha) embedded in an urbanized landscape. Patch size exerted a positive influence on the diversity of most bird functional groups, and it had the greatest effects on total abundance and species richness. The second most important factor was human disturbance. Remnant patches with lower levels of human disturbance had higher diversity than newly established patches where intense human activities occurred more frequently. In addition, vegetation complexity and habitat connectivity were positively related to total species richness and abundance, respectively, but they were less important. Management strategies for the conservation of urban forest birds, therefore, should consider not only local improvements in habitat structure - through increased patch size, reduced human disturbance, and increased vegetation complexity - but also the maintenance of habitat connectivity.

AB  - Modeling functional connectivity in altered landscapes is one of the growing fields of expertise in landscape ecology, and many research teams have proposed different methods to evaluate it for a wide range of species. However, very few have empirically validated the efficiency of such models in discriminating real corridors from theoretical ones. Models that are not validated or those only based on structural connectivity could result in inefficient management decisions. Moreover, validation could potentially reveal that functional connectivity differs between focal species and spatial scales. Here we empirically compared different validation methods for two commonly used connectivity models applied to two cervid species (i.e. moose Alces americanus and white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus) during a road enlargement project. For both species, we built functional connectivity maps using CircuitScape (circuit-based model) and LinkageMapper (least-cost path model). We then validated them empirically using four different metrics: density of cervid-vehicle collisions, distance to the nearest wintering ground and detection rate calculated with automated cameras and with sand traps. Validation was carried out at various spatial scales (150, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 and 2500 m). The circuit-based models performed better at identifying functional corridors of connectivity for moose. Validation strength differed greatly between the four metrics used, and the spatial scale at which the correlation between connectivity and data was assessed had little effect. Our study emphasizes the importance of validating functional connectivity models to provide the best decision-making tools.

AB  - The article focuses on the relevant topic of the development of the ecosystem consisting integral landscape formations of biocentric-network type, which has been done in many countries of Europe since the 1990s. The article emphasizes certain achievements of independent Ukraine regarding the methodological developments of the concept of ecosystem, first of all at the national and regional levels and also the low level of its introduction at the local level. In the process of performing (based on studying foreign and domestic experiences) the scientific study of development and perspectives of the development of local ecosystem of a residential area as a basis for the regional ecosystem in the conditions of Yampil city of Vinnytsia Oblast, we determined its extremely high biotic and landscape diversities, and also the threats of its significant transformation. As an important step to prevent negative influence of agrarian activity of inhabitants of Yampil on the environment with restoration of diversity it is characteristic of, we considered the development of the city's ecosystem. The scientific substantiations made by applications of tools became the basis for the development of local ecosystem. In the developed scheme "Local ecosystem of Yampil city", we indicated the structural elements of the ecosystem, their localization, toponyms, made corresponding indications on the map and provided all its elements with descriptions. The key and connective territories of the local ecosystem of Yampil city are compartmentalized based on the adopted criteria of the selection. Their internal structures that we characterized in details allowed us to assess the special roles of the key and connective territories in the preservation of biodiversity, landscape basics of the formation and further development of Yampil city. The territories of the city which were not included in the local elements of the ecosystem are considered restorative and buffer territories within the local and regional ecological networks. The suggested scheme of the local econetwork is basic concerning the implementation of the following stages of the development of the ecosystem by composing schemes at the regional and general national levels and is the main condition for the balanced development of the Transnistria region. We obtained the results so as to preserve and effectively use the biotic and landscape diversities combined with non exhaustive use of natural resources, which is the main goal of contemporary nature use, ecological safety and nature protection. The recommendations were developed for the use of nature-protection and administrative bodies in decision making and any kind (land use, nature protection, ecological, etc) of studies.

AB  - An animal's capacity to recolonize a patch depends on at least two components: its ability to detect the patch and its ability to reach it. However, the disruption of such processes by anthropic disturbances could explain low animal abundance patterns observed by many investigators in certain landscapes. Through field experiments, we compared the orientation and homing success of northern green frogs (Rana clamitans melanota Rafinesque, 1820) and northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens Schreber, 1782) translocated across disturbed or undisturbed surfaces. We also monitored the path selected by individuals when presented with a choice between a short distance over a disturbed surface and a longer, undisturbed route. Finally, we measured the water loss and behaviour of frogs on substrates resulting from anthropogenic disturbances and a control. When presented with a choice, 72% of the frogs avoided disturbed surfaces. Although able to orient towards the pond of capture when translocated on disturbed surfaces, frogs had a lower probability of homing successfully to the pond than when translocated at a similar distance on an undisturbed surface. Frogs lost the most water on substrates associated with disturbance and in the absence of cover. Our data illustrate that anthropically disturbed areas devoid of cover, such as mined peatlands and agricultural fields, disrupt the ability of frogs to reach habitat patches and are likely explanations to their reduced abundance patterns in such environments.

AB  - One of the major planning tools to respond to urban landscape fragmentation is the development of ecological corridors, that is, interconnected networks of urban green and blue spaces. Least-cost paths (LCP) appear to be an easy and appropriate resistance-based modelling method to respond to urban planners' needs. However, the ecological validation of urban corridors using LCP is rarely performed and needs to be generalized to different species, habitats and cities.
   We developed an experimental design to test the efficiency of LCP predictions to detect highly connecting landscape contexts that facilitate individual movements compared to movements in less connecting landscape contexts. We deliberately assigned LCP analysis parameters based on the scientific literature and expert knowledge to test a method potentially easy to use for urban stakeholders. To extend the validation, we applied our LCP model to two biological taxa with different habitat requirements: grassland-dwelling moths and forest-dwelling passerines, and to two medium-sized cities.
   We used mark-release-recapture (MRR) methods for moths and playback recall protocols for passerines to compare the patterns of individual movement between two contrasted connectivity contexts determined by the presence and absence of modelled LCPs. MRR protocol estimated movement rates between herbaceous patches and the two contrasted connectivity contexts. Playback recall protocol consisted in attracting individuals from wooded patches to the two contrasted connectivity contexts. A movement was considered facilitated, when displacement was rapidly engaged and individuals moved a long distance from their wooded patch.
   Moth and passerine movement patterns differed between the two connectivity contexts: moth recapture rates were higher in highly connecting contexts than in less connecting contexts. For passerine birds, responses to playback recalls were faster and movement distance longer in highly connecting contexts. All results support the hypothesis that both taxa were more prone to move in corridors modelled by LCP.
   Synthesis and applications. The convergence of the results for different biological models and across cities strengthens the relevance of LCP analysis for planning urban greenways and provides guidelines for landscape planners in the development of these corridors to favour the movement and survival of multiple urban species.

AB  - Biotic interactions can influence the ranges and abundances of species, but no clear guidelines exist for integrating them into correlative models of niches and distributions. Niche/distributional models characterize environmental/habitat suitability or species presence using predictor variables unaffected by (=unlinked to) the population of the focal species. Such variables (termed scenopoetic') typically have been considered to include only abiotic factors. In contrast, population-demographic approaches model the abundance of the focal species by including linked predictor variables, which frequently are biotic interactors. Nevertheless, a focal species might hold no, or negligible, population-level effects on its biotic interactors. Hence, contrary to current theory, such interactors would represent unlinked variables valid and potentially very useful for niche/distributional models. Consideration of population-level effects indicates that facilitators and affecting amensals (species that negatively affect another species but are not affected by it) constitute unlinked variables, but commensals and affected amensals do not. For competitors, mutualists, predators/prey, consumers/resources, and parasites/hosts, additional information is necessary. Specifically, available ecological/natural history information for the particular species involved (e.g. regarding specificity) and theory regarding ecological networks can allow identification of interactors that are likely to be unlinked or nearly so. Including an unlinked biotic interactor as a predictor variable in a niche/distributional model should improve predictions when the effects of the biotic interactor vary across the study region, or in another place or time period. Other relevant interactors must be taken into account by post-processing a niche/distributional model, or via population-demographic models that require abundance data over time. This framework should improve current correlative models and highlights areas requiring progress.

AB  - Forest fragmentation and the associated potential habitat loss is one of the main causes of biodiversity loss. One strategy that promotes its maintenance at a landscape scale is the establishment of biological corridors that enhance structural and functional connectivity of the biotic components. However, the applicability and functionality of this tool is limited due to the lack of planning at the moment of the design and establishment of corridors or connectivity networks that are guided by detailed and rigorous methods. In this research, we developed a theoretical proposal of ecological connectivity for the Santa Elena village, Medellin municipality, Colombia, using tools from landscape ecology. Initially, 21 forest fragments or nucleus were selected based on their minimum size (larger than 5 ha), core area (larger than 1 ha), and shape index (rounded or nearly rounded). Then, based on a friction matrix, we designed a potential network that would allow to connect 1356.35 ha of remnants forests through 31 ecological corridors of 100 m wide, comprising 208.33 ha in total. Finally, we discussed the importance of promoting this kind of strategies based on landscape ecology that enhance both habitat conservation and landscape connectivity in areas near large Latin-American cities.

AB  - Aim Migratory species depend on various habitats and resources along their migration routes. Characteristics such as dependence on distinct habitats and the presence of multiple threats along their migratory routes make these species vulnerable, and gaps in knowledge about their ecology and migration processes make them difficult to conserve. Urania boisduvalii is a diurnal moth endemic to Cuba that feeds on plants of Omphalea spp. during its larval phases. These plants produce secondary metabolites as a defence against the moth's larvae, which then are forced to migrate. Although some ecological aspects of Urania boisduvalii are known, its migration routes remain largely unknown. This research proposes potential migratory routes of Urania boisduvalii among populations of its host plant. Location Cuba. Methods We developed ecological niche models of the moth and its hosts based on environmental, anthropic, biotic and biogeographic factors to obtain potential distributional areas that include zones where positive interactions are found but exclude those where negative factors are present. These areas were overlapped to hypothesize potential breeding areas for the moths. Potential migratory corridors were proposed based on environmental connectivity. Results The moth and its hosts have broad potential distributions; however, limiting factors have substantially reduced these areas, especially for plants. The potential migratory routes of Urania boisduvalii are complex and mostly involve the western and eastern regions of Cuba. Most records outside potential breeding areas were close to these migratory corridors. Main conclusions We offer initial hypotheses of the migratory routes of U. boisduvalii, which may be useful to guiding monitoring projects that can provide more definitive views of the seasonal distribution of this species across the Cuban archipelago.

AB  - Urban greenways are proven strategies to counter ecological fragmentation and improve urban sustainability. However, significant challenges remain when seeking to integrate multiple functions into priority-oriented planning. In this paper, we focus on the city of Wuhan (China) to present an innovative approach for developing multi-functional greenway networks. Based on remote sensing and geographical information systems, this approach applies a least-cost path model, a kernel density analysis and a proxy index to identify and integrate multiple needs into priority greenway networks. Our priorities are bird and small mammal conservation, human recreation and water protection. In the cost settings of the least-cost path model, we include simulated construction costs to realistically identify corridors. This method insures that our results reflect the expenses necessary for the construction of greenways. Our study demonstrates that the kernel density method is an effective tool to illustrate priorities by revealing the potential utilisation intensity of corridors. Based on the proposed method, we identify eight potential greenway networks, each highlighting different sets of priorities. We divide these priority greenway networks into three categories of ecological security: ideal greenways, backbone greenways and the comprehensive greenway network. The latter represents the integration of animal conservation, human recreation and water protection objectives. Because priorities can be added, interchanged or weighted according to local specificities, our study offers a methodological framework applicable to developing and developed cities.

AB  - Anthropogenic habitat disturbance is fundamentally altering patterns of disease transmission and immunity across the vertebrate tree of life. Most studies linking anthropogenic habitat change and disease focus on habitat loss and fragmentation, but these processes often lead to a third process that is equally important: habitat split. Defined as spatial separation between the multiple classes of natural habitat that many vertebrate species require to complete their life cycles, habitat split has been linked to population declines in vertebrates, e.g. amphibians breeding in lowland aquatic habitats and overwintering in fragments of upland terrestrial vegetation. Here, we link habitat split to enhanced disease risk in amphibians (i) by reviewing the biotic and abiotic forces shaping elements of immunity and (ii) through a spatially oriented field study focused on tropical frogs. We propose a framework to investigate mechanisms by which habitat split influences disease risk in amphibians, focusing on three broad host factors linked to immunity: (i) composition of symbiotic microbial communities, (ii) immunogenetic variation, and (iii) stress hormone levels. Our review highlights the potential for habitat split to contribute to host-associated microbiome dysbiosis, reductions in immunogenetic repertoire, and chronic stress, that often facilitate pathogenic infections and disease in amphibians and other classes of vertebrates. We highlight that targeted habitat-restoration strategies aiming to connect multiple classes of natural habitats (e.g. terrestrial-freshwater, terrestrial-marine, marine-freshwater) could enhance priming of the vertebrate immune system through repeated low-load exposure to enzootic pathogens and reduced stress-induced immunosuppression.

AB  - During the past 50 years, there have been strong demands for establishing the North and South Green Network and its eco-corridors to resolve problems of urbanization in Seoul. Following this, from 1994, the Seoul City Government began building ecological paths to re-establish ecological networks. 25 ecocorridors were created between 1994 and 2013 in Seoul, however, the designed eco-corridors presented some problems with biased functions, losing a major objective of eco-corridors which are required to perform as both a citizens' moving route as well as wildlife passage. In addition, eco-corridors in Seoul, a heavily populated city, are not likely to serve the originally intended functions as well as those in natural areas. Accordingly, to appropriately perform its own function as a moving route for humans and wildlife, ecocorridors in urban areas are required to be comprehensively analysed with consideration of both ecological and pedestrian aspects. Study sites have been selected from the green zone of the Gangnam area. Specifically, it includes Seodal-ro, Sadang-ro, Solbat-ro, and Nambusoonhwan-ro, which form a linking footpath between Seodal mountain neighborhood park, Gachi mountain and Gwanak mountain. This study is to examine some issues of the selected urban eco-corridors, which are supposed to act as moving routes for both humans and animals through analysis of the current situation and usebehavior survey of eco-bridges in Seoul, and to interpret the meaning of ecocorridors in urban areas. Through the results of user behavior analysis of four eco-bridges, on one hand, it is found that the appearance frequency of wild animals is very low and species diversity is quite limited. On the other hand, the frequency of human utilization is very high and the purposes of utilization are varied. As known from these results, eco-bridges in Seoul could have more functions and meanings, not only concentrating on the function as a wildlife passage. This study offers the insight that eco-bridges in Seoul could be considered in a broader sense, focusing on human use rather than focusing on their ecological function in a narrow sense.

AB  - Ecosystem service values have rarely been incorporated in the process of planning ecological infrastructure for urban areas. Urban ecological infrastructure is a network system of natural lands and waters that provides ecosystem services. The purpose of this study was to design landscape corridors that maximize the value of ecosystem services in ecological infrastructure planning. We explored the optimal corridors to enhance the connectivity among landscape elements to design an ecological infrastructure for the city of Gwacheon, South Korea, as an example of a small urban area. We calculated the value of ecosystem services using standardized estimation indices based on an intensive review of the relevant literature and employed the least-cost path method to optimize the connectivity of landscape structural elements. The land use type in the city with the highest estimated value of ecosystem services was the riparian zone (i.e., 2011 US$7,312.16/ha). Given areal coverage of all land use types, the estimated value of developed area open spaces was 2011 US$899,803.25, corresponding to the highest contribution to the total value of ecosystem services. Therefore, the optimal configured dispersal corridors for wildlife were found from the riparian zones (source area) to the developed area open spaces (destination area) in the city. Several challenges remain for improving the estimation of the value of ecosystem services and incorporating these ecosystems in ecological infrastructure planning. Nonetheless, the approaches taken to estimate the value of ecosystem services and design landscape corridors in this study may be of value to future efforts in urban ecological infrastructure planning.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Island environments of the Southwest Pacific, like New Caledonia, generally present poorly diversified bee fauna. Thus, they are particularly prone to the establishment of introduced bee species. These exotic species may compete with native bees for plant resources, disrupt pollination of native plants, and enhance the reproduction of exotic ones. To conserve local plant-pollinator interactions, it is essential to assess the factors favoring the presence and the activity of exotic bees. Here, we focused on the effects of urbanization on plant-pollinator interactions. We set up experimental plant communities composed of four exotic species in two contrasted habitats-a natural environment vs. an urban environment-and observed plant-pollinator interactions. We showed that the urban environment was largely dominated by exotic bees. We also showed that some exotic bee species can interact preferentially with a single exotic ornamental plant species. Overall, our results indicate that Noumea is an entry point for exotic bees, which should encourage local authorities to maintain biosecurity measures to effectively limit the arrival of exogenous bees. Lastly, the use of exotic horticultural plants in green public spaces should be questioned regarding their potential attractiveness to exotic bees.
   Land-use changes through urbanization and biological invasions both threaten plant-pollinator networks. Urban areas host modified bee communities and are characterized by high proportions of exotic plants. Exotic species, either animals or plants, may compete with native species and disrupt plant-pollinator interactions. These threats are heightened in insular systems of the Southwest Pacific, where the bee fauna is generally poor and ecological networks are simplified. However, the impacts of these factors have seldom been studied in tropical contexts. To explore those questions, we installed experimental exotic plant communities in urban and natural contexts in New Caledonia, a plant diversity hotspot. For four weeks, we observed plant-pollinator interactions between local pollinators and our experimental exotic plant communities. We found a significantly higher foraging activity of exotic wild bees within the city, together with a strong plant-pollinator association between two exotic species. However, contrary to our expectations, the landscape context (urban vs. natural) had no effect on the activity of native bees. These results raise issues concerning how species introduced in plant-pollinator networks will impact the reproductive success of both native and exotic plants. Furthermore, the urban system could act as a springboard for alien species to disperse in natural systems and even invade them, leading to conservation concerns.

AB  - Placing invasion in a more complete food web context expands our understanding of species invasions to reflect the inherent complexity of ecological networks. Garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) has traditionally been predicted to dominate native communities through mechanisms embodied in popular hypotheses such as direct plant-plant interactions (allelopathy) and plant-herbivore interactions (enemy escape). However, garlic mustard also interacts directly with native predators by providing habitat for web-building spiders, which colonize the dry fruit structures (siliques) that garlic mustard leaves behind after it senesces. This interaction may lead to altered food web structure, resulting previously unexamined invasion consequences. This idea was tested in a field experiment including three treatments in which garlic mustard siliques were left intact (S+), removed (S-), or native species dominated and garlic mustard was absent (N). When siliques were intact, estimated insect abundance was locally reduced in invaded plots compared to native plots, but this relationship disappeared when siliques were removed. Phosphorus availability and the growth of one native plant species were both elevated in invaded plots where siliques were intact compared to plots where siliques were removed. Results indicate that garlic mustard's close association with web-building spiders initiates cascading invader impacts on the native community and ecosystem properties. This work supports recent theory suggesting that taking a broader food web perspective may help predict invasion impacts in different environmental contexts.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a major threat to the viability of wildlife populations and the maintenance of biodiversity. Fragmentation relates to the sub-division of habitat into disjunct patches. Usually coincident with fragmentation per se is loss of habitat, a reduction in the size of the remnant patches, and increasing distance between patches. Natural and anthropogenic processes leading to habitat fragmentation occur at many spatial scales, and their impacts on wildlife depend on the scales at which species interact with the landscape. The concept of functional connectivity captures this organism-based view of the relative ease of movement or degree of exchange between physically disjunct habitat patches. Functional connectivity of a given habitat arrangement for a given wildlife species depends on details of the organism's life history and behavioral ecology, but, for broad categories of species, quantities such as home range size and dispersal distance scale allometrically with body mass. These relationships can be incorporated into spatial analyses of functional connectivity, which can be quantified by indices or displayed graphically in maps. We review indices and GIS-based approaches to estimating functional connectivity, presenting examples from the literature and our own work on mammalian distributions. Such analyses can be readily incorporated within an ecological risk framework. Estimates of functional connectivity may be useful in a screening-level assessment of the impact of habitat fragmentation relative to other stressors, and may be crucial in detailed population modeling and viability analysis.

AB  - The physical and environmental attributes of landscapes often shape patterns of population connectivity by influencing dispersal and gene flow. Landscape effects on movement are typically evaluated for single species. However, inferences from multiple species are required for multi-species management strategies increasingly being applied in conservation. In this study, I compared the spatial genetic patterns of two amphibian species across the northeastern United States and estimated the influence of specific landscape features on the observed genetic structure. The spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) and wood frog (Rana sylvatica) share many ecological attributes related to habitat use, phenology and site fidelity. However, I hypothesized that important differences in their movement patterns and life history would create distinct genetic patterns for each species. Using 14 microsatellite loci, I tested for differences in the level of genetic differentiation between the two species across 22 breeding ponds. The effects of eight landscape features were also estimated by evaluating 32 landscape resistance models. Spotted salamanders exhibited significantly higher genetic differentiation than wood frogs. Different landscape features were also identified as potential drivers of the genetic patterns in each species, with little overlap in model support between species. Collectively, these results provide strong evidence that these two amphibian species interact with the landscape in measurably different ways. The distinct genetic patterns observed are consistent with key differences in movement ability and life history between A. maculatum and R. sylvatica. These results highlight the importance of considering more than one species when assessing the impacts of the landscape matrix on population connectivity, even for ecologically similar species within the same habitats.

AB  - The effects of calcium cyanamide on the soil fungal communities in successive tea-cuttings nursery soils were investigated based on Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The field experiment was carried out with three treatments, including control (CK), flooding (F) and calcium cyanamide (CC). The treatment with calcium cyanamide increased pH (similar to 1 unit) and reduced the accumulation of phenols (similar to 50%), available phosphorus (similar to 28%) and exchangeable Al (similar to 90%) significantly, and improved soil quality. The predominant phylum in all treatments was Ascomycota. FUNGuild revealed that the dominant trophic mode was saprotrophy in tea-cuttings nursery soil. Plant pathogens had a low abundance in the calcium cyanamide treatment. Alpha diversity analysis showed lower richness in the calcium cyanamide than the other treatments. Network analysis showed a poorly connected but highly modularized network in the calcium cyanamide treatment, with the crucial OTUs functions related to anti-pathogenicity. The results showed that calcium cyanamide should be recommended for improving long-term tea nurseries by increasing the survival rate of tea seedlings due to increasing soil pH value, reducing aluminum toxicity, decreasing the accumulation of polyphenols, diminishing pathogenic fungi and making the taxa related to anti-pathogenicity occupy a more important niche.

AB  - Forest cover in the upper Wabash River basin in Indiana was fragmented due to agricultural conversion beginning more than 175 years ago. Currently, urban expansion is an important driver of land-use change in the basin. A land transformation model was applied to the basin to forecast land use from 2000 to 2020. We assessed the effect of this projected land-use change scenario on five forest rodent species at three scales: using occupancy models at the patch level, proportional occupancy models at the landscape level, and ecologically scaled landscape indices to assess the change in connectivity at the watershed level. At the patch and landscape scales, occupancy models had low predictability but suggest that gray squirrels are most susceptible to land-use change. At the watershed scale, declines in connectivity did not correspond with the decline of forest. This study highlights the importance of map resolution and consideration of matrix elements in constructing forecast models. Unforeseen drivers of land use, such as changing economic incentives, may also have important ramifications.

AB  - As the global population urbanizes, dramatic changes are expected in city lighting and the urban form, which may threaten the functioning of urban ecosystems and the services they deliver. However, little is known about the ecological impact of lighting in different urban contexts. Movement is an important ecological process that can be disrupted by artificial lighting. We explored the impact of lighting on gap crossing for Pipistrellus pipistrellus, a species of bat (Chiroptera) common within UK cities. We aimed to determine whether the probability of crossing gaps in tree cover varied with crossing distance and lighting level, through stratified field surveys. We then used the resulting data on barrier thresholds to model the landscape resistance due to lighting across an entire city and explored the potential impact of scenarios for future changes to street lighting. The level of illumination required to create a barrier effect reduced as crossing distance increased. For those gaps where crossing was recorded, bats selected the darker parts of gaps. Heavily built parts of the case study city were associated with large and brightly lit gaps, and spatial models indicate movement would be highly restricted in these areas. Under a scenario for brighter street lighting, the area of accessible land cover was further reduced in heavily built parts of the city. We believe that this is the first study to demonstrate how lighting may create resistance to species movement throughout an entire city. That connectivity in urban areas is being disrupted for a relatively common species raises questions about the impacts on less tolerant groups and the resilience of bat communities in urban centres. However, this mechanistic approach raises the possibility that some ecological function could be restored in these areas through the strategic dimming of lighting and narrowing of gaps.

AB  - Aim Identifying how climate change, habitat loss, and corridors interact to influence species survival or extinction is critical to understanding macro-scale biodiversity dynamics under changing environments. In North America, the ice-free corridor was the only major pathway for northward migration by megafaunal species during the last deglaciation. However, the timing and interplay among the late Quaternary megafaunal extinctions, climate change, habitat structure, and the opening and reforestation of the ice-free corridor have been unclear.
   Location North America.
   Time period 15-10 ka.
   Major taxa studied Woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius).
   Methods For central North America and the ice-free corridor between 15 and 10 ka, we used a series of models and continental-scale datasets to reconstruct habitat characteristics and assess habitat suitability. The models and datasets include biophysical and statistical niche models Niche Mapper and Maxent, downscaled climate simulations from CCSM3 SynTraCE, LPJ-GUESS simulations of net primary productivity (NPP) and woody cover, and woody cover based upon fossil pollen from Neotoma.
   Results The ice-free corridor may have been of limited suitability for traversal by mammoths and other grazers due to persistently low productivity by herbaceous plants and quick reforestation after opening 14 ka. Simultaneously, rapid reforestation and decreased forage productivity may have led to declining habitat suitability in central North America. This was possibly amplified by a positive feedback loop driven by reduced herbivory pressures, as mammoth population decline led to the further loss of open habitat.
   Main conclusions Declining habitat availability south of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and limited habitat availability in the ice-free corridor were contributing factors in North American extinctions of woolly mammoths and other large grazers that likely operated synergistically with anthropogenic pressures. The role of habitat loss and attenuated corridor suitability for the woolly mammoth extinction reinforce the critical importance of protected habitat connectivity during changing climates, particularly for large vertebrates.

AB  - Assuming that co-distributed species are exposed to similar environmental conditions, ecological niche models (ENMs) of bird and plant species inhabiting tropical dry forests (TDFs) in Mexico were developed to evaluate future projections of their distribution for the years 2050 and 2070. We used ENM-based predictions and climatic data for two Global Climate Models, considering two Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCP4.5/RCP8.5). We also evaluated the effects of habitat loss and the importance of the Mexican system of protected areas (PAs) on the projected models for a more detailed prediction of TDFs and to identify hot spots that require conservation actions. We identified four major distributional areas: the main one located along the Pacific Coast (from Sonora to Chiapas, including the Cape and Bajio regions, and the Balsas river basin), and three isolated areas: the Yucatan peninsula, central Veracruz, and southern Tamaulipas. When considering the effect of habitat loss, a significant reduction (similar to 61%) of the TDFs predicted area occurred, whereas climate-change models suggested (in comparison with the present distribution model) an increase in area of 3.0-10.0% and 3.0-9.0% for 2050 and 2070, respectively. In future scenarios, TDFs will occupy areas above its current average elevational distribution that are outside of its present geographical range. Our findings show that TDFs may persist in Mexican territory until the middle of the XXI century; however, the challenges about long-term conservation are partially addressed (only 7% unaffected within the Mexican network of PAs) with the current Mexican PAs network. Based on our ENM approach, we suggest that a combination of models of species inhabiting present TDFs and taking into account change scenarios represent an invaluable tool to create new PAs and ecological corridors, as a response to the increasing levels of habitat destruction and the effects of climate change on this ecosystem.

AB  - Anthropogenic change, specifically urbanization, has lasting impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Past work has linked green space variables and socioeconomic characteristics with biodiversity in urban areas. Shrinking cities present an interesting case for studying biodiversity because many of these places have implemented demolition policies to remove vacant buildings from the landscape, which returns previously urbanized land back into a "natural" state. The objective of this study is to investigate the multifaceted relationship among urban green space, socioeconomic characteristics, demolition activities, and avian species richness in the shrinking city of Buffalo, NY. We first establish a baseline understanding of how social and ecological factors are related to avian species richness through generalized linear models (GLM) and then incorporate a variable characterizing demolition to understand how the process of demolition may be impacting species richness relative to other factors. Second, since our analysis relies on "citizen science" data from eBird, we aim to better understand the factors driving eBird participation in Buffalo through zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression models to test how social and ecological characteristics and demolition affect checklists submission across the city. Our findings suggested that demolition activities do not increase species richness in Buffalo, indicating these sites may not be returning to a natural state that is usable by birds. We also found that areas that have undergone considerable demolition may be a potential deterrent to eBird participation, and eBird users may create bias by sampling areas with greater green space connectivity, and thus higher richness.

AB  - Context. Urbanisation is one of the most damaging landscape-scale disturbance processes leading to significant and potentially irreversible changes in biodiversity. How apex predators respond to urbanisation is poorly understood, largely because of their low density and low detectability. Given the important functional roles of apex predators in ecosystems, it is critical that research investigates how they respond to urbanisation, and how urban systems can be designed to better support apex predators.
   Aims. The present research aims to examine how an avian apex predator, the powerful owl, responds to a complete urban-forest gradient in southern Victoria, Australia. Specifically, the research aims to understand the environmental attributes that drive habitat suitability for powerful owls across the urban-forest gradient.
   Methods. Using a total of 683 independent field-and atlas-derived records of powerful owls across the study site, the research takes a presence-only modelling approach. The presence points were modelled against a series of geospatial variables that were determined a priori on the basis of the known ecology of powerful owls.
   Key results. Potential powerful owl habitat declined in a dramatic fashion in response to increasing levels of urbanisation, ranging from 76% of the forest landscape to 21% of the urban landscape. Powerful owl habitat availability across the urban-forest gradient is positively influenced by tree cover, productivity (normalised difference vegetation index) and proximity to river systems and riparian vegetation.
   Conclusions. Presence-only modelling has provided a useful way for investigating the response of an apex predator to a gradient of urbanisation. Although powerful owl habitat availability is negatively reduced by urbanisation, there is significant scope to manage urban landscapes to either maintain or improve the availability of habitat across the gradient.
   Implications. High resource-requiring species, such as apex predators, have the capacity to be detrimentally affected by urbanisation processes. Presence-only modelling, however, provides a useful tool for investigating how these difficult-to-detect species are affected by urbanisation, and ultimately inform how landscapes can be managed to maximise habitat availability for apex predators.

AB  - We analyze the invasive potential of two Asian ambrosia beetles, Xyleborus glabratus and Euwallacea sp., into Mexico and the southern United States. The fungal symbionts of these beetles have been responsible for damage to trees of the family Lauraceae, including Persea americana and other noncultivated tree species on both coasts of the United States. We estimate their potential threat using ecological niche modeling and spatial multi-criteria evaluation protocols to incorporate plant and beetle suitabilities as well as forest stress factors across Mexico. Mexico contains higher climatic and habitat suitability for X. glabratus than for Euwallacea sp. Within this country, the neotropical region is most vulnerable to invasion by both of these species. We also identify a corridor of potential invasion for X. glabratus along the Gulf of Mexico coast where most Lauraceae and native Xyleborus species are present; dispersal of either X. glabratus or Euwallacea sp. into this region would likely lead to major disease spread. However, the overall potential damage that these beetles can cause may be a function of how many reproductive hosts and how many other ambrosia beetles are present, as well as of their capacity to disperse. This work can also alert relevant managers and authorities regarding this threat.

AB  - Functional connectivity is essential to maintaining biodiversity in fragmented landscapes but little attention has been given to structures that can provide it in an urban context. Using both the taxonomic and functional diversity of semi-natural grassland plant communities, we assessed the functional connectivity of linear transportation infrastructures in urban landscape. We sampled the vegetation at 71 study sites located along the edges of two railway lines. We hypothesised that if railways favour functional connectivity, then spatially connected communities should be more similar than disconnected communities. Therefore, we compared floristic dissimilarities between site pairs that were either connected or separated by a railway spatial break (overpass or station). As a further approach, we supposed that functional connectivity may attenuate the effect of urbanisation filters on plant communities. Thus we examined whether and how edges' plant communities were influenced by urbanisation and compared our results to the patterns described in the literature. Functional connectivity was mainly maintained at railway stations, contrary to overpasses, which seemed to interrupt dispersal, demonstrating that railway edges provide connectivity for some but not all functional groups: this was only true for moderately mobile species. Surprisingly, railway edges did not seem to play an additional connective function for invasive species, the presence of which being strongly related to the urbanisation intensity and not influenced by spatial breaks along railways. Our study thus highlights the potential function of railway edges as corridors for common grassland plants. Landscape managers should include railways in green networks to improve connectivity in urban landscapes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The impacts of urban growth on biodiversity vary according to the form and the intensity of urbanisation. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the consequences of the type of urban structure (e.g. mono centric vs polycentric), the shape of urban boundaries, the local density of residential development, on the habitats of wildlife species. In this context, this paper focuses on the relationship between forms of urbanisation and functional connectivity of ecological habitats. In the urban region of Besancon (eastern France), three emblematic protected species were selected to represent forest mammals. From the initial state describing current land cover, five prospective residential development scenarios were simulated, corresponding to the form currently most commonly found (e.g. compact development, transit-oriented development, polycentric development). For each scenario, we also simulate the volume of traffic on the road network to allow for the barrier effect of roads on habitat connectivity. Then, for each development scenario, we model the functional connectivity of habitats of the various target species using landscape graphs. Results show that compact city maintains more functional connectivity for all the species considered whereas urban sprawl leads to much more marked impacts. Moderately compact and regulated periurban scenarios have intermediate levels of impact. The transit-oriented development scenario produces specific impact values according to the species. An interesting point is that the decline in functional connectivity of forest habitats is more due to increased traffic than residential development proper. This outlines the relevance of integrated models for simulating both land use and transport at a fine scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We evaluated the effect of habitat and landscape characteristics on the population genetic structure of the white-footed mouse. We develop a new approach that uses numerical optimization to define a model that combines site differences and landscape resistance to explain the genetic differentiation between mouse populations inhabiting forest patches in southern Quebec. We used ecological distance computed from resistance surfaces with Circuitscape to infer the effect of the landscape matrix on gene flow. We calculated site differences using a site index of habitat characteristics. A model that combined site differences and resistance distances explained a high proportion of the variance in genetic differentiation and outperformed models that used geographical distance alone. Urban and agriculture-related land uses were, respectively, the most and the least resistant landscape features influencing gene flow. Our method detected the effect of rivers and highways as highly resistant linear barriers. The density of grass and shrubs on the ground best explained the variation in the site index of habitat characteristics. Our model indicates that movement of white-footed mouse in this region is constrained along routes of low resistance. Our approach can generate models that may improve predictions of future northward range expansion of this small mammal.

AB  - Identification of trait syndromes that make species vulnerable to habitat fragmentation is essential in predicting biodiversity change. Plants are considered particularly vulnerable if their capacities for persistence in and for dispersal among local habitats are low. Here we investigated the influence of easily measured functional traits on the presence of 45 plant species in an urban landscape in north-west Germany where patches were separated by distances consistent with regular plant dispersal range. To describe the spatial configuration of patches we calculated species-specific patch connectivities. Then we assessed plant connectivity responses in distribution models calculated from connectivities and environmental predictors. Twenty (45%) of the analysed species showed a positive connectivity response after accounting for species-specific habitat requirements. These species differed from non-responsive species by functional traits associated with dispersal, including reduced seed numbers and higher terminal velocities relative to non-responsive species. Persistence traits played however no role which we attribute to the environmental conditions of urban habitats and their spatiotemporal characteristics. Our study underlines that even ruderal plants experience dispersal limitation and demonstrates that easily measured functional traits may be used as indicators of fragmentation vulnerability in urban systems allowing generalizations to larger species sets.

AB  - The number and extent of human settlements around the world are increasing as the human population grows and people move from rural to urban areas. The decline and ultimately the local extinction of many indigenous species from a range of taxonomic groups within urbanised areas is a recurring theme from cities around the world. However, determining whether a species has become extinct can be difficult because sufficient survey effort may be too costly and expert opinion may involve considerable subjective bias. In this study, we compared the results of four quantitative assessments of the probability of persistence of indigenous mammals within Melbourne, Australia. Our comparisons were methodological, taxonomic and spatial. Less than half (26) of the original 54 species that occurred in Melbourne prior to European settlement have a greater than 95% probability of being extant at the end of 2000. Mammals occurring in local government areas (LGAs) within 10 kin of the central business district of Melbourne were less likely to be extant, with 29% of species having a greater than 95% probability of persisting, compared to 48% in the outer LGAs. The group of species most negatively affected by urbanisation were the small, ground-dwelling mammals, with just two out of 15 species having a greater than 10% probability of persisting. All four methods gave broadly similar results, with the Bayesian approach consistently suggesting higher probabilities of species persistence. The decline in the number of species is likely to continue with the ongoing expansion of Melbourne. The greatest opportunity to conserve the maximum number of species of mammal within Melbourne is in the outer LGAs where they remain extant. We recommend that state and local governments design and adopt a comprehensive strategy for managing habitat networks that cross jurisdictional boundaries and encompass the greater Melbourne area to enhance prospects for the survival of mammals.

AB  - Drylands range across more than half of the global terrestrial area and harbour about a quarter of continental vertebrate species, many of them endemic. However, this fauna is being increasingly threatened, in particular the one that inhabits deserts, one of the last biomes on earth. This work tracks the most relevant global change drivers acting on drylands, especially in deserts and arid regions, the conservation actions being developed, and the research needs for vertebrate conservation, following IUCN standardised classification schemes. Using the Sahara-Sahel wetlands as case study, it is provided a detailed examination of these aspects to support regional biodiversity conservation and human welfare. Deserts and arid regions are threatened by the synergistic effects of increasing development of urban areas, agriculture, energy production, mining, transportation and service corridors, resulting in pollution, invasive species, human intrusions and disturbance, biological resource overuse and in general, natural system modifications. In addition, climate change together with social underdevelopment of many desert-range countries places the mitigation of threat factors in a large and complex web of global-local societal challenges. Conservation actions targeting land/water and species protection and management, as well as education, awareness, capacity building, and legislation measures to increase livelihood development, are being developed. Additional research efforts are need to enhance biodiversity conservation planning, monitoring biodiversity and land-degradation status (based on Essential Biodiversity Variables), and quantification of socioeconomic factors associated with sustainable use of natural resources and human development. Sahara-Sahel wetlands are important life-support systems for both humans and vertebrates, the last vulnerable to listed global threats. They offer framework scenario to revert current environmental and societal challenges in deserts. Long-term conservation of desert vertebrate biodiversity requires appropriate policy instruments to promote sustainable use of natural resources. Raising environmental alertness within local communities of uniqueness of desert biodiversity is needed to promote policy change.

AB  - More than two-thirds of cropland in the United States is devoted to the production of just four crop species-maize, wheat, soybeans, and cotton-raising concerns that homogenization of the American agricultural landscape could facilitate widespread disease and pest outbreaks, compromising the national food supply. As a new component in national agricultural risk assessment, we employed a graph-theoretic approach to examine the connectivity of these crops across the United States. We used county crop acreage to evaluate the landscape resistance to transrnission-the degree to which host availability limits spread in any given region-for pests or pathogens dependent on each crop. For organisms that cats disperse under conditions of lower host availability, maize and soybean are highly connected at a national scale, compared with the more discrete regions of wheat and cotton production. Determining the scales at which connectivity becomes disrupted for organisms with different dispersal abilities may help target rapid-response regions and the development of strategic policies to enhance agricultural landscape heterogeneity.

AB  - Landscape changes due to urban expansion may severely influence urban biodiversity through direct and indirect effects. Hence, a comprehensive understanding of the urban expansion effects on species diversity is essential for conservation biologists, urban planners, and policymakers to help design more practical and effective conservation strategies. Here, based on monthly bird survey data of 12 university campuses distributed in the center and the Xianlin university town of Nanjing city, we first compared the differences of the campuses bird species richness, Shannon-Wiener, and Simpson indices. Then, we analyzed the effects of a variety of landscape attributes on the campuses bird species richness. Unlike other studies, we also constructed a 2 km buffer area surrounding each campus and analyzed the effects of the landscape attributes of the buffer area on species richness. We found that bird species richness was higher in the campus of Xianlin compared to those in the center. Landscape attributes played an important role on bird species richness, especially for the determinants in the buffer area. Specifically, species richness, Shannon-Wiener, and Simpson indices increased with the increasing area of water and green space both within the campus and the buffer area. Not surprisingly, bird species richness and diversity were more affected by fragmentation of the buffer area, increasing with the aggregation index and decreasing with the splitting index. Our study emphasized that landscape attributes of both campuses and buffer areas determined bird species richness and diversity, offering several practical implications for urban biodiversity maintenance and eco-friendly urban planning.

AB  - Urbanisation is one of the most pervasive agents of contemporary landscape change globally. Rapid land use change and competing land uses pose multiple challenges for biodiversity conservation, particularly in periurban fringe areas where suburban development encroaches into natural habitats. The quenda (Isoodon fusci-venter) is one of the very few ground-dwelling critical weight range mammals to persist in the peri-urban fringe of the rapidly expanding city of Perth, Australia. We investigated the genetic connectivity of 42 populations of quenda across the Greater Perth metropolitan region using microsatellites and generalised dissimilarity modelling to evaluate the impact of landscape elements on functional connectivity. Spatially-explicit Bayesian cluster analysis indicated quenda exhibit significant population structure across the Perth region, which, at the broadest scale, was associated with hydrological and topographical features. Inter-population genetic connectivity was facilitated by the presence of native vegetation, particularly low vegetation (< 1.4 m height) that is the species' preferred habitat. Surprisingly, measures of urbanisation were not significant predictors of gene flow, potentially as quenda show some characteristics of urban utilizers. Given the rapid pace of development in the region, knowledge on the distribution and population structure of quenda, and understanding the processes that contribute to them, provides a basis for a landscape conservation approach to urban planning. Retention of suitable habitat that facilitates persistence of this important mammal is critical.

AB  - The planning, implementation, and everyday use of the built environment interweave the green and grey components of urban fabric tightly together. Runoff from grey and impermeable surfaces causes stormwater that is managed in permeable surfaces that simultaneously act as habitats for vegetation. Green infrastructure (GI) is one of the concepts that is used to perceive, manage, and guide the components of urban green spaces. Furthermore, GI pays special attention to stormwater management and urban vegetation at several scales at the same time. This study concentrated on scalable GI in domestic private gardens. A set of garden designs in Vuores, Finland were analyzed and developed by Research by Design. The aim was to study how garden scale choices and designs can enhance GI at the block and neighbourhood scales to rethink design practices to better integrate water and vegetation throughout the scales. As a result, we propose a checklist for designers and urban planners that ensures vegetation-integrated stormwater management to enhance habitat diversity in block scale and possibility to use blocks of private plots for ecological networks. The prerequisite for garden designers is to be capable to balance between water, vegetation, and soil, and their processes and flows in detail the scale.

AB  - Parks, remnants of natural habitats and other green areas are important for preserving biodiversity in urban areas. Here, we investigate the relative importance of habitat type and connectivity for butterfly species richness in the city of Malmo, Sweden. Further, we compare species richness and composition in the urban habitats with that in the surrounding agricultural landscape using previously published data. Both butterfly species richness and density increased with decreasing connectivity, measured as the proportion of urban green areas within I km, and were higher in ruderal sites than in traditional and semi-natural parks. Species richness was only slightly lower in the urban habitats than in semi-natural grassland remnants in the agricultural landscape surrounding the city and there was only a small difference in (between site) diversity between urban and semi-natural landscapes. This study highlights the importance of "townscape" composition for species richness in urban habitats but also, demonstrates clearly that urban habitats, especially those characterized by an early-successional stage, can be of relatively high conservation value in regions dominated by intensive human land use.

AB  - Urban green space structure and pattern have been one of the highlights in Landscape Architecture studies, accompanying with urgent demands of promoting ecological spatial structures in urban construction. Focusing on functional connectivity and construction strategies of the structure of green space network in Haidian District of Beijing, this research builds resistance surface and identifies linkages through habitat quality evaluation of the InVEST Model and the simulation with the Least-Cost Model, while adopting functional connectivity index (NL, NC, IIC, PC, and dIIL) to indicate the structural characteristics of green space network at varied distance thresholds. Results reveal that, on the whole, the distance threshold of 2,200 meters is most appropriate for the structure of the existing green space network of Haidian District, when 10 components and 353 linkages are identified and six important nodes and three important linkages that require a protection priority are further determined. Findings also disclose that the forest network of target tree species and that of water network of target water bird species are highly fragmented. Forest network serves in forms of dominant patch structure, local network structure, and fragmented cluster structure in the western mountainous area, the northern plain area, and the southeastern urban area, respectively. Moreover, the research proves that by introducing ten important linkages, the connectivity of forest network can be improved by 1.7 times, completing the overall structure in multiple directions and helping form a stable and resilient structure of the network. Finally, the research puts forward strategies for urban green space construction, including identifying construction objectives and target species, identifying and protecting important nodes and important linkages, and introducing possible important linkages and improving the structure of green space network, to help efficiently improve urban ecological quality.

AB  - Explicit characterisation of the complexity of urban landscapes is critical for understanding patterns of biodiversity and for detecting the underlying social and ecological processes that shape them. Urban environments exhibit variable heterogeneity and connectivity, influenced by different historical contingencies, that affect community assembly across scales. The multidimensional nature of urban disturbance and co-occurrence of multiple stressors can cause synergistic effects leading to nonlinear responses in populations and communities. Yet, current research design of urban ecology and evolutionary studies typically relies on simple representation of the parameter space that can be observed. Sampling approaches apply simple urban gradients such as linear transects in space or comparisons of urban sites across the urban mosaic accounting for a few variables. This rarely considers multiple dimensions and scales of biodiversity, and proves to be inadequate to explain observed patterns. We apply a multidimensional approach that integrates distinctive social, ecological and built characteristics of urban landscapes, representing variations along dimensions of heterogeneity, connectivity and historical contingency. Measuring species richness and beta diversity across 100 US metropolitan areas at the city and 1-km scales, we show that distinctive signatures of urban biodiversity can result from interactions between socioecological heterogeneity and connectivity, mediated by historical contingency.

AB  - Understanding varying levels of biodiversity within cities is pivotal to protect it in the face of global urbanisation. In the early stages of urban ecology studies on intra-urban biodiversity focused on the urban-rural gradient, representing a broad generalisation of features of the urban landscape. Increasingly, studies classify the urban landscape in more detail, quantifying separately the effects of individual urban features on biodiversity levels. However, while separate factors influencing biodiversity variation among cities worldwide have recently been analysed, a global analysis on the factors influencing biodiversity levels within cities is still lacking. We here present the first meta-analysis on intra-urban biodiversity variation across a large variety of taxonomic groups of 75 cities worldwide. Our results show that patch area and corridors have the strongest positive effects on biodiversity, complemented by vegetation structure. Local, biotic and management habitat variables were significantly more important than landscape, abiotic or design variables. Large sites greater than 50ha are necessary to prevent a rapid loss of area-sensitive species. This indicates that, despite positive impacts of biodiversity-friendly management, increasing the area of habitat patches and creating a network of corridors is the most important strategy to maintain high levels of urban biodiversity.

AB  - Context Landscape connectivity is assumed to influence ecosystem service (ES) trade-offs and synergies. However, empirical studies of the effect of landscape connectivity on ES trade-offs and synergies are limited, especially in urban areas where the interactions between patterns and processes are complex. Objectives The objectives of this study were to use a Bayesian Belief Network approach to (1) assess whether functional connectivity drives ES trade-offs and synergies in urban areas and (2) assess the influence of connectivity on the supply of ESs. Methods We used circuit theory to model urban bird flow of P. major and C. caeruleus at a 2 m spatial resolution in Bedford, Luton and Milton Keynes, UK, and Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to assess the sensitivity of ES trade-offs and synergies model outputs to landscape and patch structural characteristics (patch area, connectivity and bird species abundance). Results We found that functional connectivity was the most influential variable in determining two of three ES trade-offs and synergies. Patch area and connectivity exerted a strong influence on ES trade-offs and synergies. Low patch area and low to moderately low connectivity were associated with high levels of ES trade-offs and synergies. Conclusions This study demonstrates that landscape connectivity is an influential determinant of ES trade-offs and synergies and supports the conviction that larger and better-connected habitat patches increase ES provision. A BBN approach is proposed as a feasible method of ES trade-off and synergy prediction in complex landscapes. Our findings can prove to be informative for urban ES management.

AB  - The persistence of pond-breeding amphibian populations is influenced on different spatial scales ranging from the individual breeding pond to surrounding habitat patches to landscape clusters of breeding pond populations. The connectivity among breeding ponds as well as the availability of suitable terrestrial habitats surrounding the ponds plays a major role in long-term viability of amphibian species. Besides road traffic and urban structures agricultural land activity can disrupt landscape connectivity through the use of pesticides, fertilizers and physical activity such as tillage. We developed an expert-based model to assess the impact of agricultural management measures on the migration area and terrestrial habitat availability for seven amphibian species. The model is based on a Habitat Suitability Index to identify suitable terrestrial habitats and includes a landscape permeability approach. Size of migration areas, connectivity of breeding ponds and number of reachable terrestrial habitats were modeled considering species-specific migration ranges and habitat preferences. We consider how pesticides application might lead to fragmentation and isolation of amphibian breeding pond populations. Therefore the potential disrupting impact of pesticides was simulated by inflating landscape resistance to medium and high migration cost. One amphibian species showed a decrease of migration area by 48.3% and a decrease of reachable terrestrial habitats by 41.5% at high migration costs. Three additional species showed a decrease of their migration areas between 31.5 and 35.7%. At increased migration cost, some of the investigated populations were isolated at breeding pond level or restricted to pond clusters. Our model could be used to prioritize conservation efforts for pond-breeding amphibians with adequate consideration of agricultural land use and its impact on amphibian migration.

AB  - Background
   Bacillus cereus biovar anthracis (Bcbva) is an emergent bacterium closely related to Bacillus anthracis, the etiological agent of anthrax. The latter has a worldwide distribution and usually causes infectious disease in mammals associated with savanna ecosystems. Bcbva was identified in humid tropical forests of Cote d'Ivoire in 2001. Here, we characterize the potential geographic distributions of Bcbva in West Africa and B. anthracis in sub-Saharan Africa using an ecological niche modeling approach.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Georeferenced occurrence data for B. anthracis and Bcbva were obtained from public data repositories and the scientific literature. Combinations of temperature, humidity, vegetation greenness, and soils values served as environmental variables in model calibrations. To predict the potential distribution of suitable environments for each pathogen across the study region, parameter values derived from the median of 10 replicates of the best-performing model for each pathogen were used. We found suitable environments predicted for B. anthracis across areas of confirmed and suspected anthrax activity in sub-Saharan Africa, including an east-west corridor from Ethiopia to Sierra Leone in the Sahel region and multiple areas in eastern, central, and southern Africa. The study area for Bcbva was restricted to West and Central Africa to reflect areas that have likely been accessible to Bcbva by dispersal. Model predicted values indicated potential suitable environments within humid forested environments. Background similarity tests in geographic space indicated statistical support to reject the null hypothesis of similarity when comparing environments associated with B. anthracis to those of Bcbva and when comparing humidity values and soils values individually. We failed to reject the null hypothesis of similarity when comparing environments associated with Bcbva to those of B. anthracis, suggesting that additional investigation is needed to provide a more robust characterization of the Bcbva niche.
   Author summary
   Bacillus cereus biovar anthracis (Bcbva) is an emergent pathogen causing anthrax in West and Central African countries. It shares multiple bacteriological and genomic characteristics with Bacillus anthracis, the gram-positive bacterium causing anthrax in mammals worldwide. However, Bcbva has only been isolated in tropical humid forested environments in Africa; thus, we attempted to characterize its potential distribution and the differences with B. anthracis using an ecological niche modeling framework. According to our results, both pathogens are using different environments and their distribution looks complementary with B. anthracis occupying savanna-like environments and Bcbva occupying forested areas; further, we detected some level of overlap between the potential geographic distributions of B. anthracis and Bcbva, despite their lack of overlap in their current environmental space. This is the first time the potential distribution of Bcbva is addressed considering all the available spatial information on the pathogen occurrence available as of 2017. Although our Bcbva models are limited due to sample size, this exploration informs on areas that would likely be considered for further investigation of Bcbva outbreaks with special emphasis on areas where Bcbva and B. anthracis could co-exist.

AB  - The City Biodiversity Index (CBI), or Singapore Index on Cities' Biodiversity, serves as a tool to monitor biodiversity in cities and was endorsed by the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2009. Indicator 2 of the CBI measures the connectivity of natural areas in cities. We propose an improved and straightforward method for measuring connectivity based on the effective mesh size metric to replace the previous method used in the CBI. The previous version did not account for intra-patch (within-patch) connectivity nor for major barriers. Our evaluation of the new version of Indicator 2 through its application to Montreal and Lisbon confirmed its reliability. In Montreal, natural areas have a total connectivity value of 581.7 ha, the majority of which exists between, rather than within, patches of natural area. Smaller patches (<15 ha) contribute significantly to overall connectivity, which may have implications for future conservation efforts. In Lisbon, connectivity (342 ha) is concentrated within patches. We also applied the improved Indicator 2 to a case study in southwestern Montreal, where a greenway network ("green infrastructure") has been proposed by a local community organization. We assessed the contribution of Meadowbrook Golf Course to connectivity in scenarios of the proposed greenway network and the effect that residential development would have. Not only would this development eliminate the golf course's current contribution to connectivity, but also its much greater potential contribution to connectivity in future scenarios. Restoring and establishing additional natural areas would significantly increase connectivity in the network. Our results demonstrate that the improved version of Indicator 2 is a suitable method in the CBI. It is equally useful for identifying options to increase the connectivity of natural areas within cities in the future and for determining the impacts of urban development on connectivity. More advanced methods for quantifying connectivity exist and may also be included in Part I of the CBI. However, they are often challenging to use and this frequently discourages city planners from including any indicator of connectivity in their biodiversity monitoring. The connectivity metric presented here overcomes this problem through its practicality in a wide range of planning structures while still generating meaningful results which may then inspire city planners to move towards using more advanced methods of measuring connectivity. We dedicate this paper to the memory of Bernice Goldsmith (1934-2014). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban forestry tries to connect the concept of forest ecosystem with the idea of nature preservation as well as with social needs of urban society, often living close to such a natural environment, thus being a part of it. The ability to connect the human need for the natural environment with life support system of persistent forest ecosystem should become an important contributing factor of urban forestry for well-being of urban society.
   In the range of 1 km walking distance around the city of Ljubljana and within urban areas of the city, forests comprise more than one quarter of the area. The most prevalent in the area are patches of forest fragments, estimated to have a shallow depth of the inner environment. The concept of urban forests in the Ljubljana Green System as a backbone of a green network has been confirmed especially by the two largest forest patches of Golovec and Roznik, indented as a part of forest matrix up to the city centre. Based on the analysis of the continuum of these forests, it was possible to assume that in the past, more than three quarters of forest grounds were meant for no other land use. In the other quarter of the city and its Green System, forests were more significantly reduced in the past, given the fact that we can estimate its continuum only for one half of today's area.
   On a detailed level, it is recommended for the urban forests to contain a significant percentage of trees and other species that would naturally appear on the sites of the area. Whereas on a landscape level, it is not enough to address only such species, but also temporal stability of forest patches, corridors or even forest matrix in urban areas and its urban-rural gradient into suburban areas.

AB  - As urban areas expand, understanding how ecological processes function in cities has become increasingly important for conserving biodiversity. Urban green spaces are critical habitats to support biodiversity, but we still have a limited understanding of their ecology and how they function to conserve biodiversity at local and landscape scales across multiple taxa. Given this limited view, we discuss five key questions that need to be addressed to advance the ecology of urban green spaces for biodiversity conservation and restoration. Specifically, we discuss the need for research to understand how green space size, connectedness, and type influence the community, population, and life-history dynamics of multiple taxa in cities. A research framework based in landscape and metapopulation ecology will allow for a greater understanding of the ecological function of green spaces and thus allow for planning and management of green spaces to conserve biodiversity and aid in restoration activities.

AB  - Assessment of landscape functional connectivity is increasingly important for planning landscape scale conservation measures. However, measuring the functional connectivity of landscapes is challenging due to the lack of data on species landscape interactions and because connectivity is species-specific. We developed parameters for a connectivity indicator using Delphi analysis, and critically examine the use of Delphi analysis in this context. To calculate the connectivity indicator we used the following parameters: maximum dispersal distance, negative edge effects of different land cover, and relative permeability of different land cover.
   Delphi is a technique designed to numerically synthesise expert opinion in data-poor environments and is based on repetitive questionnaires interspersed with controlled feedback. Three panels of experts were assembled, one covering each of three habitats of interest. Experts found the process challenging especially fixing exact numbers given the potential range of values. However, panels generally assigned higher permeability and low edge effects to semi-natural land cover classes, assigning low permeability and high edge impacts to more modified land cover. During the Delphi process we found that experts were prepared to alter their answers in response to feedback from the previous round. Participants' answers which did change between rounds generally changed to approach the group median, and when they did, the associated confidence score was more likely to rise than to fall. After three rounds, answers were generally stable. Delphi proved a useful method to use to generate parameter values for the connectivity indicator, with the method particularly acceptable to stakeholders of the indicator project.

AB  - Context The rapid urban expansion in southern coastal regions of China can endanger the quality and connectivity of bird habits and thus challenge our capacity for protecting bird species in urban areas. Identifying the ecological corridors that allow migratory birds to and from urban green landscapes is therefore essential for conserving biodiversity in urban areas. Objectives This study aimed to explore how urban expansion in vertical direction affects the flying paths of migratory birds and seek measurements to enhance bird migration to and from urban areas. Methods The ecological security pattern (ESP) for migratory birds in a coastal region near the Shenzhen city of China was determined based on three-dimensional landscape data and results were evaluated against historical eBird record abundance data. Results The positive agreement with historical bird abundance demonstrated that the consideration of three-dimensional landscape in parameterizing the resistance for ESPs can help identify the flight corridors for migratory birds in urban areas and the consequent sixteen key flight corridors with a total length of 454.78 km were identified in and around the Shenzhen city. Conclusions The three-dimensional landscape data are essential for identifying flight corridors for migratory birds to and from urban landscapes. The extracted flight corridors in and around the Shenzhen city connected natural reserves with urban parks, thereby enlarging bird habitats and its conservation inside the Shenzhen city.

AB  - Background: As urban areas expand, scientists now agree that the city is an important space for biodiversity conservation. Yet, still relatively little is known about how urban forms could have a differential impact on terrestrial species and ecosystems. If some reviews have been conducted to examine the link between biodiversity and urban characteristics at an infra-city scale, none have explored the relationship between urban organization and biodiversity and tried to assess the capacity of various urban forms to maintain and possibly favour flora and fauna in the city. The resulting map will present the state of knowledge regarding possible relationships between urban forms and its features on the establishment and settlement of terrestrial and temperate biodiversity at infra-city scale in western cities.
   Methods: The systematic map will follow the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence (CEE) Guidelines. We will collect the relevant peer-reviewed and grey literature in French and English language. The scientific literature will be retrieved with the use of a search string in two publication databases, one environmental and one social science database (Web Of Science Core Collection, and Cairn.info). We will also perform supplementary searches (search engines, call for literature, search for relevant reviews). All references will be screened for relevance using a three-stage process, according to a predefined set of eligibility criteria. Our study will concentrate on urban areas at the infra-city scale in cities of the temperate biogeographical zone. The subject population will include terrestrial species and ecosystems, except for archaea and bacteria. The exposure will consider all types of urban forms described by any urban descriptors or measures including heterogeneity, fragmentation, housing density, organisation of urban matrix, urban fabric) and all types of urban features (e.g. size, age of the buildings, materials, urban artefacts). All relevant outcomes will be considered (e.g. species richness, abundance, behaviour). We will provide an open-access database of the studies included in the map. Our results will also be presented narratively, together with tables and graphs summarising the key information coded from the retained articles (e.g. study characteristics, types and areas of research that has been undertaken, types of exposure, population concerned, etc.).

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a threat to biodiversity because it restricts the ability of animals to move. Maintaining landscape connectivity could promote connections between habitat patches, which is extremely important for the preservation of gene flow and population viability. This paper aims to evaluate the landscape connectivity of forest areas as it relates to the conservation of the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti), an emblematic and endemic endangered primate species. Specifically, this study seeks to model ways to improve connectivity via cropland reforestation scenarios which incorporate graph theory and genetic distances. The connectivity improvement assessment is performed at two nested scales. At the regional scale, the aim is to quantitatively assess the gain in connectivity from different reforestation scenarios, in which croplands are replaced by different kinds of forest habitats. At the local scale, the goal is to prioritize and to locate croplands based on the gain in connectivity that they would provide if they were reforested. The results indicate that the four reforestation scenarios have different impacts on connectivity; the fourth scenario, in which reforestation is accomplished with plant species that provide optimal monkey habitat, yields the greatest increase in connectivity (+24% versus less than +2% for the others). Prioritization of the 1482 cropland patches shows that the 10 best patches increase connectivity from 0.04% to 9.1% as the isolation threshold distance increases. This kind of graph theoretic approach appears to be a useful tool for connectivity assessment and the development of conservation measures for species impacted by human activities.

AB  - We reexamined a local population of Guadalupe Bass Micropterus treculii after cessation of a stocking program that significantly reduced the number of individuals that were hybridized with Smallmouth Bass M. dolomieu. Analysis of five years of post-stocking fish collection data show that the percentage of hybrids has increased in all four study sections of the upper Guadalupe River since stocking stopped. We found that hybridization had increased from 0.0% to 9.9% in Johnson Creek, 19.8% to 28.8% in North Fork Guadalupe River, 5.6% to 12.0% in South Fork Guadalupe River, and 24.2% to 26.5% in Guadalupe River main stem sections. This represents an average increase of 6.8% for all streams combined (range = 2.2-9.9%) from the last year of stocking. We also examined hybridization levels in individual stream fragments created by instream barriers (n = 76) to assess spatial variability along tributary and main stem corridors. Although hybridization appears to be increasing on a stream-wide basis, finer scale analysis show that hybrid distribution was spatially complex and there was a substantial portion of the study area with little or no hybridization. There were gradients of decreasing hybridization in an upstream direction in each of the tributaries and marked break points upstream of which hybridization was considerably lower (<10%). We also found that hybridization was highly variable among individual stream fragments (range 0%-71.4%) including those immediately adjacent to one another. These findings suggest that instream barriers may restrict genetic mixing throughout the system and contribute to partial isolation of populations within stream fragments. As such, further targeted intervention efforts are likely necessary to further reduce hybridization in fragments that still contain high proportions of hybrids. The patchy distribution that we observed may be a critical component to consider in assessment and restoration efforts; not only for Guadalupe Bass but also in other endemic black basses threatened by hybridization.

AB  - Urbanisation leads to natural habitats being fragmented with various effects according to the species and their ecological characteristics. Paradoxically, the urbanisation process creates relatively unused environments, wastelands, habitats which could contribute to biodiversity conservation in urban regions. In this review we examined the role of wastelands in maintaining biodiversity in the city and assessed the different factors responsible for wasteland biodiversity. 37 articles were suitable for our aim. Most of the studies have been conducted in large cities in Western and Central Europe. A wasteland is defined as an abandoned site with spontaneous vegetation (i.e. wild grown vegetation). In most cases, wastelands harbour more species than other urban green spaces. The processes which affect the bio diversity of wastelands operate on two different levels. Locally, the area size, age, soil, microclimate and the vegetation structure are the dominant factors. As in other environments, the species richness increases with the size of the wasteland. Wastelands of different ages include different stages of vegetation, ranging from pioneer to pre-forest stages, and consequently harbour different communities of plants and animals. The diversity of anthropogenic soil substrates leads to different plant communities. At the landscape scale, matrix composition and geographic connectivity between wastelands influence the biodiversity of wastelands, although to a lesser extent than the local features. We show that wastelands have a real potential to contribute to biodiversity conservation in urban regions. At the city scale, they represent habitats which urban planners need to take into account and include in dynamic urban planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

While previous research has shown the distribution of forest patches is a determinant of dispersal patterns among forest-obligate bird species, the impacts of habitat distribution on the dispersal of "urban-adapted" species, has yet to be examined. Here, we use capture-reencounter data of birds banded over a 9-year period at six banding stations in greater Washington, DC to assess dispersal in four species of songbirds and a translocation experiment to examine the influence of land cover on movement. Point count and land cover data were used to construct habitat suitability and landscape permeability surfaces, with the latter representing potential travels costs from the capture location to the surrounding landscape. To assess how dispersal processes are affected by urban land cover, we searched for previously banded birds at sampling locations within 1.5 km of each banding station and compared the distribution of sampling locations with and without observations of previously-banded birds. We found evidence that settlement of two of four focal species, the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) and Gray Catbird (Dumetella carolinensis), was more likely in sites with high relative permeability. To experimentally explore the consequences of the urban matrix habitat on movement, we attached radio transmitters to male Cardinals, translocated individuals 1.5 km across high-intensity urban, suburban, and forested landscapes, and recorded the time to return to their territory. Return time was dependent on land cover with Cardinals translocated across suburban habitats returning significantly faster than those moved across the other two land use classes. Combined, our findings suggest that, even among some "urban-adapted" species, dispersal within urban environments may be influenced by landscape structure and composition.

AB  - Resistance values based on habitat suitability are frequently the basis for modeling landscape connectivity and designing wildlife corridors to facilitate dispersal movements. However, animals may use the landscape differently during dispersal movements than in the home range. We hypothesized that (1) habitat features that are avoided within an animal's home range offer little resistance to animals during natal or breeding dispersal and more specifically that (2) resistance to dispersal is a negative exponential function of habitat suitability within the home range. To test these hypotheses, we used field movement data of kinkajous (Potos flavus), a neotropical, arboreal mammal, to parameterize alternative resistance surfaces based on home range resource use, home range movement data, parent-offspring locations, and breeding pair locations. We used correlation analysis to compare performance of these surfaces. Our results suggest that kinkajous perceive the fragmented landscape as more connected during dispersal than while in the home range. Although kinkajous are tightly linked to forest during movements in the home range, farms and pastures did not pose higher resistance to dispersal movements than forests. Similar tolerance for low-quality habitat has now been observed in dispersal movements of several wildlife species. A negative exponential relationship between habitat suitability and resistance characterizes landscape connectivity perception of mobile species during dispersal movements. If mobile animals can readily traverse habitat of lower quality, large fractions of the landscape may offer low resistance, allowing greater flexibility in where a corridor is located.

AB  - Global warming may alter microbially mediated ecosystem functions through reshaping of microbial diversity and modified microbial interactions. Here, we examined the effects of 5-year experimental warming on different microbial hierarchical groups in a coastal nontidal soil ecosystem, including prokaryotes (i.e., bacteria and archaea), fungi, and Cercozoa, which is a widespread phylum of protists. Warming significantly altered the diversity and structure of prokaryotic and fungal communities in soil and additionally decreased the complexity of the prokaryotic network and fragmented the cercozoan network. By using the Inter-Domain Ecological Network approach, the cross-trophic interactions among prokaryotes, fungi, and Cercozoa were further investigated. Under warming, cercozoan-prokaryotic and fungal-prokaryotic bipartite networks were simplified, whereas the cercozoan-fungal network became slightly more complex. Despite simplification of the fungal-prokaryotic network, the strengthened synergistic interactions between saprotrophic fungi and certain prokaryotic groups, such as the Bacteroidetes, retained these phyla within the network under warming. In addition, the interactions within the fungal community were quite stable under warming conditions, which stabilized the interactions between fungi and prokaryotes or protists. Additionally, we found the microbial hierarchical interactions were affected by environmental stress (i.e., salinity and pH) and soil nutrients. Interestingly, the relevant microbial groups could respond to different soil properties under ambient conditions, whereas under warming these two groups tended to respond to similar soil properties, suggesting network hub species responded to certain environmental changes related to warming, and then transferred this response to their partners through trophic interactions. Finally, warming strengthened the network modules' negative association with soil organic matters through some fungal hub species, which might trigger soil carbon loss in this ecosystem. Our study provides new insights into the response and feedback of microbial hierarchical interactions under warming scenario.

AB  - With the high rate of ecosystem change, effective systematic conservation planning must account for ongoing and imminent threats to biodiversity to ensure its persistence. Accordingly, guidance on appropriate conservation actions in the face of climate change has been accumulating. We review this guidance and bring together the key recommendations needed to successfully account for climate change impacts, relevant to the scale at which natural resource management is carried out. We discuss how the traditional conservation tools of protection and restoration need to be adjusted to be effective in the face of climate change. We highlight the conservation innovations such as moveable and temporary reserves, and Targeted Gene Flow. We build on recent work to provide critical advice for considering climate change in conservation planning. In particular, we discuss how stating explicit objectives related to climate change adaptation, quantifying uncertainty, and exploring trade-offs will better place conservation plans to meet objectives for multiple goals such as protection of species, ecosystems, geophysical diversity and ecological processes.

AB  - Preserving and expanding green infrastructure (GI) is key to biodiversity conservation in cities, but a significant share of urban land is commonly underutilized in GI plans: gardens. This is despite the fact that gardens can support diverse wildlife communities by providing habitat and by functioning as corridors. In this article, we apply circuit theory-based modeling in order to quantify the contribution of two types of gardens to connectivity in the city of Braunschweig, Germany: private gardens and allotment gardens. We ran four permeability scenarios: 1.) all green spaces including private and allotment gardens are permeable; 2.) private gardens are non permeable; 3.) allotment gardens are non-permeable; 4.) only public green spaces but no gardens are permeable. We based our modeling on the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), a common, relatively well-understood and well-liked urban species. Observations by citizen scientists were used for a plausibility analysis and interpreting the results. Our results confirm the importance of gardens for providing habitat and connectivity. The overall landscape permeability to the movement of hedgehogs would decrease by 75% and the area of core habitats would decline by 63% without private and allotment gardens. While private gardens contribute most to landscape connectivity, some allotment gardens occupy key areas for the overall connectivity in the city. In conclusion, circuit theory-based modeling is a promising tool for urban GI planning and the output of those models can inform decision makers and gardeners.

AB  - The Lobau, a former dynamic floodplain area of the Danube River situated close to Vienna (Austria), was strongly affected by the river regulation in 1875. The reduced hydrological connectivity changed the conditions in the system which is nowadays groundwater-fed, back-flooded, and characterized by sedimentation and terrestrialisation processes.
   On one hand, the artificially created habitat types have a high conservation potential; they harbour a rich community whose habitat range has been reduced due to degradation in the cultural landscape. On the other hand, restoration efforts aim to reverse the anthropogenic impact due to damming and to restore the natural status of the wetland with its dynamic hydrological regime and its associated rheophilic community as far as possible.
   The challenge for floodplain managers is now to develop a compromise solution that integrates restoration and conservation efforts. The potential options range from the conservation of the present status to the restoration of the floodplain towards pristine conditions. We used a logistic regression approach to predict the potential habitat availability for indicator species including highly endangered and flagship species which are used for attracting public support for the conservation/restoration measures.
   The results represent the actual and potential future community of the system for the management options. Based on the results we make recommendations for the selection of a best compromise for the management of the floodplain with special regard to the legal objectives. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We developed a new methodology for the assessment of landscape and ecological connectivity at regional scale. This method has been entirely formalized using mathematical language, is supported by a topological analysis of a 1:25,000 scale land use map, and has been developed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The method allows the elaboration of a diagnose of the connectivity of terrestrial landscape ecosystems, on the basis of a previously defined set of ecological functional areas, and a computational cost-distance model which includes the barrier effect. This last component takes into consideration the type of barrier, the distance impact, and the adjacent land use and vegetation type. We defined two new compound indices: one for ecological connectivity and another for the barrier effect. The practical interest of our model is that it not only allows a cost-effective assessment of the current situation, but it has predictive capabilities, allowing the quantitative assessment and comparison of the impacts resulting from different planning scenarios or different infrastructure alternatives on the landscape and ecological connectivity.
   The application of this model to the Barcelona Metropolitan Area (BMA), 16% of which is currently classified as urban, showed that 65% of the BMA area is currently occupied by functional ecological areas, and that 18% is covered by artificial barriers, although they have a direct negative impact on 56.5% of the area. The model also allowed the identification of vulnerable spots, including 1.7% of the BMA that has a critical importance for ecological connectivity, as well as the network of landscape linkages and ecological corridors that offer a high restoration potential. Further applications of this methodology assessing the impacts of regional and urban plans on ecological connectivity, suggest than it could easily be extrapolated to other regions.

AB  - Microplastics are pervasive pollutants in fresh waters, but their distribution, abundance, and diversity in fluvial environments remain poorly documented. Previous research indicated that large polyethylene microbeads were abundant in the freshwater sediments of the St. Lawrence River. Here we extend this work by quantifying the abundance of a broad range of sizes and types of microplastics in sediments and surface water samples, and we relate these metrics to environmental variables. We sampled 21 sites for sediments that spanned a land use gradient, and 10 surface water stations above and below wastewater effluent sites, along the fluvial corridor of the St. Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City from July to August 2017. Microplastics were removed from sediments using an oil extraction protocol and enumerated under fluorescent microscopy. We tested predictions that environmental filters and known point sources affect microplastic concentrations in the river. The mean concentration of microplastics across all sediment sampling sites was 832 (+/- 150 SE) plastics per kg dry weight (range 65-7562 plastics per kg dry weight), which is among the highest recorded (in the top 25%) for the world's freshwater and marine systems. Microplastic concentrations in the sediments were significantly related to a suite of environmental variables including land use and sediment particle characteristics. Particle characteristics, proximity to point sources (urban land use), and environmental filters (sediment compositional variables, % organic carbon, % inorganic carbon and distance from shore) each explained a significant fraction of variation in the microplastic composition in the sediment, with environmental filters having the greatest influence. We present a protocol that could be used to efficiently and accurately detect a broad range of microplastics until a standardized protocol is established for large-scale monitoring.

In the case of wildlife corridors, managers in human-dominated landscapes need to identify both the locations of corridors and multiple stakeholders for effective oversight. We synthesized five independent studies of tiger (Panthera tigris) connectivity in central India, a global priority landscape for tiger conservation, to quantify agreement on landscape permeability for tiger movement and potential movement pathways. We used the latter analysis to identify connectivity areas on which studies agreed and stakeholders associated with these areas to determine relevant participants in corridor management. Three or more of the five studies' resistance layers agreed in 63% of the study area. Areas in which all studies agree on resistance were of primarily low (66%, e.g., forest) and high (24%, e.g., urban) resistance. Agreement was lower in intermediate resistance areas (e.g., agriculture). Despite these differences, the studies largely agreed on areas with high levels of potential movement: >40% of high average (top 20%) current-flow pixels were also in the top 20% of current-flow agreement pixels (measured by low variation), indicating consensus connectivity areas (CCAs) as conservation priorities. Roughly 70% of the CCAs fell within village administrative boundaries, and 100% overlapped forest department management boundaries, suggesting that people live and use forests within these priority areas. Over 16% of total CCAs' area was within 1 km of linear infrastructure (437 road, 170 railway, 179 transmission line, and 339 canal crossings; 105 mines within 1 km of CCAs). In 2019, 78% of forest land diversions for infrastructure and mining in Madhya Pradesh (which comprises most of the study region) took place in districts with CCAs. Acute competition for land in this landscape with globally important wildlife corridors calls for an effective comanagement strategy involving local communities, forest departments, and infrastructure planners.

AB  - 1. Understanding resource selection and quantifying habitat connectivity are fundamental to conservation planning for both land-use and species management plans. However, data sets available to management authorities for resource selection and connectivity analyses are often highly limited and fragmentary. As a result, measuring connectivity is challenging, and often poorly integrated within conservation planning and wildlife management. To exacerbate the challenge, scale-dependent resource use makes inference across scales problematic, resource use is often modelled in areas where the species is not present, and connectivity is typically measured using a source-to-sink approach, erroneously assuming animals possess predefined destinations.
   2. Here, we used a large carnivore, the leopard Panthera pardus, to characterise resource use and landscape connectivity across a vast, biodiverse region of southern Africa. Using a range of data sets to counter data deficiencies inherent in carnivore management, we overcame methodological limitations by employing occupancy modelling and resource selection functions across three orders of selection, and estimated landscape-scale habitat connectivity - independent of a priori source and sink locations - using circuit theory. We evaluated whether occupancy modelling on its own was capable of accurately informing habitat connectivity, and identified conservation priorities necessary for applied management.
   3. We detected markedly different scale-dependent relationships across all selection orders. Our multi-data, multi-scale approach accurately predicted resource use across multiple scales and demonstrates how management authorities can more suitably utilise fragmentary data sets. We further developed an unbiased landscape-scale depiction of habitat connectivity, and identified key linkages in need of targeted management. We did not find support for the use of occupancy modelling as a proxy for landscape-scale habitat connectivity and further caution its use within a management context.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Maintaining habitat connectivity remains a fundamental component of wildlife management and conservation, yet data to inform these biological and ecological processes are often scarce. We present a robust approach that incorporates multi-scale fragmentary data sets (e.g. mortality data, permit data, sightings data), routinely collected bymanagement authorities, to inform wildlife management and land-use planning. We recommend that management authorities employ a multi-data, multi-scale connectivity approach - as we present here - to identify management units at risk of low connectivity.

AB  - Within the framework of landscape genetics, resistance surface modelling is particularly relevant to explicitly test competing hypotheses about landscape effects on gene flow. To investigate how fragmentation of tropical forest affects population connectivity in a forest specialist bird species, we optimized resistance surfaces without a priori specification, using least-cost (LCP) or resistance (IBR) distances. We implemented a two-step procedure in order (i) to objectively define the landscape thematic resolution (level of detail in classification scheme to describe landscape variables) and spatial extent (area within the landscape boundaries) and then (ii) to test the relative role of several landscape features (elevation, roads, land cover) in genetic differentiation in the Plumbeous Warbler (Setophaga plumbea). We detected a small-scale reduction of gene flow mainly driven by land cover, with a negative impact of the nonforest matrix on landscape functional connectivity. However, matrix components did not equally constrain gene flow, as their conductivity increased with increasing structural similarity with forest habitat: urban areas and meadows had the highest resistance values whereas agricultural areas had intermediate resistance values. Our results revealed a higher performance of IBR compared to LCP in explaining gene flow, reflecting suboptimal movements across this human-modified landscape, challenging the common use of LCP to design habitat corridors and advocating for a broader use of circuit theory modelling. Finally, our results emphasize the need for an objective definition of landscape scales (landscape extent and thematic resolution) and highlight potential pitfalls associated with parameterization of resistance surfaces.

AB  - Green turtles (Chelonia mydas) are observed year-round in the Sea of Jeju Island, Republic of Korea; however, there is limited information on their migration and seasonal distribution outside of Korean waters. To investigate their spatial and temporal movement, we tracked 8 green turtles (straight carapace length range, 49.7-85.9 cm; mean +/- SD, 63.36 +/- 10.99 cm), taken as bycatch in pound nets near Jeju Island, using satellite transmitters from August 2015 to January 2017. Turtles were mainly juveniles and were tracked for 17-314 d. Three turtles traveled more than 400 km from their release site in 2 different directions: one individual moved westward to China within 17 d of release, and 2 individuals traveled eastward to Japan. One turtle that moved to Japan had been flipper-tagged at Kagoshima, Japan, 1 mo prior to its capture at Jeju Island. The other 5 individuals remained near the coast of Jeju Island. The individual tracked for the longest period (314 d) overwintered (water temperature, 12 degrees-14 degrees C) in the eastern area of Jeju Island. These results indicate that green turtles from different regions, including China and Japan, may use the areas around Jeju Island for foraging, for overwintering, and/or as a migratory corridor. To fortify the conservation of green turtles in the region, international cooperation and expanded research efforts, such as genetic studies, are needed.

AB  - Fine-scale landscape features such as scattered trees are increasingly thought to be critical for dispersal, and need to be considered in connectivity modelling and planning. Yet existing modelling approaches struggle to adequately take fine-scale features and threshold dynamics of dispersal behaviour into account, in part because of computational limitations. We present a framework for modelling connectivity at fine spatial resolutions over large spatial extents. Our framework involves a novel approach to characterising fine-scale dispersal behaviour within the context of existing modelling methods, and uses key parameters of dispersal behaviour to link models and their interpretation at multiple scales. We address computational limitations by creating a gap-crossing threshold layer, which identifies areas where dispersal is possible because of the presence and spacing of fine-scale connectivity elements. This layer is combined with a dispersal-cost layer within a graph-network analysis to identify the optimal least-cost path between patches. Graph metrics are used to assess the importance of specific patches at the regional-scale and to describe connectivity for the whole landscape. A local-scale connectivity model using the Circuitscape software complements the regional analysis outputs by considering all possible pathways across a landscape simultaneously rather than a single least-cost path. The framework was designed specifically to be applied by land use planners who need to quantify the impacts of property development on fine-scale connectivity, yet need to assess implications at the regional scale. We demonstrate the framework by applying it in the Lower Hunter region, Australia. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban expansion threatens global biodiversity through the destruction of natural and semi-natural habitats and increased levels of disturbance. Whilst woodlands in urban areas may reduce the impact of urbanisation on biodiversity, they are often subject to under or over-management and consist of small, fragmented patches which may be isolated. Effective management strategies for urban woodland require an understanding of the ecology and habitat requirements of all relevant taxa. Yet, little is known of how invertebrate, and in particular moth, assemblages utilise urban woodland despite being commonly found within the urban landscape. Here we show that the abundance, species richness, and species diversity of moth assemblages found within urban woodlands are determined by woodland vegetation character, patch configuration and the surrounding landscape. In general, mature broadleaved woodlands supported the highest abundance and diversity of moths. Large compact woodlands with proportionally less edge exposed to the surrounding matrix were associated with higher moth abundance than small complex woodlands. Woodland vegetation characteristics were more important than the surrounding landscape, suggesting that management at a local scale to ensure provision of good quality habitat may be relatively more important for moth populations than improving habitat connectivity across the urban matrix. Our results show that the planting of broadleaved woodlands, retaining mature trees and minimising woodland fragmentation will be beneficial for moth assemblages.

AB  - Urban environments are heavily anthropogenic and often species depauperate. Many bird species, however, persist in cities, facilitated in part by the vegetated habitats cities provide. Urban vegetation management is likely to be key to bird conservation in cities, but supporting such conservation requires a more complete understanding of the relationships between urban birds and different aspects of urban vegetation than we currently possess. We sought to identify relationships between the species richness and abundance of songbird nesting guilds and attributes of urban vegetation to help build this understanding. We used guild richness and abundance and urban vegetation data compiled via point-count and urban-forest surveys in the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City corridor of Iowa, USA to construct binomial N-mixture models. We used our models to evaluate relationships between the abundance and richness of native songbird nesting guilds and different attributes of urban forests and understory vegetation. Relationships between nesting guilds and urban vegetation differed among guilds, although relationships with some attributes of urban vegetation (e.g., impervious and lawn cover) were more similar. Our models indicate that some characteristics of urban vegetation (e.g., tree height, evergreen trees, standing dead trees) are related to the richness or abundance of only one guild, while others (e.g., low vegetation) are important predictors for multiple guilds, but with different relationships. These findings suggest that some attributes such as lawn and impervious cover could be managed city-wide to support conservation, but few vegetation management approaches could be applied uniformly across cities to support species in all nesting guilds. These results thus indicate that urban conservation in the study area and beyond is likely to require vegetation management that is targeted to specific settings within cities and to the requirements of different groups of species that occur within those settings to support a diversity of bird species.

The levels of invasion were quantified for 18,798 vegetation plots, using two measures: proportion of the species that are aliens and total cover of alien species. Separate assessments were made for archaeophytes and neophytes. Within each habitat, the level of invasion was related to altitude using generalized linear models. The level of invasion, depending on the measure used, decreased with altitude in 16 out of 20 habitats for archaeophytes and 18 out of 23 for neophytes. In two habitats, one measure of the level of invasion increased with altitude for archaeophytes. The values of the level of invasion predicted by generalized linear models for particular combinations of habitats and altitudes were projected onto a land-cover map and digital elevation map of the country. Four maps showing the level of invasion were produced, based on the proportion of the species that are archaeophytes or neophytes, and cover of archaeophytes and neophytes. The maps show that both archaeophytes and neophytes are most common in lowland agricultural and urban areas, whereas they are sparsely represented in mountainous areas. At middle altitudes, agricultural areas are more invaded than forested areas. Outside agricultural and urban areas, high levels of invasion are found especially in lowland sandy areas and river corridors.

AB  - Population expansion and land transformation reduce biodiversity, potentially reducing environmental functionality. These effects are evident globally, and specifically in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa, where land cover is being transformed for urbanisation. However, much of the urbanised areas incorporate differing levels of urban greening, which is improving local species and functional diversity. In recent years, a new form of urban greening in the form of eco-estate development has increased, which improves biodiversity and functional diversity. However, it has not yet been determined whether these eco-estates are connected to one another and the surrounding natural landscapes, allowing for natural species' colonisation, immigration and dispersal. In this study, we assessed whether eco-estates along the coast of KZN were ecologically connected to a) one another, and b) the surrounding natural landscape. Using a hybrid Least-cost Pathway/Ecological Circuit Theory approach, we modelled habitat suitability and dispersal requirements of a forest-specialised bird species in an effort to provide future development and management plans for eco-estates. Connectivity throughout coastal KZN was evident, with increased connectivity in areas of natural and urban indigenous forest and coastal thicket/dense bush and river systems (riparian zones), within which existing eco-estates were subsequently developed. Eco-estates were well connected to one another and surrounding natural landscapes, emphasising their importance as patches containing endangered indigenous forest and unprotected coastal thicket/dense bush and of increased species and functional diversity, improving local ecosystem functioning. We recommend that eco-estate development primarily focus on areas which have previously been transformed, to increase natural land cover. The intention to preserve, rehabilitate, and conserve natural land cover is fundamentally important if development is to take place within and surrounding areas of high connectivity to assist in increasing and conserving suitable habitats, improving functionality and connectivity in KZN, and assisting in offsetting the deleterious effects of future climate change.

AB  - The movements of organisms and the resultant flows of ecosystem services are strongly shaped by landscape connectivity. Studies of urban ecosystems have relied on two-dimensional (2D) measures of greenspace structure to calculate connectivity. It is now possible to explore three-dimensional (3D) connectivity in urban vegetation using waveform lidar technology that measures the full 3D structure of the canopy. Making use of this technology, here we evaluate urban greenspace 3D connectivity, taking into account the full vertical stratification of the vegetation. Using three towns in southern England, UK, all with varying greenspace structures, we describe and compare the structural and functional connectivity using both traditional 2D greenspace models and waveform lidar-generated vegetation strata (namely, grass, shrubs and trees). Measures of connectivity derived from 3D greenspace are lower than those derived from 2D models, as the latter assumes that all vertical vegetation strata are connected, which is rarely true. Fragmented landscapes that have more complex 3D vegetation showed greater functional connectivity and we found highest 2D to 3D functional connectivity biases for short dispersal capacities of organisms (6 m to 16 m). These findings are particularly pertinent in urban systems where the distribution of greenspace is critical for delivery of ecosystem services.

AB  - Aspiring towards cities that are sustainable and equitable, as detailed by Goal 11 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, has become increasingly relevant given the growing human population in urban areas. A key part of guaranteeing that cities meet Goal 11 is to ensure equitable access to urban green spaces, and the biodiversity that they support, for all residents. However, there is evidence from developed world cities of a Luxury Effect, where wealthier residents have greater access to urban biodiversity than poorer residents. To test for this Luxury Effect in a developing world city, we measured bird species richness and diversity in 27 urban green spaces in Johannesburg, South Africa, to examine how socio-economic and ecological drivers influence urban biodiversity. We found no evidence of a Luxury Effect with the median income of neighbourhoods surrounding the green spaces having no significant effect on bird richness or diversity. There were, however, ecological effects with surrounding natural land-cover negatively correlated to richness, and a positive influence of wetland connectivity on richness. The negative effect of natural land-cover is possibly due to the relatively low bird diversity of the natural grasslands surrounding Johannesburg. The positive effect of wetland connectivity and the lack of a Luxury Effect indicate that the use of waterbodies to historically separate populations has buffered poorer neighbourhoods from depreciated biodiversity within the selected green spaces. The effect of wetlands also further emphasises the importance of water availability on urban biodiversity. This indicates that historical land use decisions can still influence how biodiversity is distributed in urban landscapes.

AB  - Habitat corridors that facilitate functional connectivity are a fundamental component of wildlife conservation in fragmented landscapes. However, the landscape matrix separating suitable habitat is not uniformly impermeable to movement and management to increase matrix permeability could be an alternative means to maintain connectivity. Gliding mammals are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because their movements are constrained by glide distance thresholds. Populations of gliders in cities are at risk of being isolated by increasing habitat loss and urban development, yet little is known about how the urban matrix affects glider movement. Here we investigate how the level of urbanization and tree cover in the matrix influence matrix permeability to sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps) within suburban forest reserves. Twenty-two sugar gliders were radio-tracked over winter and summer at four reserves. Boundary crossing behaviour was measured as the number of times each glider crossed into the matrix, and matrix permeability was determined as the maximum distance travelled by gliders into the matrix. The majority of gliders (81%) were located in the matrix at least once, and rates of boundary crossing were consistent across urbanization and tree cover levels. Matrix permeability was negatively affected by matrix urbanization, but not by matrix tree cover, and no interaction effects were found. Although distances travelled by gliders into the matrix did not exceed 180m, they were comparable with typical movement distances by gliders in reserves. Our results demonstrate that the urban matrix can provide suitable habitat for gliding mammals to move and forage, but that increased urbanization may inhibit glider use of the matrix irrespective of tree cover. This finding has implications for conservation planning and suggests that structurally connected areas may not be used if movement behaviour is inhibited. Conversely, management of matrix permeability could be used to maintain connectivity without needing to construct physical corridors.

AB  - The urban matrix was recently shown to be a mosaic of heterogeneous dispersal habitats. We conducted a playback experiment of mobbing calls to examine the probabilities of forest birds to cross a distance of 50 m over urban matrix with different land-cover types in an urban area. We treated the reciprocal of the crossing probabilities as a movement resistance for forest birds. We drew resistance surfaces based on the land-cover maps of urban Sapporo. We applied a circuit theory to examine the relative role of a detour route consisting of a riparian corridor and urban matrix for dispersing forest bird individuals from continuous forest to an isolated green space in the midst of an urban area. Our results showed that wood cover had the highest crossing probability, while open land (grassland and pavement) had the lowest probabilities. Buildings and water surface displayed an intermediate probability. Resistance surfaces and flow maps at 25- and 50-m resolutions were very similar and suggested that dispersing individuals are likely to use the intervening building areas that dominate the urban matrix rather than detour through riparian corridors. Our results showed the useful combination of experimental approaches and circuit theory, and the importance of the spatial configuration of corridors, as well as the composition and management of dispersal habitats, to landscape connectivity.

AB  - Urban areas are quickly expanding in the southeastern United States with varying effects on biodiversity. Maintaining bird richness in cities is essential for conserving ecosystem function. In this study, we determined the relative importance of landscape composition and configuration on urban avian richness in the southeastern U.S. We used linear models to explore the influence of the proportion, size, aggregation, and edge density of forests, wetlands, and developed land cover types on urban avian species richness and feeding guild diversity. We found that the proportion of developed land in a city, a composition metric, and forest edge density of cities, a configuration metric, had consistent negative effects on bird richness and feeding guild diversity. These results differ from previous studies that have found landscape configuration to have a minimal influence on bird richness. Urban revegetation should therefore focus on reducing expansion of developed land and reducing edge density of large forest patches.

AB  - Globally, protected areas are being established to protect biodiversity and to promote ecosystem resilience. The typical spatial conservation planning process leading to the creation of these protected areas focuses on representation and replication of ecological features, often using decision support tools such as Marxan. Yet, despite the important role ecological connectivity has in metapopulation persistence and resilience, Marxan currently requires manual input or specialized scripts to explicitly consider connectivity.
   'Marxan Connect' is a new open source, open access Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool designed to assist conservation planners with the appropriate use of data on ecological connectivity in protected area network planning.
   Marxan Connect can facilitate the use of estimates of demographic connectivity (e.g. derived from animal tracking data, dispersal models, or genetic tools) or structural landscape connectivity (e.g. isolation by resistance). This is accomplished by calculating metapopulation-relevant connectivity metrics (e.g. eigenvector centrality) and treating those as conservation features or by including the connectivity data as a spatial dependency amongst sites in the prioritization process.
   Marxan Connect allows a wide group of users to incorporate directional ecological connectivity into conservation planning with Marxan. The solutions provided by Marxan Connect, combined with ecologically relevant post-hoc testing, are more likely to support persistent and resilient metapopulations (e.g. fish stocks) and provide better protection for biodiversity.

AB  - Cities are growing rapidly worldwide, yet a mechanistic understanding of the impact of urbanization on biodiversity is lacking. We assessed the impact of urbanization on arthropod diversity (species richness and evenness) and abundance in a study of six cities and nearby intensively managed agricultural areas. Within the urban ecosystem, we disentangled the relative importance of two key landscape factors affecting biodiversity, namely the amount of vegetated area and patch isolation. To do so, we a priori selected sites that independently varied in the amount of vegetated area in the surrounding landscape at the 500-m scale and patch isolation at the 100-m scale, and we hold local patch characteristics constant. As indicator groups, we used bugs, beetles, leafhoppers, and spiders. Compared to intensively managed agricultural ecosystems, urban ecosystems supported a higher abundance of most indicator groups, a higher number of bug species, and a lower evenness of bug and beetle species. Within cities, a high amount of vegetated area increased species richness and abundance of most arthropod groups, whereas evenness showed no clear pattern. Patch isolation played only a limited role in urban ecosystems, which contrasts findings from agro-ecological studies. Our results show that urban areas can harbor a similar arthropod diversity and abundance compared to intensively managed agricultural ecosystems. Further, negative consequences of urbanization on arthropod diversity can be mitigated by providing sufficient vegetated space in the urban area, while patch connectivity is less important in an urban context. This highlights the need for applying a landscape ecological approach to understand the mechanisms shaping urban biodiversity and underlines the potential of appropriate urban planning for mitigating biodiversity loss.

AB  - ContextUrbanization is a substantial force shaping the genetic and demographic structure of natural populations. Urban development and major highways can limit animal movements, and thus gene flow, even in highly mobile species. Characterizing varying species responses to human activity and fragmentation is important for maintaining genetic continuity in wild animals and for preserving biodiversity. As one of the only common and wide-ranging large wild herbivores in much of urban North America, deer play an important ecological role in urban ecosystems, yet the genetic impacts of development on deer are not well known.ObjectivesWe assessed genetic connectivity for mule deer to understand their genetic response to habitat fragmentation, due to development and highway barriers, in an increasingly urbanized landscape.MethodsUsing non-invasive sampling across a broad region of southern California, we investigated genetic structure among several natural areas that were separated by major highways and applied least-cost path modelling to determine if landscape context and highway attributes influence genetic distance for mule deer.ResultsWe observed significant yet variable differentiation between subregions. We show that genetic structure corresponds with highway boundaries in certain habitat patches, and that particular landscape configurations more greatly limit gene flow between patches.ConclusionsAs a large and highly mobile species generally considered to be well adapted to human activity, mule deer nonetheless showed genetic impacts of intensive urbanization. Because of this potential vulnerability, mule deer and other ungulates may require further consideration for effective habitat management and maintenance of landscape connectivity in human-dominated landscapes.

AB  - Background Mobile animals transport nutrients and propagules across habitats, and are crucial for the functioning of food webs and for ecosystem services. Human activities such as urbanization can alter animal movement behavior, including site fidelity and resource use. Because many urban areas are adjacent to natural sites, mobile animals might connect natural and urban habitats. More generally, understanding animal movement patterns in urban areas can help predict how urban expansion will affect the roles of highly mobile animals in ecological processes. Methods Here, we examined movements by a seasonally nomadic wading bird, the American white ibis (Eudocimus albus), in South Florida, USA. White ibis are colonial wading birds that forage on aquatic prey; in recent years, some ibis have shifted their behavior to forage in urban parks, where they are fed by people. We used a spatial network approach to investigate how individual movement patterns influence connectivity between urban and non-urban sites. We built a network of habitat connectivity using GPS tracking data from ibis during their non-breeding season and compared this network to simulated networks that assumed individuals moved indiscriminately with respect to habitat type. Results We found that the observed network was less connected than the simulated networks, that urban-urban and natural-natural connections were strong, and that individuals using urban sites had the least-variable habitat use. Importantly, the few ibis that used both urban and natural habitats contributed the most to connectivity. Conclusions Habitat specialization in urban-acclimated wildlife could reduce the exchange of propagules and nutrients between urban and natural areas, which has consequences both for beneficial effects of connectivity such as gene flow and for detrimental effects such as the spread of contaminants or pathogens.

AB  - The total amount of sealed surfaces is increasing in many urban areas, which presents a challenge for sewerage systems and wastewater treatment plants when extreme rainfall events occur. One promising solution approach is the application of decentralized eco-technologies for water management such as green roofs and constructed wetlands, which also have the potential to improve urban biodiversity. We review the effects of these two eco-technologies on species richness, abundance and other facets of biodiversity (e.g., functional diversity). We find that while green roofs support fewer species than ground-level habitats and thus are not a substitute for the latter, the increase in green roof structural diversity supports species richness. Species abundance benefits from improved roof conditions (e.g., increased substrate depth). Few studies have investigated the functional diversity of green roofs so far, but the typical traits of green roof species have been identified. The biodiversity of animals in constructed wetlands can be improved by applying animal-aided design rather than by solely considering engineering requirements. For example, flat and barrier-free shore areas, diverse vegetation, and heterogeneous surroundings increase the attractiveness of constructed wetlands for a range of animals. We suggest that by combining and making increasing use of these two eco-technologies in urban areas, biodiversity will benefit.

AB  - Ecological research targeting sustainable urban landscapes needs to include findings and methods from many lines of ecological research, such as the link between biodiversity and ecosystem function, the role of humans in ecosystems, landscape connectivity, and resilience. This paper reviews and highlights the importance of these issues for sustainable use of ecosystem services, which is argued to be one aspect of sustainable cities. The paper stresses the need to include social and economic factors when analyzing urban landscapes. Spatially explicit data can be used to assess the roles different green areas have in providing people with ecosystem services, and whether people actually have access to the services. Such data can also be used to assess connectivity and heterogeneity, both argued to be central for continuous, long-term provision of these services, and to determine the role urban form has for sustainability.

AB  - The ability to predict spatial variation in biodiversity is a long-standing but elusive objective of landscape ecology. It depends on a detailed understanding of relationships between landscape and patch structure and taxonomic richness, and accurate spatial modelling. Complex heterogeneous environments such as cities pose particular challenges, as well as heightened relevance, given the increasing rate of urbanisation globally. Here we use a GIS-linked Bayesian Belief Network approach to test whether landscape and patch structural characteristics (including vegetation height, green-space patch size and their connectivity) drive measured taxonomic richness of numerous invertebrate, plant, and avian groups. We find that modelled richness is typically higher in larger and better-connected green-spaces with taller vegetation, indicative of more complex vegetation structure and consistent with the principle of 'bigger, better, and more joined up'. Assessing the relative importance of these variables indicates that vegetation height is the most influential in determining richness for a majority of taxa. There is variation, however, between taxonomic groups in the relationships between richness and landscape structural characteristics, and the sensitivity of these relationships to particular predictors. Consequently, despite some broad commonalities, there will be trade-offs between different taxonomic groups when designing urban landscapes to maximise biodiversity. This research demonstrates the feasibility of using a GIS-coupled Bayesian Belief Network approach to model biodiversity at fine spatial scales in complex landscapes where current data and appropriate modelling approaches are lacking, and our findings have important implications for ecologists, conservationists and planners.

AB  - The growing number of artificial structures in estuarine, coastal and marine environments is causing "ocean sprawl". Artificial structures do not only modify marine and coastal ecosystems at the sites of their placement, but may also produce larger-scale impacts through their alteration of ecological connectivity - the movement of organisms, materials and energy between habitat units within seascapes. Despite the growing awareness of the capacity of ocean sprawl to influence ecological connectivity, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how artificial structures modify ecological connectivity in near- and off-shore environments, and when and where their effects on connectivity are greatest. We review the mechanisms by which ocean sprawl may modify ecological connectivity, including trophic connectivity associated with the flow of nutrients and resources. We also review demonstrated, inferred and likely ecological impacts of such changes to connectivity, at scales from genes to ecosystems, and potential strategies of management for mitigating these effects. Ocean sprawl may alter connectivity by: (1) creating barriers to the movement of some organisms and resources - by adding physical barriers or by modifying and fragmenting habitats; (2) introducing new structural material that acts as a conduit for the movement of other organisms or resources across the landscape; and (3) altering trophic connectivity. Changes to connectivity may, in turn, influence the genetic structure and size of populations, the distribution of species, and community structure and ecological functioning. Two main approaches to the assessment of ecological connectivity have been taken: (1) measurement of structural connectivity - the configuration of the landscape and habitat patches and their dynamics; and (2) measurement of functional connectivity - the response of organisms or particles to the landscape. Our review reveals the paucity of studies directly addressing the effects of artificial structures on ecological connectivity in the marine environment, particularly at large spatial and temporal scales. With the ongoing development of estuarine and marine environments, there is a pressing need for additional studies that quantify the effects of ocean sprawl on ecological connectivity. Understanding the mechanisms by which structures modify connectivity is essential if marine spatial planning and eco-engineering are to be effectively utilised to minimise impacts.

AB  - Understanding the relationship between population dynamics and habitat connectivity is crucial for effective conservation and management of wildlife. In this study, we performed a graph-theoretical analysis to identify the relationship between nest distribution of the black-billed magpie Pica pica sericea and well-connected habitat patches. We analyzed 134 nest sites to determine environmental variables important for nesting magpies and identify habitat patches using a logistic model. Connectivity was estimated by Euclidean distance between habitat patches. A randomization procedure was implemented to verify the association between the nest distribution and the degree of habitat connectivity measured at multiple spatial scales. Preferred nesting habitat was areas close to the forest edge, containing more forest cover within 30 m of the nest. Connectivity analysis showed that the nest location was highly related to large clusters of habitat patches when patches are connected at large spatial scales. In addition, the nests in forest patches were close to grass patches with high connectivity. However, the size of habitat clusters adjacent to nests was much smaller than the average size of total habitat clusters across most scales, indicating that there are anthropogenic factors (e.g., effect of supplementary food in an urban matrix) affecting the distribution of magpie nests. Our results suggest that the distribution of magpie nests is related to landscape connectivity, which can be more clearly explained by taking into account the anthropogenic factors.

AB  - Despite the widespread adoption of motion-triggered camera traps, studies using camera traps to characterize wildlife communities in residential areas in North America are limited. To fill this data gap, we placed camera traps over three seasons in 22 residential neighborhoods within Dutchess County, NY. To account for imperfect detection, we applied individual-level and community-level Bayesian site-occupancy models to these data. Overall, we captured 64,639 independent detections over 17,820 camera trap days. We detected between 17 and 22 mammal and non-passerine bird species in each of the seasons of data collection, while our community models estimated between 24 and 33 mammal and non-passerine bird species in each season. Small, cryptic species were not reliably captured by camera traps, limiting our ability to model their occupancy. We identified five species: raccoons (Procyon lotor), eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) found in all neighborhoods. The most common covariate included in our final occupancy models was the percent of area within each neighborhood that was an impervious surface, which positively affected occupancy for some species, and negatively affected occupancy for others. Forest cover, the second most common variable in our final models, negatively affected occupancy for all species. Our estimates characterize a baseline for quantifying species richness and composition in residential areas of Dutchess County, NY and surrounding regions, and offer a comparison to similar studies in natural areas. Overall, the results improve understanding of how residential landscapes affect individual species and communities.

AB  - The distribution of the northern brown bandicoot (Isoodon macrourus), a medium-sized ground-dwelling marsupial, was examined in habitat fragments within the urban landscape of the city of Brisbane, Australia. From surveys conducted in 68 fragments, bandicoots were found to be present in 33 (49%) despite widespread habitat loss and fragmentation. Logistic regression analysis revealed that of 13 measured independent variables, functional connectivity was the only factor that significantly predicted the presence of bandicoots within fragments, with connectivity positively correlated with the likelihood of occupation. Functional connectivity was equated to the likelihood of bandicoot immigration into the focal fragment from the nearest occupied fragment, based on the estimated resistance to movement offered by the intervening matrix. Within Brisbane, riparian habitat fragments typically have a relatively high level of functional connectivity, as thin strips of vegetation fringing waterways serve as corridors between larger riparian areas and facilitate the movement of bandicoots between patches. Analyses based on the Akaike Information Criterion revealed that the optimal model based on landscape context variables was convincingly better supported by the data than the optimal model produced from fragment characteristics. However, it is important to examine both internal attributes of habitat fragments and external features of the surrounding landscape when modelling the distribution of ground-dwelling fauna in urban environments, or other landscapes with a highly variable matrix. As urban centres throughout the world expand, it is crucial that the ecology of local wildlife be considered to ensure functional connection is maintained between habitat patches, especially for the conservation of species that are highly susceptible to fragmentation.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation in urbanized area is an increasing challenge worldwide. A quantitative tool is needed to provide a spatially explicit representation of habitat mosaics and thus afford insight into the ecological consequences of landscape changes. We developed a method for identifying core habitats and generating a cost surface that was used to identify both the permeability of the landscape matrix and the quality of core habitats and then we developed a least-cost model to delimit the links between pairs of core habitats. We defined a graph-theoretic dispersal flow index to measure the dispersal potential of certain ecological processes, i.e. functional connectivity. A network consisting of core habitats and links was assembled in the rapid urbanized Shenzhen City of China. The results showed that the cell-based least-cost distance calculation between the core habitats can avoid the subjectivity of land cover-based approaches that rely on expert experience. A highly connected network can facilitate DF and reduce the ecological risk of extinction due to habitat fragmentation. For saving construction cost in the urban environment, urban planner can efficiently design ecological corridors along the least-cost paths to connect isolated core habitats and promote appropriate animal behaviors. The methodology described here will be useful in making better conservation decisions and predictions regarding the consequences of human activity and thereby promote sustainable development.

AB  - The interrelated nature of landscape metrics calls for their joint application in analyzing complicated landscape patterns and associated ecological processes. Using geographic information system, remote-sensing and factor-analysis techniques, the landscape patterns of urban green spaces (UGS) in the compact city of Hong Kong were analyzed for their landscape-ecological quality in different land uses and districts. Using the Fragstat software, some key indices were selected to characterize the landscape mosaic with reference to patch size, patch shape, proximity relationship and edge configuration. Some old districts have smaller and more heterogeneous UGS than newer ones due to relatively low-quality landscape attributes. The landscape patterns of UGS have not improved with old-town renewal and new-town developments. In land uses with less human disturbance, UGS tend to be larger, and more homogeneous to enhance ecosystem services, and are closer to each other with more green cover to enhance connectivity and facilitate movements of organisms and people between proximal patches. Furthermore, vegetation-dominated land uses often have more complicated and hence longer UGS edges than other land uses to augment interfacial benefits. Of the 11 land uses, Government, institution and community and open space have more complicated UGS edges than more human-dominated types. The findings could inform the landscape-pattern design of UGS in compact cities to optimize their ecological qualities and benefits to both nature and residents, and to reinforce urban nature conservation.

AB  - In promoting biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service capacity, landscape connectivity is considered a critical feature to counteract the negative effects of fragmentation. Under a Green Infrastructure (GI) perspective, this is especially true in rural and peri-urban areas where a high degree of connectivity may be associated with the enhancement of agriculture multifunctionality and sustainability. With respect to GI planning and connectivity assessment, the role of dispersal traits of tree species is gaining increasing attention. However, little evidence is available on how to select plant species to be primarily favored, as well as on the role of landscape heterogeneity and habitat quality in driving the dispersal success. The present work is aimed at suggesting a methodological approach for addressing these knowledge gaps, at fine scales and for peri-urban agricultural landscapes, by means of a case study in the Metropolitan City of Rome. The study area was stratified into Environmental Units, each supporting a unique type of Potential Natural Vegetation (PNV), and a multi-step procedure was designed for setting priorities aimed at enhancing connectivity. First, GI components were defined based on the selection of the target species to be supported, on a fine scale land cover mapping and on the assessment of land cover type naturalness. Second, the study area was characterized by a Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) and connectivity was assessed by Number of Components (NC) and functional connectivity metrics. Third, conservation and restoration measures have been prioritized and statistically validated. Notwithstanding the recognized limits, the approach proved to be functional in the considered context and at the adopted level of detail. Therefore, it could give useful methodological hints for the requalification of transitional urban-rural areas and for the achievement of related sustainable development goals in metropolitan regions.

AB  - Urbanization may affect genetic differentiation among animal populations because it converts native vegetation to novel land cover types that can affect population connectivity. The effect of land cover change on genetic differentiation may vary among taxa; mobile birds may be least affected. Regardless, genetic differentiation between populations should be best predicted by measures of distance that incorporate the effect of land cover on movement. We studied the relationship between land cover and genetic differentiation in Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) at eighteen sites in the Seattle metropolitan region. We generated a series of hypothetical "resistance surfaces" based on land cover and development age, calculated "resistance distances" between pairs of sampling sites, and related them to pairwise genetic differentiation. Genetic differentiation was best described by a multiple regression model where resistance to gene flow (1) linearly increased with age of development and (2) was greater in high- and medium-density urbanization than in native forest land cover types (R (2) = 0.15; p = 0.003). The single variable with the highest correlation with genetic differentiation was derived from a linear relationship between development age and resistance (R (2) = 0.08; p = 0.007). Our results thus suggested that urban development reduced population connectivity for Song Sparrows. However, the relation of development age to genetic differentiation suggested that equilibrium was not yet reached. Hence, the effects of lost connectivity will increase. Our understanding of the landscape genetics of this recently anthropogenically modified landscape benefited from considering population history.

AB  - Green spaces within urban areas provide services and benefits to human populations and habitat for a variety of species. Freshwater, in the form of rivers, canals, lakes, reservoirs and ponds, is an important component of urban greenspaces. This paper focuses on ponds; and specifically ponds within urban areas. This work is timely as during 2008 ponds were designated, in the UK, as habitats of national conservation importance. Yet, while farmland ponds have received considerable attention, there has been little work on the ecology and landscape ecology of urban ponds. Ecological data was collected from 37 ponds in the Borough of Halton (northwest England) over a period of 2 years (2005-2006). The median species richness in these ponds was 28 invertebrate species and 10 macrophyte species. A highly significant correlation was observed between pond density and species richness. The relationship between the richness of different taxa varied according to scale; becoming more significant within pond clusters than within a single pond. These findings have significance for those involved in planning and managing urban environments, further strengthening the need for functional ecological connectivity in urban areas. With pressure to increase infill development, and thus raise housing density, a greater understanding of the affect of urban design on pond ecology will be of importance to urban planners and ecologists alike.

AB  - Paved roads in urban forests cause forest fragmentation and thus reduce animal populations, threaten dispersal and recruitment of animal-dispersed plants. Here, we tracked animal-mediated seed dispersal of Quercus chenii in the urban forest centre and near roadsides to test the effect of paved roads on seed dispersal and recruitment. We conducted experiments in a forest patch in urban areas of Wuhan, China. The forest was dominated by the focal tree species and separated by paved roads. Only two potential seed dispersal animals, one rodent (Niviventer confucianus) and one jay (Garrulus glandarius) were observed in this stand. Seeds were removed farther but not as fast in the forest centre compared to roadsides, while no differences of seed fate, dispersal direction, and seedling establishment were detected between the forest centre and roadsides, indicating the thick vegetation along roadsides provided feeding shelters for small animals. However, when compared with primary forests containing more seed dispersers, seed removal rate in this urban forest fragment was much slower in both forest centre and roadside. Furthermore, due to road barriers, seeds were seldom moved across the paved road and remained in the fragmented stand, reflecting a limited function of seed dispersers. These results suggested paved roads isolated forests into small "islands" and weakened the ecological function of seed dispersers by impeding long distance seed dispersal. Reintroducing dispersers and building wildlife corridors would be impactful ways to restore urban forest patches.

AB  - Landscape heterogeneity (the composition and configuration of different landcover types) plays a key role in shaping woodland bird assemblages in wooded-agricultural mosaics. Understanding how species respond to landscape factors could contribute to preventing further decline of woodland bird populations.
   To investigate how woodland birds with different species traits respond to landscape heterogeneity, and to identify whether specific landcover types are important for maintaining diverse populations in wooded-agricultural environments.
   Birds were sampled from woodlands in 58 2 x 2 km tetrads across southern Britain. Landscape heterogeneity was quantified for each tetrad. Bird assemblage response was determined using redundancy analysis combined with variation partitioning and response trait analyses.
   For woodland bird assemblages, the independent explanatory importance of landscape composition and landscape configuration variables were closely interrelated. When considered simultaneously during variation partitioning, the community response was better represented by compositional variables. Different species responded to different landscape features and this could be explained by traits relating to woodland association, foraging strata and nest location. Ubiquitous, generalist species, many of which were hole-nesters or ground foragers, correlated positively with urban landcover while specialists of broadleaved woodland avoided landscapes containing urban areas. Species typical of coniferous woodland correlated with large conifer plantations.
   At the 2 x 2 km scale, there was evidence that the availability of resources provided by proximate landcover types was highly important for shaping woodland bird assemblages. Further research to disentangle the effects of composition and configuration at different spatial scales is advocated.

AB  - The conservation of biological diversity in landscapes dominated by human use is emerging as an increasingly significant challenge, given the rate at which the Earth's remaining vegetation resources are being lost. Whilst traditional approaches to conservation have relied upon the ability of species to persist within the scattered fragments to which they have been confined, recent scientific evidence suggests that the long-term viability of fragmented populations may only be secured through the establishment of ecological connectivity between existing fragments.
   In the absence of a suitable methodology within which to design connective habitat configurations, a conceptual approach to landscape design was devised for a highly urbanised environment within the Shellharbour Local Government Area (LGA), New South Wales (NSW). This approach utilises beneficial landscape attributes advocated in the literature, and tailors existing rapid assessment methodologies traditionally used to provide simple measures of ecosystem health. Using this methodology, conservationally significant stepping-stone sites were identified between selected terminal habitat patches. The determination of an optimal corridor configuration linking these patches was found to heavily utilise riparian habitat and adjacent residential yard space. Planting endemic species in these areas will support ecological flow by increasing the area of core habitat relative to edge habitat. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim: Ecological restoration is critical for recovering biodiversity and ecosystem services, yet designing interventions to achieve particular outcomes remains fraught with challenges. In the extensive regions where non-native species are firmly established, it is unlikely that historical conditions can be fully reinstated. To what degree, and how rapidly, can human-dominated areas be shifted via restoration into regimes that benefit target species, communities or processes?
   Location: We explore this question in a >20-year-old reforestation effort underway at Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge in montane Hawaii. This large-scale planting of Acacia koa trees is designed to secure populations of globally threatened bird species by transitioning the site rapidly from pasture to native forest.
   Methods: We surveyed all forest birds in multiple corridors of young planted trees, remnant corridors of mature trees along gulches and at sites within mature forest. Using a Bayesian hierarchical approach, we identified which factors (distance from forest, habitat type and surrounding tree cover) had the most important influence on native and exotic bird abundance in the reforestation area.
   Results: We found that 90% of native and exotic bird species responded quickly, occupying corridors of native trees approximately a decade after planting. However, native and exotic forest birds responded to markedly different characteristics of the reforested area. Native bird abundance was strongly predicted by proximity to mature forest and remnant corridors; conversely, exotic bird abundance was best predicted by overall tree cover throughout the area reforested.
   Main conclusions: Our results demonstrate that large-scale tree planting in corridors adjacent to mature forest can catalyse rapid recovery (both increased abundance and expanded distribution) of forest birds and that it is possible to design reforestation to benefit native species in novel ecosystems.

AB  - Landscape connectivity is an important consideration in understanding and reasoning about ecological systems. Two features within a landscape can be viewed as connected whenever a path exists between them. In many applications, the relevance of a potential path is assessed relative to the cost or resistance it presents to traversal. Typically, the least-cost paths between landscape features are used to approximate the potential for connectivity. However, traversal of a landscape between two locations may not necessarily conform to a least-cost path. Moreover, recent research has begun to cast some doubt on the how different types of landscape features may influence movement. Thus, it is important to consider the geographic bounds to movement more broadly. Continuous (i.e., raster) and discrete (i.e., vector) representations of connectivity are commonly used to model the spatial relationships among landscape features. While existing approaches can shed meaningful insights on system topology and connectivity, they are still limited in their ability to represent certain types of movement and are heavily influenced by scale of the areal units and how cost of landscape traversal is derived. In order to better address these issues, this paper proposes a new vector-based approach for delineating the geographic extent of corridors and assessing connectivity among landscape features. The developed approach is applied to evaluate habitat connectivity for salamanders to highlight the benefits of this modeling approach.

AB  - Vegetation corridors, such as street trees in urban areas, which connect patchy woodland and mitigate habitat isolation, are expected to enhance the persistence of birds in urban landscapes. However, the effectiveness of urban corridors on birds remains equivocal because vegetation corridor is often managed for human use with little consideration of wildlife. Here we compared the effects of three major corridors of varying vegetation structures (trees with a dense understory, trees with a sparse understory, and grassy areas with sparse trees) on the species richness and abundance of birds in 21 wooded patches in the center of Tokyo, Japan, during wintering and breeding seasons. Using generalized linear models and Akaike's information criterion, we found that the effectiveness of corridors depended on the tolerance of birds to urbanization. Urban avoider species, having low tolerance to urbanization, demonstrated lower species richness and abundance in patches close to the corridor with a sparsely vegetated understory as compared with patches close to the understory-richer corridors during winter, although such an effect disappeared during the breeding season. The corridors did not have a significant effect on suburban adapter species with a high tolerance to urbanization. Our results suggest that corridors with scarce understory vegetation may limit the persistence of birds avoiding urban areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Functional connectivity is a key determinant of animal distributions in heterogeneous landscapes. Patch connectivity depends on both patch preference and accessibility, but few studies have integrated habitat selection and movement analyses to gain a general understanding of functional connectivity. In this paper, we define functional connectivity by identifying which factors influence the choice of the patch that is visited next, the location from which animals leave the current patch, and the inter-patch trajectory. Our study provides tools to anticipate movement trajectories and, therefore, animal distribution in patchy landscapes. We followed 23 radio-collared bison across the meadow network of Prince Albert National Park between 2005 and 2008. Selection of the next meadow visited over available meadows was assessed by comparing their characteristics and land cover composition of the area separating them from the departure meadow. Additionally, we used 196 bison trails originating from 29 meadows to evaluate movement rules during inter-patch travels. Bison preferred to travel in deciduous rather than in conifer stands during summer and fall but displayed no preference during winter and spring. They also selected meadows offering higher plant biomass in winter than in other seasons. Throughout the year, meadow proximity was an important determinant of meadow selection. Inter-patch trajectory was influenced by directional persistence, as well as movement biases toward the next meadow and toward canopy gaps. Unlike the choices individuals made in selecting their next meadow, bison displayed no preference between forest stands during inter-meadow travel, indicating that functional connectivity involves hierarchical movement decisions. We showed that the behavioral determinants of functional connectivity varied over spatiotemporal scales. First, forest stand composition between meadows influenced the next target, but not the trajectory during inter-meadow travels. Second, meadow selection varied among seasons. Therefore, although structural connectivity may be immutable to these behaviorally induced changes in inter-patch movements, functional connectivity would adequately account for such modifications in animal spatial dynamics.

AB  - In this study, we aim to gain a better insight on how habitat filtering due to urbanization shapes bird communities of Vienna city parks. This may help to derive implications for urban planning in order to promote and maintain high diversity and ecosystem function in an increasing urbanized environment. The structure of wintering bird communities of 36 Vienna city parks - surveyed once a month in January 2009, December 2009, December 2012, and January 2013 - was described by species richness and the functional diversity measurements FRic (functional richness), FEve (functional evenness), and FDiv (functional divergence). Environmental filtering was quantified by park size, canopy heterogeneity within the park, and the proportion of sealed area surrounding each park. Species richness, FRic, and FDiv increased with increasing park size. Sealed area had a strong negative effect on species richness and FDiv. Canopy heterogeneity played a minor role in explaining variance in FDiv data. FEve did not respond to any of these park parameters. Our results suggest a loss of species richness and functional diversity, hence most likely indicate a decline in ecosystem function, with decreasing park size and increasing sealed area of the surrounding urban landscape matrix.

AB  - Aim Urbanization is a major driver of global land-use change, substantially modifying patterns of biodiversity. Managing these impacts has become a conservation priority. The creation and maintenance of greenways, such as river corridors, is frequently promoted as a strategy for mitigating habitat fragmentation in urban areas by bringing semi-natural habitat cover into city centres. However, there is little evidence to support this assertion. Here, we examine whether riparian zones maintain semi-natural habitat cover in urban areas and how species richness varies along such zones. Location Sheffield, Northern England. Methods Multiple taxonomic groups (birds, butterflies, plants) were surveyed at 105 sites spanning seven riparian corridors that transect the study system. For all groups, we model the relationships between species richness and environmental variables pertinent to an urban system. To test whether riparian zones can act to maintain semi-natural habitats within a city, we modelled the proportion of semi-natural land cover within 250 m grid squares that do, and do not, contain a river. Results Species richness varied markedly in relation to distance from the urban core. Trends differed both between taxonomic groups and between rivers, reflecting the complex patterns of environmental variation associated with cities. This suggests that biodiversity surveys that focus on a single group or transect cannot reliably be used as surrogates even within the same city. Nonetheless, there were common environmental predictors of species richness. Plant, avian and butterfly richness all responded positively to Habitat Diversity and the latter two declined with increases in sealed surface. Main conclusions Multiple transects and taxonomic groups are required to describe species richness responses to urbanization as no single pattern is evident. Although riparian zones are an important component of the mosaic of urban habitats, we find that river corridors do not disproportionately support tree and Natural Surface Cover when compared to non-riverine urban areas.

AB  - Understanding the impacts of landscape-level processes on the population biology of amphibians is critical, especially for species inhabiting anthropogenically modified landscapes. Many pond-breeding amphibians are presumed to exist as metapopulations, but few studies demonstrate the extent and consequences of this metapopulation structure. Gene flow measures may facilitate the construction of more realistic models of population structure than direct measures of migration. This is especially true for species that are cryptic, such as many amphibians. We used eight polymorphic microsatellite loci to determine the genetic population structure of spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) breeding at 17 ponds in northeastern Ohio, a landscape fragmented by roads, agriculture, urban areas and the Cuyahoga River. Using a variety of analyses (Bayesian clustering, F-statistics, AMOVA) we generated a model of salamander population genetic structure. Our data revealed patterns of genetic connectivity that were not predicted by geographical distances between ponds (no isolation by distance). We also tested for a relationship between population structure and several indices of landscape resistance, but found no effect of potential barriers to dispersal on genetic connectivity. Strong overall connectivity among ponds, despite the hostile habitat matrix, may be facilitated by a network of riparian corridors associated with the Cuyahoga River; however, high gene flow in this system may indicate a general ability to disperse and colonize beyond particular corridors.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) are important conservation tools for safeguarding marine systems, yet they are increasingly impacted by climate change. Connectivity is a fundamental aspect of MPA design and evaluation, but regional patterns of marine ecological connectivity are often not well understood, nor how connectivity patterns may be affected by climate change. Our objective was to assess how ecological connectivity between MPAs may shift with projected ocean temperature changes in the Northern Shelf Bioregion in British Columbia, Canada, and demonstrate a potential approach that can be used in other systems. We conducted a case study with Dungeness Crab (Metacarcinus magister) and Shortspine Thornyhead (Sebastolobus alascanus) using benthic temperature outputs from a regional ocean model for hindcast (1981-2010) and future (2041-2070) periods coupled with species' environmental preference information. We evaluated MPA exposure to projected tem-perature changes and suitability for the adult stage of the focal species. Using existing least-cost and circuit theory-based tools more often applied in terrestrial systems, we identified potential linkages between MPAs via adult movement, simulating both optimal and probabilistic paths, then compared MPA interconnectedness be-tween time periods. There was a marked decrease in MPA suitability and interconnectedness for Shortspine Thornyhead under projected future climates, while there was a marked increase in MPA suitability for Dungeness Crab and minor increase in MPA interconnectedness. Given the contrasting results in connectivity changes when examining just two species, this study highlights the challenge of building climate resilience in MPA network designs with multispecies objectives.

AB  - Habitat loss is a significant driver of biodiversity loss, causing fragmentation into small, isolated patches of suitable land cover. This reduces the permeability of landscapes to the movement of individuals and reduces the likelihood of metapopulation persistence. Quantifying functional connectivity, the ability of a focal species to move between resource patches, is therefore essential for conservation management. There is substantial evidence supporting a technique based on 'population synchrony'- the degree of correlation in time-series of annual population growth rates between different long-term monitoring sites, to provide a measure of functional connectivity. However, synchronised population dynamics are not only driven by the movement of individuals between sites, but also shared environmental conditions which must be accounted for. Here, we use species survey data from over four decades to investigate average levels and temporal trends in population synchrony for 58 British bird and butterfly species. We first show that population synchrony is significantly associated with synchrony in some seasonal climatic variables. Once we accounted for spatiotemporal climatic patterns, we found that synchrony in butterflies declined over time by 71% between 1985 and 2000 but increased by 64% in recent years. Synchrony in birds showed some decline between 1999 and 2005, after which there appears to being recovery, however most species (74%) show no significant overall change in synchrony. Our proposed indicator provides a 'species-eye-view' of functional connectivity using widely available abundance data. Developing such indicators of functional connectivity, which can be updated annually, is crucial to improve the effectiveness of land management strategies for conservation under increasing environmental change.

AB  - The fragmentation, isolation and sparseness of vegetation in urban areas gives small patches of vegetation enhanced ecological value as habitat islands, compared with rural areas. Habitats as small as an individual tree may provide important landscape linkages across a densely urbanized city. Thus there is a need for micro-scale inventories of whole cities, which should incorporate not just biomass, but also vegetation of different life form, to support different habitat structural requirements. A combination of fine resolution multispectral satellite images from Ikonos, with the image processing technique of Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU) permits the identification of different types of urban vegetation at sub-pixel level. Any fractional amount of grass and/or trees respectively within each 4 m Ikonos pixel can be identified.
   To evaluate such fine scale inventory, least cost path (LCP) analysis was performed using pixel fractions representing micro-scale tree habitats. This study adopts an innovative approach by allocating variable weightings to the vegetation fraction amounts within each pixel, rather than to whole pixels. The result is a fuzzy friction surface, which constitutes a very high-resolution database for input to fuzzy querying and decision-making. The friction values represent species' preferences or tolerance levels, and may be varied according to the fraction amounts within a pixel. Automated mapping of least cost pathways over different friction surfaces produced different routes across the study area, the densely urbanized Kowloon Peninsula in Hong Kong. Comparison of the results with field data of bird sightings indicates the need for high detail in urban ecological analysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In many ways, the Barycz Valley is a unique region. For one thing, it contains the highest number of fish ponds in Poland. Secondly, it is free from heavy industry and large cities. Thus, this region may be considered considerably clean, and the observed concentrations of trace elements are typical for non-degraded environments. There is, however, a threat of excessive accumulation of trace elements such as Zn, Pb and Cu in waters of the rivers in the Barycz drainage basin, received from point sources, and especially supplied with wastewater. These rivers play a very important role; namely, they are the source of water for filling up numerous ponds (MAREK 1989). On the other hand, any seepage of river waters into the groundwater may cause excessive concentrations of trace elements in soils near the ponds.
   The objective of the study was to analyse and assess sorption properties of sandy soils used as hay meadows. As the study was conducted in a special bird protection area (SBP) included in the European Ecological Network Nature 2000, special attention was paid to the content of selected trace elements. The following analyses were performed on the collected soil samples: particle size distribution, pH in 1 mol KCl dm(-3), TOC, N total, content of exchangeable base cations (Ca+2, Mg+2, K+, Na+) and total content of the metals Fe, Mn, Zn, Pb and Cu.
   The genesis of the examined soils seems closely linked to the very wet moistened local environment, which significantly influenced the physical and physicochemical soil parameters. These soils were formed in a region crisscrossed by a dense network of watercourses of the Barycz River drainage basin, with strong ominant aquaculture traditions. The sum of base exchange cations (S) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) in the examined soils are strongly affected by the particle size distribution, the fact confirmed by significant positive relationships with the silt fraction and colloidal fraction, and significant negative correlations with the sand fraction. Higher content of Zn, Pb and Cu in surface genetic horizons of the examined soil profiles may point to the anthropogenic origin of the metals. Despite the dominant sandy texture, the soils are characterised by a thick humus horizon, abundant in TOC and TN, which increases their capacity for trace element accumulation. Our assessment of the contamination of these soils with Zn, Pb and Cu did not demonstrate any excess in terms of the permissible levels of the trace elements.

AB  - Dams strongly impair the fluvial environment by altering downstream flows. We analysed riverscapes downstream of three dams and hypothesized that different dam types in rivers with diverse history of land-use and land cover (LULC) change have significant riparian cover differences at diverse biogeomorphic units (banks, riverbanks, islands). We performed a temporal comparison using pre-dam (1965) and post-dam (2013) high-resolution airborne imagery. A new approach was devised to correct the spatial offset between historical and contemporary imagery. Riparian vegetation and LULC(200 m-buffer) were mapped in three rivers of Portugal regulated by the dams Touvedo (run-of-river), Vilarinho das Furnas and Fronhas (storage reservoirs). Five landscape metrics, measures of shape complexity, area and edge effect of riparian patches were computed, including the Weighted Class Area, a metric developed to better interpret the landscape variation. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis of highly altered riverscapes in the post-dam period. For all case studies riparian patches are presently larger, but with less complex shapes and smaller edges. In the present study riparian patches encroach into the river channel, occupy more area and are larger at the two reservoir rivers than at the run-of-river setting. Riparian growth trajectory at the latter is mainly outwards from the active channel and non-vegetated areas in riverbanks and banks are significantly larger; likely due to the washing flows. Redundancy analyses indicated that riparian change was driven by both LULC (agricultural land abandonment and unmanaged forests) and hydrological alterations that jointly determine the structure and spatial trajectories of riparian expansion.

AB  - Connectivity is essential to ensure vegetation conservation and adaptation to climate change. Human actions produce a progressive fragmentation of the vegetation, affecting its quality and persistence. Adequate consideration of this effect in environmental assessment is necessary, but is often lacking; project impacts are frequently considered negligible, despite being cumulative. The aim of this review is to analyse the literature on fragmentation and loss of ecological connectivity in vegetation, to identify the main impacts and how to mitigate them. A novelty is the linking of these impacts to the human actions that generate them, which facilitates their consideration in the environmental assessment. Vegetation clearing results in fragmentation, separating patches whose persistence will depend on their size, shape or isolation. Reduced flow also causes loss of connectivity between rivers and floodplains. Fragmentation and induced connectivity favour the entry of invasive plants. These effects become more significant when threatened species or habitats are affected. Mitigation measures need to be implemented to avoid, minimise, restore and compensate for these impacts; ecological corridors can combine all these types of measures. Monitoring is essential to assess the dynamics of restored areas, and to detect changes in vegetation or the entry of invasive species. Only proper consideration of these impacts in decision-making, and appropriate mitigation, can control the negative cumulative effects that are currently occurring.

AB  - 1. Concern about the effects of habitat fragmentation has led to increasing interest in dispersal and connectivity modelling. Most modern techniques for connectivity modelling have resistance surfaces as their foundation. However, resistance surfaces for animal movement are frequently estimated without considering dispersal, despite being the principal natural mechanism by which organisms move between populations.
   2. We collected Global Positioning System data over 10 years from 50 African lions Panthera leo (11 male natal dispersers, 20 adult males and 19 adult females) and used a path level analysis to parameterize demographic-specific resistance surfaces for the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA) in Southern Africa.
   3. Lion path selection varied according to demographic grouping: adult females were most averse to risky landscapes such as agro-pastoral lands, towns, areas of high human density and highways. Male natal dispersers were the least-risk averse suggesting they are potentially the most prone demographic to human-lion conflict. Adults of both sexes selected bushed grassland and shrubland habitats and avoided woodland. Male natal dispersers displayed the opposite trend suggesting con-specific avoidance and/or suboptimal habitat use.
   4. We used the resistance surfaces to calculate factorial least-cost path networks for each demographic-specific resistance surface and present results that show substantial differences between predicted patterns of connectivity for male natal dispersers, adult females and adult males.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Resistance surfaces are widely used to create connectivity models, which are promoted for use by conservation managers. Our results suggest that the demographic category used to parameterize resistance surfaces may lead to radically different conclusions about connectivity. Failure to include dispersing individuals when parameterizing resistance surfaces intended for connectivity modelling may lead to erroneous conclusions about connectivity and potentially unsound management strategies.

AB  - Urbanization is a major cause of biodiversity loss and disconnection between people and nature. For this reason, the creation and maintenance of green areas as part of the urban landscape is a common practice in cities around the world. These green areas are generally a result of particular public policies regarding how these areas can be accessed, maintained, and how they are connected to other natural fragments in the city. In an effort to investigate aspects of the ecology of such green areas of the city of Curitiba, southern Brazil, the present study measured distinct parameters of the structure of butterfly assemblages from 19 forest fragments of distinct classes of protection, testing the influence of different policies (protection category) on butterfly assemblages. Comparatively, we also tested the predictive power of landscape variables (at distinct scales) and fragment quality (e.g. diameter at breast height, density of vegetation) using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs). Overall, 14,596 individuals belonging to 412 butterfly species were recorded, but values of species diversity and composition are very heterogeneous, indicating that the protection categories do not significantly interfere with the structure of the butterfly assemblages. More important than the protection category is the forest fragment quality and landscape connectivity. Our models showed that degraded fragments tend to present a specific butterfly composition, whereas the more urbanized landscape have poor butterfly species richness. These results reinforce the importance of implementing public policies that prioritize the conservation of the quality of forest fragments in every class of protection, as well as the conservation of forest fragments throughout the urban landscape.

AB  - There were dramatic changes in the ecological vulnerability (EV) of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) region due to the effects of climate change and human activity. Obtaining field observation and statistical data for the evaluation of the EV of the CPEC region is difficult due to its transnational status. This study proposes a novel remote sensing ecological vulnerability index (RSEVI) based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), STRM3, DMSP-OLS, and NPP-VIIRS products. The RSEVI index was applied to the CPEC region to investigate the spatiotemporal changes in EV and the influencing factors during 2000-2019. The results showed that: (1) the large-scale application of the RSEVI index showed good applicability to the CPEC region, with a precision of 89.75%; (2) the average RSEVI value for the CPEC region was 0.83, thereby falling into a category of "intensive vulnerability"; (3) a stable trend in RSEVI was observed for the entire CPEC region during the study period, except for the Indus Basin where there was a significant change; (4) the increasing rate of the RSEVI in the northeastern parts exceeded that of other parts during 2000-2019; (5) precipitation, temperature, and vegetation coverage showed negative relationships with RSEVI, whereas RSEVI showed a positive relationship with slope. The RSEVI results indicated that ice and bare land were the most vulnerable, whereas cropland was the least vulnerable; (6) there were differences in the dominant factor and dominant interactive factor among different sub-regions. The results of this study could provide important decision support for the protection of the ecological environment and for economic development.

AB  - Conservation planning for biodiversity within anthropogenic landscapes is crucial given the rate of habitat conversion and human population growth. Investigating anthropogenic impacts on the persistence of biodiversity is key to management decision-making.
   We investigated the influence of protected areas (PAs), agriculture and urbanisation on the occupancy of mammal communities in an anthropogenic matrix containing indigenous forest fragments of the Coastal Belt of southern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
   We integrated camera-trap mammal data, land-use and human population density within occupancy models, and compared occupancy of individual species across the land-use mosaic.
   We modelled occupancy of seven mammal species with sufficient na < ve occupancy (> 0.20, range 0.25-0.87). The occupancy of Philantomba monticola was positively influenced by human population size and was higher within urban areas compared with PAs. Although human population size positively affected Hystrix africaeaustralis occupancy, it along with Atilax paludinosus had a lower occupancy within urban areas. Tragelaphus scriptus and Potamochoerus larvatus overall had higher and Sylvicapra grimmia had lower occupancies within PAs.
   Species were variable in their response to the anthropogenic changes in the landscape. For example, occupancy of P. monticola was low within PAs but high in areas where change in land ownership and loss of habitat are threats. For other species, it appeared that the density of infrastructure of the urban landscape, rather than human population density, affected them negatively. However, seasonal differences within different management regimes also provided context-specific influences on occupancy and detectability. We emphasize the importance of natural vegetation patches within anthropogenic landscapes for maintaining native fauna, whilst stressing the value of temporally replicated, multi-species, regional-scale studies when making conservation decisions.

AB  - Ecological corridors are landscape elements that prevent the negative effects of fragmentation. However, their effectiveness has never been clearly validated in urban landscapes.
   We analysed the role of green corridors in an urban context by comparing metacommunities of arthropods in (i) woodlots considered as sources of species, (ii) woody corridors and domestic gardens that are (iii) connected (CG) or (iv) disconnected to corridors (DG) and taking into account the connectivity of the matrix. We trapped 3 taxa of arthropods - spiders, carabids and staphylinids - because they are sensitive to fragmentation but with different dispersal capabilities. We analysed their species richness, abundance and taxonomic and functional composition.
   For the 3 taxa, the taxonomic and functional compositions of communities in CG were closer to those of the corridor and the source than those of DG. Woodland species were associated with source, corridor and CG. A lower abundance in DG was revealed for staphylinids and spiders. Lower species richness in DG was observed for staphylinids.
   The differences between taxa could be explained by the dispersal capabilities of the species and by their various responses to landscape structures. For carabids, processes at a wider scale could be responsible for their rarity in sources and, consequently, in gardens. For spiders, the colonisation from other sources could explain the high species richness found in disconnected gardens. Our results suggest that the role of corridors is crucial for enhancing biodiversity in green spaces such as domestic gardens.
   Our results clarify the effectiveness of corridors in urban landscapes and have direct implications for the ecological management of cities. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rapid climate change will create extreme problems for the biota of the planet. Much of it will have to migrate towards the poles at a rate far beyond normal speeds. In this context, the concept of assisted migration has been proposed to facilitate the migration of trees. Yet current practices of assisted migration focus on "where tree species should be in the future" and thus have many uncertainties. We suggest that more attention should be paid on the flow of forest migration. Therefore, this study develops a three-step methodology for mapping the flow of forest migration under climate change. Since the migration of trees depends on the activities of their seed dispersal agents, the accessibility of landscapes for dispersal agents is mainly considered in this study. The developed method combines a least-cost path model, a graph-based approach, and a circuit theory-based model. The least-cost path model is applied to map the movement of dispersal agents, based on which graph-based indices are used to evaluate the accessibility of landscapes for dispersal agents, which in turn is used as the basis for circuit theory-based modelling to map the flow of forest migration. The proposed method is demonstrated by a case study in the Greater Manchester area, UK. The resulting maps identify areas with high probability of climate-driven migration of trees.

AB  - Cities worldwide are expanding in area and human population, posing multiple challenges to amphibian populations, including habitat loss from removal of wetlands and terrestrial upland habitat, habitat fragmentation due to roads and the built environment, and habitat degradation from pollutants, extensive human use and introduced species. We developed an eight-step urban amphibian conservation framework based on established monitoring, analytical methods and community engagement to enable amphibian conservation in a large urban centre. The framework outlines a process used to conserve biodiversity in a complex landuse and decision-making environment supported by a series of successive complementary modelling techniques to measure amphibian presence, priority habitat and functional connectivity. We applied the framework in Calgary, Alberta, Canada to illustrate its potential. Here, urbanization has reduced wetlands by 90% and ecological knowledge on amphibians was poor. We improved knowledge on amphibian diversity and distribution, identified core wetlands and movement pathways for amphibian species and identified barriers in the wetland network where construction or restoration measures could re-establish amphibians or increase their densities. This knowledge was shared with ecologists and city planners for implementation through appropriate policies and plans. Our framework provides a series of stepwise products to improve an urban municipality's ability to restore or conserve priority habitat and movement pathways necessary for amphibian survival under pressure from multiple land uses. The framework provides a platform to identify city plans, policy and or programmes and to derive necessary information to support amphibian conservation.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation has largely reduced biodiversity in the urban fringe. The prioritization of individual habitat patches can provide spatially explicit guidance for ecological conservation and restoration. Numerous studies discussed the effectiveness of purely spatial connectivity metrics to rank the conservation priority of habitats, but hardly resolved this issue in a dynamic landscape context. Meanwhile, spatio-temporal connectivity metrics were usually applied at the landscape scale, but are rarely extended to determine habitat priority at the patch scale. As such, we extend a generalized betweenness centrality metric into spatio-temporal connectivity networks to evaluate conservation priorities of individual habitat patches from a dynamic landscape perspective. The contribution rates of spatio-temporal connectivity metrics are examined at varying dispersal distances of the target species. Caidian District, the fringe of Wuhan City in central China, is taken as a case study. The results illustrate that a net decrease in habitat amounts and quality from 2005 to 2015 was mainly caused by urban expansion and agricultural production. The positive contribution rates of spatio-temporal connectivity metrics are observed at distance thresholds exceeding 200 m at the landscape scale, which allows us to capture the response of habitat priority to landscape dynamics. Accordingly, we develop a balanced conservation strategy for multiple species and the targeted conservation measures based on the coupled analysis of quality and conservation priority of habitat patches. Our findings are expected to provide solid support for biodiversity conservation in urban growth.

AB  - Severe low frequency natural disturbances along stream networks can substantially alter urban and rural landscapes and impact habitat and population dynamics of wildlife species. In 1978, severe flooding along the North Prong of the Medina River significantly altered the habitat for the Rio Grande wild turkey and may have contributed to the decreased abundance of this species observed during recent decades in the southeastern Edwards Plateau, TX, USA. The objective of our study was to examine the changes in landscape structure caused by this flooding event and their potential impact on wild turkey habitat. Aerial photography from 1972, 1984, and 1995 was used to quantify habitat changes in riparian zones and adjacent bottomlands along the Medina River. We documented substantial reductions in habitat suitability and connectivity caused by the flooding, followed by a partial recovery over 17 years. Analysis using patch-level metrics in conjunction with class-level metrics, provided insights to the pattern and possible mechanisms of the landscape changes. Habitat along higher-order streams was most affected, reducing not only the suitable habitat locally, but also the habitat connectivity throughout the riparian network. This loss of connectivity rendered numerous habitat patches along lower-order streams unavailable to Rio Grande wild turkeys as this species depends on riparian corridors for dispersal and movement among habitat patches. Our results illustrate the critical importance of multiple-scale analysis based on hierarchical dendritic structures of river networks when assessing habitat changes and their impact on populations of terrestrial wildlife species dependent on riparian habitats in semi-arid landscapes.

AB  - Corridors are intended to increase species survival by abating landscape fragmentation resulting from the conversion of natural habitats into human-dominated matrices. Conservation scientists often rely on 1 type of corridor model, typically the least-cost model or current-flow model, to construct a linkage design, and their choice is not usually based on theory or empirical evidence. We developed a method to empirically confirm whether corridors produced by these 2 models are used by target species under current landscape conditions. We applied this method in the Gamba landscape between 2 national parks in southwestern Gabon. We collected signs of presence of African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus), and 2 apes, western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and central chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes), on transects. We used patch-occupancy models to identify least-cost and current-flow corridors for these 4 species. On average, 28.7% of current-flow corridors overlapped with least-cost corridors, confirming that the choice of corridor model can affect the location of the resulting linkage design. We validated these corridors by monitoring signs and examining camera detections on new transects within and outside modeled corridors. Current-flow corridors performed better than least-cost corridors for elephants, whereas the opposite was found for buffalo and apes. Locations of the highest priority corridors for the 3 taxa did not overlap, and only 18.3% of their combined surface was common among 2 species. We used centrality metrics to calculate the average contribution of corridor pixels to landscape connectivity and derived an index that can be used to prioritize corridors. As a result, we recommend protecting at least 17.4% of the land surface area around Gamba town to preserve the preferred travel routes of the target species.

AB  - Understanding how environmental changes driven by urbanization impact the biodiversity in urban riparian areas has great importance for landscape planning and river ecosystem conservation. There have been many studies on the response of bird communities to different environmental variables in urban parks; however, although supporting some of the highest bird diversities, case studies in urban riparian areas remain limited. In existing research, few studies have considered the impact of both local waterfront characteristics and surrounding environmental variables at a larger scale. In this study, we selected birds as the indicator to clarify their response to both local- and landscape-scale environmental variables in riparian areas of Tsing river, Beijing, in terms of (a) vegetation composition, (b) human disturbance, (c) land cover, and (d) landscape connectivity. We hypothesized that birds with different biological characteristics may respond differently to environmental variables. Birds were then further grouped according to the habitat type, residential type, and feeding type. It turned out that the coverage of grass and the disturbance of pedestrians are the most influential variables. Besides, compared with the land cover and landscape connectivity, the total contribution of vegetation characteristics and human disturbance accounts for the main proportion of explained variance. Information pertaining to these environmental variables can provide evidence to support bird conservation efforts in urban areas, and the identified distance threshold provides a basis for future landscape connectivity assessments.

AB  - Forest fragmentation as a result of urbanisation can adversely affect gene flow between wildlife populations. Although gene flow among fragmented populations has been investigated for many species, there has been little research into the effects of urbanisation on gene flow in large mammals. Singapore is a small, densely urbanised tropical city-state where more than 99% of its original forest has been cleared. The wild pig is currently the largest native terrestrial mammal in Singapore and has important roles in maintaining plant diversity and seed dispersal. Pigs are widespread and present in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve (CCNR) as well as other forest patches in Singapore. Due to the extent of urbanisation, it is unclear if genetic connectivity exists between the CCNR and other forest fragments. In this study, genome libraries from 48 samples of pig blood were collected from two sites: 1) the CCNR and 2) forest fragments in the northeast of Singapore. Genome-wide SNP loci were used to understand the population genomics of the two pig populations. The results indicated that the pig populations formed two distinct genetic clusters that did not align with the respective sites. Both sites included individuals with signatures from both genetic clusters, although with different frequencies. This suggests that pigs can move across heavily urbanised landscapes. Future studies should involve long term collaring studies to identify specific corridors used by the pigs for dispersal, and a larger population genomic assessment to understand pig dispersal and gene flow to and from forest patches other than the CCNR and the Northeast.

AB  - Roadsides, in particular those being species-rich and of conservation value, are considered to improve landscape permeability by providing corridors among habitat patches and by facilitating species' dispersal. However, little is known about the potential connectivity offered by such high-value roadsides. Using circuit theory, we modelled connectivity provided by high-value roadsides in landscapes with low or high permeability in southcentral Sweden, with 'permeability' being measured by the area of semi-natural grasslands. We modelled structural connectivity and, for habitat generalists and specialists, potential functional connectivity focusing on butterflies. We further assessed in which landscapes grassland connectivity is best enhanced through measures for expanding the area of high-value roadsides. Structural connectivity provided by high-value roadsides resulted in similar patterns to those of a functional approach, in which we modelled habitat generalists. In landscapes with low permeability, all target species showed higher movements within compared to between grasslands using high-value roadsides. In landscapes with high permeability, grassland generalists and specialists showed the same patterns, whereas for habitat generalists, connectivity provided by high-value roadsides and grasslands was similar. Increasing the ratio of high-value roadsides can thus enhance structural and functional connectivity in landscapes with low permeability. In contrast, in landscapes with high permeability, roadsides only supported movement of specialised species. Continuous segments of high-value roadsides are most efficient to increase connectivity for specialists, whereas generalists can utilize also short segments of high-value roadsides acting as stepping-stones. Thus, land management should focus on the preservation and restoration of existing seminatural grasslands. Management for enhancing grassland connectivity through high-value roadsides should aim at maintaining and creating high-value roadside vegetation, preferably in long continuous segments, especially in landscapes with low permeability.

AB  - As cities overgrow, the need for ecological restoration is becoming increasingly urgent, especially in densely populated areas. Urban ecological restoration represents the best approach to undertake damages to restore native ecosystem remnants fulfilling biodiversity but also social goals in dense urban settings such as Mexico City. The feasibility of restoring unique xerophytic scrub vegetation in lava field remnants was evaluated in a portion of a university campus in Mexico City. Here we present an index (Need and Feasibility of Restoration Index, NFRI) for such purpose. The NFRI was designed through multicriteria analysis and considered ecological, economic, and social indicators. Cluster and principal components analysis were carried out to identify different groups of lava field remnants with similar characteristics and to point out critical variables that in turn would support management strategies. The outcomes made evident the necessity of restoring native vegetation for all of the evaluated remnants; however, the group containing the largest ones obtained the highest values for restoration feasibility and NFRI. The recovery of the rest of the remnants is critical to support the ecological restoration of the area as this may provide connectivity with better-preserved ecosystem remnants. When the restoration is unaffordable due to financial constraints, it is highly recommended to direct efforts towards ecological rehabilitation actions. The establishment of native xerophytic gardens is promoted when remnants cannot support a self-sustainable plant community. It is crucial to include the diversity of views and values of the community and the economic and ecological aspects to guarantee the sustainability of the landscape, especially in the urban context. The latter can provide better planning and design processes, ensuring benefits for humans and nature.

AB  - Researchers and managers of natural resource conservation have increasingly emphasized the importance of maintaining a connected network of important ecological patches to mitigate landscape fragmentation, reduce the decline of biodiversity, and sustain ecological services. This research aimed to guide landscape management and decision-making by developing an evaluation framework to construct ecological security patterns. Taking the Jianghan Plain as the study area, we identified key ecological sources by overlaying the spatial patterns of ecological quality (biodiversity, carbon storage, and water yield) and ecological sensitivity (habitat sensitivity, soil erosion sensitivity, and water sensitivity) using the Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model and the Chinese Soil Loss Equation Function. Ecological corridors were obtained by the least-cost path analysis method and circuit theory. A total of 48 ecological sources (3812.95 km(2)), primarily consisting of water area, forestland, and cropland, were identified. Ninety-one ecological corridors were derived, with a total length of 2036.28 km. Forty barriers and 40 pinch points with the highest improvement coefficient scores or priority scores were selected. There were 11 priority corridors with very high levels of connectivity improvement potential and conservation priority, occupying 16.15% of the total length of corridors. The overall potential for ecological connectivity is high on the Jianghan Plain. Our framework offers a valuable reference for constructing ecological security patterns and identifying sites for ecological restoration at the regional scale.

AB  - Understanding animal responses to landscape elements helps forecast population reactions to changing landscape conditions. The challenge is that some behaviors are poorly known and difficult to estimate. We assessed how uncertainty in behavioral responses to dense woods, an avoided landscape structure, impacts functional connectivity among reproductive habitat patches for Fender's blue butterfly, an endangered prairie species of western Oregon, USA. We designed a factorial simulation experiment using a spatially explicit individual-based model to project functional connectivity for female butterflies across current and alternative landscapes. We varied the probability of dense woods entry and turning angle standard deviation for movements within the dense woods over a range of biologically reasonable and observed values. Butterflies in the current landscape (46 % dense woods) and one with prairie encroached by forest (60 % dense woods) showed reductions in functional connectivity estimates consistent with the expectations of habitat fragmentation. Although dense woods entrance uncertainty impacted functional connectivity projections, uncertainty in the dense woods turning angle standard deviation had comparatively little impact on connectivity estimates. Reduction and reconfiguration of the current dense woods to 27 % cover (restored landscape) appeared to facilitate a corridor behavior in dispersing individuals, likely providing a functional connectivity estimate comparable to the historic landscape (< 5 % dense woods). Our simulations suggest that additional study of butterfly movement within the dense woods is unnecessary and that a partial reduction in dense woods would be sufficient to achieve historic levels of functional connectivity for Fender's blue across the study landscape.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation in human-dominated landscapes is seen as a major threat to biodiversity persistence. Nearly all corridor conservation plans designed to restore habitat connectivity are based on modeled data, and are rarely tested with empirical field data. Here we describe landscape permeability models derived from an estimated linear relationship between specific landscape features related to human land use (e.g. traffic volume, housing density) and bird and mesocarnivore detection levels from empirical field studies. We compare these model estimates with existing occurrence data for pumas (Puma concolor), a generalist predator commonly used as a focal species for connectivity analysis, in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Our results show that pumas were observed to readily use moderately disturbed habitats, and rarely were detected in the most heavily disturbed areas. This comparison of a more generic connectivity model estimate with animal field observations shows that while generic models can be useful for corridor designs in highly disturbed environments they may be less useful in moderately impacted rural to semi-natural landscapes, where more detailed studies of species behavior may be required to delineate functional corridors. Mapping the level of landscape permeability that surrounds the built environment, as measured by distance to roads and housing density, offers a spatially explicit way to identify areas important wildlife movement. This approach provides a tool to help managers and land-use planners prioritize habitat corridors for biodiversity conservation across fragmented landscapes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Connectivity is a major concern for the maintenance of wildlife populations, ecological flows, and many other landscape functions. For these reasons many different connectivity indices have been used or proposed for landscape conservation planning; however, their properties and behaviour have not been sufficiently examined and may provide misleading or undesired results for these purposes. We here present a new index (probability of connectivity, PC) that is based on the habitat availability concept, dispersal probabilities between habitat patches and graph structures. We evaluate the performance of PC and compare it with other widespread indices through a set of 13 relevant properties that an index should ideally fulfil for adequately integrating connectivity in landscape planning applications. We found that PC is the only index that systematically accomplished all the requirements, overcoming some serious limitations of other available indices. We encourage the use of PC as a sound basis for planning decision-making. To demonstrate the use and potential of PC for practical landscape applications, we present an example of application to a case study for the goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) in Catalonia (NE Spain), where we identify those habitat areas that most contribute to overall landscape connectivity and evaluate the effectiveness and potential improvement of a protected areas network (Natura 2000) for conserving those critical habitat areas.

AB  - Identifying urban areas with a high potential for providing pollination is essential for the management of urban agriculture. Urban green spaces have a vital role in providing nesting and foraging habitats for pollinators, and they act as pollinator refuges in cities. Therefore, regions adjacent to green spaces can host agricultural products in dire need of pollinators for their produce. To determine the suitable areas for urban agriculture according to the proximity to urban green spaces, we used two models, the Lonsdorf and the graph theory models. The Lonsdorf model focuses more on the capacity of the patches to support pollinators but graph theory methods on the connectivity between the patches. According to graph theory, a set of patches with functional connectivity for pollinators can lead to the formation of clusters around them. Each of these clusters has a certain potential for supplying pollination for urban agricultural products. Both models estimate the capacity of patches in supplying pollination services based on the distances at which bees can fly. To test the robustness of the results of each model, we perform both models at distances of 500, 700, 1000, and 1500 m as maximum foraging distances of bees. Our results suggested that both models showed similar results in determining suitable areas for urban agriculture. Both models showed that the northern and northeastern regions of Tehran were the most suitable areas for urban agriculture and have a high potential to support the pollinator population. In contrast, the central regions had a low capacity to maintain pollinators for urban agriculture, and had little support from wild bees for pollination. Our results also showed that the conversion of bare lands into green spaces could significantly increase the pollination level in Tehran city.

AB  - Urbanization is a major factor driving habitat fragmentation and connectivity loss in wildlife. However, the impacts of urbanization on connectivity can vary among species and even populations due to differences in local landscape characteristics, and our ability to detect these relationships may depend on the spatial scale at which they are measured. Bobcats (Lynx rufus) are relatively sensitive to urbanization and the status of bobcat populations is an important indicator of connectivity in urban coastal southern California. We genotyped 271 bobcats at 13,520 SNP loci to conduct a replicated landscape resistance analysis in five genetically distinct populations. We tested urban and natural factors potentially influencing individual connectivity in each population separately, as well as study-wide. Overall, landscape genomic effects were most frequently detected at the study-wide spatial scale, with urban land cover (measured as impervious surface) having negative effects and topographic roughness having positive effects on gene flow. The negative effect of urban land cover on connectivity was also evident when populations were analyzed separately despite varying substantially in spatial area and the proportion of urban development, confirming a pervasive impact of urbanization largely independent of spatial scale. The effect of urban development was strongest in one population where stream habitat had been lost to development, suggesting that riparian corridors may help mitigate reduced connectivity in urbanizing areas. Our results demonstrate the importance of replicating landscape genetic analyses across populations and considering how landscape genetic effects may vary with spatial scale and local landscape structure.

AB  - Conservation planners continue to face challenges in quantifying and ameliorating the negative ecological effects of landscape fragmentation on species populations. While significant methodological and technological advancements have led to more analytically robust assessments of landscape connectivity, the end result of these efforts is often the demarcation of corridor areas void of any significant detailed physical design of their interiors. To address this shortcoming, this work proposes the creation of a hybrid geode sign and connectivity conservation framework and the development of a new tool, or Automated Design Model (ADM), for use in wildlife corridor design. The ADM's primary purpose is to generate detailed vegetation planting designs that may be applied to the interiors of previously modeled corridors. When coupled with existing methods for delineating the spatial extents of biologically best corridors, ADM derived vegetation designs may prove useful in mitigating negative edge effects and enhancing species movement, thus potentially improving the corridors connectivity function. Using a series of geospatial models and rule-based pattern generators, the ADM derived designs are highly customizable to locally specific landscape conditions, varied focal species requirements, and differences spatial structures known to facilitate wildlife movement.
   Moreover, the automated nature of the ADM allows for detailed design at the landscape-scale, has broad applicability in connectivity conservation and landscape restoration, and may help in filing data gaps necessary for moving towards planning and design implementation. Towards this end, this work proposes a basis for developing a common understanding of what constitutes geodesign, proposes the development of a hybrid geodesign/conservation planning framework, and discusses the development of the ADM as a mechanism for improving the functional design of wildlife corridors.

AB  - The desire to improve urban sustainability is motivating many city planners to adopt growth strategies that increase residential density, leading to substantial changes to urban landscapes. What effect this change will have on biodiversity remains unclear, but it is expected that the role of public greenspace in providing wildlife habitat will become critical. We explored the role of urban "pocket parks" as habitat for birds, and how this role changed with increasing residential density in the surrounding neighbourhood. We found that parks in neighbourhoods with high levels of public greenspace (corresponding to less residential land) supported more bird species and individuals overall, and more woodland-dependent species, insectivores and hollow-nesters. Total greenspace area was more important (included in the best ranked models for all bird responses) than the configuration (number, average size and connectivity) of greenspace patches. The majority of species were common suburban birds, indicating that species we assume are tolerant to urban areas will be negatively affected by increasing residential density. Parks form part of an interconnected network of urban open space. For parks to continue to support a diverse native bird community, the network must be viewed, managed, and maintained in its entirety. We suggest three key management actions to improve the bird diversity values of urban greenspaces in compact cities: (1) Increase urban greenspace cover in residential neighbourhoods. (2) Increase vegetation structure in greenspace. (3) Encourage homeowners to plant trees and shrubs.

AB  - Mohave ground squirrels Xerospermophilus mohavensis Merriam are small grounddwelling rodents that have a highly restricted range in the northwest Mojave Desert, California, USA. Their small natural range is further reduced by habitat loss from agriculture, urban development, military training and recreational activities. Development of wind and solar resources for re newable energy has the potential to further re duce existing habitat. We used maximum entropy habitat models with observation data to describe current potential habitat in the context of future renewable energy development in the region. While 16% of historic habitat has been impacted by, or lost to, urbanization at present, an additional 10% may be affected by renewable energy development in the near future. Our models show that X. mohavensis habitat suitability is higher in areas slated for renewable energy development than in surrounding areas. We provide habitat maps that can be used to develop sampling designs, evaluate conservation corridors and inform development planning in the region.

AB  - Landscape restoration through revegetation is being increasingly used in the conservation management of degraded landscapes. To effectively plan restoration programs information is required on how the landscape context of revegetation influences biodiversity gains. Here, we investigate the relative influence of patch area and connectivity on bird species richness and abundance within urban revegetation patches in Brisbane, Australia. We carried out bird surveys at 20 revegetation sites, and used hierarchical partitioning and model selection to test the relative importance of patch area (the area of revegetation including all directly connected remnant vegetation) and landscape connectivity (the vegetated area connected by less than 10 m, 20 m, 30 m, 40 m and 50 m cleared gaps). We controlled for a number of possible confounding variables within the hierarchical partitioning procedure. Both the hierarchical partitioning and model selection procedures indicated that connectivity had an important influence on bird species richness. Patch area in combination with connectivity were important influencing factors on overall bird abundance. We also carried out the hierarchical partitioning procedure for bird abundance data within a range of feeding guilds, yielding results specific to species groups. Overall our data suggest that greater connectivity enhances the habitat area that colonists can arrive from (resulting in greater species richness), whereas increased patch area allows for increased abundance by expanding the habitat available to species already present in a patch. A combined approach where connectivity and overall habitat area is enhanced across the landscape is likely to be necessary to meet long-term conservation objectives. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Connectivity has been an accepted goal in ecological restoration of wilderness areas for some time, but it is a relatively new approach in urban areas. The connectivity analysis presented here explores the numbers and patterns of corridors required to connect urban green spaces as part of an overall biodiversity conservation strategy. Green spaces in this study were weighted based on size and a habitat requirement of 0.5 ha for a hypothetical indicator species. Thirteen potential networks were evaluated using Gamma, Beta, and Cost Ratio indices. The study zone contained 54 green spaces (habitat nodes) with a combined area of 636.5 ha in a total urban area of approximately 2,600 ha. Several models (Travelling Salesman, Paul Revere, and Least Cost to User) were used to evaluate possible connections. These results indicated that at least 325 linkages are necessary to connect half of the nodes. Such large numbers of linkages are only feasible by enhancing the matrix of backyard habitat, planted boulevards, and utility rights-of way found in a city. Strengthening such networks should work well to support the biota protected in urban parks and wildlife refuges and the seasonal migrants that sometimes depend on urban habitats for their survival.

AB  - CONTEXT: Accelerated intensification/disintensification and urbanization are changing agricultural systems and propel the need for spatial approaches to understand sustainability-enhancing resilience. Landscapes are key to this understanding though little is known of the broad-scale, cross-landscape connectivity of social-ecological factors amid changing agricultural systems.OBJECTIVE: This study's goals are to identify broad-scale types of agricultural landscapes in Spain that are associated with intensification/disintensification and urbanization and then to use case studies to assess the types and extent of cross-landscape connectivity. It examines the social-ecological connectivity of environmental resources, resource users, and governance. The overarching purpose is to improve the understanding of socialecological connectivity in strengthening the sustainability-enhancing resilience of agricultural landscapes amid global agri-food changes.METHODS: To pursue these goals, we conducted a structured literature review of publications to identify major types of agricultural landscapes in Spain that reflect intensification/disintensification and urbanization trends. Case studies of agricultural landscapes and connectivity were undertaken in the Madrid and Granada regions. These case studies used a structured interview with experienced professional experts in fields of social-ecological sustainability and agricultural landscapes in each region. Analyses including Latent Block Modelling were applied to interview results on types and extent of cross-landscape connectivity in both conventional and alternative agriculture.RESULTS and CONCLUSIONS: The structured literature review identified the predominance of three types of broad-scale agricultural landscapes in Spain: intensive, "traditional" rural, and peri-urban/urban. Analysis of case-study results revealed variation of the extent and structure of connectivity among clusters of landscape interactions and social-ecological factors. Landscape-level connectivity created both negative agricultural impacts (e.g., extensive water transfers and nutrient pollution in conventional agriculture) and positive impacts (e. g., knowledge system and seed exchanges in alternative agriculture). Interactions of alternative agricultural systems in peri-urban/urban and "traditional" rural landscapes have benefitted from cross-landscape connectivity amid accelerated agricultural change.SIGNIFICANCE: Research and policy on the landscape-level connectivity of agricultural systems are needed to strengthen sustainability-enhancing resilience of both conventional and alternative agriculture. This study's approach and results are a strategic complement to existing emphasis on within-landscape cycles of socialecological factors in alternative agriculture. This study's insights are important in the transition phases of alternative agriculture and associated food systems amid changes due to agricultural intensification/disintensification and urbanization. Understanding selective cross-landscape connectivity is important for spatial approaches to strengthen the sustainability-enhancing resilience of agricultural systems.

AB  - Landscape simplification and degradation through agricultural intensification is widely recognized as a main driver of biodiversity loss. In intensively used agricultural landscapes, patches of semi-natural habitats and particularly connections between them are of high importance for many taxa. Vegetated connections like hedgerows are especially important for foraging and commuting of mobile taxa such as bats. However, the interest of another treeless linear habitat - herbaceous field margins - remains unstudied for insectivorous bats. Field margins are nevertheless known as an important habitat for other taxa, including bat prey. Here we assessed the importance of field margins for bats compared to other landscape variables. We measured bat activity based on a repeated passive acoustic monitoring during 17 complete nights in summer on 112 study sites in an intensively used agricultural landscape. Each night, we sampled bat species activity and community metrics (i. e. species richness and community habitat specialization index) at different distances to field margins, and along a gradient of relative density of field margins. To compare field margin effects with other landscape variables, the sampled sites were selected by keeping a large variability in these other variables (land-cover Shannon diversity index, forests, hedgerows, water bodies, main roads, urban areas, grasslands, number of crops and rapeseed percentage). Only Myotis sp. were affected by herbaceous field margins. Specifically, the Myotis group activity decreased with the distance to herbaceous field margins (i.e. towards field crop cores), and positively correlated with relative density of herbaceous field margins, for which the effect size was comparable to other landscape variables. However, other landscape variables such as the proportion of and the distance to forests, the relative density of and the distance to hedgerows or land-cover Shannon diversity index, affected species richness, community specialization index, and bat activity of species from open, edge and narrow-space foragers, including the Myotis group as well. Our results highlight that herbaceous field margins have a positive effect on the activity of narrow-space bat foragers as Myotis species, but do not replace other landscape variables that drive the activity of the whole community.

AB  - Green roofs are important green spaces in order to improve vegetated area in urban landscapes. They can support ecosystem functionality, including stormwater management, cooling and insulation of buildings, moderation of urban heat island effect, contribution to human health and habitat provisioning. In addition they provide habitats in areas deprived of natural wildlife areas, providing green corridors linking fragmented existing habitats, improve wildlife movement and dispersal, thereby increasing population connectivity and act as refuges for declining or rare species. Unfortunately populations living in urban areas continue to rise and are expected to reach 61% in 2030, which is likely to negatively impact urban green spaces. The aim of this research was to investigate the importance of green roof systems on urban biodiversity. A literature review was undertaken to discover the importance of green roof systems on urban biodiversity. Additionally, feasibility analysis of the planting project of possible extensive green roof application in semi-arid climatic conditions of Cyprus was carried out. Positive effects of the plants on the roof are also discussed. Feasibility analysis was carried out for the NEU car factory management building which was planned as 820 m(2). The following plant species have been suggested for the vegetation of sustainable green roof system in Cyprus; Sedum angelina, Sedum spurium, Sedum glaucophyllum, Thymus vulgaris, Santolina spp., Gaura lindheimeri, Lavandula angustifolia, Rosmarinus officinalis. According to research results 820 m(2) of extensive green roof will cost approximately 37107 Euro. Under Cyprus climatic conditions, this cost analysis estimated that extensive green roof application would cost around 49 Euro per square meter. This research provides valuable information for the importance of green roof establishments within the Mediterranean cityscapes and also has suggestions of vegetation types and roof layers for future green roof projects for the Mediterranean region.

AB  - The last 20 years have seen a dramatic increase in efforts to mitigate the negative effects of roads and traffic on wildlife, including fencing to prevent wildlife-vehicle collisions and wildlife crossing structures to facilitate landscape connectivity. While not necessarily explicitly articulated, the fundamental drivers behind road mitigation are human safety, animal welfare, and/or wildlife conservation. Concomitant with the increased effort to mitigate has been a focus on evaluating road mitigation. So far, research has mainly focussed on assessing the use of wildlife crossing structures, demonstrating that a broad range of species use them. However, this research has done little to address the question of the effectiveness of crossing structures, because use of a wildlife crossing structure does not necessarily equate to its effectiveness. The paucity of studies directly examining the effectiveness of crossing structures is exacerbated by the fact that such studies are often poorly designed, which limits the level of inference that can be made. Without well performed evaluations of the effectiveness of road mitigation measures, we may endanger the viability of wildlife populations and inefficiently use financial resources by installing structures that are not as effective as we think they are. In this paper we outline the essential elements of a good experimental design for such assessments and prioritize the parameters to be measured. The framework we propose will facilitate collaboration between road agencies and scientists to undertake research programs that fully evaluate effectiveness of road mitigation measures. We discuss the added value of road mitigation evaluations for policy makers and transportation agencies and provide recommendations on how to incorporate such evaluations in road planning practices.

AB  - The Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River are imposing barriers for wildlife, and the additive effect of urban and agricultural development that dominates the lower Great Lakes region likely further reduces functional connectivity for many terrestrial species. As the climate warms, species will need to track climate across these barriers. It is important therefore to investigate land cover and bioclimatic hypotheses that may explain the northward expansion of species through the Great Lakes. We investigated the functional connectivity of a vagile generalist, the bobcat, as a representative generalist forest species common to the region. We genotyped tissue samples collected across the region at 14 microsatellite loci and compared different landscape hypotheses that might explain the observed gene flow or functional connectivity. We found that the Great Lakes and the additive influence of forest stands with either low or high canopy cover and deep lake-effect snow have disrupted gene flow, whereas intermediate forest cover has facilitated gene flow. Functional connectivity in southern Ontario is relatively low and was limited in part by the low amount of forest cover. Pathways across the Great Lakes were through the Niagara region and through the Lower Peninsula of Michigan over the Straits of Mackinac and the St. Marys River. These pathways are important routes for bobcat range expansion north of the Great Lakes and are also likely pathways that many other mobile habitat generalists must navigate to track the changing climate. The extent to which species can navigate these routes will be important for determining the future biodiversity of areas north of the Great Lakes.

AB  - Urban grasslands are usually managed as short-cut lawns and have limited biodiversity. Urban grasslands with low-intensity management are species rich and can perform numerous ecosystem services, but they are not accepted by citizens everywhere. Further, increasing and/or maintaining a relatively high level of plant species richness in an urban environment is limited by restricted plant dispersal. In this study, we examined the connectivity of urban grasslands and prioritized the grassland patches with regard to their role in connectivity in an urban landscape. We used high-resolution data from a land use system to map grassland patches in Wroclaw city, Silesia, southwest Poland, Central Europe, and applied a graph theory approach to assess their connectivity and prioritization. We next constructed a model for several dispersal distance thresholds (2, 20, 44, 100, and 1000 m), reflecting plants with differing dispersal potential. Our results revealed low connectivity of urban grassland patches, especially for plants with low dispersal ability (2-20 m). The priority of patches was correlated with their area for all dispersal distance thresholds. Most of the large patches important to overall connectivity were located in urban peripheries, while in the city center, connectivity was more restricted and grassland area per capita was the lowest. The presence of a river created a corridor, allowing plants to migrate along watercourse, but it also created a barrier dividing the system. The results suggest that increasing the plant species richness in urban grasslands in the city center requires seed addition.

AB  - Context Maintaining connectivity in landscapes where natural ecosystems are quickly replaced by human land-uses is a challenge. To reduce the effects of habitat loss, ecological corridors have been proposed as a relevant tool for landscape planning. Objective We aimed to develop a spatial model to identify and prioritize riparian corridors to improve landscape connectivity. Methods The model considers the effect of the land-use/cover types and remaining forests on the movement capacity of a focal species sensitive to fragmentation. Since landscape elements act as barriers or promoters to ecological fluxes, suitability values were set according to the element's ability in providing habitat. The model recognizes the effect of the contact between associated elements along the riparian corridor's width and length and corrects their suitability. These procedures enabled the calculation of the Utility Factor, resulting in a measure of the quality of the corridor. Results The results show that the model assists the identification of the riparian corridor's sections where connectivity is hampered and management efforts are required to maintain landscape connectivity. In addition, it can be applied to select the corridors dominated by large forests, which could be designed for conservation purposes. The two study cases evidence that the model is flexible, adjustable to distinct landscapes, and the decision-maker's objectives. Conclusions We concluded that the proposed strategy helps decision-makers to prioritize the territories for managing or preserving connectivity. Finally, the method provides quantitative information that would not be perceived by just interpreting land-use/cover maps.

AB  - Conservation of biodiversity is an important global challenge to ensuring future sustainability. University campuses can provide valuable resources for biodiversity; however, this is not yet fully recognized and sufficiently researched. The present study was carried out to show the biodiversity value of different green spaces at the Chiba University Nishi-Chiba Campus. Butterflies were chosen as indicators at ten sites: one intensive green roof, four meadows, two roads, two open spaces and one kitchen garden. From June 2010 to November 2010, butterfly surveys were carried out by transect counts from 8:00 am to 12:00 pm every two weeks, ten times in total. We identified 705 individuals of 25 species from 5 families. The species were mainly those common to urban areas near Tokyo. The results showed that the highest number of butterfly species and the highest total number of butterflies were observed in the kitchen garden, where various medicinal herbs provided a continuous source of nectar. On the contrary, the lowest total number of butterflies was found on the intensive green roof, although the Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H') value was high. The meadows provided a valuable habitat for the butterflies, and the roads connecting the campus green spaces were an important passageway for the butterflies. In the open spaces, areas planted with flowerbeds attracted a high number of butterflies. In conclusion, the university campus provided favorable habitats for butterflies; however, careful planting design and management is required to maintain nectar sources and host plants to maximize the biodiversity benefits of each green space.

AB  - Urbanization is a worldwide problem affecting wildlife negatively. Cities cause habitat suppression, fragmentation, among other disease spreading, suitable conditions for exotic species, and direct animal kills-consequently, local native species might be extinct. Still, urban areas can also provide biodiversity maintenance because some species can be adapted to the urban environment. Here, we assess how the urban environment influences the displacement of native turquoise-fronted Amazon (Amazona aestiva). We created a map of environmental suitability to modeling A. aestiva displacement routes among three protected areas in Brasilia, Brazil. We tested (1) if the modeled corridors tend to be near to the areas where A. aestiva occurs and (2) how landscape spatial heterogeneity influences those modeled routes. We expected to observe oriented routes in homogeneous areas (few pixels with high-frequency selection), and the opposite in heterogeneous areas. To test our hypotheses, we recorded A. aestiva and correlated its presence/absence with the modeled corridors and correlated the landscape spatial heterogeneity with different metrics of the modeled corridors. Our results indicate that at least one of the modeled routes was near to the points with parrots. In general, potential dispersal routes with little spatial variation occurred in homogeneous areas. In the urban matrix, potential routes were less oriented with more spatial variation. Our results suggest the adoption of different strategies to manage the natural environment in an urban matrix. By managing the spatial heterogeneity, it is possible to direct how the species use the space, promoting the displacement to desired areas, avoiding the more urbanized ones.

AB  - Awareness of the adverse ecological effects of road and other large construction projects has resulted in a rapidly growing demand to quantitatively predict and evaluate the effects on gene flow among plants and animals in natural habitats. In this study, we evaluated the effects of different road construction scenarios on animal species movement by using the methods of ecological landscape connectivity in the typical regions of Yunnan Province, China. The results showed landscape connectivity levels (Probability of Connectivity (PC)) decreased after road construction and species with lower dispersal abilities were more affected to the subsequent habitat fragmentation. First level roads affected landscape connectivity most significantly. At a distance of 100 m, the PC index decreased more than 50%. Further analysis suggested that the use of landscape connectivity to assess landscape processes revealed the adverse effects on the species movement more effectively compared with the traditional landscape pattern analysis. In addition, we conducted a graph theory and a least-cost modeling discussion, it is obvious that they are powerful tools to represent and analyze landscape networks with respect to related species movement. Network analysis offers a quantitative and simple but effective tool for ecological process assessment and biological conservation on large scales.

AB  - Urban Green Spaces (UGSs) can provide social and ecological benefits, and the coordination of these two functions will largely advance human-nature harmony in cities. As such, we proposed a comprehensive framework to evaluate UGSs multifunctionality, i.e. the coupling coordination relationship of ecological connectivity and spatial accessibility of UGSs. Wuhan City in Central China was taken as a case study, and multiple ecosystem service values of green space patches and the disordered use of UGSs multifunctionality were explored. The results demonstrated low-level coupling coordination of UGSs multifunctionality in Wuhan. More than 70% of UGSs were imbalanced, 27.91% of which featured small sizes, low connectivity and accessibility. We suggest that planners should optimize UGSs arrangement to improve species reachability, especially for species with dispersal distance less than 4 km, and to create 15-minute community life circles for residents at the same time. Our findings are expected to support the promotion of UGSs multifunctionality and the balance of urban development and habitat conservation.

AB  - Landscape connectivity, defined as the degree to which the landscape facilitates or impedes movement among resource patches, has been considered to be a key issue for biodiversity conservation. However, the use of landscape connectivity measurements has been strongly criticised due to uncertainties in the methods used and the lack of validation. Moreover, measurements are typically restricted to the population level, whereas management is generally carried out at the community level. Here, we used satellite imagery and network metrics to predict the landscape connectivity at community level for semi-natural herbaceous patches in an urban area near Paris (France). We tested different measurement methods, both taking into account and ignoring the spatial heterogeneity of matrix resistance estimated by the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), and quantifying the link strength between patches with the shortest path and flow metrics. We assessed the fit of these connectivity predictions with empirical data on plant communities embedded in an urban matrix. Our results indicate that the best fit with the empirical data is obtained when the connectivity is estimated with the flow metric and takes into account the matrix heterogeneity. Overall, our study helps to estimate the landscape connectivity of urban areas and makes recommendations for ways in which we might optimise landscape planning with respect to conservation of urban biodiversity.

AB  - Land cover and use changes are important to study for their impact on ecosystem services and ultimately on sustainability. In urban environments, a particularly important research question addresses the relationship between urbanization-related changes and biodiversity, subject to controversies in the literature. Birds are an important ecological group, and useful for answering this question. The present study builds upon the hypothesis according to which avian diversity decreases with urbanization. In order to answer it, a sample of 4245 observations from 650 sites in Annaba, Algeria, obtained through the point abundance index method, were investigated by computing Shannon-Wiener's diversity index and the species richness, mapping them, and analyzing the results statistically. The findings confirm the study hypothesis and are relevant for planning, as they stress the role of urban green spaces as biodiversity hotspots, and plead for the need of connecting them. From a planning perspective, the results emphasize the need for interconnecting the green infrastructure through avian corridors. Moreover, the results fill in an important lack of data on the biodiversity of the region, and are relevant for other similar Mediterranean areas. Future studies could use the findings to compare with data from other countries and continents.

AB  - Urban riparian zones are highly valuable for a range of environmental, social and economic reasons. Despite their ecological complexity, legislative instruments underpinning riparian protection focus predominantly on minimum corridor widths required to fulfill environmental functions. This study sought to identify the dominant environmental variables that influence riparian corridor biodiversity in northern Sydney, Australia. Ant and plant assemblages were sampled from 18 riparian corridors of various widths. Environmental data pertaining to each corridor were collected using field and desktop surveys. Generalised Linear Modelling found perimeter:area ratio and the gradient of the slope perpendicular to the stream to predict significantly ant and plant richness. Plant richness was also influenced by vegetation community type and corridor width. When streamside vegetation communities were considered in isolation, many of the same factors were found to influence species richness. Likewise, Distance-based Linear Modelling identified vegetation community type and landscape connectivity as significant predictors of ant composition both in streamside habitats and those located across the full width of each riparian corridor sampled. While width was the best predictor of plant assemblage composition across the whole riparian corridor, streamside vegetation was influenced more significantly by soil pH. This result arose principally due to a dominance of exotic plants in alkaline soils. Although wider corridors were likely to encompass a greater variety of biotic assemblages, landscape and site scale environmental characteristics appeared to be of greater ecological significance. Environmental managers should therefore consider these factors and target weed invasion when seeking to enhance biodiversity in urban riparian corridors. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Evaluating how habitat heterogeneity and landscape connectivity influence fine-scale population processes of gene flow and spatial population structure is key for understanding animal dispersal. Liomys pictus is a heteromyid rodent that inhabits tropical dry deciduous and semideciduous forests, where it is a dominant, abundant species and a key element on the ecosystem as seed disperser. We evaluated how landscape features shaped the genetic structure and gene flow at a fine scale among L. pictus populations in a well-conserved natural environment. On the basis of L. pictus ecological characteristics (e.g. dominant species, female philopatry), we predicted that forested areas (irrespective of vegetation type) should facilitate dispersal if the forest vegetation acted as a kind of corridor, and that these patterns will be different between sexes. We tested these assumptions (104 individuals, six sampling localities, 14 microsatellite loci) after checking for discrete genetic groups using Bayesian clustering methods, by assessing the effect of landscape variables on patterns of gene flow combining Mantel and partial Mantel tests, least-cost path and circuit theories. L. pictus differentiated into genetic clusters delimited by clear landscape boundaries. Accordingly, resistance hypotheses results showed that precipitation and stream channels were the main environmental and landscape attributes influencing gene flow. Exchange of a majority of migrants was detected from the center into other sampling localities, indicating higher dispersal throughout deciduous and semideciduous forest corridors, whereas isolation by distance was found only for females. Our approach allowed us to elucidate animal environmental space use, identifying some of the landscape features linked to the species dispersal patterns, which can serve as a basis for the study and comparison with other tropical forests and species. It can also have conservation applications, for instance, preserving the forested corridors we identified as significant for dispersal can likely benefit other codistributed, threatened rodent species.

AB  - In urban areas, each land use type possesses its own vegetation characteristics. The purpose of this study is to determine the vegetation structure of land uses in Aydin urban area by means of vegetation cover analysis. Vegetation cover analysis is an indicator of different land uses' contribution to wildlife habitat value. In the analysis, the variables of 1) vegetation ratio, 2) vegetation cover naturalness level, and 3) vegetation cover structural diversity have been used. Results of the analysis indicated that in terms of sum of all variables, natural areas (93%) obtained the highest value followed by highways (76%), and low-density residential areas (67%). Riverbeds (45%), commercial areas (39%) and industrial areas (34%) received the lowest value. The results shows that natural areas are critical in maintaining the ecological qualities of urban environments; improvement of the open spaces in the increasing residential developments contribute to the urban open space system significantly; and ecological corridor alternatives such as roads and water-ways presents opportunities in improving the urban ecosystems.

AB  - For better or worse, in those parts of the world with a widespread farming, livestock rising, and urban expansion, the maintenance of species richness and ecosystem services cannot depend only upon protected natural sites. Can they rely on a network of cultural landscapes endowed with their own associated biodiversity? We analyze the effects of land-cover change on landscape ecological patterns and processes that sustain bird species richness associated to cropland-grassland landscapes in the Great Plains-Denver metropolitan edge. Our purpose is to assess the potential contribution to bird biodiversity maintenance of Great Plain's cropland-grassland mosaics kept as farmland green belts in the edge of metropolitan areas. We present a quantitative landscape ecology assessment of land-cover changes (1930-2010) experienced in five Great Plains counties in Colorado. Several landscape metrics assess the diversity of land-cover patterns and their impact on ecological connectivity indices. These metrics are applied to historical land-cover maps and datasets drawn from aerial photos and satellite imagery. The results show that the cropland-grassland mosaics that link the metropolitan edge with the surrounding habitats sheltered in less human-disturbed areas provide a heterogeneous land matrix were a high bird species richness exists. They also suggest that keeping multifunctional farmland-grassland green belts near the edge of metropolitan areas may provide important ecosystem services, supplementing traditional conservation policies. Our maps and indicators can be used for selecting certain types of landscape patterns and priority areas on which biodiversity conservation efforts and land-use planning can concentrate.

AB  - The effects of urbanization on bats are poorly understood, but published data suggests it might be detrimental to them. Even though urban parks provide refuge to native biota, the nature of the urban landscape exacerbates the insularization process. In order to evaluate if wooded streets in an urban landscape provide connectivity for bats, we compared bat community structure in three different types of habitats: urban parks, wooded streets and non-wooded streets. Sampling occurred monthly from August 2006 to July 2007 in the city of Vitria, southeastern Brazil. Richness, relative abundance and diversity were higher in urban parks and lower in non-wooded streets. Jaccard's similarity index showed that the wooded streets are more similar to non-wooded streets than to urban parks. Urbanization may benefit generalist species by providing new resources, but for specialist species critical resources may be lost and persistence endangered. There is evidence that wooded streets may provide some degree of connectivity for birds in urban landscapes, but our results suggest that this is not the case, with wooded streets being used by few individuals of a few species. Vegetation cover is important to maintain bat diversity in urban centers. Activities like landscape planning and gardening should include biodiversity data in their outputs in order to better design a landscape that improves the likelihood of persistence of bats.

AB  - The problem of institutional fit in social-ecological systems has been empirically documented and conceptually discussed for decades, yet there is a shortage of approaches to systematically and quantitatively examine the level of fit. We address this gap, focusing on spatial fit in an urban and peri-urban regional landscape. Such landscapes typically exhibit significant fragmentation of remnant habitats, which can limit critical species dispersal. This may have detrimental effects on species persistence and ecosystem functioning if land use is planned without consideration of the spatial patterns of fragmentation. Managing habitat fragmentation is particularly challenging when the scale of fragmentation reaches beyond the control of single managers, thereby requiring different actors to coordinate their activities to address the problem at the appropriate scale. We present a research approach that maps patterns of collaborations between actors who manage different parts of a landscape, and then relates these patterns to structures of ecological connectivity. We applied our approach to evaluate the fit between a collaborative wetland management network comprising all 26 municipalities in the Stockholm County in Sweden and an ecologically defined network of dispersed but ecologically interconnected wetlands. Many wetlands in this landscape are either intersected by the boundary between two or more municipalities, or are located close to such boundaries, which implies a degree of ecological interconnectedness and a need for intermunicipal coordination related to wetland management across boundaries. We first estimated the level of ecological connectivity between wetlands in neighboring municipalities, and then used this estimate to elaborate the level of social-ecological fit vis-a-vis intermunicipal collaboration. We found that the level of fit was generally weak. Also, we identified critical misalignments of ecological connectivity and intermunicipal collaboration, respectively, as well as collaborations that represented an adequate alignment. These findings inform on where to most effectively allocate limited resources of collaborative capacity to enhance the level of social-ecological fit. Our approach and results are illustrated using maps, which facilitates the potential application of this method in land use planning practice.

AB  - Urban small water bodies, such as ponds, are essential elements of human socio-economic landscapes. Ponds also provide important habitats for species that would otherwise not survive in the urban environment. Knowledge on the biodiversity of urban ponds and the relationship between their ecological value and factors linked to urbanization and socio-economic status is crucial for decisions on where and how to establish and manage ponds in cities to deliver maximum biodiversity benefits. Our study investigates if the pattern of urban-pond biodiversity can be related to different socio-economic factors, such as level of wealth, education or percentage of buildings of different types. Because of lack of previous studies investigating that, our study is of exploratory character and many different variables are used. We found that the biodiversity of aquatic insects was significantly negatively associated with urbanisation variables such as amount of buildings and number of residents living around ponds. This relationship did not differ depending on the spatial scale of our investigation. In contrast, we did not find a significant relationship with variables representing socio-economic status, such as education level and wealth of people. This latter result suggests that the socio-economic status of residents does not lead to any particular effect in terms of the management and function of ponds that would affect biodiversity. However, there is a need for a finer-scale investigation of the different potential mechanism in which residents in areas with differing socio-economic status could indirectly influence ponds.

AB  - Green-blue space loss and fragmentation are particularly acute in Chinese cities due to rapid urbanization, large ring-road system and the following city compartments. Therefore, connecting urban green-blue spaces has been recently advocated by central government. This paper revised and applied the recently developed urban green network approach to the case of Xi'an city, China, a city which has been rarely studied before from this perspective. The focus was on connecting fragments of urban green-blue spaces to compact green-blue networks, integrating both social and ecological functions into a fully functioning entity. Landscape metric analysis was added to identify that the main city outside the city core should be a planning priority zone. The Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus), Asiatic toad (Bufo gargarizans) and humans at leisure were selected as three focal species to meet the emerged socio-ecological benefits. Sociotope and biotope maps were drawn up to identify patches with high human recreation and wildlife shelter values and providing crucial network structures. Least-cost-path model was used for identifying potential linkages between patches. This model was based on network structures and cost surface, which measures the theoretical energy cost of travelling between landscape elements. By integrating the potential paths for the selected organisms with density analysis, the updated framework generated three improvement maps for species indicators, and 10 network corridors for establishing green-blue networks at city scale. At neighbourhood scale, one site with habitat and linkage examples illustrated specific measures that could be taken in local practice.

AB  - Urbanization has resulted is severe alteration and destruction of natural habitats. Durban, South Africa, is one of the fastest growing cities in the world and the demand for land is increasing. The Durban Metropolitan Open Space System (D'MOSS) was created for both ecological and social enhancement through an integrated approach to urban open space establishment and management. We assessed a subsection of the D'MOSS for its contribution to biodiversity enhancement. Invertebrates were selected as indicators of diversity, Pitfall trapping was conducted on a seasonal basis on traffic islands from two landscaping management regimes: extensive mown areas (i.e. limited structural diversity) and the inclusion of indigenous and exotic shrubs, herbs and trees (i.e. structurally enhanced). The influence of adjacent remnant natural areas as a source for these islands, was also assessed. Species-area and species-distance predictions based on island biogeography theory were tested to determine whether they apply at this small scale. In this study, urban traffic islands accommodated 232 invertebrate morphospecies, i.e. 71% of the estimated species richness for a larger sampling effort. A total of 23 881 individuals were sampled, 81 5, of which were a single species of ant and a collembolan. Species abundance followed expected seasonality (high in summer and low in winter) irrespective of island treatment. While enhanced islands supported a higher richness during spring, as well as a greater number of unique species overall, our results were riot conclusive in their support of either the movement of invertebrates along corridors of semi-natural vegetation, or the value of larger areas of urban open space. The lack of independence between distance and area in this study, the limited scale over which diversity was measured, and the influence of multiple sources of emigration are discussed.

AB  - Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii) is the largest native mammal that inhabits the Neotropics, and it is enlisted as Endangered by the IUCN Red List. The historic distribution of this species included the area from southern Mexico to northern Colombia. However, its distribution and populations have been reduced drastically during the past 30 years. The main threats for Baird's tapir are the direct persecution for subsistence hunting, habitat destruction, and habitat fragmentation. In this study, we used camera traps and occupancy models to identify the landscape characteristics that were associated with the occurrence of tapirs in the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, which is one of the most important populations of the species in Mexico, with the aim to identify areas with habitat suitability for the species. We used our best occupancy model to generate a resistance matrix to develop a model of habitat connectivity using Circuit Theory. According to the best occupancy model, the most suitable areas for this species were the forested areas located at the highest elevations of the mountain ranges that provided rugged terrain. We identified three critical corridors to allow for the connectivity of tapir populations in the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, and one of these corridors provides connectivity between this population and the population in the Ocote Biosphere Reserve. With this approach, we propose a conservation strategy for the species that incorporates a more realistic and detailed scheme of Baird's tapir occurrence in the Sierra Madre de Chiapas region. Priority actions to conserve tapirs in the Sierra Madre de Chiapas over the long term include ensuring the complete protection of prime habitat for the species, improved connectivity by protecting forest cover, implementation mitigation measures in areas where paved roads interrupt connectivity of populations, and eradicating poaching of the species in the region completely.

We used expert-opinion and empirically derived models to investigate landscape connectivity at two spatial scales among bobcats Lynx rufus in New Hampshire, USA. Paths of marked bobcats were compared to random movements in the context of program CIRCUITSCAPE. At the local scale (within home ranges), the empirical model (based on observations and telemetry locations) performed better than the expert-opinion model. At the regional scale (state of New Hampshire), both models identified urban development as a potential barrier; however, the models differed in predicting how specific natural features (e.g. mountains and large water bodies) and some roads affected bobcat movements. When compared with bobcat population structure based on genetic information, the expert-opinion model overestimated the influence of roads. Alternatively, the empirical model overestimated the influence of snow. Our findings indicate that the empirically based resistance model was better at describing landscape-scale effects, whereas the expert-opinion model provided a good understanding of gene flow at a regional scale. As such, both models may be considered complementary. Bobcats were sensitive to disruptions imposed by habitat fragmentation and thus may be a suitable focal species for evaluating the consequences of land-use changes on the regional suite of mesocarnivores.

AB  - P>1. Linear features associated with transportation and riparian corridors are known to inhibit the mobility of birds and other wildlife, yet the factors contributing to their barrier effects are poorly understood. The diversity of roads in urban landscapes provides an opportunity for elucidating the relative importance of factors such as noise, traffic volume, gap width and adjacent vegetation on animal movement.
   2. Using an avian mobbing call as a lure, we tested the willingness of forest songbirds to cross four types of linear features in the urban landscape of Calgary, Alberta, Canada: (1) roads of varying widths and traffic volumes, (2) conventional railways and light transit lines, (3) transportation bridges across riparian corridors, and (4) rivers.
   3. Using mixed effects logistic regression, we found that the size of the gap in vegetation was the most important determinant of movement (P < 0 center dot 001). As the gap in vegetation exceeded 30 m, the likelihood of movement decreased dramatically and by 45 m, birds were only half as likely to move across gaps as they were to move an equivalent distance in continuous tree cover. Traffic volume also had a significant dampening effect on movement (odds ratio = 0 center dot 952 per 1000 vehicle per day increase; P < 0 center dot 001) and generally explained more variation in the data than noise levels.
   4. Railroads proved to be the most permeable of the features we tested, probably owing to their relatively narrow width, which never exceeded 30 m. Surprisingly, rivers were less permeable than the anthropogenic linear features we tested, with a significant barrier effect evident even at widths < 50 m.
   5. The birds in our study showed a marked preference for flying over, rather than under, transportation bridges, particularly when adjacent vegetation was available.
   6.Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that linear features, both anthropogenic and natural, can significantly impede the movements of forest songbirds and that managing adjacent vegetation is a potentially effective way to mitigate these barrier effects in cities and other fragmented landscapes.

AB  - In many cities worldwide, urbanization is leading to the rapid and extensive fragmentation of native vegetation into small and scattered urban remnants. We investigated the effects of fragmentation on plant species richness and abundance in 30 remnant Banksia woodlands in the rapidly expanding city of Perth, located in the southwestern Australian global biodiversity hotspot. We considered a comprehensive set of factors characterizing landscape fragmentation dynamics (current and historical remnant area and connectivity, time since isolation, and trajectories of landscape change), disturbance regimes (fire frequency, grazing, and intensity of human activities), and local environmental conditions (soil nutrient status and litter depth). We used generalized linear mixed models to determine the interactive effects of time since remnant isolation and remnant area on plant species richness, and structural equation models to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of landscape and local factors on plant species richness and abundance. Fragmentation impacts were most rapid in smaller remnants. Indeed, in the small remnants, native plant species richness was halved in only a few decades after isolation, suggesting an underlying rapid loss of habitat quality. We found that richness and abundance of woody species were higher in historically large remnants and lower in the rural areas, despite these rural remnants showing greater connectivity. Richness of native herbaceous species declined with time since isolation, mainly in the smaller remnants, and this was associated with altered soil properties. Furthermore, increased litter depth (possibly indicating higher productivity) and increased abundance of nonnative herbaceous species in the older and smaller remnants was associated with a decline in the abundance of native herbaceous species. Our study suggests that in rapidly expanding cities, landscape fragmentation can have major and complex effects on remnant vegetation. Yet these impacts might take several decades to manifest themselves. Hence, understanding the long-term conservation capacity of newly formed remnants, which is key to setting conservation priorities, requires consideration of landscape fragmentation and land use history. Moreover, the smaller and older remnants may already display changes due to fragmentation, providing clues for urban planning and ecosystem management that help to protect urban remnant plant diversity.

AB  - Context With the expansion in urbanization, understanding how biodiversity responds to the altered landscape becomes a major concern. Most studies focus on habitat effects on biodiversity, yet much less attention has been paid to surrounding landscape matrices and their joint effects. Objective We investigated how habitat and landscape matrices affect waterbird diversity across scales in the Yangtze River Floodplain, a typical area with high biodiversity and severe human-wildlife conflict. Methods The compositional and structural features of the landscape were calculated at fine and coarse scales. The ordinary least squares regression model was adopted, following a test showing no significant spatial autocorrelation in the spatial lag and spatial error models, to estimate the relationship between landscape metrics and waterbird diversity. Results Well-connected grassland and shrub surrounded by isolated and regular-shaped developed area maintained higher waterbird diversity at fine scales. Regular-shaped developed area and cropland, irregular-shaped forest, and aggregated distribution of wetland and shrub positively affected waterbird diversity at coarse scales. Conclusions Habitat and landscape matrices jointly affected waterbird diversity. Regular-shaped developed area facilitated higher waterbird diversity and showed the most pronounced effect at coarse scales. The conservation efforts should not only focus on habitat quality and capacity, but also habitat connectivity and complexity when formulating development plans. We suggest planners minimize the expansion of the developed area into critical habitats and leave buffers to maintain habitat connectivity and shape complexity to reduce the disturbance to birds. Our findings provide important insights and practical measures to protect biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes.

AB  - Movement of individuals promotes colonization of new areas, gene flow among local populations, and has implications for the spread of infectious agents and the control of pest species. Wild Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) are common in highly urbanized areas but surprisingly little is known of their population structure. We sampled individuals from 11 locations within Baltimore, Maryland, to characterize the genetic structure and extent of gene flow between areas within the city. Clustering methods and a neighbour-joining tree based on pairwise genetic distances supported an east-west division in the inner city, and a third cluster comprised of historically more recent sites. Most individuals (similar to 95%) were assigned to their area of capture, indicating strong site fidelity. Moreover, the axial dispersal distance of rats (62 m) fell within typical alley length. Several rats were assigned to areas 2-11.5 km away, indicating some, albeit infrequent, long-distance movement within the city. Although individual movement appears to be limited (30-150 m), locations up to 1.7 km are comprised of relatives. Moderate F-ST, differentiation between identified clusters, and high allelic diversity indicate that regular gene flow, either via recruitment or migration, has prevented isolation. Therefore, ecology of commensal rodents in urban areas and life-history characteristics of Norway rats likely counteract many expected effects of isolation or founder events. An understanding of levels of connectivity of rat populations inhabiting urban areas provides information about the spatial scale at which populations of rats may spread disease, invade new areas, or be eradicated from an existing area without reinvasion.

AB  - Animal biodiversity in cities is generally expected to be uniformly reduced, but recent studies show that this is modulated by the composition and configuration of Urban Green Areas (UGAs). UGAs represent a heterogeneous network of vegetated spaces in urban settings that have repeatedly shown to support a significant part of native diurnal animal biodiversity. However, nocturnal taxa have so far been understudied, constraining our understanding of the role of UGAs on maintaining ecological connectivity and enhancing overall biodiversity. We present a well-replicated multi-city study on the factors driving bat and nocturnal insect biodiversity in three European cities. To achieve this, we sampled bats with ultrasound recorders and flying insects with light traps during the summer of 2018. Results showed a greater abundance and diversity of bats and nocturnal insects in the city of Zurich, followed by Antwerp and Paris. We identified artificial lighting in the UGA to lower bat diversity by probably filtering out light-sensitive species. We also found a negative correlation between both bat activity and diversity and insect abundance, suggesting a top-down control. An in-depth analysis of the Zurich data revealed divergent responses of the nocturnal fauna to landscape variables, while pointing out a bottom-up control of insect diversity on bats. Thus, to effectively preserve biodiversity in urban environments, UGAs management decisions should take into account the combined ecological needs of bats and nocturnal insects and consider the specific spatial topology of UGAs in each city.

AB  - Cities contain a diverse range of habitats that support plant establishment and persistence. This study focuses on a particular vertical artificial habitat: masonry retaining walls in Hong Kong. We explored the diversity and co-existence of different plant growth forms, synoptic assessment of habitat conditions, and relationship between habitat factors and vegetation occurrence. Some 270 walls with notable plant colonization in old districts were studied. We surveyed intrinsic wall fabric, extrinsic site condition, tree species and abundance, and other types of plant cover. The data were evaluated with the help of principal component and multiple regression analyses. A wide assemblage of species and growth forms have established spontaneously on walls. The tree flora is dominated by Moraceae (Mulberry family) members, genus Ficus (figs or banyans), and particularly Ficus microcarpa. Trees with strangler characteristics pre-adapted to grow on the vertical habitat are strongly favoured, followed by ruderals and garden escapees. Natives outnumber exotics by a large margin. Multiple wall attributes could be condensed into four factors, classified as water-nutrient supply, habitat connectivity, structure-maintenance, and habitat size. The action of habitat factors on vegetation occurrence hinges on plant growth form and dimension. The occurrence of diminutive lichen-moss is related to the fundamental sustenance water-nutrient factor. The bigger mature trees are more dependent on the larger-scale habitat size factor. The medium-sized plants, including herbs, shrubs and tree seedlings, are contingent upon the dual influence of water-nutrient and habitat connectivity. Spatial contiguity with natural ecosystem can secure continual supplies of seeds, water, nutrient, genial microclimate, and clean air to foster wall vegetation growth. The conservation of walls and their companion flora could avoid degrading or reducing these critical enabling factors. The urban ecological heritage deserves to be protected from unnecessary, misinformed and harmful impacts. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Animal movement can be significantly altered in human-dominated landscapes such as urban and peri-urban areas, where habitat is often fragmented and/or linear. Knowledge regarding how wildlife respond to anthropogenic change is vital for informing conservation efforts in such landscapes, including the design of nature reserves and wildlife corridors. To better understand how threatened species persist and behave within human-dominated landscapes, we examined the home range and space use of the nationally endangered southern brown bandicootIsoodon obesulus obesulusin peri-urban Melbourne, Australia's second-largest city. Specifically, we examined whether: (1) bandicoots were confined to linear strips of remnant vegetation or also made use of the broader highly modified landscape matrix; (2) the configuration of the linear vegetated strips affected home range shape; and (3) home range area differed between bandicoots living in linear strips and those in larger remnant habitat patches. We found that: (1) 71% of adult males and 33% of adult females used the matrix, but non-dispersing juveniles were entirely confined to the linear strips; males also travelled greater distances into the matrix (away from the vegetated strips) than females; (2) bandicoots had longer home ranges in narrower strips and males had longer home ranges than females; and (3) home range area for both sexes was smaller in linear strips than has been recorded in other studies in larger remnant habitats. Our study highlights the importance of retaining narrow, fragmented and modified vegetation to accommodate threatened biodiversity within human-dominated landscapes, but suggests the surrounding matrix may also offer important resources for adaptable species, such as bandicoots. Supporting off-reserve conservation of biodiversity in novel ecosystems is increasingly pertinent in our rapidly urbanizing world.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is increasing as a result of anthropogenic activities, especially in urban areas. Dispersal through fragmented habitats is key for species to spread, persist in metapopulations and shift range in response to climate change. However, high habitat connectivity may also hasten the spread of invasive species.
   To develop a model of spread in fragmented landscapes and apply it to the spread of an invasive insect in urban woodland.
   We applied a patch-based model, based on electric network theory, to model the current and predicted future spread of oak processionary moth (OPM: Thaumetopoea processionea) from its source in west London. We compared the pattern of 'effective distance' from the source (i.e. the patch 'voltage' in the model) with the observed spread of the moth from 2006 to 2012.
   We showed that 'effective distance' fitted current spread of OPM. Patches varied considerably in their 'current' and 'power' (metrics from the model), which is an indication of their importance in the future spread of OPM.
   Patches identified as 'important' are potential 'pinch points' and regions of high 'flow', where resources for detection and management will be most cost-effectively deployed. However, data on OPM dispersal and the distribution of oak trees limited the strength of our conclusions, so should be priorities for further data collection. This application of electric network theory can be used to inform landscape-scale conservation initiatives both to reduce the spread of invasives and to facilitate large-scale species' range shifts in response to climate change.

AB  - Evaluating fine-scale population structure of multiple species in the same landscape increases our ability to identify common patterns as well as discern ecological differences among species' landscape genetic relationships. In the Palouse bioregion of northern Idaho, USA, 99% of the native prairie has been converted to nonirrigated agriculture and exotic grasslands. Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) and long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) in this area breed almost entirely in artificial ponds on private land. We used genetic distances (F-ST and D-c) derived from eight microsatellite loci in 783 samples to evaluate the relationships among sympatric breeding populations (N = 20 and 26) of these species in a 213-km2 landscape. Both species showed a pattern of isolation by distance that was not improved when distance was measured along drainages instead of topographically corrected straight lines (P < 0.01). After testing for autocorrelation among genetic distances, we used an information theoretic approach to model landscape resistance based on slope, soil type, solar insolation, and land cover, and multi-model inference to rank the resistance of landscape surfaces to dispersal (represented by genetic distance). For both species, urban and rural developed land cover provided the highest landscape resistances. Resistance values for long-toed salamanders followed a moisture gradient where forest provided the least resistance, while agriculture and shrub/clearcut provided the least resistance for Columbia spotted frogs. Comparative landscape genetics can be a powerful tool for detecting similarities and differences between codistributed species, and resulting models can be used to predict species-specific responses to landscape change.

AB  - Management of wetland connectivity is important for biodiversity conservation. In the modern agricultural landscape, the natural connections between floodplain wetlands have been greatly altered. Agricultural ditches and channelized streams are widely distributed in floodplains, which may contribute to the maintenance of wetland connectivity and biodiversity. To determine how these watercourse networks affect wetland biodiversity, we examined the relationship between the species richness of aquatic animals and wetland connectivity, with a special focus on species mobility. From July to August 2011, fish and aquatic insects were collected from 24 wetlands in northern Japan. To determine the degree of wetland connectivity, we assessed the relative importance of individual wetlands in maintaining the entire wetland network using two connectivity indices: hydrologic connectivity via watercourses and spatial connectivity defined as Euclidian distances between wetlands using graph theory. We found that only high mobility groups of both taxa could enhance species richness in either a hydrologic (fish) or spatial (insect) wetland network. The species richness of insects with high-flying ability was found to increase as spatial connectivity increased. Furthermore, the species richness of fish with high-swimming ability was positively influenced by hydrologic connectivity, most likely because highly mobile species were able to reach suitable habitats and migrate from source populations in a wetland network owing to their good mobility. Our findings indicate that hydrologic network is important for maintaining biodiversity as well as spatial connectivity. It is important to focus conservation efforts on key wetlands with high hydrologic and spatial connectivity in future wetland management.

AB  - The role of green belts is not only to provide the recreation for human activities but also to improve environmental quality and to provide refuges for wildlife under intensified urban development. After the new demarcation of administrative areas, the influx and construction of industrial zones and commercial buildings has caused a major change of the original landscape in the Dadu hill area in Taichung City, Taiwan. The aims of this study are to provide recommendations pertaining the design of ecological corridors to improve the connectivity of the remaining green places, and the assessment of the health of habitat for the developed urban area. We compared the biodiversity (birds, mammals, plantation) and carbon flux in three different suburban areas including a campus, a metropolitan park and an undeveloped woodland in regular disturbance by human and fire. According to the results of habitat similarity, the metropolitan park and campus were grouped with the higher diversity of birds, but the woodland had the higher diversity of plantation and mammals. Seasonal change is the main factor which affects the carbon flux and vegetation growth situation, and the disturbance by human activities and canopy and coverage by plantation are the causes of fluctuations. The habitat assessment which integrated the biodiversity and carbon flux provided another angle to evaluate the greenbelt design comprehensively. However, the quantification of the whole ecosystem service value is a further direction of environment management, especially in green place conserving under the urban sprawl.

AB  - Urban agglomerations have become a new geographical unit in China, breaking the administrative fortresses between cities, which means that the population and economic activities between cities will become more intensive in the future. Constructing and optimizing the ecological security pattern of urban agglomerations is important for promoting harmonious social-economic development and ecological protection. Using the Harbin-Changchun urban agglomeration as a case study, we have identified ecological sources based on the evaluation of ecosystem functions. Based on the resistance surface modified by nighttime light (NTL) data, the potential ecological corridors were identified using the least-cost path method, and key ecological corridors were extracted using the gravity model. By combining 15 ecological sources, 119 corridors, 3 buffer zones, and 77 ecological nodes, the ecological security pattern (ESP) was constructed. The main land-use types composed of ecological sources and corridors are forest land, cultivated land, grassland, and water areas. Some ecological sources are occupied by construction, while unused land has the potential for ecological development. The ecological corridors in the central region are distributed circularly and extend to southeast side in the form of tree branches with the Songhua River as the central axis. Finally, this study proposes an optimizing pattern with four belts, four zones, one axis, nine corridors, ten clusters and multi-centers to provide decision makers with spatial strategies with respect to the conflicts between urban development and ecological protection during rapid urbanization.

AB  - Beijing, the capital and second largest city of China, expanded in a typical concentric pattern. The urbanized area consists of five concentric zones, which are based on the city's ring road system. Willow trees (Salix spp.) are commonly planted and abundant in the city. In this study, we determined the effects of urbanization on willow trunk-dwelling weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea) in a 3-year survey. Our results indicated that species richness and abundance decreased from outskirts to the urban center. It was estimated that within a 30-km limit, species richness and abundance might be reduced by 0.9 species and 59.3% of individuals per 5 km toward urban center. Landscape variables (e.g., the proportion of impervious surface and distance to urban center) explained 59.4% of species richness and 43.9% of species abundance. Local variables (e.g., plant resources and site size) explained only 4.9% of species richness and 4.7% of species abundance. Our results show that there is a negative relationship between urban expansion and weevil diversity. There are several ways in which such detrimental effects on biodiversity could be mitigated: (1) Optimization of urban landscape structures, as well as vegetation planting; (2) increasing connectivity between urban remnants and natural landscapes in the outskirts of the city; and (3) limiting the proportion of impervious surface in inner urban zones.

AB  - Widespread species that exhibit both high gene flow and the capacity to occupy heterogeneous environments make excellent models for examining local selection processes along environmental gradients. Here we evaluate the influence of temperature and landscape variables on genetic connectivity and signatures of local adaptation in Phaulacridium vittatum, a widespread agricultural pest grasshopper, endemic to Australia. With sampling across a 900-km latitudinal gradient, we genotyped 185 P. vittatum from 19 sites at 11,408 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using ddRAD sequencing. Despite high gene flow across sites (pairwise F-ST = 0.0003-0.08), landscape genetic resistance modelling identified a positive nonlinear effect of mean annual temperature on genetic connectivity. Urban areas and water bodies had a greater influence on genetic distance among sites than pasture, agricultural areas and forest. Together, F-ST outlier tests and environmental association analysis (EAA) detected 242 unique SNPs under putative selection, with the highest numbers associated with latitude, mean annual temperature and body size. A combination of landscape genetic connectivity analysis together with EAA identified mean annual temperature as a key driver of both neutral gene flow and environmental selection processes. Gene annotation of putatively adaptive SNPs matched with gene functions for olfaction, metabolic detoxification and ultraviolet light shielding. Our results imply that this widespread agricultural pest has the potential to spread and adapt under shifting temperature regimes and land cover change.

AB  - Urbanisation is one of the most severe drivers of current global biodiversity loss and has contributed to severe declines in many amphibian species. The aim of this study was to determine whether artificial stormwater ponds, designed to control water flow, can act as refuges for amphibians in urban areas. Moreover, we analysed the influence of habitat and landscape quality on amphibian species richness of 46 stormwater ponds (STOPON) in comparison to 46 control ponds (CONTROL).
   Our study revealed that environmental conditions clearly varied between STOPON and CONTROL. The most pronounced differences were that STOPON were larger, shallower, sunnier, more isolated by streets and had a greater cover of built-up area and lower cover of arable land surrounding them. Nevertheless, the amphibian assemblages of STOPON and CONTROL were very similar. All nine amphibian species (including three threatened species) detected in this study were found in both pond types. Moreover, species richness (2.8 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.2) and the frequency of each species did not differ between STOPON and CONTROL. The only exception was Pelophylax spp., which occurred more regularly in STOPON. Both habitat and landscape quality affected amphibian species richness; however, the explanatory power of the habitat models was about twice as high as those of the landscape models.
   In conclusion, stormwater ponds play an important role for amphibians in urban areas. In comparison to CONTROL, the low landscape quality in the surroundings of STOPON seemed to be compensated by a higher habitat quality due to regular management.

AB  - Modelling population dynamics of invasive species may help to propose effective management countermeasures. Invasion dynamics generally show recursive patterns across species and regions, where initial lag is followed by spread and eventual dominance phases. However, timing and modes of these phases are highly variable, emerging from the interplay between traits of the invader and characteristics of the invaded landscape. Disentangling this interplay is particularly arduous in species with complex life-histories, where an individual passes through different life stages that alter physiology, behaviour and interactions with the environment. Here, we describe an age structured model that can be utilized to simulate population dynamics of invasive pond-breeding anurans. The model follows a spatially structured population approach, each pond representing a discrete habitat patch that exchanges individuals with other similar patches, and simulates change in survival and dispersal behaviour as a function of age. It also integrates dispersal with landscape complexity through landscape resistance modelling to depict functional connectivity across the pond network. Then we apply the model to a case study, the invasion of the guttural toad Sclerophrys gutturalis in Cape Town, first detected in 2000. Age-structured demographic and spatial dynamics of the focal population are reconstructed in a network of 415 ponds embedded in a heterogeneous landscape. Parameterization is conducted through field and laboratory surveys, a literature review and data collected during an ongoing extirpation from 2010. We use the model to explore: i) occurrence and duration of lag phase; ii) whether the spatial spread fits an accelerating or a linear trend; iii) how simulated dynamics match field observations. Additionally we test model sensitivity to demographic and behavioural traits. We found a lag phase in both demographic and spatial dynamics; however the lag duration of these dynamics does not coincide, where invaders start to spread across the pond network five years before the demographic explosion. Also, we found that the spatial spread fits an accelerating trend that causes complete invasion of the network in six years. Such dynamics noticeably match field observations and confirmed patterns previously detected in other invaders characterized by high dispersal abilities. Sensitivity analysis suggests that it would have been preferable to quantify initial propagule size and post-metamorphic survival in the field; both timing and modes of invasion are particularly sensitive to these parameters. We conclude that the model has potential to forecast amphibian invasion dynamics and test management countermeasures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wetlands are one of the world's most important, economically valuable, and diverse ecosystems. A major proportion of wetland biodiversity is composed of aquatic invertebrates, which are essential for secondary production in aquatic and terrestrial food webs. Urban areas have intensified the challenges wetlands encounter by increasing the area of impermeable surfaces and the levels of nutrient and pollutant overflows. We investigated how urban infrastructure affects the aquatic invertebrate fauna of urban wetlands in metropolitan Helsinki, southern Finland. We measured riparian canopy cover, emergent vegetation coverage, and various land cover and road variables. Recreation area, forests, and open natural areas were the most important landscape features positively influencing aquatic invertebrate family richness, whereas buildings and roads had a negative effect on family richness and abundances of many taxa. Recreation area and the various forest types also positively affected the alpha-diversity indices of wetlands. On the other hand, fish assemblage did not affect either family richness or abundances of the studied taxa. Furthermore, trees growing on the shoreline negatively affected the diversity of aquatic invertebrate families. Invertebrate family diversity was greatest at well-connected wetlands, as these areas added to the regional species pool by over 33%. Our results show that connectivity and green areas near wetlands increase aquatic invertebrate family diversity, and our results could be utilized in urban planning.

AB  - In the face of ongoing habitat loss and fragmentation, maintaining an adequate level of landscape connectivity is needed to both encourage dispersal between habitat patches and to reduce the extinction risk of fragmented wildlife populations. In a developing region of southwestern Ontario, Canada, a declining population of Eastern Massasauga rattlesnakes (Sistrurus catenatus) persists in fragmented remnants of tallgrass prairie in an urban park system. The goal of this study was to identify potential connectivity pathways between habitat patches for this species by using a GIS least-cost permeability swath model, and to evaluate the outputs with snake road mortality data. Results identified seven pathways between five core habitat blocks, a subset of which were validated with aerial imagery and mortality data. Four high-ranking pathways intersected roads through or near road mortality hotspots. This research will guide conservation interventions aimed at recovering endangered reptiles in a globally rare ecosystem, and will inform the use of permeability swaths for the identification of locations most suitable for connectivity interventions in dynamic, urbanizing landscapes.

AB  - Pollinator welfare is a recognized research and policy target, and urban greenspaces have been identified as important habitats. Yet, landscape-scale habitat fragmentation and greenspace management practices may limit a city's conservation potential. We examined how landscape configuration, composition, and local patch quality influenced insect nesting success across inner-city Cleveland, Ohio (U.S.A.), a postindustrial legacy city containing a high abundance of vacant land (over 1600 ha). Here, 40 vacant lots were assigned 1 of 5 habitat treatments (T1, vacant lot; T2, grass lawn; T3, flowering lawn; T4, grass prairie; and T5, flowering prairie), and we evaluated how seeded vegetation, greenspace size, and landscape connectivity influenced cavity-nesting bee and wasp reproduction. Native bee and wasp larvae were more abundant in landscapes that contained a large patch (i.e., >6 ha) of contiguous greenspace, in habitats with low plant biomass, and in vacant lots seeded with a native wildflower seed mix or with fine-fescue grass, suggesting that fitness was influenced by urban landscape features and habitat management. Our results can guide urban planning by demonstrating that actions that maintain large contiguous greenspace in the landscape and establish native plants would support the conservation of bees and wasps. Moreover, our study highlights that the world's estimated 350 legacy cities are promising urban conservation targets due to their high abundance of vacant greenspace that could accommodate taxa's habitat needs in urban areas.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate warming is expected to shift the geographical distribution of forest trees worldwide. Urbanization-induced landscape fragmentation represents a considerable impediment to species' range shifts. Large-scale afforestation is often suggested to be an effective measure to mitigate the negative impacts of landscape fragmentation. However, the effectiveness of afforestation on climate-driven forest migration has rarely been evaluated in urban environments. Here, we tested the effectiveness of two common afforestation strategies in promoting the migration of bird-dispersed tree species in Greater Manchester, UK: (A) planting trees in private gardens and roadsides and (B) establishing large woodlands in public lands. A modelling approach combining graph and circuit theory was used to assess the improvement in landscape connectivity after urban afforestation and to analyze how the two strategies promote the process of forest migration under climate change. Our results suggested that planting trees in gardens and streets could improve the spatial patterns of forest migration by forming stepping stones for the movement of birds across the urban matrix; establishing large woodlands in public areas could enhance the probability of forest migration between urban woodlands by providing population hubs. We found that the effectiveness of urban afforestation was strongly influenced by the spatial arrangement of trees and the physical characteristics of local bird species. The study offers new insight into the biodiversity benefits of urban landscapes, encourages tree-planting programs in urban environments, and calls for close cooperation between urban foresters, designers, and managers to cope with the changing climate.

AB  - Urbanisation can cause severe environmental problems and threaten biodiversity by habitat destruction, fragmentation and degradation. This is particularly the case in fast-growing South Korean city regions. While nature conservation policies were recently adopted that require the creation of habitat corridors, there is a lack of ecological information and tools for effective biodiversity conservation planning. This research has developed and customised an approach that combined landscape character assessment with four landscape ecological metrics to provide quantitative information on the ecological conditions for biodiversity conservation planning at the city regional level. The metrics used in this study were landscape heterogeneity, patch shape, patch distance and patch context. These indices were simple to use and required land cover data that were recorded from aerial photography and a digital topographic map. The metrics indicated the highest species richness, highest potential for species dispersal and highest ecological stability for the mountain landscape, followed by the urban fringe, agricultural land and the urban area. The results suggest that the landscape ecological metrics provide a useful tool that could play an important role in supporting spatial planning for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - As an important factor of scenic quality and biodiversity along a greenway, landscape diversity has yet to receive as much attention as it deserves. In the practice of greenway alignment planning, it usually gives way to the primary consideration of land suitability. In this article, we aim to make up this missing link. Upon the new concepts and measurement of linear landscape diversity and cellular landscape diversity, we proposed greenway potential index incorporating land suitability and landscape diversity. The greenway potential index was combined with connectivity analysis to connect path between a future greenway's origin and destination that meets both land suitability and landscape diversity requirements. Specially, with Wuchang (Wuhan City, China) as a case study area, we proposed three greenway alignment planning scenarios respectively according to the criteria of suitability, diversity and the synthesis of them. Markedly differences were revealed between the results of suitability greenways and diversity greenways. The results indicate that the tripartite model we proposed is capable of planning a connecting path between a future greenway's origin and destination that not only meets land suitability requirements for greenway construction, but also incorporates as many landscape types of significant difference as possible.

AB  - Biodiversity maintenance is a crucial ecosystem service. Due to time limits and data availability, assessing biodiversity using indicators or models has become a hot topic in recent decades. However, whether some proposed indicators can explain biodiversity well at the local scale is still unclear. This study attempted to test whether the habitat quality index (HQI) as measured using the integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade-offs (InVEST) model could explain variations in bird diversity in New Jiangwan Town, a rapidly urbanized region of Shanghai, China. The relationships from 2002 to 2013 among HQI and the two diversity indices, species richness and species abundance, were analyzed using Fisher's exact test and gray correlation analysis. No significant association was found. Habitat connectivity was then integrated to develop a new combined indicator of habitat quality and connectivity index (HQCI). The associations between HQCI and the two diversity indices were improved significantly. The results indicated that connectivity may be an important factor explaining the diversity of certain species at a local scale. More empirical studies should be conducted to provide scientific evidence relating habitat quality to biodiversity.

AB  - Urban insect communities are structured by hierarchical filters including regional processes, human facilitation, and species interactions. We sought to inform future urban conservation endeavors by identifying how landscape composition and configuration as well as the management of vacant lot greenspaces affect native lady beetle (Coccinellidae) community structure within the city of Cleveland, Ohio, USA. We found no effect of habitat treatment on native lady beetle abundance when comparing vacant lots seeded with native wildflowers and those with naturally occurring weedy vegetation mown monthly or annually. Nonetheless, establishing conservation plantings that vary in plant height, biomass, and bloom abundance could aid in supporting a greater richness of coccinellid species, as these variables had differential effects on the abundance of fungivorous and aphidophagous feeding guilds. Further, we found that vacant lots embedded within landscapes with increased impervious surface and a high degree of greenspace isolation contained fewer aphidophagous native and exotic lady beetles. Our findings suggest that landscape context is a critical consideration when aiming to utilize vacant land as conservation habitat for coccinellids. Given their large holdings of vacant land, shrinking cities offer a unique opportunity to incorporate landscape-scale planning into future sustainable development initiatives. For instance, with over 27,000 vacant lots, the city of Cleveland could aid lady beetle conservation by electing to maintain vacant lots that promote greenspace connectivity while targeting isolated lots within intact neighborhoods for new residential development.

AB  - Urban areas are often considered to be a hostile environment for wildlife as they are highly fragmented and frequently disturbed. However, these same habitats can contain abundant resources, while lacking many common competitors and predators. The urban environment can have a direct impact on the species living there but can also have indirect effects on their parasites and pathogens. To date, relatively few studies have measured how fine-scale spatial heterogeneity within urban landscapes can affect parasite transmission and persistence.
   Here, we surveyed 237 greenspaces across the urban environment of Edinburgh (UK) to investigate how fine-scale variation in socio-economic and ecological variables can affect red fox (Vulpes vulpes) marking behavior, gastrointestinal (GI) parasite prevalence, and parasite community diversity.
   We found that the presence and abundance of red fox fecal markings were nonuniformly distributed across greenspaces and instead were dependent on the ecological characteristics of a site. Specifically, common foraging areas were left largely unmarked, which indicates that suitable resting and denning sites may be limiting factor in urban environments. In addition, the amount of greenspace around each site was positively correlated with overall GI parasite prevalence, species richness, and diversity, highlighting the importance of greenspace (a commonly used measure of landscape connectivity) in determining the composition of the parasite community in urban areas.
   Our results suggest that fine-scale variation within urban environments can be important for understanding the ecology of infectious diseases in urban wildlife and could have wider implication for the management of urban carnivores.

AB  - Anticipating how epidemics will spread across landscapes requires understanding host dispersal events that are notoriously difficult to measure. Here, we contrast host and virus genetic signatures to resolve the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying geographic expansions of vampire bat rabies virus (VBRV) in Peru. Phylogenetic analysis revealed recent viral spread between populations that, according to extreme geographic structure in maternally inherited host mitochondrial DNA, appeared completely isolated. In contrast, greater population connectivity in biparentally inherited nuclear microsatellites explained the historical limits of invasions, suggesting that dispersing male bats spread VBRV between genetically isolated female populations. Host nuclear DNA further indicated unanticipated gene flow through the Andes mountains connecting the VBRV-free Pacific coast to the VBRV-endemic Amazon rainforest. By combining Bayesian phylogeography with landscape resistance models, we projected invasion routes through northern Peru that were validated by real-time livestock rabies mortality data. The first outbreaks of VBRV on the Pacific coast of South America could occur by June 2020, which would have serious implications for agriculture, wildlife conservation, and human health. Our results show that combining host and pathogen genetic data can identify sex biases in pathogen spatial spread, which may be a widespread but under-appreciated phenomenon, and demonstrate that genetic forecasting can aid preparedness for impending viral invasions.

AB  - The Tiber River stretch crossing the metropolitan area of Rome (Italy) is regarded as one of the main biological corridors of the city, as it diversifies the urban landscape while contributing to the plant diversity. This paper aims to document the current plant richness occurring along the Tiber within the city by providing a comprehensive inventory of the spontaneous vascular flora and an overview of its composition, and structural, chorological and ecological features. This flora lists 493 species and it is characterized by: i) high species richness (more than 30% of Rome's flora), ii) presence of species with naturalistic value, as rare or included in Red List IUCN categories, iii) high number of ruderal and multizonal species (including several aliens) that have well adapted to human disturbance, and have partially replaced the typical riverine plants, iv) wide spread of eutrophic aquatic species, and rarefaction of those species that are more sensitive to eutrophication and water pollution. The dataset and the overview reported in this study can be useful for future research, with a special focus on a better naturalistic management of the urban river ecosystem, and the conservation of the floristic heritage within the city of Rome.

AB  - Cities are expanding rapidly worldwide. Modern cities are expected to carry heavy extinction debts owing to their recent and drastic fragmentation histories. Therefore, detecting extinction debt and identifying species threatened by it in recently created cities are necessary to prevent future biodiversity losses. Here, we studied the relationship between the life-history traits of butterfly species and the extent of their extinction debts using two different methodological approaches in Tokyo, central Japan. First, we compared the effects of current and past landscape parameters on current species richness using generalized linear models. Second, we predicted species richness in unstable (i.e. high loss) habitats using a model developed for stable (i.e. low loss) habitats. The difference between predicted and observed species richness was used to estimate the extinction debt (the number of species expected to go extinct). We classified butterfly species as seasonal specialists or generalists and as habitat specialists or generalists based on their life-history traits. With both methods, we found significant extinction debts only for specialist species. Mapping the potential extinction debts within our study area indicated that currently large patches had relatively low extinction debts, whereas small patches often had high extinction debts. These results suggested that improving patch area, connectivity and especially quality, would have more significant impacts in small patches than in large ones. Extinction debt is an important concept for setting conservation priorities in highly fragmented landscapes, especially in urban areas.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to examine the role of urban public parks in maintaining connectivity and butterfly assemblages. Using a regression framework, we first test the relative importance of park size and isolation in predicting abundance and species richness of butterfly assemblages across a set of 24 public parks within a large metropolitan area, Marseille (South-East France). Then, we focus on landscape features that affect diversity patterns of the recorded butterfly communities. In this second part, the urban landscape surrounding each park is described (within a 1 x 1 km window) according to two major components: vegetated areas (habitat patches) and impervious or built areas (matrix patches). Specifically, we aim to test whether the incorporation of this built component (matrix) in the landscape analysis provides new insights into the understanding of ecological connectivity in the urban environment. We found a significant effect of both matrix configuration (shape complexity of the built patches) and distance from regional species pool (park isolation) on diversity of butterflies that overrides park size in their contribution to variation in species richness. This result suggests that many previous studies of interactions between biodiversity and urban landscape have overlooked the influence of the built elements.

AB  - The landscape patterns of urban green spaces have been proven to be important factors that affect urban thermal environments. However, the spatial effect of the landscape patterns of urban patches with different vegetation densities on land surface temperature (LST) has not been investigated in detail. In this study, the built-up area of Xuzhou City was taken as the study region, and the four phases of Landsat 8 images and their corresponding ground observations from 2014 to 2020 were selected as the basic data. Normalized spectral mixture analysis and an improved mono-window algorithm were used to invert the vegetation component fraction (VF) and LST maps of the study area, respectively, and the surface patches were classified into five levels according to the VF values, from low to high. Four landscape-level and five class-level metrics were then selected to represent the landscape characteristics of each VF-level patch. The tested values of 60 and 780 m were regarded as the best grain size and spatial extent, respectively, in the calculation of all landscape metrics of ALL VF-level patches (VFLM) using the moving-window method. The results of bivariate Moran's I for VFLM and LST showed the following: (1) for landscape-level metrics, only the Shannon diversity index and patch diversity have substantial negative spatial correlations with LST (with average |Moran's I| < 0.2), indicating that the types of VF levels and the number of patches exert weak negative effects on the thermal environment for a certain area; (2) for class-level metrics such as percentage of landscape, patch cohesion index, largest patch index, landscape shape index, and aggregation index, only the class-level metrics of sub-high VF (LV4) and extreme-high (LV5) VF levels patches have significant negative spatial correlations with LST (with high Moran's I value, and high-high and low-high distributions in local indications of spatial association cluster maps), indicating that only the patches of high VF levels can effectively alleviate LST and that patch proportion, natural connectivity degree, predominance degree, shape complexity, and aggregation degree are important landscape factors for regulating the thermal environment. Principal component analysis and multiple linear regression were applied to determine the impact weights of the class-level VFLMs of LV4 and LV5 patches on LST, which revealed the contributions of these landscape metrics to mitigating the urban heat island effect (UHI). These results signify the importance of and differences in the spatial patterns of various VF-level patches for UHI regulation; these patterns can provide new perspectives and references for urban green space planning and climate management.

AB  - Community assembly is the process by which local communities are organized and maintained from the regional species pool. Understanding processes of insect assembly are of interest in "shrinking" cities where vacant land has become abundant as a result of protracted economic decline and population loss. Vacant land represents a viable conservation space for insects such as beetles that contribute to ecosystem services including pest suppression, decomposition, and nutrient cycling. However, the inherent heterogeneity of cities may pose challenges for beetle dispersal from source populations, while quality of the urban environment may constrain establishment. The objective of this study was to investigate the constraints to ground-dwelling beetle community assembly in vacant lots and pocket prairies of Cleveland, Ohio using a functional trait-based approach. Functional traits with a strong predictive capacity for ecological functions were measured on beetle species collected via pitfall traps. Assembly of beetle communities was primarily constrained by dispersal limitations to colonization. Over 93% of species found within treatments were capable of flight, and functional diversity of beetle communities was higher across all treatments than expected by chance. Once beetles colonized, successful establishment was influenced by heavy metal contamination and mowing frequency, with these disturbances shaping communities based on body size, antennae length, and origin. Colonization of dispersal-limited species could be facilitated by increasing connectivity among greenspaces in cities, while establishment could be enhanced by managing local environmental conditions. Understanding how insect communities are structured in urban ecosystems provides context for observed patterns of biodiversity, advances conservation efforts, and fosters ecosystem services.

AB  - Research in the field of ecology suggests that two main strategies, corridors and stepping-stones, can enhance urban habitat connectivity. While highly relevant to planning, no synthesis of this literature addresses planning research or implications. This review describes the effectiveness of corridor and stepping-stone strategies, actions that could enhance their ability to support animal movement, and the state of knowledge on connectivity planning, implementation, and outcomes. It concludes by identifying four significant gaps in our knowledge of planning for urban connectivity. Most critically, few studies assess the on-the-ground results of habitat connectivity planning and none examine the long-term outcomes.

AB  - Target 2 of the European Biodiversity Strategy promotes the maintenance and enhancement of ecosystem services < (ES) as well as the restoration of at least 15% of degraded ecosystems by creating green infrastructure (GI). The purpose of the this research is to present a GI proposal that combines the delivery of regulating services with the restoration and ecological reconnection of urban forests and trees in a densely urbanised context.
   The project area covers about 3 000 ha in the urban sector of the metropolitan area of Rome and the GI components consist of 533 ha of areal green spaces and of more than 500 km of road verges. Planned interventions include forest restoration and tree plantations, with a varying service supply according to type and condition of the different components. Potential natural vegetation (PNV) models and dispersal potential of representative forest species, together with structural and functional vegetation models for the enhancement of air pollutants removal, guided the selection of the species to be promoted and of the planting pattern. Environmental benefits of the proposal include more than 30 ha of restored urban forests, about 15 000 planted individuals of native oaks, a sevenfold improvement in ecological connectivity and halved isolation between green spaces. On the other hand, the expected socio-economic benefits include almost 300 000 potential beneficiaries of the improved air quality and avoided costs for damages to human health that range between 40 700 and 130 200 EUR per year.
   Notwithstanding their preliminary character, these estimates allowed the proposal to highlight the relationship between GI and public health. Moreover, they showed the economic and social effectiveness of nature-based solutions in comparison with further development of grey infrastructure. These results promote the definition of a national GI strategy in Italy.

AB  - The loss of global biodiversity is one of the major challenges of our time and urbanisation is seen as a main cause of this. The aim of this study was to determine whether artificial stormwater ponds, designed to control water flow, can act as refuges for Odonata in urban areas. Moreover, we analysed the influence of habitat and landscape quality on dragonfly species richness and density of 35 stormwater ponds (STOPON) in comparison to 35 control ponds (CONTROL).
   Our study revealed significant differences in environmental conditions between STOPON and CONTROL. At the habitat level, STOPON were larger, had a warmer microclimate, and lower concentrations of phosphate. STOPON were predominantly situated in suburbs, while CONTROL occurred mostly in rural areas. Accordingly, at the landscape level, STOPON had greater cover of built-up area as well as a lower cover of arable land and woodland. In line with this, the dragonfly assemblages at STOPON and CONTROL differed. Overall species richness was greater at STOPON than at CONTROL, and indicator species were only identified for STOPON. Especially threatened species benefited from STOPON, having higher species richness as well as higher adult and exuviae densities than CONTROL.
   In conclusion, our study shows that stormwater ponds in urban areas play an important role in the conservation of dragonflies in general and threatened species in particular. At STOPON, as a result of regular management, the habitat quality was high and compensated for the low landscape quality stemming from significant urbanisation effects.

AB  - An often-cited benefit of river restoration is an increase in biodiversity or shift in composition to more desirable taxa. Yet, hard manipulations of habitat structure often fail to elicit a significant response in terms of biodiversity patterns. In contrast to conventional wisdom, the dispersal of organisms may have as large an influence on biodiversity patterns as environmental conditions. This influence of dispersal may be particularly influential in river networks that are linear branching, or dendritic, and thus constrain most dispersal to the river corridor. As such, some locations in river networks, such as isolated headwaters, are expected to respond less to environmental factors and less by dispersal than more well-connected downstream reaches. We applied this metacommunity framework to study how restoration drives biodiversity patterns in river networks. By comparing assemblage structure in headwater vs. more well-connected mainstem sites, we learned that headwater restoration efforts supported higher biodiversity and exhibited more stable ecological communities compared with adjacent, unrestored reaches. Such differences were not evident in mainstem reaches. Consistent with theory and mounting empirical evidence, we attribute this finding to a relatively higher influence of dispersal-driven factors on assemblage structure in more well-connected, higher order reaches. An implication of this work is that, if biodiversity is to be a goal of restoration activity, such local manipulations of habitat should elicit a more profound response in small, isolated streams than in larger downstream reaches. These results offer another significant finding supporting the notion that restoration activity cannot proceed in isolation of larger-scale, catchment-level degradation.

AB  - Patterns of biological diversity should be interpreted in light of both contemporary and historical influences; however, to date, most attempts to explain diversity patterns have largely ignored history or have been unable to quantify the influence of historical processes. The historical effects on patterns of diversity have been hypothesized to be most important for taxonomic groups with poor dispersal abilities. We quantified the relative stability of rainforests over the late Quaternary period by modeling rainforest expansion and contraction in 21 biogeographic subregions in northeast Australia across four time periods. We demonstrate that historical habitat stability can be as important, and in endemic low-dispersal taxa even more important, than current habitat area in explaining spatial patterns of species richness. In contrast, patterns of endemic species richness for taxa with high dispersal capacity are best predicted by using current environmental parameters. We also show that contemporary patterns of species turnover across the region are best explained by historical patterns of habitat connectivity. These results clearly demonstrate that spatially explicit analyses of the historical processes of persistence and colonization are both effective and necessary for understanding observed patterns of biodiversity.

AB  - The goal of the present study was to assess which variables influence the distribution of birds in urban parks. Twenty parks were studied in a city on the Spanish high plateau during the breeding season, and relationships among park characteristics, bird richness, and individual bird presences were established. The park area and tree cover accounted for 73.1% of the variation in bird richness. Although area size was the best predictor of species richness (65% of the variation), some species did not seem to be related to this variable but rather to others, such as vegetation and the degree of park isolation with respect to other areas. Contrary to what is normally expected, the distance from our parks to the river did not influence their bird species richness.

AB  - An important level of biodiversity, alongside the diversity of genes and species, is the diversity of ecosystems and landscapes. In this contribution an indicator system is proposed to measure natural diversity (relief, soils, waters), cultural diversity (main land use classes, diversity of land use, ecotones, connectivity) and anthropogenic impacts (fragmentation, hemeroby, protection). The contribution gives an overview of various indicators on landscape diversity and heterogeneity currently used in Germany and Europe. Based on these indicators a complementary system, is presented. The indicators introduced here are derived from regular evaluations of the digital basis landscape model (Basic DLM) of the Authoritative Topographic-Cartographic Information System (ATKIS), the digital land cover model for Germany (LBM-DE) as well as other supplementary data such as the mapping of potential natural vegetation. With the proposed indicators it is possible to estimate cumulative land-use change and its impact on the environmental status and biodiversity, so that existing indicator systems are supplemented with meaningful additional information. Investigations have shown that indicators on forest fragmentation, hemeroby or ecotones can be derived from official geodata. As such geodata is regularly updated, trends in indicator values can be quickly identified. Large regional differences in the distribution of the proposed indicators have been confirmed, thereby revealing deficits and identifying those regions with a high potential for biodiversity. The indicators will be successively integrated into the web-based land-use monitor (http://www.ioer-monitor.de), which is freely available for public use. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Arthropods were sampled using pitfall traps, sticky traps, sweep netting, Malaise traps and visual sampling at a national botanic garden, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where the taxonomic impediment is great. The aims were to compare two sites, one of native vegetation and the other of mainly exotic plants, to determine the possible localized extent of biodiversity change across the land mosaic, and to test and compare methodologies and indicator taxa and to make recommendations for ecological landscaping of a botanic garden. Species richness and evenness varied considerably with sampling technique used. From results of a single replicate of data from all trapping methods including 821 arthropod species and 3831 individuals, a number of conclusions could be drawn. Trapping procedures such as sweep netting and pitfall traps, which focus on species with restricted mobility and/or host plant requirements, indicated greatest differences in diversity between two closely located sites. Taxa varied in sensitivity to microlandscape, again depending on the extent of their mobility. Cicindelid and carabid beetles were particularly good indicators of habitat disturbance and type. The management recommendations are that in a species-rich urban botanic garden such as this, as many ecotopes as possible should be preserved or created. These should vary in topography, landscape characteristics and vegetation composition, with as much connectivity as possible. This is a feasible blanket approach to give home to a large number of nameless species and morphs. Patches of different ecotopes should not be separated by more than a few metres by expanses of mown lawn which isolates much of the fauna.

AB  - By social connectivity we refer to the communication and movement of people, goods, ideas, and culture along and across rivers, recognizing longitudinal, lateral, and vertical connectivity, much as has been described for other riversfor hydrology and ecology. We focus on rivers as they pass through cities, and the relationships between these rivers and city dwellers. Historically, the most important longitudinal connectivity function of rivers was their role as major transport routes and the simplification of formerly complex, irregular banks and beds, into straight, uniform shipping channels has resulted in a loss of lateral and vertical connectivity, notably the quotidian uses such as fishing, washing clothes, water supply, swimming and other recreation.
   The scale of the river itself, and its scale in comparison to the scale of the city, largely determine the river's social function and the degree to which it influences city form. River width affects the perception of 'closeness' of the other bank, ease of bridging the river, influence of the river on the city's street pattern, and type of waterfront uses that occur. Up to 15 m wide, people can converse, whereas across rivers similar to 50 to similar to 200 m wide, people are not recognizable but still clearly visible, instilling the banks with a 'lively' atmosphere. At widths over similar to 200 m, people blur, yet moving vehicles and trees branches shaldng in wind may still provide some dynamic elements to an otherwise static landscape composed of building facades. In exceptionally wide rivers, the city on the opposite bank is little more than a skyline, which often becomes a signature and symbol of regional identity.
   In contemplating how people use rivers, we can define a range of human activities in relation to height above the water (i.e., instream to banktop), a vertical dimension of human connectivity with rivers. Many uses occur on the top of the bank, such as quiet contemplation, walking, or cycling along a riverside trail, while others depend on contact with the water itself, such as wading, diving, and canoeing (which presupposes adequate water quality). Many of these relationships are illustrated by the challenge of reconnecting Cairo with the Nile. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bird species richness (S) and numbers (N) were studied in the breeding season in housing developments of different ages in a small English town and compared with village sites, urban green corridors and adjacent arable farmland. S and N were highest in village and green corridor sites. S in urban plots ranged from 13 to 18 species, similar to farmland, but N was much lower in farmland. Marked differences in the number of individual species between plots were recorded. S and N were independent of age of development and area of gardens within plots but both were correlated with the area of greenspace. Greenspace alone and combined with gardens was correlated with the numbers of several individual species. The results are discussed in relation to proposed new large-scale housing developments in England.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems are under threat from habitat loss, partly due to urban expansion. However, some elements of urban freshwaters are already integral parts of the urban landscape and so are more resilient to loss, representing opportunities for the enhancement of freshwater resources within cities. This study investigated the biodiversity value of the Leeds-Liverpool Canal in Leeds, UK, in relation to its landscape context. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that (i) biodiversity value is lowest nearest to the urban core, and (ii) the pattern of canal locks structured ecological communities. Nutrients, metals and dissolved carbon all existed at relatively low concentrations, contrary to what is often seen in urban water bodies, although concentrations were higher in the urban core. This gradient of chemical stress was associated with a decline in macroinvertebrate diversity towards the city centre, which manifested as pollution-sensitive taxa being excluded from this area. Community structures were found to vary between groups of sampling sites separated by locks, suggesting that locks may act as barriers for aquatic invertebrates by restricting dispersal. The results in this study indicate that canals in urban areas can be high-quality habitats, despite the associated anthropogenic stressors, and locks may represent a unique model for researching relationships between connectivity and community structure.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation caused by urbanization often have negative impacts on wildlife in cities. There are considerable studies investigating the relationship between species traits and fragmentation vulnerability. However, so far, very few studies have examined the influence of species traits combined with landscape factors on vulnerability to urbanization in urbanized landscapes. In this study, we investigated how species traits and park characteristics influenced bird sensitivity to urbanization in the highly urbanized city of Nanjing, China. We used the line-transect method to survey birds in 37 urban parks. For each bird species, we collected data on nine life-history and ecological traits that are commonly assumed to influence urbanization vulnerability. For each park, we selected six landscape variables that are commonly considered to influence bird response to urbanization. After phylogenetic correction, the nine species traits were used separately and in combination to evaluate their associations with species abundance, an indicator of urbanization vulnerability. We then used the RLQ and fourth-corner analyses to test relationships between species traits and environmental variables. We found that the 75 species analyzed demonstrated considerable variation in vulnerability to urbanization. Using PGLS analyses and model averaging, we found that habitat specificity was the single best ecological predictor of urbanization vulnerability in birds in Nanjing city parks. The RLQ analysis showed that body size and habitat specificity were correlated with distance to city center and connectivity of the parks, reflecting strong effects of trait-mediated environmental filters that selectively benefit species with smaller body mass and lower habitat specificity in urbanized landscape. Therefore, conservation efforts giving priority to species with high habitat specificity and to parks with high connectivity and far away from the city center may prove effective for the preservation of bird diversity in our highly urbanized system. Meanwhile, preventing future habitat loss and destruction in existing city parks may also effectively conserve these vulnerable species.

AB  - Urbanization and habitat fragmentation have the potential to influence bird communities. In addition, these phenomena, as well as ongoing lethal control measures, have also greatly reduced the range of the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) since the beginning of the 20th century. Although prairie dogs are highly interactive species that can influence avian communities, few studies have investigated whether these interactions persist in urban settings. Our goal was to investigate the relative impacts of habitat fragmentation and prairie dogs on bird communities within an urban matrix. We performed bird surveys on 20 habitat fragments (10 colonized by prairie dogs, 10 uncolonized by prairie dogs) distributed throughout the Denver metropolitan area, and calculated Shannon-Weiner diversity and richness of all birds and native species, as well as total counts of grassland birds and raptors. Diversity, richness, and counts of many species increased with increasing fragment connectivity, and decreased on fragments isolated for longer periods of time. Avian diversity and richness did not differ between fragments with and without prairie dogs, suggesting that this element of the ecological role of prairie dogs is not fully retained in urban habitat. Future studies of the role of prairie dogs as keystone species in urban systems should include other taxa as well as consider the influence of the urban matrix surrounding prairie dog habitat. Our results emphasize that conservation of urban avian diversity should focus on landscape connectivity as well as local habitat features.

AB  - Urban ecosystems are complex social-ecological systems with important functions. These man-made ecosystems have certain areas with high biological diversity, including both remnant species and species purposefully or unintentionally introduced by human actions. There can be important habitats and valuable corridors for both common and less common species within the urban sprawl. The main aim of this study is to respond to the call for integrative research by studying relationships between the anthropogenic activities and urban biodiversity of the cities from the southern part of Rajasthan, India. We observed that the local population was interested in biodiversity, especially phenological events, and benefited from it by getting aesthetic pleasure and information on seasonal changes. The cities, such as Udaipur have an artificially developed diversified habitat within urban limits which provides shelter and protection to a variety of flora and fauna species. Urban areas are often rich in species, particularly vascular plants and many groups of animals, especially birds. Further, urban green spaces in the form of artificial parks and agricultural fields have the diversity of flora, whereas artificial lakes are the sites of wetland species. The most eye-catching faunal group of birds was used to understand the importance of biodiversity for Udaipur. Bird diversity and abundance are indicators of the condition of watershed habitats, both terrestrial and wetland. The role of urban areas in functions, such as the provision of ecosystem services will largely be determined by patterns of biodiversity within that area. To keep these biological indicators healthy, watershed conditions should be managed to encourage bird survival and reproduction. Further, to support an integrative approach in urban green planning, both ecological and social research has to be incorporated in the planning process.

AB  - There has been a recent increase in interest on how urbanization affects soil fauna communities. However, previous studies primarily focused on some limited land use types or line transects of urban-rural gradients. At family and higher taxonomic levels, we investigated the changes of soil mesofauna communities (abundance, species richness, and community structure) with urbanization intensity along different disturbance features in 47 sites evenly located in downtown Guangzhou and adjacent regions. The 47 research sites were classified into four ecosystem types mainly according to the location (rural/urban), vegetation cover, and management intensity. In turn, the four types with increasing urbanization intensity were rural forest, urban forest, urban woodland, and urban park. Firstly, the role of urban soil property (soil physicochemical characteristic and soil heavy metal content) in regulating soil mesofauna community was investigated. The results showed that soil mesofauna abundance and diversity decreased with increasing soil pH, total nitrogen content (TN), and heavy metal comprehensive index (CPI). Soil Pb decreased soil mesofauna species richness (taxa number) and regulated soil mesofauna community structure. Secondly, we examined the effects of landscape changes on the soil mesofauna community. We found impervious surface (IS) ratio did not predict changes in soil mesofauna abundance, species richness, or community structure. Instead, IS ratio was positively correlated with soil pH, soil TN, and CPI. After excluding sites that belonged to rural forests and urban parks, site area was positively correlated with soil mesofauna abundance. Thirdly, our results revealed significant differences in soil property, landscape trait, and soil mesofauna community among the four ecosystem types. Interestingly, urban forest, the one lightly disturbed by urbanization, but not rural forest, had the highest soil mesofauna abundance. Soil mesofauna abundance in urban woodlands was similar to that in urban parks, which was about half of that in urban forests. Species richness in urban parks was 21% lower than that in rural forests. Our results also showed that urban woodland and urban parks had distinct mesofauna community structures compared to those in rural forests and urban forests. In conclusion, the present study suggested that (1) soil property changes due to urbanization, such as increased pH and heavy metal enrichment in urban soil, decreased soil mesofauna abundance and species richness, changed community structure, and mediated the effect of landscape change on soil mesofauna community; (2) however, soil and landscape changes could not explain the increase of abundance in urban forests, which supported the intermediate disturbance hypothesis.

AB  - Costa Rica is recognized worldwide for its nature conservation policy following the traditional land-sparing approach. However, concerns have been raised about the opposite trends of the agricultural land cover changes driven by the option to expand old and new export crops after the country's external debt crisis of the 1980s. We study what happened during the last 20 years by applying landscape ecology metrics to the REDD+ land cover maps of 1986, 2001, and 2014, and statistically testing these indicators with the locations of species richness of plants and birds recorded by INBio. Our results confirm that deforestation has been reversed and most of the biodiversity considered is housed in forestland, but also that the expansion of export monocultures and urban sprawl have fragmented and isolated these tropical forests. Ecological connectivity values decreased 13% across the territory, all crops are negatively correlated with bird and plant locations, and the metropolitan expansion caused a detrimental impact on coffee agroforestry. All these outcomes are consistent with the growing deficit of the Costa Rican physical trade balance due to a faster increase of tropical exports than the growing imports of staple food, with a loss of soil organic matter filled by high doses of agrochemicals imported. Overcoming these environmental problems require a new land-sharing approach to nature conservation aimed at improving ecological connectivity through an agroecology approach combined with land-use planning to preserve the remaining green belt of the shade coffee plantations as a buffer green infrastructure in the metropolitan area.

AB  - Cities are challenging environments for human life, because of multiple environmental issues driven by urbanization. These can sometimes be mitigated through ecosystem services provided by different functions supported by biodiversity. However, biodiversity in cities is affected by numerous factors, namely habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation, as well as pollution, altered climate, and new biotic challenges. To better understand the link between biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services, we need to improve our mechanistic knowledge of these relationships. Trait-based ecology is a promising approach for unravelling the causes and consequences of biodiversity filtering on ecosystem processes and underlying services, but large gaps remain unexplored.
   Here, we present a series of research directions that are aimed at extending the current knowledge of the relationship between trait-based biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services in cities. These directions are based on: (1) improving urban habitat mapping; (2) considering often neglected urban habitats and ecological niches; (3) integrating multiple urban gradients; (4) using trait-based approaches to improve our mechanistic understanding of the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services; and (5) extending the involvement of citizens.
   Pursuing these research directions may support the sustainable management of urban ecosystems and the long-term provision of ecosystem services, ultimately enhancing the well-being of urban populations.(C) 2021 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - We explore the extent to which inner-city fauna can be enhanced by source areas in periurban zones as a response to a decreasing quality and size of green habitats within cities. The objectives were to get a better understanding of the interaction between animal populations of urban and peri-urban areas, and the role of urban green structures within this relationship, and to find out the extent to which peri-urban areas can contribute to urban animal populations. We illustrate the idea of peri-urban support by using a simulation model for individual animal movement, applied in a particular case-study with butterflies as model species. Results show differences in accessibility of inner-city areas between model butterfly species that differ in mobility. The impact of peri-urban individuals on populations of inner-city habitats differed among several peri-urban source-scenarios: the enlargement of the inner-city butterfly population by peri-urban individuals was determined as 7-36% for 'moderate dispersers' and 19-56% for 'good dispersers'. Results also show that well-connected habitat patches within existing urban green structures were more likely to be visited by peri-urban individuals than isolated habitat patches. We conclude that peri-urban nature areas, if large enough, can have a potentially positive influence on the presence of fauna in inner-city neighborhoods. In addition, results suggest that connectivity between inner-city and peri-urban habitat patches enhances contribution of peri-urban migrants to inner-city populations. By providing a range of different habitats, from inner-city up to peri-urban area, moderately mobile habitat specialists could better compete against the small set of successful habitat generalists that are increasing in urban environments all over the world.

AB  - Aim: To predict the distribution of suitable habitats for Malayan gaur (Bos gaurus) at a highly fragmented forest area in Peninsular Malaysia and to identify the potential connectivity between suitable habitat patches.
   Methodology: Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach was used to predict the distribution of suitable habitats of the Malayan gaur. Gaur presence-only data and six environmental variables were collated for the habitat suitability modeling, and area under curve (AUC) value was used to estimate the performance of the model. The resulting model was then used to derive a potential connectivity map through least-cost analysis using Corridor Designer toolbox in ArcGIS 10.4.
   Results: The AUC value of the habitat suitability model was 0.84. Distance from urban areas indicated the highest relative contribution to the model (26.9%), followed by distance from water body (24.2%) land use (18.0%) elevation (14.3%), slope (14.0%) and lithology (2.6%). Predicted suitable habitats for gaur were found mostly in lowland forest areas, especially in the vicinity of rivers within forest reserves. A total of five wildland blocks were derived from the habitat suitability model, and several potential corridor swaths were identified connecting the wildland blocks.
   Interpretation: The absence of gaur occurrence in suitable habitats suggest that fragmented habitats greatly affected gaur distribution and population. Road network and agricultural lands are the major barriers of gaur movement as they are very sensitive towards disturbances and conflict. Thus, this research proposes potential connectivity at a regional scale for Malayan gaur for use in future planning in conservation, management and development.

AB  - Maintaining forest landscape connectivity is one of the most effective ways to alleviate natural forest fragmentation and biodiversity loss problems. Recently, graph theory based metrics have been used as powerful tools in the assessment of landscape connectivity. However, the functional features of landscape units at different structure levels, based on which outcomes can be enriched and advice can be given for practical applications, have been overlooked. In this study, a series of graph-based connectivity indices was calculated to 1) evaluate the optimal threshold distance, 2) identify the key landscape units at the component and patch levels, and 3) classify the functional types of components and patches and analyze functional patterns at different structural levels. The relationship between patch size and patch functional performance in maintaining landscape connectivity was discussed. With a natural forest area in Minqing County of China as the study area, recommendations regarding forest conservation and connectivity enhancement were provided based on the research conclusions. This study provides a way to comprehensively analyze habitat fragmentation and functional patterns for local forest conservation. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The populations of Humboldtiana durattgoensis have experienced a drastic reduction in the effective population size; in addition, the species is threatened by anthropogenic activities. For the aforementioned, landscape genetics will serve as a tool to define the potential evolutionarily significant units (ESU) for this species. To complete our objective, we evaluated the effect of cover vegetation and climate on the functional connectivity of the species from the last glacial maximum (LGM) to the present as well as the effect of climate on shell shape. Partial Mantel tests, distance-based redundance analysis and a Bayesian framework were used to evaluate connectivity. On the other hand, geometric morphometrics, phylogenetic principal component analysis and redundancy analysis were used for the analysis of shell shape. Our results suggest that the suitable areas have been decreasing since the LGM; also, vegetation cover rather than climate has influenced the genetic connectivity among land snail populations, although temperature had a high influence on shell shape in this species. In conclusion, vegetation cover was the main factor that determined the functional connectivity for the land snail; however, local selective pressures led to different phenotypes in shell shape that allowed us to postulate that each one of the previously defined genetic groups must be considered as a different ESU.

AB  - This article summarizes the data of a survey of flowering plants in 80 sites in five European cities and urban agglomerations (Antwerp, Belgium; greater Paris, France; Poznan, Poland; Tartu, Estonia; and Zurich, Switzerland). Sampling sites were selected based on a double orthogonal gradient of size and connectivity and were urban green areas (e.g. parks, cemeteries). To characterize the flowering plants, two sampling methodologies were applied between April and July 2018. First, a floristic inventory of the occurrence of all flowering plants in the five cities. Second, flower counts in sampling plots of standardized size (1 m(2)) only in Zurich. We sampled 2146 plant species (contained in 824 genera and 137 families) and across the five cities. For each plant species, we provide its origin status (i.e. whether the plants are native from Europe or not) and 11 functional traits potentially important for plant-pollinator interactions. For each study site, we provide the number of species, genera, and families recorded, the Shannon diversity as well as the proportion of exotic species, herbs, shrubs and trees. In addition, we provide information on the patch size, connectivity, and urban intensity, using four remote sensing-based proxies measured at 100- and 800-m radii. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Connectivity has long played a central role in ecological and evolutionary theory and is increasingly emphasized for conserving biodiversity. Nonetheless, connectivity assessments often focus on individual species even though understanding and preserving connectivity for entire communities is urgently needed. Here we derive and test a framework that harnesses the well-known allometric scaling of animal movement to predict community-level connectivity across protected area networks. We used a field translocation experiment involving 39 species of southern African birds to quantify movement capacity, scaled this relationship to realized dispersal distances determined from ring-and-recovery banding data, and used allometric scaling equations to quantify community-level connectivity based on multilayer network theory. The translocation experiment explained observed dispersal distances from ring-recovery data and emphasized allometric scaling of dispersal based on morphology. Our community-level networks predicted that larger-bodied species had a relatively high potential for connectivity, while small-bodied species had lower connectivity. These community networks explained substantial variation in observed bird diversity across protected areas. Our results high-light that harnessing allometric scaling can be an effective way of determining large-scale community connectivity. We argue that this trait-based framework founded on allometric scaling provides a means to predict connectivity for entire communities, which can foster empirical tests of community theory and contribute to biodiversity conservation strategies aimed at mitigating the effects of environmental change.

AB  - Considering that urban sprawl and the increase in anthropogenic activities lead to natural habitats loss and fragmentation, threatening biodiversity, the conservation of urban forest remnants is extremely important for the persistence of native fauna and flora species. The objective of this study was to evaluate the landscape structure of an urbanized area in the Atlantic Forest biome, using geoprocessing techniques and fundamentals of Landscape Ecology, in order to provide subsidies for forest conservation in the urban landscape. A land use/land cover map was used to quantify forest cover and to evaluate the landscape structure. Landscape metrics quantified the area, shape and proximity of the forest remnants, providing indicators of the landscape structure. Forest covers 22.9% of the study area, with only 3.6% of the fragments larger than 50 ha. The majority of the fragments (83%) has an area of less than 10 ha. Only three remnants are larger than 500 ha, the largest of them is located in Ipanema National Forest. Most forest fragments (80%) are located in particular properties. The landscape was diagnosed as highly anthropized and fragmented, but with remnants close to each other (NEAR < 50m) potentiating the movement of species in the anthropic matrix. Scenarios of exclusion of small fragments demonstrated the fragility of the matrix without their support, since the small remnants contribute to the connection between the larger ones. The anthropic grassland is the second largest land use class in the study area (20.4%), behind only the urbanized area (25%). Actions to maintain biodiversity in anthropized landscapes such as the study area should prioritize the restoration of anthropic grasslands, incentives for forest conservation in private properties and the maintenance of small fragments in the landscape, in order to promote the connection between large forest areas. Urban and environmental planning of cities should be aligned and based on scientific studies on the spatialization of the vegetation in urban areas.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities are the main cause of habitat loss and fragmentation, which directly affects biodiversity. Disruption in landscape connectivity among populations may affect complex interactions between species and ecosystem functions, such as pollination and seed dispersal, and ultimately result in secondary extinctions. Urbanization, one of the most intense forms of landscapes changes, has been reported to negatively affect bird and plant diversity. Still, little is known about the effects of urban landscapes on interaction networks. We investigated the relationship between urban landscape structure and plant-frugivore networks at different spatial scales. Coupling interaction data from urban areas and a model selection approach, we evaluated which landscape factors best explained the variation in urban networks properties. Our results indicate that urbanization decreases bird richness, mainly through the loss of habitat specialist species, which results in networks being composed mainly of birds well adapted to urban dwelling. We found that interaction evenness, a measure of homogeneity of interaction distribution between species, increases with urbanization. This is due to the strong dominance that generalist birds had in network composition because they foraged on all available fruits, including exotic plants. The ensuing homogenization of interactions can reduce the resilience of networks and affect the efficiency of ecosystems functions. Thus, urbanization plans should consider the proportion and distribution of green areas within cities, coupling human and ecosystem wellbeing.

AB  - Using a case study of an isolated management unit of Sichuan snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellana), we assess the extent that climate change will impact the species' habitat distribution in the current period and projected into the 2050s. We identify refugia that could maintain the population under climate change and determine dispersal paths for movement of the population to future suitable habitats. Hubei Province, China. We identified climate refugia and potential movements by integrating bioclimatic models with circuit theory and least-cost model for the current period (1960-1990) and the 2050s (2041-2060). We coupled a maximum entropy algorithm to predict suitable habitat for the current and projected future periods. Suitable habitat areas that were identified during both time periods and that also satisfied home range and dispersal distance conditions were delineated as refugia. We mapped potential movements measured as current flow and linked current and future habitats using least-cost corridors. Our results indicate up to 1,119km(2) of currently suitable habitat within the study range. Based on our projections, a habitat loss of 67.2% due to climate change may occur by the 2050s, resulting in a reduced suitable habitat area of 406km(2) and very little new habitat. The refugia areas amounted to 286km(2) and were located in Shennongjia National Park and Badong Natural Reserve. Several connecting corridors between the current and future habitats, which are important for potential movements, were identified. Our assessment of the species predicted a trajectory of habitat loss following anticipated future climate change. We believe conservation efforts should focus on refugia and corridors when planning for future species management. This study will assist conservationists in determining high-priority regions for effective maintenance of the endangered population under climate change and will encourage increased habitat connectivity.

AB  - Forest cover reduction may affect movements of forest animals, but resistance to animal movements in and out of forests remains unknown despite its importance for modelling. We tested whether ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), a forest-interior songbird, responds similarly to the amount of forest cover while moving locally (similar to 2 km) and over entire landscapes (similar to 25 km). We compared spatially-explicit simulations to field data to address the issue of resistance to movement in open areas. We caught, banded and translocated 143 territorial males 0.8-27 km away from their territory early in the breeding season. Seventy-eight percent and 50% of translocated males returned (homed) within 10 days following "local" and "landscape" translocations respectively. Independent of translocation distance, homing times increased with decreasing forest in the landscape. With a Geographic Information System (GIS), we simulated "least-cost" paths that homing ovenbirds would ideally take, when resistance to movement in open areas ranged 1-1000 times the resistance to movement in forest. The length, the cumulative cost, and variability of simulated least-cost movement paths increased with increasing resistance in open areas. With landscape translocations, least-cost path length explained homing time better than Euclidean distance, and based on an information-theoretic approach, resistance to movement was estimated to be 27 times greater in open areas than in forests (95% confidence interval: 16-45). However, least-cost path length did not perform better than Euclidean distance with local translocations, and the cumulative cost of least-cost paths was not associated to homing time in either translocation scale. We conclude that resistance to animal movements in open areas can be addressed by a combination of GIS modelling and translocation experiments, and is between one and two orders of magnitude greater than resistance to movements in forests, in the case of ovenbirds.

AB  - Agricultural intensification has caused a decline in structural elements in European farmland, where natural habitats are increasingly fragmented. The loss of habitat structures has a detrimental effect on biodiversity and affects bat species that depend on vegetation structures for foraging and commuting. We investigated the impact of connectivity and configuration of structural landscape elements on flight activity, species richness and diversity of insectivorous bats and distinguished three bat guilds according to species-specific bioacoustic characteristics. We tested whether bats with shorter-range echolocation were more sensitive to habitat fragmentation than bats with longer-range echolocation. We expected to find different connectivity thresholds for the three guilds and hypothesized that bats prefer linear over patchy landscape elements. Bat activity was quantified using repeated acoustic monitoring in 225 locations at 15 study plots distributed across the Swiss Central Plateau, where connectivity and the shape of landscape elements were determined by spatial analysis (GIS). Spectrograms of bat calls were assigned to species with the software batit by means of image recognition and statistical classification algorithms. Bat activity was significantly higher around landscape elements compared to open control areas. Short- and long-range echolocating bats were more active in well-connected landscapes, but optimal connectivity levels differed between the guilds. Species richness increased significantly with connectivity, while species diversity did not (Shannon's diversity index). Total bat activity was unaffected by the shape of landscape elements. Synthesis and applications. This study highlights the importance of connectivity in farmland landscapes for bats, with shorter-range echolocating bats being particularly sensitive to habitat fragmentation. More structurally diverse landscape elements are likely to reduce population declines of bats and could improve conditions for other declining species, including birds. Activity was highest around optimal values of connectivity, which must be evaluated for the different guilds and spatially targeted for a region's habitat configuration. In a multi-species approach, we recommend the reintroduction of structural elements to increase habitat heterogeneity should become part of agri-environment schemes.

AB  - Purpose The white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) is an important reservoir host for the pathogen responsible for Lyme disease in eastern North-America. Indigenous cases of Lyme disease in southern Quebec have increased from two cases in 2004 to 160 cases in 2015. Because of the strong relationship between the white-footed mouse occurrence and the Lyme disease pathogen prevalence, we can estimate the risk of Lyme disease by finding areas of high contact between mice. In this study, we inferred the movement patterns and contact rate of the white-footed mouse in southern Quebec.
   Methods We used pattern-orientated modelling to estimate a directional measure of functional connectivity from an Individual-Based Model. We replicated the spatial pattern observed in previously published molecular analysis of a white-footed mouse population.
   Results A perceptual range of 80 m best explained the genetic structure of the white-footed mouse in the region. The paths of individuals generally overlapped the edges of urban centers and the boundary of linear obstacles such as highways and water bodies. We show that the contact probability of mice was a good predictor of the number of mice caught in the field.
   Conclusions Our findings highlight the usefulness of individual-based models to potentially predict high contact areas and disease hotspots across landscapes.

AB  - Wildlife conservation in urban habitats is increasingly important due to current urbanization trends. We review the different approaches to studying birds in urban landscapes, and point out the importance of the habitat island ecological theory as a research framework for the management and conservation of urban birds. Based on two comprehensive research projects conducted at urban parks in Spain (Madrid) and Finland (Oulu and Rovaniemi), several different issues related to bird conservation in cities are discussed, main findings of these projects are presented, and future research needs are suggested. Urban parks are important biodiversity hotspots in cities. Fragmentation conditions have the same deleterious effects to urban birds as in other fragmented landscapes. Park size accounts for species accumulation in urban parks; this pattern being highly nested. Urban parks of 10-35 ha would contain most of the species recorded in cities, but other indicators related to the probabilities of persistence of the target species should be obtained. Wooded streets can increase urban landscape connectivity by providing alternative habitat for feeding and nesting during the breeding season. Because increasing the size of parks is difficult in cities, enhancement of habitat diversity and resource availability for birds within parks (e.g. nest boxes, winter feeding tables, etc.) appears to be a straightforward way of increasing urban bird diversity. However, human disturbance (pedestrians) should be controlled since it can negatively influence many urban birds. We present a conceptual model for urban bird conservation, which includes three aspects (management, environmental education and research) and new alternatives to promote the involvement of different sectors of the society.

AB  - We investigated the relationships between vegetation area, edge length, and mammals in the urban woods of Daejeon Metropolitan City, South Korea. The vegetation patches included in this study varied from 2.1 to 501.0 ha in size. Surveys were conducted monthly between February and October 2015, with a survey route measuring 1km in length and 10 m width established in each forest patch. Field signs of 14 species of mammals were recorded in the 33 chosen forest patches over the course of the study period, and the number of species in each patch varied from 2 to 11. Mammal species richness was positively correlated with vegetation area, and field sign frequency was positively correlated with vegetation area and negatively correlated with edge length. The field sign frequencies of large moles Mogera robusta, Siberian chipmunks Tamias sibiricus, leopard cats Prionailurus bengalensis, Korean hares Lepus coreanus, water deer Hydropotes inermis, and wild boars Sus scrofa were positively correlated with vegetation area. Moreover, that of large moles, leopard cats, Korean hares, and water deer were negatively correlated with edge length. Remnant vegetation area and edge length are the primary determinants of mammal species richness and field sign frequency in urban woods, highlighting the importance of vegetation patch size for mammal conservation in fragmented urban landscapes.

AB  - Urban rivers and riparian areas serve as corridors that move matter, organisms, and energy to urban areas from adjacent landscapes. However, anthropogenic disturbances and obstructions in river basins have severely impeded the function of many urban rivers as ecological corridors. Here, we used carabid beetles to assess the impact of urbanization on a river and its riparian areas. We identified carabid diversity and composition along an urbanization gradient. We classified 1,855 individuals in 17 species along a river. The carabid communities in riparian areas reflected critically disturbed habitats, and their composition markedly differed between the riparian areas and their adjacent habitats. Carabid beetle diversity sharply decreased with increasing urbanization. Flight capacity and feeding type varied along the urbanization gradient. Environmental variables associated with urbanization such as riparian quality and disturbance level significantly influenced carabid diversity. Land use type in increasingly urbanized areas was correlated with decreased carabid diversity and increased carabid dominance. Patch density, patch size, and interspersion metrics revealed that fragmentation and isolation influenced carabid diversity. Mitigation of disturbances and conservation of riparian microhabitats are required to improve biodiversity in riparian areas.

AB  - Flying animals use aerial habitats to forage, communicate and travel. However, human activities that fragment aerial habitat with built structures, noise, and chemical or light pollution, may limit the ability of wildlife to use airspace efficiently. Applying landscape connectivity theory to aerial habitats could reveal how long-distance migrants respond to sources of aerial habitat fragmentation along their migratory routes. Artificial light at night is a major component of urbanization that fragments dark skies across North America. Attraction of nocturnal migrants to urban light is well documented, but species-specific responses, especially throughout a full migration from breeding to wintering grounds, are not. We tested hypotheses about long-distance migratory movements in relation to artificial light using a highly nocturnal, Nearctic-Neotropical avian migrant (Eastern whip-poor-will Antrostomus vociferus). We applied a resource selection framework at multiple spatial scales to explore whether GPS-tracked birds (n = 10) responded to urbanization in general, or artificial light specifically, during migratory flights. We found little evidence of attraction to artificial light during nocturnal flights. Artificial light and urbanization were highly correlated and difficult to disentangle, but the birds generally avoided urban areas and selected dark-connected skies for travel. Migratory stopovers (locations where GPS-tracked birds (n = 20) paused for at least one night), were located almost exclusively in dark, rural areas. Our results illustrate that considering how nocturnal aerial migrants respond to both aerial and terrestrial habitat elements can improve our understanding of what may facilitate their long-distance movements.

AB  - Habitat connectivity is essential to facilitate species movement across fragmented landscapes, but hard to achieve at broad scales. The enforcement of existing land use policies could improve habitat connectivity, while providing legal support for implementation. Our goal was to evaluate how forest connectivity is affected if forests are restored according to existing riparian buffer regulations in Chile. We simulated forest restoration within 30 and 200 m of rivers in 99 large watersheds, following two sections of the forest regulation. We mapped habitat for two model forest species that have different minimum habitat sizes (15 and 30 ha), and for each we identified forest habitats and corridors using image morphology analysis. To quantify change in connectivity, we used a network graph index, the Relative Equivalent Connected Area. We found that both 30- and 200-m riparian buffers could have a positive effect on habitat connectivity. The 200-m buffers increased connectivity the most where forest cover was 20-40% (40% mean increase in connectivity index), while the 30-m buffers increased connectivity the most where forest cover was 40-60% (30% mean increase in connectivity index). The effect of riparian restoration scenarios was similar for both model species, suggesting that effective implementation of existing forest regulation could improve connectivity for fauna with a range of minimum habitat size requirements. Our findings also suggest that there is some flexibility in the buffer sizes that, if restored, would increase habitat connectivity. This flexibility could help ease the social and economic cost of implementing habitat restoration in productive lands.

AB  - The investigation of plant assemblages growing in urban ecosystems offers the chance to observe new interactions among biodiversity, urban planning and public health, in the context of a changing world with increasing city surfaces and populations. In this context, the aim of this work is the study of floristic, ecological and functional diversity of land use types of Milan, such as a) Built-up areas (urbanized and productive zones), b) Roads (borders and flowerbed of main boulevards and avenues), c) Railways (tracks borders, stations and adjacencies) and d) Green areas (parks, gardens, and orchards). A floristic survey was performed through stratified sampling and a floristic database was built. The following bioecological information was added to each sampling location: species richness, %alien species, %families, %life forms, functional diversity, %Grime's CSR strategies, Ellenberg's indicator values (EIVs), urbanity index and functional diversity estimators. Differences among land use types were detected with linear mixed models. In total, about 300 taxa were recorded, and 34 % of the species surveyed were aliens. The Railways were prominent with regard to several traits such as floristic richness, number of insect-pollinated species, mean EIV for light and soil reaction and functional diversity estimators. On the other hand, the urbanity index was the lowest in Railways. In general, Urban areas and Roads had lower trait values, while Green areas had intermediate performances. Our results showed that despite the expected high presence of ruderal and alien species, typical of disturbed environments, the urban landscapes of Milan are diversified in their ecological functions and included areas rich in uncommon species limited to peculiar habitats. The railway landscape of Milan represents a reservoir and refuge for many native species, incorporating microhabitats not present in other city landscapes. Therefore, railway areas should be included in the planning of green networks to improve connectivity and support the nature in urban landscapes.

AB  - Urban forests are often remnants of former larger forested areas, and traditionally considered as degraded habitats due to negative effects of urbanization. However, recent studies have shown that urban forests managed for recreational purposes can be structurally close to natural forests and may provide habitat features, such as dead wood, that are scarce in intensively managed forest landscapes. In this study, we assessed how urbanization affects polypore species richness and the number of red-listed polypore species in forest stands, and the occurrences of polypore species on individual units of dead wood. Spruce-inhabiting polypore assemblages and their associations to urbanization, local habitat connectivity and dead-wood abundance were investigated in southern Finland. The effects of urbanization on polypore species richness and individual species were largely negligible when other environmental variability was accounted for. Several red-listed polypore species were found in deadwood hotspots of urban forests, though urbanization had a marginally significant negative effect on their richness. The main driver of total species richness was dead-wood abundance while the number of red-listed species was also strongly dependent on local habitat connectivity, implying that a high degree of fragmentation can decrease their occurrence in urban forests. We conclude that the highest potential for providing habitats for threatened species in the urban context lies in large peri-urban recreational forests which have been preserved for recreational purposes around many cities. On the other hand, overall polypore diversity can be increased simply by increasing dead-wood abundance, irrespective of landscape context.

AB  - Understanding the factors that influence the characteristics of avian communities using urban parks at both the patch and landscape level is important to focus management effort towards enhancing bird diversity. Here, we investigated this issue during the breeding season across urban parks in Beijing, China, using high-resolution satellite imagery. Fifty-two bird species were recorded across 29 parks. Analysis of residence type of birds showed that passengers were the most prevalent (37%), indicating that Beijing is a major node in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. Park size was crucial for total species abundance, but foliage height diversity was the most important factor influencing avian species diversity. Thus, optimizing the configuration of vertical vegetation structure in certain park areas is critical for supporting avian communities in urban parks. Human visitation also showed negative impact on species diversity. At the landscape level, the percentage of artificial surface and largest patch index of woodland in the buffer region significantly affected total species richness, with insectivores and granivores being more sensitive to the landscape pattern of the buffer region. In conclusion, urban birds in Beijing are influenced by various multi-scale factors; however, these effects vary with different feeding types.

AB  - Purpose
   Large-scale urbanisation has become a significant barrier to the natural migration of tree species, which is being exacerbated by accelerated climate change. Within this context, improving the permeability of urban landscapes is expected to be an effective strategy to facilitate the process of forest migration through cities. The purpose of this paper is to develop a method to assess the permeability of urban green spaces as stepping stones for forest migration, from the perspective of seed dispersal.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The proposed method combines a least-cost path (LCP) model and a graph theory-based approach. The LCP model is applied to map the potential pathways of seed dispersal at multiple spatial and temporal scales, based on which graph theory-based indices are used to quantify the accessibility of urban landscapes for seed dispersers. This method is demonstrated by a case study in the Greater Manchester area, UK. Eurasian jay, Eurasian siskin, coal tit and grey squirrel are selected as the main seed dispersers in the study area.
   Findings
   The results provide a comparison of the landscape permeability maps generated from different seed dispersers and identify key areas likely to facilitate the process of forest migration. Recommendations regarding landscape management for improving permeability are also discussed.
   Originality/value
   This method allows designers to re-visualise highly modified and fragmented urban landscapes as stepping stones for seed dispersal, which in turn allows for a more piecemeal form of landscape design to optimise urban landscapes for climate adaptation.

AB  - Urban open spaces are considered as spatial residuals of the expansion of built areas. The environmental impact of the resulting land-cover pattern and associated ecosystem services are frequently evaluated at a crude spatial resolution only. However, wild animals use remaining interconnected fine-grain open spaces as an infrastructure for movement. In this paper, we traced the evolution of an open-space system in Haifa, Israel, and examined the impact of urban morphology on size and distribution of open spaces at different spatial resolutions. At a 30m resolution, our analysis indicated fragmentation and increasing partial elimination of open spaces. Over time the connectivity declined at a diminishing rate, yet the network did not disintegrate into separate components. The evolution analysis implied that in crude resolution, the open space network is threatened. At a 5m resolution, our analysis showed that Haifa remains porous to animal movement. Using combined multiple least-cost paths through the urban landscape of heterogeneous permeability, we illustrated extensive connectivity among open spaces. Backyards and other urban in-between spaces complemented the seminatural open-space network connectivity, enabling wildlife movement between habitat patches and thus survival in an urbanized environment.

AB  - Green areas drawn on a city plan represent open spaces that have different meanings for humans and wildlife. Diverse kinds of green may influence species viability in urban environments. It is necessary to understand what those areas mean for wildlife populations and how land-use changes affect habitats and movements for making scientifically defensible planning and design decisions. My objective was to demonstrate how open space and urban development patterns affect the viability of wildlife populations in urbanizing landscapes from a movements perspective. Eight scenarios for 2060 for an urbanizing area near Portland, Oregon combined four open space (none, corridors, parks, and network) with two urban development patterns (compact and dispersed). Dispersal model HexSim simulated three target species - Red-legged frog (Rana aurora aurora), Western meadowlark (Sturnella neclecta) and Douglas squirrel (Tamasciurus douglasii) - movements on those scenarios to compare and contrast sustained populations to the ca. 2010 baseline landscape. Network scenarios presented the largest number of frog breeders. Greenway scenarios showed the largest populations of squirrels. Park and network scenarios sustained viable populations of meadowlarks, but park scenarios performed best. Compact development scenarios performed best for most indicators, while dispersed development scenarios performed better for meadowlarks. Network scenarios performed best when considering the collective of species. Networks presented more diverse habitats, sustaining higher diversity of species. For plans to sustain more species, more comprehensive and diverse habitats must be promoted, otherwise trade-offs should be expected - like the extinction of meadowlarks in greenway scenarios.

AB  - Farm ponds provide a home for birds and numerous species of aquatic animals in Taoyuan, Taiwan. Urbanization and development of infrastructure resulted in the gradual disappearance of these ponds. Currently, only 3800 ponds originally approximately 15.4 % remain, and 84.6 % of the surface area of the ponds has vanished. Aiming to protect avian diversity, this study used logistic regression analysis and the geostatistical approach to analyze the relationship between avian diversity and landscape structure, in an effort to elucidate the spatial driving force of avian diversity. We detected that regression-kriging (RK) was even more accurate than logistic regression (LR). In addition, the value of diversity (H') measures may decrease instead of increase when evenness (J') is increased. The results of this study also indicated that an exceedingly strong relationship existed among avian diversity and landscape scale, agricultural landscape indices, and pond landscape indices. The models predict that preservation of large areas of waterscapes and paddy landscapes result in greater diversity of avian species. Spatial estimation of the research area indicated that human activity substantially affected avian ecology, leading to reductions in avian diversity. Thus, the reduction of the area of ecological corridors due to urban development is expected to further reduce avian diversity in the Taoyuan region. Our approach can be used to effectively analyze the correlations between characteristics of ecosystems and the environmental landscape, to ensure that pondscapes can be appropriately maintained and ecological reserves designated to prevent further decline in avian diversity.

AB  - Riparian zones provide many ecosystem services and are a frequently found type of green area in urban ecosystems; these areas increase the aesthetic value of urban landscapes. The aim of this 17-year study was to assess the applicability of passive vegetation restoration of the gravel/sand bars that emerged after a devastating flood along the river in the city of Prague. The number of species and the sum of their coverages rapidly increased for the initial six years. After the twelfth year, the vegetation composition gradually began to stabilize. Species diversity increased for seven years after the beginning of the succession and then remained essentially unchanged. The diversity values were lower on finer substrates with higher proportions of dust and clay particles. The neophytes, i.e. species introduced after the year 1500, established with more successful on substrates with greater soil skeleton proportions. Finer substrates were preferred by graminoids; among them, the invasive Arrhenatherum elatius was the most abundant. The share of invasive species in the total vegetation cover initially fluctuated at approximately 40%; after eight years, it stabilized at approximately 10%. The proportion of naturalized alien species stabilized within the range of 20-30%. The results show that a new type of species-rich vegetation spontaneously emerged on gravel/sand bars. The vegetation consisted mainly of native and naturalized non-invasive alien species. However, attention needs to be given to potential alien plant invasions.

AB  - This study introduces the Transversal Connectivity Index (TCI) as an ecological indicator for classifying the natural landscape patches by their effective transversal connectivity to the water surfaces. The method applies specifically to urban areas at which the quality of blue-green infrastructure (BGI) is of fundamental importance in reducing the climate change consequences. Effective transversal connectivity among the BGI at the metropolitan scale supplies various ecosystem services in support of nature-based solutions for emerging urban challenges. The TCI value is computed (determined) by integrating a variety of existing and novel landscape indicators into an equation. The connectivity indicators belong to two categories: the intra-patch consists of the isoperimetric quotient, and patch ecological indicator, and the inter-patch ones listed as the band level, the shared border ratio, and the transport fragmentation buffer. The method is tested on the metropolitan zone of Berlin, and the results reveal unconventional findings of the effectiveness of BGI in urbanized landscapes. Despite the abundant green surfaces present in Berlin, only 50% of them have direct access to freshwater surfaces, based on Urban Atlas land use land cover data. The proposed indexing method is reproducible for other metropolitan areas, leading to comparative evaluation of effective BGI, having direct implications with emerging agendas of metropolitan management and policy making like the City Biodiversity Index, the concept of Sponge City, and Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - Global wildlife populations are in decline, in part, due to urbanization. However, in urban landscapes, green infrastructure such as green roofs are being created to provide habitat for wildlife. Green roof isolation, planting heterogeneity, and size can all influence wildlife biodiversity, as may the age of a green roof. When new habitat is created, wildlife use of these new habitats is expected to increase over time. To test this expectation for birds, we monitored bird activity prior to and after installation of small green roof plots on six buildings located within New York City parks. Contrary to expectations, bird activity and bird species richness did not increase after green roof plot installation, nor did they increase over a period of 4 years following installation. These unexpected results may reflect the relatively small size of the plots or the fact that the plots were on buildings located within urban parks. Bird activity and bird species richness varied widely between roofs, and the composition of rooftop bird species may have been more influenced by the characteristics of the surrounding landscapes than the presence of the green roof plots. These findings suggest that small urban green roofs within a larger and, potentially, higher quality habitat may not provide additional habitat for foraging birds. Urban green roofs have numerous ecological and environmental benefits, but the size and characteristics of landscapes surrounding a green roof need to be considered when installing green roofs as wildlife habitat.

AB  - Context Cougars (Puma concolor) have been recolonizing Midwestern North America during the past 3 decades with > 950 cougar confirmations east of established populations. Due to an increase in confirmations east of current breeding populations, evaluation of cougar habitat suitability and connectivity is needed. However, few studies have assessed the habitat potential for cougar recolonization in the eastern portion of their former range. Objectives We used various habitat quality thresholds to model potential cougar habitats and dispersal corridors throughout eastern North America. Methods Based on expert opinion, we used landcover, slope, human density, distance to roads, and distance to water as model variables. Least-cost path methods were used to model dispersal corridors from western populations to potential eastern habitat patches. Results Patches of suitable habitat ranged in size from 3868 km(2) (Ozark Mountains) to > 2,490,850 km(2) (central and eastern Canada). Potential habitats were predominantly forest and shrubland, contained little anthropogenic development, and had high stream densities. Dispersal corridors were present throughout the study area. Corridors largely consisted of forested and cultivated landscapes and had higher road densities than habitat patches. Conclusions Our research provides conservationists with insights into areas suitable for cougar recolonization so they may proactively plan for potential cougar populations east of their current range. This work also provides a framework for evaluating multiple levels of landscape suitability for recolonizing species.

AB  - Background: Eurasian Sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus) increasingly represent successful city-dwellers. Thereby, a rich food supply indicated by high numbers of small birds is believed to be the key driver for this bird-eating rap- tor species to settle in urban environments. However, as small passerine birds show particularly strong antipredator responses, sparrowhawks may not simply focus on patches of highest prey densities, but rather respond strategically to prey behavior, raising the importance of other parameters in determining the occurrence within urban landscapes.
   Methods: To deepen our knowledge on habitat requirements of urban sparrowhawks, bird surveys were carried out during winter between December 2005 and January 2017 in 36 city parks in Vienna, Austria. Besides food supply also park size, canopy heterogeneity and the connectivity with other green spaces were considered.
   Results: Occurrence of sparrowhawks was positively affected by increasing park size, prey density and the interaction between both. Bird feeder density and park connectivity with other green spaces were of minor importance in explaining the presence of this species. Canopy heterogeneity didn't affect city park occupancy by Eurasian Sparrowhawks.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that large city parks, particularly when characterized by high prey densities, substantially contribute to protect and preserve ecologically important bird species such as raptors within the urban environment-a landscape already struggling with biodiversity losses and functional homogenization.

AB  - It is widely recognized that major transportation infrastructures such as highways degrade habitats, increase the risk of collision mortality, and cause alterations in landscape connectivity by reducing connections between habitats due to the barrier effect. Wildlife crossings (underpasses and overpasses) have therefore become stan-dard practice to reduce these effects on wildlife. Most studies aim to identify relevant locations for the creation of new wildlife crossings, but it is very rare for results based on modeling tools or animal movement records, for example, to be confronted with expert opinion and knowledge. Our paper provides a methodological framework combining modeling tools and field expertise from a multi-scale perspective. We used complementary connec-tivity metrics from graph theory to accurately quantify and spatialize the most relevant areas to improve habitat connectivity with multispecies conservation goals. The connectivity analysis was coupled with field expertise to take into account the local context, and technical and land feasibility. We prioritized existing road structures for improvement, found the best locations for new wildlife crossings, and made specific, costed technical recom-mendations. We empirically tested this approach on a large highway network in Northern France. This allowed us to define work principles to improve 109 existing road structures and to create underpasses or overpasses on 15 road sections. This innovative study for operational purposes has been a useful tool to assist the decision-making process of land-use planners who wish to improve wildlife crossings on major transportation infrastructures.

AB  - The loss and fragmentation of natural habitats is a major threat to biodiversity globally. In fragmented landscapes, species are not only affected by patch-level attributes but also by the influence of the whole mosaic of landscape elements surrounding habitat patches. Therefore, it is important to understand the simultaneous effects of local and landscape-level attributes on biodiversity. In this study, we determined the influence of landscape context on species richness of forest mammals in an urban-forest mosaic of the EThekwini Municipality Area, Durban, South Africa. We determined presence/absence of mammals in 28 patches using remote-triggered camera traps over two sampling periods. We applied generalised linear modelling within an information-theoretic framework to quantify the effects of within-patch, isolation, matrix, and landscape level attributes on species richness. The results showed the importance of landscape context for occurrence patterns of mammals in fragmented landscapes. In particular, they showed that patch size, shape complexity, habitat amount in the immediate environment, habitat proximity and road density were the most important factors influencing mammalian richness patterns. Overall, the results stressed the importance of habitat area (patch size, habitat amount in the immediate environment, and habitat proximity) and its spatial configuration to faunal preservation and suggest that management efforts in this landscape should be aimed at protecting fragments from further loss and disturbance and matrix improvement to increase landscape connectivity.

AB  - Riparian areas are often the only green areas left in urban and suburban landscapes, providing opportunities for conservation and connectivity of both aquatic and terrestrial organisms. While city planners and land managers often tout the importance of riparian networks for these uses, it is not well established if urban riparian plant communities are actually functioning as connected assemblages. Furthermore, urban riparian zones are well known to be highly invaded by non-native plant species and may be functioning to increase the spread of non-native species across the landscape. Here we examine connectivity of plant assemblages in riparian networks within an extensively urbanized landscape. We sampled riparian plant communities at 13 sites along three second-order streams of the Rahway River watershed, New Jersey. We also characterized propagule dispersal at each site by sampling litter packs on the river banks five times between March-October 2011 and identifying germinants from litter packs after cold stratification. Species turnover of both riparian and litter vegetation was more strongly associated with flow distance, particularly for native species, indicating that riverine systems are important for promoting connectivity of native plant assemblages in urban landscapes. However, non-native germinants significantly dominated propagule dispersal along the stream reaches, particularly early in the growing season, suggesting spread utilizing the river system and preemption may be an important mechanism for invasion success in this system. Our data show that management of invasive species should be planned and implemented at the watershed scale to reduce spread via the river system.

AB  - Cities in China support higher human population densities compared to those in western countries; consequently, the high pressure placed on cultural ecosystem services (CES) provision of residential green spaces might hinder overall human wellbeing and the maintenance of avian diversity. Thus, this study aimed to identify how to meet the main preferences of citizens for residential green spaces while simultaneously enhancing bird diversity in city neighborhoods, generating a win-win scenario for human needs and biodiversity. This study was implemented using 568 questionnaires for residents and GLMM for bird-environment statistical analyses. Residents in Beijing preferred higher levels of bird species richness than individual abundance in neighborhoods. Residential green space appeared to serve as the movement corridor for some rare species, indicating the importance of promoting the presence of migrant bird guilds, which is currently incidental. The cultivation of fruit-bearing shrubby plants was supported by most city residents, and would also promote the presence of migratory birds in green spaces. In contrast, while increasing the width of residential green spaces would benefit migratory birds, it had less public support. This multi-disciplinary study clearly demonstrated that both the quality of life of humans in cities and biodiversity conservation could be efficiently incorporated in green space plans, even under highly urbanized circumstances.

AB  - Understanding, predicting and controlling animal movement is a fundamental problem of conservation and management ecology. The need to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts, such as crop raiding by large herbivores, is becoming increasingly urgent. Because of the substantial costs or the possibility of unsuitable outcomes on wildlife, managers are often encouraged to deploy interventions that can achieve their objective while minimizing the impact on animal populations. We propose an adaptive management framework that can identify cost-effective solutions to reduce human-wildlife conflicts, while also minimizing constraints on animal movement and distribution. We focus on conflicts involving animals for which conflict zones occupy only a portion of their home-range. The adaptive management approach includes four basic steps: define and spatialize conflict areas, predict animal distribution from functional connectivity and patch residency time, predict the impact of management actions on animal distribution, and test predictions and revise predictive models. Key to the process is development of a mathematical model that can predict how habitat-animal interactions shape animal movement dynamics within patch networks. In our model, networks consist of a set of high-quality patches connected by links (i.e., potential inter-patch movements). Inter-patch movement rules and determinants of patch residency time need to be determined empirically. These data then provide information to parameterize a reaction-advection-diffusion model that can predict animal distribution dynamics given habitat features and movement taxis toward (or against) conflict areas depending on management actions. Illustrative simulations demonstrate how quantitative predictions can be used to make spatial adjustments in management interventions (e.g., length of diversionary fences) with respect of conflict areas. Simulations also show that the impact of multiple interventions cannot be considered as simply having additive effect, and their relative impact on animal equilibrium distribution depends on how they are added and deployed across the network. Following the principles of adaptive, integrated landscape management, the predictive model should be revised as monitoring provides new information about the response of animals to the set of interventions. We contend that the proposed quantitative approach provides a robust framework to find cost-effective strategy toward sustainable human-wildlife conflicts.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has intensified habitat fragmentation and shrinkage of waterbirds, threat-ening the sustainable development of waterbird diversity. Urban waterbird restoration can be achieved by considering suburban waterbirds as the source of restoration of urban waterbird diversity and by overcoming the separation between urban and suburban populations. Optimal design of ecological corridors is the most effective approach to facilitate movement of waterbirds. However, three challenges to applying ecological corridors to urban waterbird diversity resto-ration remain: (1)identifying focal species for the ecological corridor network; (2)identifying nodes in the ecological corridor; (3) assigning priority for design of the different areas in the corridor. The aim of this study was to develop methods to resolve these challenges using the design of a waterbird ecological corridor in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area in Southern China as a case study. Under the proposed methods, it is hoped that waterbird re-covery will occur in the city, characterized by a complex three-dimensional space, thereby pro-moting an increase in urban waterbird diversity.

AB  - Global warming threatens to reduce population connectivity for terrestrial wildlife through significant and rapid changes to sea ice. Using genetic fingerprinting, we contrasted extant connectivity in island-dwelling Peary caribou in northern Canada with continental-migratory caribou. We next examined if sea-ice contractions in the last decades modulated population connectivity and explored the possible impact of future climate change on long-term connectivity among island caribou. We found a strong correlation between genetic and geodesic distances for both continental and Peary caribou, even after accounting for the possible effect of sea surface. Sea ice has thus been an effective corridor for Peary caribou, promoting inter-island connectivity and population mixing. Using a time series of remote sensing sea-ice data, we show that landscape resistance in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago has increased by approximately 15% since 1979 and may further increase by 20-77% by 2086 under a high-emission scenario (RCP8.5). Under the persistent increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, reduced connectivity may isolate island-dwelling caribou with potentially significant consequences for population viability.

AB  - Habitat loss and degradation are considered major threats to freshwater biodiversity and to invertebrates in particular. These often irreversible processes may lead to local and regional extinctions of species, most notably of stenotopic taxa. In spite of this, a number of studies have shown that small habitat patches can sustain rich and abundant communities. The present work assesses the relevance of a group of four small man-made (secondary) wildlife ponds to Odonata species diversity and abundance. Results obtained on pond recruiting capacity, species richness, abundance and habitat use by means of exuviae collection and monitoring of adults using a capture-mark-recapture (CMR) method indicate the potential suitability of these small aquatic biotopes and the surrounding landscape as habitat providers and stepping stone connectors in the VallSs lowlands (Catalonia, Spain). This region, close to the metropolitan area of Barcelona, has severely degraded natural habitats and high landscape fragmentation due to infrastructure, urban and industrial expansion. A comparison among a greater number of sites (ponds and sections of streams and rivers) distributed across the region showed that adequately managed small waterbodies harbour richer Odonata communities than others that are unmanaged or managed specifically for other types of fauna or uses. Appropriate care of these small biotopes avoids disturbance and keeps them free from vertebrates like fish and waterfowl which, under certain conditions, may have a strong influence on the invertebrate communities because, apart from feeding on larvae, they may have a negative impact on macrophyte development and water quality. While rivers and streams, the only natural aquatic habitats in the area, may be both expensive and technically challenging to restore and manage successfully, the creation and/or restoration of small ponds and short river sections in suitable locations can be a cost-effective method for enhancing freshwater vegetation and invertebrate diversity in this impacted landscape.

AB  - Humans have been dominating the urban areas with their abilities and unfavourably tend to have affected other living creatures. This paper directed how to acquire a place in the cities for creating opportunities for birds that live in the cities to live together with us. Several methods were applied emphasizing on Urban Rapid Biodiversity Assessment ( RBA) which was adjusted for tropical environments. Vegetation structure, Domain value and the diversity of vascular plants are components determining the quality preference for birds. Results indicated that stream corridors were the best accommodating spaces with an average number of vascular plants was 27; the average number of existing vegetation structures amounted up to 7.00; the average of the total Domain values of all vegetation structures excluding buildings was 24.00 and the average of the total Domain value of all trees was 11.00. Furthermore there were as well empty fields, road corridors, institutional space, green spaces for the public, urban farms and wetlands. The quality of spaces for city birds could be more specific by adding additional filtering of size, ownership, and a development plan. Networking with natural areas would be more feasible if more space were included. Available spaces would be greater when the state of ownership was not limited, despite public spaces were much easier to manage.

AB  - Assessing the impact of land-use change on biodiversity is an important task in the context of global-change scenarios. Here, conceptual considerations, descriptions of a model solution and results of a case study for the regional scale are presented. Land-use was seen as an integrative variable, which depends on natural, as well as on socioeconomic parameters. Economic processes have been externalized by using results of economy driven base-scenarios about land-use change at the county level. Tendencies from these scenarios were extracted, expanded to a set of sub-scenarios, and transformed into land-use maps by a land-use model. These land-use maps were evaluated with respect to biodiversity at the ecosystem level. The results of the evaluation of the single sub-scenarios were summarized to response functions, which describe the sensitivity of landscape attributes toward land-use changes. It is stated that biodiversity is not a generic indicator and can only be assessed after defining the context. Here, only ecosystems with low hemeroby (`semi-natural' ecosystems) were considered. The concept of hemeroby, which describes the degree of human disturbance on ecosystems, was used as a qualitative complement to the quantitative concept of biodiversity. Biodiversity was assessed by means of six indicators for three aspects of biodiversity: composition, structure and function. The model was applied in a case study dealing with the impact of extensification of grassland on biodiversity in the county Havelland, west of Berlin. In general, the compositional aspect of biodiversity demonstrated the clearest response. Structural diversity reacted only moderately, but a strong impact of land-use change on connectivity was indicated by an increasing proximity of semi-natural biotopes. The latter was proven by evaluating the connectivity of semi-natural grasslands from the perspective of the white stork (Ciconia ciconia). All response functions showed a high heterogeneity in spatial and functional aspect. At the landscape level, the heterogeneity was hidden behind a supposed moderate reaction of landscape. This underlines the demand for a spatially explicit realization of land-use scenarios and for the consideration of a wide range of scenarios by means of response functions.

AB  - The loss of large natural areas due to development has increased interest for and use of vegetated areas in urban and suburban areas for wildlife habitats. The goal of this study was to quantify vegetation characteristics for each type of land cover found in the greater Tucson, Arizona area, thereby providing a predictive tool for wildlife management and other land management issues. This research was based on and is a continuation of a pilot study that developed a method associating land cover categories to aerial photographs in eastern Pima County, including the City of Tucson. Aggregation of land cover categories used by Tucson and Pima County and verifications of any uncertain classifications of land cover with field evaluations produced a consistent land cover classification system and database. Natural open space was the largest land cover category within our study area, comprising 52% of the total land cover. Riparian areas, low-density housing and natural open space areas had the highest percentage of native vegetation and escape cover. Golf and neighborhood parks ranked much lower than these land covers relative to native vegetation and escape cover (vegetation with foliage/stems at ground level). The most structurally diverse plant communities were associated with medium density residential areas and zoos that contain a relatively high number of exotic species. Results from the wildlife habitats index indicated riparian areas as the most valuable habitats in eastern Pima County (the county where Tucson is located), followed by low-density housing (less than or equal to1 residence/acre), natural open space, and federal/state parks and forests.

AB  - Understanding the impacts of habitat fragmentation on dispersal is an important issue in landscape and conservation ecology. Here I examine the effects of fine- to broad-scale patterns in landscape structure on dispersal success of organisms with differing life-history traits. An individual-based model was used to simulate dispersal of amphibian-like species whose movements were driven by land cover and moisture conditions. To systematically control spatial pattern, a landscape model was created by merging simulated land cover maps with synthetic topographic surfaces. Landscapes varied in topographic roughness and spatial contagion in agriculture and urban land cover. Simulations included three different species types that varied in their maximum potential dispersal distances by 1-, 2-, or 4-fold. Two sets of simulations addressed effects of varying aspects of landscape structure on dispersal success. In the first set of simulations, which incorporated variable distances between breeding patches, dispersal success was lowest for all species types when anthropogenic cover was patchily distributed. In the second set, with interpatch distances held constant as landscape composition varied, dispersal success decreased as anthropogenic cover became spatially contagious. Both sets revealed strong main effects of species characteristics, interpatch distances and landscape composition on dispersal success; furthermore, scale-dependent patterns in land cover and moisture gradients had a stronger effect on longer- than shorter-ranging species types. Taken together, these simulations suggest that heuristic conservation strategies could potentially be developed based on important but limited life history information.

AB  - Urbanization generates shifts in wildlife communities, with some species increasing their distribution and abundance, while others decline. We used a dataset spanning 15years to assess trends in distribution and habitat dynamics of the black-tailed prairie dog, a highly interactive species, in urban habitat remnants in Denver, CO, USA. Both available habitat and number of prairie dog colonies declined steeply over the course of the study. However, we did observe new colonization events that correlated with habitat connectivity. Destruction of habitat may be slowing, but the rate of decline of prairie dogs apparently remained unaffected. By using our estimated rates of loss of colonies throughout the study, we projected a 40% probability that prairie dogs will be extirpated from this area by 2067, though that probability could range as high as 50% or as low as 20% depending on the rate of urban development (i.e. habitat loss). Prairie dogs may fulfill important ecological roles in urban landscapes, and could persist in the Denver area with appropriate management and habitat protections.

AB  - Landscape genetics offers a powerful approach to understanding species' dispersal patterns. However, a central obstacle is to account for ecological processes operating at multiple spatial scales, while keeping research outcomes applicable to conservation management. We address this challenge by applying a novel multilevel regression approach to model landscape drivers of genetic structure at both the resolution of individuals and at a spatial resolution relevant to management (i.e. local government management areas: LGAs) for the koala (Phascolartos cinereus) in Australia. Our approach allows for the simultaneous incorporation of drivers of landscape-genetic relationships operating at multiple spatial resolutions. Using microsatellite data for 1106 koalas, we show that, at the individual resolution, foliage projective cover (FPC) facilitates high gene flow (i.e. low resistance) until it falls below approximately 30%. Out of six additional land-cover variables, only highways and freeways further explained genetic distance after accounting for the effect of FPC. At the LGA resolution, there was significant variation in isolation-by-resistance (IBR) relationships in terms of their slopes and intercepts. This was predominantly explained by the average resistance distance among LGAs, with a weaker effect of historical forest cover. Rates of recent landscape change did not further explain variation in IBR relationships among LGAs. By using a novel multilevel model, we disentangle the effect of landscape resistance on gene flow at the fine resolution (i.e. among individuals) from effects occurring at coarser resolutions (i.e. among LGAs). This has important implications for our ability to identify appropriate scale-dependent management actions.

AB  - For a highly urbanised city, such as Sydney, there are limited opportunities for revegetation. Through consultation with councils, private landholders, community groups and State Government agencies, realistic opportunities have been identified particularly along riparian and transport corridors occurring on both public and private land. This has been made possible by the Green Web Sydney project. Green Web Sydney proposes the establishment of a green web of native vegetation to protect, conserve and enhance remaining remnant bushland in the Sydney region. Central to this plan is the establishment of habitat corridors that link fragmented patches of bushland to facilitate the movement of wildlife and natural dispersal of native plants, and the implementation of various biodiversity initiatives within Council organisations. The project encourages a consistent and cooperative approach to native vegetation management in the Sydney region. By working locally and regionally within the framework of Green Web, councils and the community will create a green web of bushland corridors, protecting remnant bushland of conservation value and thus enhance Sydney's rich biodiversity and natural heritage.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are key to conserving biodiversity and ecosystem services globally, but their effectiveness increasingly depends on the ability of the surrounding agricultural areas to support biodiversity and secure connectivity at the landscape level. This requires monitoring the broader multi-use landscapes in which PAs exist and identifying the landscape characteristics that support rich, functional wildlife communities. Here, we investigated the species richness and habitat use patterns of a mammal community in relation to different landscape variables and land use and land cover (LULC) types in a PA and its surrounding agricultural lands in the Cerrado. We first used a hierarchical multi-species occupancy model with input camera trap data and eight landscape variables (vegetation productivity, phenology, and heterogeneity, distance to water, roads and settlements, and the PA, slope, and elevation) to estimate the species richness and habitat use of 29 mammal species across the landscape. We then analyzed the relationships between the species richness and habitat use and the landscape variables at the site level, as well as the distribution of species at the landscape level in relation to the different natural and agricultural LULC types. We found that most species are present in the native forest areas across the landscape and that many species are also present in the croplands surrounding the PA. The results also showed that species' habitat use was especially determined by the productivity and heterogeneity of the vegetation cover, with a particularly strong positive relation in grasslands and pastures. These results suggest that the private properties surrounding the PA might be playing an essential role in supporting biodiversity in this region and provide insights on management practices that could largely contribute to maintaining or promoting a multifunctional landscape, such as maintaining the remaining forests or increasing the productivity and the heterogeneity (e.g., by increasing tree cover) in pastures.

AB  - To maximize specific ecosystem services (ES) such as food production, people alter landscape structure, i.e., the types of ecosystems present, their relative proportions, and their spatial arrangement across landscapes. This can have significant, and sometimes unexpected, effects on biodiversity and ES. Communities need information about how land/use activities and changes to landscape structure are likely to affect biodiversity and ES, but current scientific understanding of these effects is incomplete. The Monteregie Connection (MC) project has used the rapidly suburbanizing agricultural Monteregien landscape just east of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to investigate how current and historic landscape structure influences ES provision. Our results highlight the importance of forest connectivity and functional diversity on ES provision, and show that ES provision can vary significantly even within single land-use types in response to changes in landscape structure. Our historical analysis reveals that levels of ES provision, as well as relationships among individual ES, can change dramatically through time. We are using these results to build quantitative ES-landscape structure models to assess four future landscape scenarios for the region: Periurban Development, Demand for Energy, Whole-System Crisis, and Green Development. These scenarios integrate empirical and historical data on ES provision with local stakeholder input about global and local social and ecological drivers to explore how land-use decisions could affect ES provision and human well-being across the region to the year 2045. By integrating empirical data, quantitative models, and scenarios we have achieved the central goals of the MC project: (1) increasing understanding of the effects of landscape structure on biodiversity and ES provision, (2) effectively linking this knowledge to decision making to better manage for biodiversity and ES, and (3) creating a vision for a more sustainable social-ecological system in the region.

AB  - The ecological impact of roads and traffic is now widely acknowledged, with a variety of mitigation strategies such as purpose designed fauna underpasses and overpasses commonly installed to facilitate animal movement. Despite often being designed for larger mammals, crossing structures appear to enable safe crossings for a range of smaller, ground dwelling species that exhibit high vulnerability to roads. Less attention has been paid to the extent to which fauna overpasses function as habitat in their own right, an issue particularly relevant to reptiles and amphibians. The Compton Road fauna array (Brisbane, Australia) includes a vegetated fauna overpass which connects two urban forest reserves and traverses a major four lane arterial road. The aim of this study was to quantify the extent to which colonisation of the Compton Road fauna overpass by reptile and amphibian species living in adjacent forests occurred. Pitfall sampling at seven sampling sites occurred between June 2005 and February 2010, starting approximately six months after overpass construction, with additional observational detections throughout this period. The overpass yielded higher species diversity and capture rates compared with the forest areas. Species accumulation curves demonstrated a strong and consistent colonisation rate of the overpass throughout the six year monitoring period, while persistent occupation by species on the overpass throughout the six years suggests permanent colonisation of the vegetated structure as an extension of the natural forest habitat. These outcomes demonstrate that the fauna overpass at Compton Road provides suitable habitat for diverse local herpetofauna communities and suggest enhanced habitat connectivity across the road.

AB  - Dispersal has long been recognized as a mechanism that shapes many observed ecological and evolutionary processes. Thus, understanding the factors that promote its evolution remains a major goal in evolutionary ecology. Landscape connectivity may mediate the trade-off between the forces in favour of dispersal propensity (e.g. kin-competition, local extinction probability) and those against it (e.g. energetic or survival costs of dispersal). It remains, however, an open question how differing degrees of landscape connectivity may select for different dispersal strategies. We implemented an individual-based model to study the evolution of dispersal on landscapes that differed in the variance of connectivity across patches ranging from networks with all patches equally connected to highly heterogeneous networks. The parthenogenetic individuals dispersed based on a flexible logistic function of local abundance. Our results suggest, all else being equal, that landscapes differing in their connectivity patterns will select for different dispersal strategies and that these strategies confer a long-term fitness advantage to individuals at the regional scale. The strength of the selection will, however, vary across network types, being stronger on heterogeneous landscapes compared with the ones where all patches have equal connectivity. Our findings highlight how landscape connectivity can determine the evolution of dispersal strategies, which in turn affects how we think about important ecological dynamics such as metapopulation persistence and range expansion.

AB  - Conservation subdivision is a design concept used by landscape architects and other built environment professionals to conserve wildlife habitat within growing communities. The idea is by Clustering homes together to maximize open space. one can conserve urban biodiversity. It is a popular concept used by many planners and landscape architects and is used in many municipalities as an alternative to conventional urban development. In this review paper, we systematically review Randall Arendt's book, Conservation Design for Subdivisions: A Practical Guide to Creating Open Space Networks, which has championed the conservation design concept. Through this review and our experiences with how the conservation design concept has been applied, we provide suggestions that will (1) maximize the potential of conservation subdivisions to conserve wildlife and their habitats, and (2) promote positive wildlife experiences for residents of conservation subdivisions. We found several recommended design elements that could negatively impact wildlife but of significance, we found that most guidelines and effort in conservation subdivisions are placed on the design phase: construction and post-construction phases are neglected. We discuss the social and ecological elements that warrant consideration during the construction and post-construction phases and how they are necessary in order to conserve functional wildlife habitat within a conservation subdivision.

AB  - In aquatic ecosystems, tributaries play an important role in maintaining the populations and diversity of aquatic organisms throughout the drainage basin, but because of their small catchments, these ecosystems are often more susceptible to the effect of land-use changes and flow-regime alterations. Here, we examined anthropogenic effects on benthic macroinvertebrate diversity in the tributary lagoons, collectively called "Naiko," surrounding Lake Biwa. We sampled macroinvertebrates and determined the environmental characteristics of 20 tributary lagoons. We identified the environmental factors determining the diversity of macroinvertebrates and found that turbidity significantly diminished species diversity. We assessed the anthropogenic stressors that contributed to the increase in turbidity and found that human population density and the proportion of paddy fields in the watershed area were positively correlated with turbidity, most likely caused by erosion of terrigenous organic matter from the paddy fields and urban areas. In addition, the presence of sluice gates and the lengths of channels connecting to the main lake were positively correlated with turbidity, suggesting that these factors lowered hydrologic connectivity and retained organic matter. We concluded that changes to the landscape and decreased hydrologic connectivity caused by human activity increased turbidity, which in turn decreased macroinvertebrate diversity. The identification of these factors in tributaries is vital for developing a strategy for habitat restoration to conserve the entire ecosystem of the Lake Biwa basin.

AB  - Taking Xuzhou City as a case, the studies of landscape classification, pattern analysis and eco-environmental impacts evaluation are made using Landsat TM/ETM+ images in this paper. For this purpose, firstly urban landscape information is extracted from Landsat TM/ETM+ images using C5.0 decision tree classification method based on spectral features, texture features and shape information. The results prove that the classification accuracy can meet the requirements of landscape patterns analyzing and evaluating. Then according to classified images, urban landscape pattern is analyzed based transfer matrix and landscape pattern metrics at the scale of landscape and class. Finally, based on the analysis, urban landscape pattern impacts on environment are evaluated qualitatively from three angles: heterogeneity, fragmentation, and edge effect. The results, which indicate that the level of fragmentation, diversity and connectivity of Xuzhou landscape in 2005 is higher than in 1987, but the level of congregation in 2005 is lower than in 1987, can reflect the urban expansion and the change of landscape patterns effectively.

AB  - Urban vegetation is an essential element of the urban city pedestrian walkway. Despite city forest regulations and urban planning best practices, vegetation planning lacks clear comprehension and compatibility with other urban elements surrounding it. Urban planners and academic researchers currently devote vital attention to include most of the urban elements and their impact on the occupants and the environment in the planning stage of urban development. With the advancement in computational design, they have developed various algorithms to generate design alternatives and measure their impact on the environment that meets occupants' needs and perceptions of their city. In particular, multi-agent-based simulations show great promise in developing rule compliance with urban vegetation design tools. This paper proposed an automatic urban vegetation city rule compliance approach for pedestrian pathway vegetation, leveraging multi-agent system and algorithmic modeling tools. This approach comprises three modules: rule compliance (T-Rule), street vegetation design tool (T-Design), and multi-agent alternative generation (T-Agent). Notably, the scope of the paper is limited to trees, shrubbery, and seating area configurations in the urban pathway context. To validate the developed design tool, a case study was tested, and the vegetation design tool generated the expected results successfully. A questionnaire was conducted to give feedback on the use of the developed tool for enhancing positive experience of the developed tool. It is anticipated that the proposed tool has the potential to aid urban planners in decision-making and develop more practical vegetation planting plans compared with the conventional Two-Dimensional (2D) plans, and give the city occupants the chance to take part in shaping their city by merely selecting from predefined parameters in a user interface to generate their neighborhood pathway vegetation plans. Moreover, this approach can be extended to be embedded in an interactive map where city occupants can shape their neighborhood greenery and give feedback to urban planners for decision-making.

AB  - Background: It has been recognized that urban green spaces play a crucial role in providing many landscape services. The research aimed at identifying the main knowledge gaps in this framework and to support urban planning, taking into account the spatial configuration of green areas through a pilot study area, and mapping urban landscape services. Methods: In this research, (1) a systematic review, analyzed through a network analysis; (2) an urban pilot study to map the Urban Green Index and, jointly, the spatial composition and configuration of urban green areas, through the integration of three landscape metrics; and (3) the mapping of Urban Landscape Services Index have been carried out. Results: The 37% of the reviewed articles focused on regulating services, while the network analysis identified four clusters. The total Urban Green Index was 26%, and some districts showed a percentage that surpassed it. The total overall Green Connectivity Index was 21%. Some districts were the best providers of landscape services. Conclusions: This research was in line with the EU Joint Science for Policy Report suggesting giving emphasis to the spatial pattern map of green spaces in European cities to provide spatial data available for decision-makers in relation to GI deployment.

AB  - Landscape connectivity is a key aspect for the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem viability. Nowadays, the competition between economic development and nature conservation is intense. In most territories natural vegetation is being replaced by exotic tree plantations, which have a better performance in terms of timber productivity but often, a lower ecological value. We evaluated potential natural forest connectivity improvement in the Cantabria region (Northern Spain) through two main actions: protection of environmentally valuable forest areas, and reforestation with indigenous species of those patches of exotic plantation trees with a particularly important role for the connectivity of the forest network. We established a variety of scenarios to calculate least cost paths, considering the presence or absence of plantation forestry and highways to examine connectivity. Then, we applied two habitat availability indices (integral index of connectivity and probability of connectivity) attending to different dispersal distances. Our analyses show a great potential for improving connectivity using plantation forests in the natural forest network, and a dramatic impact of the highway in the north-south connectivity of the study area. Based on these results, we identified those patches of plantation forest and natural forest that are more important for the maintenance of overall landscape connectivity, and propose their protection or conversion through reforestation. The final proposed network constitutes a larger and better connected natural forested landscape than the existing one. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although invasive plants are recognized as a major ecological problem, little is known of the relative importance of plant community characteristics versus landscape context in determining invasibility of communities. We determined the relative importance of community and landscape features of 30 woodlots in influencing the invasion of Lonicera maackii. We sampled woodlots using the point-quarter method and calculated canopy openness and basal areas and densities of shrub, sapling and tree species, as well as woody species richness. We used aerial photos and ArcView GIS to calculate landscape parameters from the same woodlots using a buffer distance of 1500 m. We used logistic and linear regression analyses to determine the community and landscape factors that best explain L. maackii presence and density. We also tested whether woodlot invasion by L. maackii begins at woodlot edges.
   Presence of L. maackii was significantly explained only by distance from the nearest town (logistic regression, p=0.017); woodlots nearer town were more likely to be invaded. Among invaded woodlots, density of L. maackii was positively related to the amount of edge in the landscape (partial R-2=0.592) and negatively related to total tree basal area (partial R-2=0.134), number of native woody species (partial R-2=0.054), and sapling shade tolerance index (partial R-2=0.054). Lonicera maackii in woodlot interiors were not younger than those on the perimeters, leading us to reject the edge-first colonization model of invasion.
   Our findings reveal that landscape structure is of primary importance and community features of secondary importance in the invasion of L. maackii. This shrub is invading from multiple foci (towns) rather than an advancing front. Connectivity in the landscape (i.e. the number of corridors) did not promote invasion. However, edge habitat was important for invasion, probably due to increased propagule pressure. The community features associated with L. maackii invasion may be indicators of past disturbance.

AB  - Urban greening offers a series of services including the improvement of air quality, water cycle, through several functions (e.g., absorption of air pollutants, increasing water catchment operated by soil). There is increasing attention to quantify urban green areas and the related benefits to the extent that the Italian National Statistics Institute (ISTAT) scores the "green value" of the main cities. There are still uncertainties on the classification of the green areas and their potential to provide services that collectively improve the urban life quality. This study analysed the green areas of the urban environment of Matera city, focussing on their category (private gardens, school gardens, green streets and urban parks) and size and their potential to serve as CO2 sink. The analyses were carried out on four representative areas and the size of the various categories was assessed through cadastral and other municipal data. The urbanization process had influences on urban ecosystems including plant biodiversity, increasing the abundance of plant alien species. Knowledge on the spread of alien plant species might help to prevent the biodiversity loss. Therefore, a qualitative survey of the existing alien plant species in the urban environment was performed. Preliminary results show that the urban green area calculated in this study is 90 ha. In addition, private gardens share a higher surface of urban green areas, reflecting a good greening aptitude of citizens. Considering that the green areas within built environment is most beneficial for human well-being, a possible scenario related to the carbon (C) sequestration by these areas in Matera city will be presented. A potential green corridor connecting some existing spot green areas to promote social aspects and improve well-being of citizens and environmental sustainability will also be discussed. This study might be supportive for urban planners and local policy makers, contributing to drive future decisions towards a greener built environment of Matera city.

AB  - Urbanisation is an important driver of biodiversity loss, also contributing to habitat loss and fragmentation of grasslands at the urban-rural interface. While urban green spaces are known to include many grassland habitats, it is uncertain to what extent urban land use types harbour grasslands of special conservation interest and whether patch characteristics and connectivity of these differ from grasslands on agricultural land. By relating the city-wide biotope mapping to the land use mapping of Berlin, Germany, we assessed (1) to which specific urban land use types the major grassland biotope types belong, (2) differences in patch characteristics and connectivity, and (3) the conservation value of grassland patches at a typological level by means of their legal protection status. Grasslands cover 5% of Berlin's surface, and 43% of that area is assigned to legally protected grassland types. The majority of legally protected grassland (71%) lies on urban land opposed to 29% on agricultural land. Airports and historic parks, which only cover 2% of land in Berlin, contain one-third of all protected dry grasslands. Wet grassland is more confined to agricultural land. In airports and agricultural areas, grassland patches are larger but of a more complex shape than those in historic parks. In airports, grassland patches show greater connectivity as they are situated in grassland-dominated surroundings. Grassland in historic parks appears to be more vulnerable due to smaller patch sizes and higher fragmentation. The example of Berlin demonstrates that the urban green infrastructure can clearly contribute to grassland conservation and may thus partially compensate for the decline of traditional grasslands in cultural landscapes. It will be important to involve residents and landowners in urban grassland conservation and management because most grassland of special conservation interest (57%) was found outside of conservation areas.

AB  - Maintaining biodiversity in urban landscapes requires a well-functioning green infrastructure for the landscape to remain ecologically functional. However, city planners often lack knowledge to identify how well different parts of the green infrastructure are connected, and tools to estimate the accessibility to important habitats for different species in urban areas are strongly needed. We compared the ability of three measures of available food resources, with increasing complexity, for explaining species richness and abundance of bees and wasps at 23 locations in an urban landscape in Sweden. Specifically, we tested (1) the summed amount of food habitat within a buffer circle, (2) the amount of food habitat weighted by distance, and (3) the summed amount of food habitat within an area created by cost-weighted distance based on the surrounding landscape friction. We tested two spatial scales (200 and 400 m). The results show that both the summed (1) and the weighted measures (2) were very poor in explaining species richness and abundance regardless of spatial scale, while we found significant relationships for both species richness and abundance with the friction-based measure (3) at both scales. For the friction-based measure, the relationships with both response variables were strongest at the smallest spatial scale (200 m). We conclude that bees and wasps are sensitive to barriers such as large roads and built-up areas when foraging in urban environments. This is important to consider when assessing the functionality of urban green infrastructure in order to not overestimate the available amount of habitat and how well different parts of the landscape are connected for these important pollinators.

AB  - The organization of ecological assemblages has important implications for ecosystem functioning, but little is known about how scavenger communities organize at the global scale. Here, we test four hypotheses on the factors affecting the network structure of terrestrial vertebrate scavenger assemblages and its implications on ecosystem functioning. We expect scavenger assemblages to be more nested (i.e. structured): 1) in species-rich and productive regions, as nestedness has been linked to high competition for carrion resources, and 2) regions with low human impact, because the most efficient carrion consumers that promote nestedness are large vertebrate scavengers, which are especially sensitive to human persecution. 3) We also expect climatic conditions to affect assemblage structure, because some scavenger assemblages have been shown to be more nested in colder months. Finally, 4) we expect more organized assemblages to be more efficient in the consumption of the resource. We first analyzed the relationship between the nestedness of the scavenger assemblages and climatic variables (i.e. temperature, precipitation, temperature variability and precipitation variability), ecosystem productivity and biomass (i.e. NDVI) and degree of human impact (i.e. human footprint) using 53 study sites in 22 countries across five continents. Then, we related structure (i.e. nestedness) with its function (i.e. carrion consumption rate). We found a more nested structure for scavenger assemblages in regions with higher NDVI values and lower human footprint. Moreover, more organized assemblages were more efficient in the consumption of carrion. However, our results did not support the prediction that the structure of the scavenger assemblages is directly related to climate. Our findings suggest that the nested structure of vertebrate scavenger assemblages affects its functionality and is driven by anthropogenic disturbance and ecosystem productivity worldwide. Disarray of scavenger assemblage structure by anthropogenic disturbance may lead to decreases in functionality of the terrestrial ecosystems via loss of key species and trophic facilitation processes.

AB  - Questions Extensive green roofs (EGRs) are novel ecosystems and essential tools in mitigating the negative effects of urbanization. However, the extent to which traditional community assembly insights apply to spontaneous plant and trait diversity and composition on EGRs and novel ecosystems in general is unclear: (a) is a dispersal filter present because of EGRs' fragmented nature (e.g., roof height, urban environment); (b) can we confirm the strong abiotic filtering due to extreme EGR conditions (e.g., limited substrate depth); and (c) does the presence of the planted vegetation lead to biotic filtering? Location The Flanders and Brussels region of Belgium. Methods The vegetation of 129 EGRs was sampled during a field campaign. Information on local (e.g., substrate, roof height) and regional characteristics (e.g., connectivity indices) were collected and species traits were collected from multiple databases. All data were used to construct (generalized) linear mixed models that tested the effects of the dispersal-, local abiotic- and local biotic filters on plant community formation. Redundancy analysis was used to investigate predictor effects on functional composition and null models were constructed to assess trait divergence/convergence. Results Our results show that the spontaneous plant species diversity is not affected by their landscape context (dispersal filtering), while their functional composition is. Additionally, the importance of abiotic filtering is confirmed, as substrate depth and exposure have a strong impact on species diversity and decreasing substrate depth negatively impacts functional diversity. Finally, we show that biotic filtering by increased planted species cover leads to trait divergence, changes in functional composition and reduced cover of spontaneous species. Conclusions We find that a broad perspective that includes the regional and local biotic and abiotic environment is needed to assess all factors that influence the vegetation on EGRs. As biotic interactions are present, EGRs should not be considered as static systems.

AB  - While cities are known as important habitats for wild bees, a conceptual understanding of how assemblages of wild bee species are shaped by urban environments is limited. We applied a functional approach to test how taxonomic and functional diversity within wild bee communities of urban grasslands, and traits of bee species, related to local habitat features (e.g., management, species richness, flower coverage) and characteristics of the surrounding urban matrix (e.g., urbanisation, isolation). Surprisingly, urbanisation was not related to any diversity measure. Yet, taxonomic and functional diversity in bee communities, and proportion of endangered bee species, responded negatively to the isolation of grasslands within the urban matrix-but positively to flower coverage. Urbanisation, previous restoration efforts and site type filtered the functional composition of bee communities in terms of species traits related to diet and nesting. Results substantiate the role of urban habitats for functionally diverse bee communities, including Red-Listed species, and indicate pathways towards enhancing habitat functions of urban grasslands for wild bees by (i) improving the connectivity of urban grassland patches within the urban matrix, and (ii) more locally by adjusting management to maintain flower coverage in grasslands. These approaches can support efforts to develop pollinator-friendly greenspaces within the urban green infrastructure.

AB  - Land-use change and climate change are recognized as two main drivers of the current biodiversity decline. Protected areas help safeguard the landscape from additional anthropogenic disturbances and, when properly designed, can help species cope with climate change impacts. When designed to protect the regional biodiversity rather than to conserve focal species or landscape elements, protected areas need to cover a representative sample of the regional biodiversity and be functionally connected, facilitating individual movements among protected areas in a network to maximize their effectiveness. We developed a methodology to define effective protected areas to implement in a regional network using ecological representativeness and functional connectivity as criteria. We illustrated this methodology in the Gaspesie region of Quebec, Canada. We simulated movements for the endangered Atlantic-Gaspesie caribou population (Rangifer tarandus caribou), using an individual-based model, to determine functional connectivity based on this large mammal. We created multiple protected areas network scenarios and evaluated their ecological representativeness and functional connectivity for the current and future conditions. We selected a subset of the most effective network scenarios and extracted the protected areas included in them. There was a tradeoff between ecological representativeness and functional connectivity for the created networks. Only a few protected areas among those available were repeatedly chosen in the most effective networks. Protected areas maximizing both ecological representativeness and functional connectivity represented suitable areas to implement in an effective protected areas network. These areas ensured that a representative sample of the regional biodiversity was covered by the network, as well as maximizing the movement over time between and inside the protected areas for the focal population.

AB  - Conversion of lands to agriculture and development within remaining natural habitats have fragmented ecosystems and reduced wildlife populations. The US Fish and Wildlife Service has adopted an incentive-based conservation strategy known as the Safe Harbor Program (SHP) to reduce the vulnerability of federally protected species located on private properties. In addition to protecting populations, the SHP also strives to enhance species viability by devising strategies to (re)connect populations among habitat patches. We empirically evaluated the effectiveness of the initial Safe Harbor agreement, developed for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis, hereafter RCW) in the North Carolina Sandhills, in enhancing connectivity for that species. According to our results, breeding territories located on private properties enrolled in the SHP promoted dispersal of RCWs and enhanced overall population connectivity relative to otherwise similar territories located on non-SHP properties. Moreover, the SHP created extensive stepping-stone corridors throughout the region. Our analysis also showed that RCW connectivity will be negatively impacted directly and indirectly by encroaching urban growth. By combining an urban growth model with estimated connectivity, managers and conservation planners can identify which properties critical for connectivity are most threatened by urban encroachment. These results can help conservation planners develop strategic actions on private land based on the species specific movement ability, current landscapes and projected urban growth.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) are an area-based conservation strategy commonly used to safeguard marine biodiversity and ecosystem services. Ecological connectivity governs the exchange of individuals among spatially fragmented habitats and is often highlighted as an important element in the design of MPAs. However, the degree to which measured or modelled representations of connectivity are applied to marine management decisions worldwide remains unclear. We reviewed the scientific and management literature to explore the application of connectivity in MPAs located in six countries or regions with advanced marine spatial planning. Only 11% of the 746 MPAs we examined considered connectivity as an ecological criterion, increasingly so since 2007. Landscape measures such as habitat linkages were used most frequently by managers and genetic and modelling approaches by scientists. Of the MPAs that considered connectivity, 71% were for state marine conservation areas or reserves in California and commonwealth marine reserves in Australia. This pattern indicates substantial geographic bias. We propose that the incorporation of connectivity in conservation planning needs to become more accessible to practitioners and provide four recommendations that together will allow scientists and managers to bridge this gap: 1. determine whether to prioritize connectivity as an ecological criterion, 2. identify the role of an MPA in supporting connectivity, 3. identify the appropriate spatial and temporal scale of connectivity, and 4. improve regional knowledge of connectivity patterns. We also propose a framework to facilitate the communication of metrics and patterns of connectivity between scientists and practitioners to apply the best available information in the design and adaptive management of MPAs and networks of MPAs.
